Oncogene (2015) 34, 4808-4820; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.404; published online 22 December 2014  INTRODUCTION Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent carcinomas throughout the world, with an estimated one million new cases and half a million mortalities each year.1,2 Metastasis, one of the six initial cancer hallmarks,3 is a major cause of CRC-associated mortality.4 More than one-third of patients with CRC will ultimately develop metastatic disease;5 however, little is known about the exact molecular mechanisms underlying CRC metastasis.6 Under- standing the key factors in these processes is crucial to the development of novel anticancer therapies. In most types of cell, the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ is a  critical regulator that mediates various cellular processes.7 In non- excitable cells, the store-operated calcium influx (SOCE) is the major mechanism of Ca2+ entry.8,9 Recent studies have identified two important molecules responsible for SOCE activation: STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai1.8 When Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum is depleted, STIM1 serves as a Ca2+ sensor and aggregates into multiple punctae that translocate within close proximity of the plasma membranes.10 Orai1, an essential pore- forming component of the SOCE channel, translocates to these STIM1-containing structures during store depletion and open stomediate Ca2+ entry.11-13 Recently, STIM1 has been reported to have an important role in various pathophysiological conditions, such as the immune response,11,14 cardiovascular disease,15,16  sexual dysfunction17 and pulmonary disease.18 STIM1 was also found to be involved in cancer and was initially thought to work as a tumor suppressor,19 although subsequent data indicate an  opposite function.20 More recently, Orai1 and STIM1 were shown to be essential for the migration of breast tumor cells.21 Another study found that STIM1 has an important role in the growth, migration and angiogenesis of cervical cancer.22 These studies suggest that STIM1 might have a critical role in cancer. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a morphogenetic  process in which cells lose their epithelial characteristics such as cell polarity and cell-cell contact, and gain mesenchymal proper- ties such as increased motility. EMT also endows cells with invasive properties, induces stem cell properties and prevents apoptosis and senescence. Morphologic evidence of EMT has been found at the invasive front of human tumors.23 EMT is viewed as an essential early step and a critical process during tumor metastasis.24-27 Notably, several recent studies suggest that EMT initiated by Oct4 or Snail1 in breast cancer may be associated with STIM1-directed Ca2 influx.21,23,28-30 These studies strongly suggest that STIM1 may promote cancer metastasis by regulating EMT. MicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that posttran-  scriptionally regulate protein expression.31 Several studies have shown that miRNAs have an important role in cancer metastasis.32  Recently, some studies have highlighted the importance of miRNAs in the regulation of EMT.33,34 As both miRNAs and STIM1 may have important roles in EMT process, we are interested in whether STIM1 expression is regulated by certain miRNAs in cancer. Notably, a recent study has found that miR-195 directly regulates STIM1 mRNA decay in normal rat intestinal crypt cells.35  However,whether posttranscriptional regulation by certain  State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.

RESULTS STIM1 promotes migratory and invasive capacities of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo To assess whether STIM1 expression correlates with the metastatic potential of CRC cells, we examined the expression of STIM1 in  four human CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT29 and LOVO) and in a normal human intestinal epithelial cell line. Basal expression levels of STIM1 were significantly increased in SW620 and LOVO cells, which have highly metastatic propensities, compared with either the poorly metastatic cell lines SW480 and HT29 or the immortalized cell line human intestinal epithelial cell line (Figures 1a1 and a2). The SW480 cell line was obtained from a primary CRC lesion, and the SW620 cell line was established from a lymph node (LN) metastasis in the same patient a year later.36  Figure 2. STIM1 promoted CRC cells invasion and metastasis in vivo. SW480 cells transfected with the LV-STIM1 expression vector (two clones, c1 and c2) or the control vector and SW620 cells transfected with LV-STIM1si-1, LV-STIM1si-2 or a negative control were injected into nude mice via the tail vein for an in vivo metastasis assay.

SW480 cells were infected with recombinant lentivirus expressing STIM1 (LV-STIM1) or a control lentivirus (LV-NC) and stable clones were established (SW480-STIM1c1, SW480-STIM1c2 and SW480-NC, respectively; Figure 1b). Upregulation and knockdown of STIM1 expression was confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 1b). Transwell assays showed that downregulation of STIM1 expression in SW620 cells markedly decreased cell migration and invasion (Figures 1c1 and c2). Conversely, upregulation of STIM1 expression in SW480 cells significantly enhanced cell migration and invasion (Figures 1d1 and d2). MTT (3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay was performed to exclude the contribution of cell proliferation (Supplementary Figures S1A  and B).These results suggest that STIM1 promotes metastasis in CRC cells. To further explore the role of STIM1, we injected SW480-  STIM1c1, SW480-STIM1c2, SW620-STIM1si1 or SW620-STIM1si2 cells into nude mice through the lateral tail vein. Histologic analyses (Figures 2c1 and c2) confirmed that the incidence of lung and liver metastases was markedly increased in mice injected with SW480-STIM1c1 or SW480-STIM1c2 cells and markedly decreased in mice injected with SW620-STIM1si1 or SW620-STIM1si2 cells, compared with the control group. The number of metastatic lung and liver nodules was significantly increased in the SW480- STIM1c1 and SW480-STIM1c2 groups and significantly decreased in the SW620-STIM1si1 and SW620-STIM1si2 groups, compared with the control group (Figures 2a, b1 and b2).  200- 400-  100\u00b5m  100\u00b5m  100\u00b5m  20 18 16 14 12 10  8 6 4 2 0  14  12  10  8  6  4  2  0  Upregulation of STIM1 in CRC tissues  STIM1 staining  Tumor (90)  Positive  Nagetive  63  27 71  19 P<0.001  Adjacentnontumor (90) P value  S ta  in in  g  s  c o  re  o  f  im  m u  n o  s ta  in in  g  R e la  ti v e  m  R N  A  e  x p  re s s io  n  R e la  ti v e  a  b o  u n  d a n  c e  i n  tu m  o rs  #  *  *  8  6  4  2  0 Noncancerous  region of CRC  Adjacent nontumor  LN positive  STIM1  STIM1 negative STIM1 positive  P e rc  e n t  su  rv iv  a l  100  80  60  40  20  0  Month after operation(m)  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 LN negative  CRC  Non-m etastatic  CRC  M etastatic  CRC  Figure 4.

STIM1 in the progression and metastasis of CRC Z Zhang et al  4812  Oncogene (2015) 4808 - 4820   2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited    STIM1 regulates EMT in CRC cells The EMT has a crucial role in cancer metastasis. During the EMT process, differentiated polarized epithelial cells undergo profound morphogenetic changes, typified by the dissolution of cell-cell junctions and loss of apicobasolateral polarity, resulting in the formation of migratory mesenchymal cells with invasive proper- ties. Moreover, during this process the expression of epithelial markers (such as E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin) is downregulated, whereas the expression of mesenchymal markers (such as vimentin and fibronectin) is upregulated.38,39  By comparing the morphology of the cell models described above under a light microscope, we observed that ectopic expression of STIM1 in SW480 cells induced the conversion of polarized epithelial cells to spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells with the loss of cell-cell adhesion, whereas knockdown of STIM1 in SW620 cells resulted in a tighter organization of cells in colonies and an epithelioid morphology (Figure 3a). Next, we assessed the expression of EMT markers in these cell  models. Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription- PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed a marked decrease in the expression of vimentin and fibronectin and a significant increase in the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin in SW620-STIM1si1 and SW620-STIM1si1 cells, compared with control cells. Conver- sely, a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and an increase in the expression of vimentin and fibronectin were observed in SW480-STIM1c1 and SW480-STIM1c1 cells, compared with control cells (Figures 3b and c). These changes in E-cadherin and vimentin expression were confirmed by an immunofluores- cent assay (Figure 3d). These results suggest that STIM1 is critical for the acquisition of EMT characteristics and may contribute to the EMT-derived invasive phenotype in CRC cells.  STIM1 is significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues and indicates poor prognosis To explore the potential role of STIM1 in determining the clinical outcome of CRC, we assessed STIM1 expression in a tissue  microarray of 90 CRC patients. The results of immunohistochem- ical staining showed that STIM1 was localized to both the cytoplasm and membranes. Positive STIM1 expression was detected in 63 of 90 (71.1%) primary CRC samples compared with only 19 of 90 (21.1%) adjacent non-tumor tissues. These results were confirmed by scoring the staining intensity across the section (Figures 4A1-3). These findings indicated that STIM1 was significantly overexpressed in human CRC tissues. To investigate the correlation between STIM1 overexpression and CRC metastasis, we compared STIM1 expression in 10 pairs of LN metastasis-positive (LN-positive group) and LN metastasis- negative (LN-negative group) primary CRC specimens. Real-time PCR analysis showed that STIM1 mRNA levels were much higher in the LN-positive group than in the LN-negative group (Figure 4C). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with positive STIM1 expression had shorter overall survival than those who were negative for STIM1 expression (Figure 4D). To investigate whether STIM1 expression is associated with the progression of CRC, we investigated the expression of STIM1 in an additional 40 fresh CRC tissues by qRT-PCR (Figure 4B) and compared the results with the clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients. The results showed that overexpression of STIM1 did not correlate with age, gender or tumor size (P40.05), but was significantly associated with TNM stage and LN status (Po0.01; Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the expression level of STIM1 positively correlated with the progression of CRC and that STIM1 overexpression is indicative of poor prognoses of human CRC patients following curative resection.  The expression of miR-185 inversely correlates with the expression of STIM1 in CRC cells and is associated with the progression of CRC The above results indicated that STIM1 overexpression might have a critical role in CRC. However, there have been few studies on the regulation of STIM1 expression in cancer. miRNAs were recently found to have an important role in tumor progression through their function as posttranscriptional regulators. We hypothesized that posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs may represent one of the upstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression. To test this idea, we used several web-based target analysis tools (TargetScan, miRanda, RNAhybrid, pictar and DIANAmT) to identify miRNAs that potentially target STIM1. As a result, miR-185 was identified as a potential regulator of STIM1 expression (Figure 5a). This was consistent with the results of our previous miRNA microarray analysis, which identified miR-185 as the most significantly downregulated miRNA in SW620 cells compared with SW480 cells.36 Therefore, miR-185 was selected for further study. We examined endogenous miR-185 expression levels in four  human CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT29 and LOVO) and in a normal human intestinal epithelial cell line by qRT-PCR. The expression levels of miR-185 were significantly decreased in SW620 and LOVO cell lines (highly metastatic cells) compared with either poorly metastatic or immortalized cells. miR-185 expression negatively correlated with the metastatic potential of the CRC cells (Figure 5b1). Furthermore, the expression of miR-185 and STIM1 was inversely correlated (Figure 5b2). To investigate the correla- tion of miR-185 with STIM1 expression levels in CRC tissues, we used qRT-PCR to measure the expression levels of miR-185 in the 40 CRC tissues previously described. Our results confirmed that the mRNA level of miR-185 negatively correlated with STIM1 expression (Figure 5c2). The correlation of miR-185 expression with clinicopathologic factors was also examined. In contrast to STIM1 expression, low expression levels of miR-185 were significantly associated with advanced clinical tumor node metastasis stage and LN metastasis (Po0.001). miR-185 expres- sion levels in CRC patients did not correlate with age, gender, tumor size or cell differentiation (P40.05) (Table 2).

STIM1 in the progression and metastasis of CRC Z Zhang et al  4813    2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene (2015) 4808 - 4820    strongly suggest that miR-185 is one of the upstream molecules regulating STIM1 expression in cancer.  miR-185 represses invasion and regulates EMT in CRC cells To investigate the role that miR-185 has in the migration and invasion of CRC cells, the SW620 cell line was transiently transfected with miR-185 mimics. Successful upregulation of miR-185 expression was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure 6a1). Increased miR-185 expression resulted in significant inhibition of migration and invasion in SW620 cells (Figures 6a2 and a3). To determine whether the loss of miR-185 promotes the migration or invasion of CRC cells, miR-185 was silenced in SW480 cells with an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor (Figure 6b1). This inhibition of  miR-185 significantly promoted cell migration and invasion (Figures 6b2 and b3). These results indicate that miR-185 represses the invasive potential of CRC cells. As STIM1 has been shown to promote EMT in CRC cells and miR-185 has been predicted as a potential regulator of STIM1, we hypothesized that miR-185 may exert an opposite effect on the regulation of EMT in CRC cells. To test this, we compared the morphology of our cell models under a light microscope, and found that upregulating the expression of miR-185 in SW620 cells induced a tighter organization of cells in colonies, whereas downregulating the expression of miR-185 in SW480 cells led to a more fibroblast-like mesenchymal cell morphology (Figure 3c). Western blot and qRT-PCR analyses showed that upregulation of miR-185 in SW620 cells increased the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and decreased the  3 '   agucCUUGACGGAAAGAGAGGu   5 '    hsa-miR-185  STIM1  1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0.0  0 20 40 60 80 10 0  12 0  14 0  16 0  18 0  miR-185  200 150 100 50  2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5  8  6  4  2  0  2  1 3 5 7  2.5  2.0  1.5  1.0  0.0  0.5  1 2 4 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 1 8 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 2 8 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 3 8 39 4083  HI EC  R e  la ti  v e   e x  p re  s s  io n   l e  v e  l R  e la  ti v e  e  x p  re s s io  n  l  e v e l  R e la  ti v e  e  x p  re s s io  n  o  f m  iR -1  8 5  R e la  ti v e  e  x p  re s s io  n  o  f m  iR -1  8 5  HI 29  SW 48  0  SW 62  0  LO VO  Relative expression of STIM1  miR-185 Adjacent nontumor STIM1 CRC STIM1 Adjacent nontumor miR-185 CRC  n=5  R= -0.9390 P=0.0179  Y = -0.004814X + 0.0.8607  n=40  R= -0.6144 P<0.0001  Relative expression of STIM1  Y = -0.1558X + 0.9583  38 : 5 '   cccuGGGUGUUCUGUCUCUCCu   3 '    STIM1 I I I I I I I I I I: : : :  Figure 5.

Moreover, inhibition of miR-185 in SW480 cells decreased the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and increased the expression of vimentin and fibronectin (Figures 6c and d2). Interestingly, these effects of miR-185 on EMT were similar to the effects of STIM1 siRNAs in CRC cells.  STIM1 is a direct functional target of miR-185 in CRC metastasis As mentioned above, an inverse correlation between miR-185 and STIM1 expression was identified in both CRC cells and tissues. To obtain additional direct evidence that STIM1 expression is regulated by miR-185, we analyzed the binding site of miR-185 in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of STIM1 and performed a luciferase reporter assay. An STIM1 3\u2032-UTR reporter (Luc-STIM1) or the corresponding mutant reporter (Luc-STIM1-mu) was co- transfected with miR-185 mimics or mimic controls into SW620 cells. As expected, the luciferase activities of the reporter constructs were reduced significantly only when miR-185 mimics were co-transfected with Luc-STIM1 in SW620 cells. No apparent change in luciferase activities was observed in cells transfected with Luc-STIM1-mu or mimic controls (Figure 7a). To confirm whether targeting of the STIM1 3\u2032-UTR by miR-185 was functional, SW620 cells transfected with miR-185 mimics and SW480 cells transfected with the miR-185 inhibitor were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. Both mRNA (Figure 7b1) and protein (Figure 7b2) levels of STIM1 were markedly upregulated in SW480 cells transfected with the miR-185 inhibitor, whereas both mRNA (Figure 7c1) and protein (Figure 7c2) levels of STIM1 were effectively downregulated in SW620 cells transfected with the miR-185 mimic. Further experiments confirmed that the altered miR-185 expression does not affect the expression of STIM2, Orai1, Orai2 and Orai3, which may also be involved in SOCE (Supplementary Figures S2A and B). These results suggest that  STIM1 is a direct functional target of miR-185. To further corroborate this hypothesis, we performed a \u2018rescue' experiment by co-transfecting SW620 cells with miR-185 mimics and a pcDNA3.1 vector carrying an STIM1 expression cassette (pcDNA3.1-STIM1) or mutated seed sequences of miR-185 at the STIM1 3\u2032-UTR (STIM1-mu). Western blot analysis demonstrated that co-transfection of SW620 cells with the miR-185 mimic and STIM1-mu restored STIM1 protein expression, whereas co- transfection with pcDNA3.1-STIM1 failed to recover the STIM1 expression that was silenced by the miR-185 mimic. Furthermore, restoration of STIM1 expression by the introduction of STIM1-mu into SW620 cells transfected with the miR-185 mimics inhibited the expression of E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin and increased the expression of vimentin and fibronectin (Figure 7d). In addition, rescuing STIM1 expression in the presence of the miR-185 mimics enhanced the invasion and migration potential of SW620 cells (Figure 7e). Moreover, to determine the effect of the miR-185- STIM1 axis on SOCE, we examined cellular Ca2+ distribution by Ca2+ imaging in both SW620 and SW480 cells. After ER Ca2+  depletion, Ca2+ influx through SOCE into SW620 cells was increased compared with SW480 cells (Supplementary Figures S3A and B). We then examined the effect of overexpression of miR-185 and found that SOCE was impaired in SW620-miR-185 mimic cells (Supplementary Figures S3C and D), whereas inhibition of miR-185 in SW480 cells moderately increased SOCE (Supplementary Figures S3E and F). Taken together, these results suggest that STIM1 is a potential functional target of miR-185. In summary, our results suggest that STIM1 is a direct functional  target of miR-185 and that this novel miR-185/STIM1 axis has an important role in the regulation of CRC metastasis.  DISCUSSION In this study, we demonstrate that STIM1 promotes CRC metastasis. The upregulation of STIM1 in CRC is at least partly attributed to posttranscriptional regulation by miR-185, a novel EMT-regulating miRNA. Additionally, we provide evidence sup- porting the involvement of STIM1 in the regulation of EMT in cancer. The influx of Ca2+ is essential for the migration of tumor  cells.40,41 STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, regulates Ca2+ influx by activating SOCE.11,12 STIM1 has recently been proposed to be a critical molecule in the regulation of cancer metastasis,21,22 although the exact role of STIM1 in metastasis remains controversial. STIM1 was initially implicated as an antimetastasis molecule.19 However, we found that STIM1 promoted migration and invasive properties in CRC, and that increased expression of STIM1 in CRC was significantly associated with cancer metastasis. In accordance with our study, STIM1 was reported to be one of the molecules essential for breast tumor cell migration in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo.21 Similarly, another study demonstrated that the level of STIM1 was significantly associated with the risk of metastasis in cervical cancer. Moreover, epidermal growth factor-stimulated migration in cervical cancer cells requires STIM1 expression.22 Our results provide new evidence supporting the involvement of STIM1 in the promotion of cancer metastasis. It has been reported that expression of constitutively active Ras  overcomes the migration-inhibitory function of the Ca2+ influx inhibitor and STIM1 siRNA in breast cancer.21 Interestingly, a previous study has shown that activation of the Ras signaling pathway leads to activation of the transcriptional regulator, Snail1,28 which appears to have a major role in EMT.23,29 These studies strongly suggest that STIM1 might promote cancer metastasis by regulating the EMT. In this study, we demonstrated that knockdown of STIM1 induced the conversion of spindle- shaped, fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells to polarized epithelial  Table 2.

These findings provided new evidence supporting the involve- ment of STIM1 in driving metastasis through the regulation of EMT in cancer cells. We further examined the clinical relevance of STIM1 and found  that STIM1 was markedly upregulated in CRC tissues. Moreover, increased levels of STIM1 correlated with a high metastatic potential of CRC cells. In accordance with our findings, a previous study also showed that STIM1 was significantly associated with the risk of metastasis in cervical cancer.22 Based on these findings, elucidating the mechanism of STIM1 upregulation may contribute to the identification of new cancer therapy targets. A recent study demonstrated that the expression of STIM1 is regulated by Wilms tumor suppressor 1 and early growth response 1 in six specific cancer subtypes.42 Another study reported that STIM1 is regulated by androgens in prostate stromal cells. However, these observa- tions are not sufficient to explain the mechanism behind the upregulation of STIM1 in cancer. A recent study found that another STIM protein, STIM2, inversely control melanoma growth and invasion,43 suggesting that STIM proteins, including STIM1 and STIM2, have critical roles in cancer. Interestingly, these STIM proteins may exert different and even opposite functions in different kinds of cancers, which imply complex and important roles in cancer. Further study on STIM family may provide new targets for cancer therapy. miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of tumor  metastasis32 and recent studies have highlighted the importance of miRNAs in the regulation of the EMT.33,34 To explore whether posttranscriptional regulation by certain miRNAs is one of the upstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression, we used several target prediction algorithms to assay for miRNA binding sites in the STIM1 3\u2032-UTR. miRNA-185 was identified by several algorithms. Surprisingly, our previous miRNA microarray analysis revealed that miR-185 was the most significantly downregulated miRNA in SW620 cells (highly metastatic) compared with SW480 cells (poorly metastatic).36 In this study, we found that miR-185 expression inversely correlated with the expression of STIM1 in both CRC cells and tissues, and that transfection with miR-185 significantly downregulated the expression of STIM1. These results were further confirmed by luciferase activity assays. miR-185 was recently found to be an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer44 and hepatocellular carcinoma.45 Moreover, miR-185 can induce cell cycle arrest and repress cell proliferation in non-small- cell lung cancer,46 colorectal cancer,47 glioma,48 gastric cancer49  and breast cancer.50 miR-185 has also been reported to be involved in metastasis in colorectal cancer51 and glioma.48  However, the role of miR-185 in the pathophysiological functions of STIM1 has not previously been reported. The results presented here show that upregulating the  expression of miR-185 inhibited migration and invasion and reversed the EMT in CRC cells. Our data further indicate that STIM1 is a functional target of miR-185 in CRC. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the mechanism of the regulation of STIM1 expression at the posttranscriptional level,  although further studies are required to fully understand the mechanism by which the miR-185-STIM1 pathway regulates EMT in cancer. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a critical function of  STIM1 in promoting CRC metastasis. This study also reveals a new regulatory mechanism of STIM1 expression by miR-185, an miRNA not previously associated with the EMT process. We believe that the miR-185-STIM1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention against cancer metastasis.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture The human CRC cell lines were preserved in our institute and were routinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 100 U/ml penicillin sodium and 100mg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified air atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. Throughout the experiment, cells were used in the logarithmic phase of growth according to the supplier's instructions.  Clinical samples Samples from 40 CRC patients (23 males and 17 females) who had undergone proctocolectomy with LN dissection for CRC at Xijing Hospital (Xi'an, China) between November 2008 and April 2009 were included in the study (Supplementary Table S2). None of the patients received preoperative chemotherapy. The resected specimens were histologically examined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The primary tumor samples and corresponding non-tumor mucosa were collected from each patient immediately after the surgical process and were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen until further use. Total RNA from the frozen tissues was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Oligonucleotide construction, lentivirus production and construct design An miR-185 mimic, an inhibitor and a negative control oligonucleotides were purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). Transfection of oligonucleotides was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. On the basis of the STIM1 sequence, three short hairpin RNAs were designed using the siRNA Target Finder (InvivoGene, San Diego, CA, USA): 5\u2032-GGGAAGACCTCAATTACCA-3\u2032, 5\u2032-TCTCCACATTTGGATTCTT-5\u2032 and 5\u2032-TGGATGATGTAGATCATAA-3\u2032. Lenti- viral vectors encoding short haipin RNAs were generated using GV248 vector (GeneChem Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). Stable transfectants overexpressing STIM1 were generated by lentiviral transduction using a GV166 vector (GeneChem Co., Ltd). An empty vector was used as the negative control. STIM1-expressing vector with miR-185 binding sites or mutated seed  sequences of miR-185 at STIM1 3\u2032-UTR (STIM1-mu) was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA) and was subcloned into the eukaryotic expression vector.  Luciferase assay Luc-STIM1 vector. The STIM1 3\u2032-UTR containing the predicted miR-185 binding site was amplified by RT-PCR from the total RNA of cultured SW620 cells and was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
