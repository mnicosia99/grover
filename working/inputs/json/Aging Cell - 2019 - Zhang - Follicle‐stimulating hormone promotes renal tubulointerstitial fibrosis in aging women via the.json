However, the effect of high circulating follicle\u2010stimulating hormone  (FSH) levels on renal dysfunction remains unknown. In this study, blood samples from  3,055 postmenopausal women were collected and tested, which showed that there  was a strong negative correlation between eGFR and FSH levels (p < 0.001), inde\u2010 pendent of LH, testosterone, and estradiol. Functional FSHR was detected in renal  tubular epithelial cells. In vivo, high circulating FSH levels promoted a phenotype of  tubulointerstitial fibrosis, characterized by increases in 24\u2010hr urine protein/creatinine  ratio, serum Cr, serum BUN, and ECM deposition. Similar results obtained from cul\u2010 tured HK\u20102 cells showed that FSH increased the transcriptional and protein expres\u2010 sion of profibrotic mediators (collagen IV, fibronectin, and PAI-1). This promotion of  fibrosis by FSH occurred through the activation of AKT/GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2\u2010catenin pathway,  which could be attenuated by silencing FSHR by siRNA or by LY294002 or MK2206.  In addition, FSH-stimulated HK-2 cells secreted  IL-8, which promoted macrophage  migration to exacerbate tubulointerstitial fibrosis. These results revealed a previously  unknown effect of FSH on kidney injury, which may offer a critical insight into the  development of CKD in aging postmenopausal women.

It is widely re\u2010 ported that endogenous sex hormones, originally considered to act  on the reproductive system, contribute to the development of kid\u2010 ney diseases, but their overall impacts on renal function still remain  controversial. Quite a few studies held the view that female sex hor\u2010 mones were overall protective in terms of renal diseases because  accelerated progression of CKD in males was more frequent than fe\u2010 males (Kang & Miller, 2002; Saran et al., 2015; Silbiger & Neugarten,  1995).  However,  the  sex  differences  in  this  renoprotection  seem  to diminish after menopause, when stratified by age (Nitsch et al.,  2013). Furthermore, hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis dysfunc\u2010 tion ultimately brings about a decline in the estrogen level and was  considered to be the key factor for the increased incidence of CKD,  while estrogen supplementation alone failed to fully reverse renal  dysfunction  (Holley,  2004;  Pietrzak  et  al.,  2006).  Together,  these  findings suggest that some sex hormones may play roles, which have  not yet been investigated, in the pathophysiology of postmeno\u2010 pausal CKD.  A substantial elevation in the serum follicle-stimulating hormone  level, although likely to compensate for estrogen withdrawal, has  been closely involved in the adverse effects of menopause on many  nongonadal tissues, including bone (Sponton & Kajimura, 2017), liver  (Song et al., 2016), adipose tissue (Liu et al., 2015), umbilical vascular  endothelial cell (Siraj et al., 2013), and biliary epithelium (Onori et   al., 2013). Functional follicle\u2010stimulating hormone receptors (FSHRs)  were also reported to exist in these extragonadal tissues to regulate  bone, glucose, and lipid metabolism (Qi et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2006).  In addition, the abundance of FSHR in patients with primary renal  carcinoma was nearly comparable to that in testicular cancer, in  which the surge was different from the physiologically low FSHR ex\u2010 pression in the kidneys (Fagerberg et al., 2014). FSHR can serve as an  effective tumor vasculature marker, whose elevation is strongly re\u2010 lated to angiogenesis in renal metastatic tumors (Siraj, Pichon, Radu,  & Ghinea, 2012). However, to date, epidemiological and experimen\u2010 tal studies exploring the potential association between FSH and  CKD are not available, and no information exists about a functional  contribution of FSH to kidney disease. Thus, the aim of this study  was to investigate the hypothesis that FSH participates in the de\u2010 velopment of renal impairment during the postmenopausal period.  2\u2003 |\u2003RESULTS  2.1\u2003|\u2003FSH is associated with eGFR, decreased eGFR,  and CKD in postmenopausal women  To confirm our hypothesis that FSH participates in the develop\u2010 ment of renal impairment during the postmenopausal period, we  selected 3,055 postmenopausal women from 10,441 participants  based  on  a  cross-sectional  study  called  \u201cSPECT-China\u201d  (Figure   F I G U R E  1 \u2003 FSH is associated with eGFR, decreased eGFR, and CKD in postmenopausal women.

S1) and then analyzed serum renal function indexes and sex hor\u2010 mone levels to explore whether FSH is related to renal function.  The serum FSH level was first divided by quartile, and its quartile  ranges were  \u226447.30,  47.31-61.10,  61.11-78.10,  and  \u226578.11  IU/L  (Table S1). With the increase in the FSH quartiles, eGFR levels de\u2010 creased from 84.1 to 78.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (p for trend <0.001,  Figure 1a). Consistently, the prevalence of decreased eGFR and  CKD gradually increased across FSH quartiles (p for trend <0.001,  Figure 1b,c). After adjusting for age, total testosterone (T), E2, LH,  current smoker status, urban/rural residence, high/low economic  status,  BMI,  dyslipidemia,  diabetes,  and  hypertension,  the  odds  risks (ORs) of decreased eGFR (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 2.17-4.27) and   CKD (OR = 2.76, 95% CI: 1.50-5.06) in the highest quartile of FSH  increased approximately threefold compared with that in the low\u2010 est quartile (p for trend <0.001, Figure 1d,e), respectively. These  clinical associations caused us to further examine the effect of  FSH on renal fibrosis development.  2.2\u2003|\u2003Expression of FSHR in kidney and high FSH  exposure exacerbated renal dysfunction  To understand the roles of FSH in kidney disease, we first examined  the expression of FSHR in kidney samples from normal female mice.

The protein localization of FSHR  was further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, showing  that FSHR was highly abundant in mouse renal tubular epithelium  and HK\u20102 cells (Figure 2b). Thus, we speculated that renal proximal  epithelium cells were likely to be the key candidate sites where FSH  exerted an effect on the kidney. In addition, we attempted to in\u2010 vestigate whether the FSHR is a functional FSHR when exposed to  FSH treatment in vitro, and found that FSHR expression generally  increased in a dose\u2010dependent manner in HK\u20102 cells treated with  FSH (Figure S2). These results suggest that FSHR may mediate FSH\u2010 related kidney changes.  To confirm whether high FSH levels exert impacts on renal  function in mice, we performed ovariectomy surgery to mimic  postmenopausal  hormone  changes  (Figure  S3A).  As  expected,  OVX mice had declined levels of E2 as well as increased levels  of  LH  and  FSH  (Figure  S3C,D),  and  obvious  elevations  in  kidney  weight/body weight, 24\u2010hr urine protein/creatinine, serum cre\u2010 atinine, and serum urea nitrogen (Figure 2c-f), but no significant  changes in body weight (Figure S3B) were observed. Ovariotomy\u2010 induced renal dysfunction was improved by daily administration  of GnRHa, a gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone agonist that can  suppress  pituitary-derived  FSH  and  LH  release.  Additional  FSH  injected into mice was used to explore the singular effect of FSH  on renal dysfunction as shown in Figure 2c-f described, and FSH  supplementation in the absence of LH led to a marked aggravation  in renal dysfunction.  2.3\u2003|\u2003High FSH impaired kidney function through  enhanced tubulointerstitial fibrosis  Given that functional FSHR was highly elevated in renal tubular epi\u2010 thelium, we mainly focused on HK\u20102 cells to further understand how  FSH exacerbated renal dysfunction. In vitro, the transcriptional and  protein expression of several fibrotic genes (collagen IV, fibronec\u2010 tin, and PAI-1) significantly  increased  in a  time- and dose-depend\u2010 ent manner in HK\u20102 cells (Figure 3a-d), while we did not observe an  obvious difference in cell viability (Figure S4), which led us to specu\u2010 late that renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, rather than apoptosis, might  be responsible for FSH\u2010induced renal dysfunction. Renal fibrosis is  characterized by excessive fibrous connective tissues, such as col\u2010 lagen and fibronectin in or around lesions. In vivo, renal Sirius Red  staining  and Masson  staining were  performed which  showed  that  high circulating FSH groups (OVX vs. OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice) have  more interstitial collagen deposition, whose positive areas increased  approximately threefold compared to low circulating FSH group  (OVX + GnRHa mice;  Figure  3e). We  further  validated  the mRNA  and protein expression levels of profibrotic factors by quantitative  RT-PCR and Western blot  and  found  that  collagen  IV,  fibronectin,  and PAI-1 expression levels in the high circulating FSH groups were  notably upregulated compared to those in low circulating FSH group  (Figure 3f-h). These identical alterations were also observed in the  IHC and IF results (Figure 3i).  2.4\u2003|\u2003The AKT/GSK\u20103\u03b2/\u03b2\u2010catenin signaling pathway  was essential for FSHR\u2010mediated interstitial fibrosis  Since high circulating FSH levels were found to cause renal ECM (ex\u2010 tracellular matrix) deposition and interstitial fibrosis, we mainly con\u2010 centrated on the signaling pathways that might be involved in renal  fibrosis reported in recent literature. We first examined the protein  changes of pAKT (Thr308), AKT, pGSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9), and GSK\u20103\u03b2, and  we found that phosphorylation of AKT (Thr308) and GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9)  was increased in OVX and OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice compared with  that in OVX + GnRHa mice (Figure 4a), respectively. No significant  changes in the corresponding total proteins were observed. The re\u2010 sults in HK\u20102 cells treated with FSH were consistent with those in  kidney  samples  (Figure  S5).  Enhanced  phosphorylation  of  GSK-3\u03b2  (Ser9) led to its own inactivation, causing \u03b2-catenin accumulation. As  expected, the protein expression of \u03b2\u2010catenin, a downstream sign\u2010 aling molecule, increased in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of  HK-2  cells  (Figure  S5).  To  further  examine whether  the  activation  of AKT signaling  is  indispensable for FSH-induced ECM accumula\u2010 tion, LY294002 and MK 2206, two common AKT pathway inhibitors,  were added to HK-2 cells. LY294002 or MK 2206 caused a marked  inhibition of phospho-AKT (Thr308), phospho-GSK-3\u03b2 (Ser9) phos\u2010 phorylation, and a reduction of the \u03b2\u2010catenin level (Figure 4b,c).  Moreover, LY294002 or MK 2206 reversed the fibrotic phenotypes  demonstrated by Western blot, which  effectively  decreased FSH- stimulated protein levels of collagen IV and fibronectin in HK\u20102 cells  (Figure 4d,e). This was consistent with a reduced expression of col\u2010 lagen IV, as assessed by immunofluorescence (Figure 4f). These re\u2010 sults indicated that FSH can enhance the downstream AKT signaling  pathway to inactivate GSK\u20103\u03b2, followed by \u03b2\u2010catenin accumulation  and translocation into the nucleus to activate fibrosis\u2010related genes.  Given that FSH exerts its biological effect via binding to FSHR,  we next attempted to silence FSHR function via the specific siRNA  to explore whether FSH\u2010induced fibrogenic action was mediated by  FSHR. Effective ablation of FSHR was obtained with an approxi\u2010 mately twofold decline in the transcriptional and protein expression  in HK\u20102 cells (Figure 4g,h). FSHR knockdown significantly reduced  FSH-stimulated  transcription  and  protein  levels  of  PAI-1  and  fi\u2010 bronectin, suggesting that FSH\u2010mediated renal fibrosis is depen\u2010 dent on  functional FSHR  (Figure 4g,h). We next  tested  the effect  of FSHR on FSH-induced signaling transduction. Western blotting  analyses revealed that FSHR ablation inhibited FSH\u2010stimulated  phosphorylation of AKT and GSK-3\u03b2, as well as \u03b2\u2010catenin accumu\u2010 lation and its nuclear transduction in HK\u20102 cells (Figure 4i). These  results indicated that FSHR is also required for FSH\u2010induced signal\u2010 ing transduction.  2.5\u2003|\u2003Macrophages exacerbated FSH\u2010mediated  interstitial fibrosis  Damaged epithelial cells release a train of chemokines that can  draw macrophages to the sites of injured tissue for inflamma\u2010 tion.

Several toxic factors (ROS and iNOS) and proinflammatory cy\u2010 tokines (TNF\u2010\u03b1  and  IL-1\u03b2) secreted by innate macrophages were  significantly increased in the high circulating FSH group com\u2010 pared  to  the  low  circulating  FSH  group,  as  assessed  by  RT-PCR  (Figure 5b). In vitro, macrophages exposed to FSH stimulation ex\u2010 hibited similar results, and these cytokine changes were also the  markers  of  macrophage  polarization  from M0  to M1,  indicating  that FSH induced macrophages to change to a proinflammatory  phenotype  (Figure 5c,d).  It  is widely believed  that damaged epi\u2010 thelial cell\u2010secreted chemokines draw macrophages to the sites of  injured tissue; then, we performed a transwell assay and found  that macrophage migration was indeed enhanced when cocul\u2010 tured with the FSH\u2010treated HK\u20102 supernatant, and this promotion  was attenuated by FSHR blockage (Figure 5e-g). IL-8, a powerful  chemotactic factor secreted by renal epithelial cells, markedly in\u2010 creased in patients with kidney diseases; therefore, we used RT\u2010 PCR and ELISA to test the effect of FSH on IL-8 levels in vitro. As  expected,  IL-8  levels gradually  increased, and the optimal stimu\u2010 lated concentration of FSH was likely to be at a dosage of 100 ng/ ml  (Figure  5h,i).  Next,  we  silenced  FSHR  by  FSHR  siRNA  based  on this concentration, and the chemotactic  influence of  IL-8 was  significantly suppressed (Figure 5j,k). Together, these data indicate  that macrophages exacerbated FSH\u2010mediated interstitial fibrosis.  3\u2003 |\u2003DISCUSSION  Numerous epidemiological studies have documented that FSH  sharply increased during the postmenopausal period in which CKD  occurred  rather  rapidly  (Burger  et  al.,  1995;  Saran  et  al.,  2018).  However, no clinical correlation between renal function and serum  FSH levels has been explored. Here, we analyzed data from 3,055  postmenopausal samples from a large cross\u2010sectional survey that  enrolled more than 10,000 Chinese individuals, showing that high  circulating FSH level increased the risks of decreased eGFR and CKD  in the postmenopausal female population, and this positive correla\u2010 tion was independent of age, total T, estradiol, current smoker sta\u2010 tus, etc. Based on large\u2010scale clinical data analysis, we attempted to  investigate whether FSH participated in the progression of kidney  disease in experimental study.  Postmenopausal status is characterized by high levels of FSH and  LH, as well as low levels of E2, making it difficult to explore the precise  role of FSH in renal function in the OVX mouse model. To diminish  the potential effect of these two parameters, we used GnRHa\u2010treated  ovariectomized mice administered with recombinant FSH in accor\u2010 dance with several studies (Li, Chen, et al., 2017; Song et al., 2016).  Given that kidney injury is a relatively chronic process, we increased  the dose of FSH from 0.15 IU to 0.3 IU and lengthened intervention  time  to 6 weeks, which was different  from Liu's  study on  fat  accu\u2010 mulation. Consequently,  rising serum FSH and falling serum LH and  E2 were all observed in OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice. Under these   conditions, OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice had higher levels of 24\u2010hr uric  protein/creatinine, serum Cr, and serum BUN and presented a more  obvious phenotype of ECM deposition by histopathology, suggesting  that FSH was responsible for renal dysfunction and tubulointerstitial  fibrosis. These results also indirectly eliminated the effect of GnRHa  on  kidney  injury  as  Gandaglia's  findings  reported  (Gandaglia  et  al.,  2014). Interstitial fibrosis exhibited identical manifestations in all pro\u2010 gressive forms of chronic kidney disease, although glomerular lesions  played a specific role in the pathogenesis of renal disease (Zeisberg &  Neilson, 2010). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis seen in ovariectomized mice  might be partly attributed to abundant expression of FSHR in the renal  tubular epithelium. The transition of tubular epithelial cells (TECs) from  an epithelial phenotype to mesenchymal feature contributed to tub\u2010 ulointerstitial fibrosis (Li, Li, Hao, Liu, & Duan, 2017). Consistent with  these findings, FSH treatment significantly increased transcriptional  and protein expression of fibrogenic cytokines (PAI-1, fibronectin, and  collagen IV) in vitro and in vivo.  Follicle\u2010stimulating hormone receptor is a member of the G  protein\u2010coupled receptor that is considered as a driver of the ac\u2010 tivation of multiple signaling cascades. Emerging evidence from  studies  suggests  that  an  altered  PI3K/AKT  signaling  pathway  is  highly linked to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. FSH stimulated  the  FSHR-mediated  PI3K  pathway,  leading  to  activation  of  AKT  and downstream  targets  in GCs  (Hunzicker-Dunn et  al.,  2012). A  report by Cheryl et al. demonstrated that FSHR interacts with the  adaptor protein APPL1 via the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote cell  survival in HEK 293 cells in response to FSH treatment (Nechamen  et al., 2004). As shown in our findings, FSH-stimulated rapid AKT  (Thr308) phosphorylation was observed in HK\u20102 cells, and the in\u2010 hibition of PI3K/AKT signaling with LY294002 or MK 2206, or the  silencing of FSHR by siRNA, significantly  reduced  this activation.  GSK\u20103\u03b2 is believed to exert an anti\u2010fibrotic effect in multiple organ  systems  (Gong, Rifai, Ge, Chen, & Dworkin, 2008). The enhance\u2010 ment  in  AKT  phosphorylation  activates  GSK-3\u03b2 by phosphoryla\u2010 tion at Ser9, thus leading to changes in activity of GSK\u20103\u03b2. Further,  GSK\u20103\u03b2 targets the \u03b2\u2010catenin complex for ubiquitination and pro\u2010 teasomal degradation, and the disintegration of this complex con\u2010 tributes to \u03b2\u2010catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation, thus  triggering fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis (Hwang, Seo, & Ha,  2009). FSH promoted the phosphorylation of GSK\u20103\u03b2 and \u03b2\u2010cat\u2010 enin translocation into the nucleus, and LY294002 or MK 2206, or  FSHR siRNA powerfully blocked GSK-3\u03b2/ \u03b2\u2010catenin signaling and  lessened the expression of profibrotic proteins mediated by FSH,  such as fibronectin and collagen IV.  Numerous evidence has suggested that macrophages have cru\u2010 cial roles in the progression of fibrosis (Wynn, 2011). Macrophages  have 2 distinct subtypes participating in this process: classically  activated  (M1)  and  alternatively  activated  (M2)  macrophages. M1  macrophages generally infiltrated and presented profibrotic activity  by releasing toxic factors that can aggravate tissue injury, such as  ROS, iNOS, TNF\u2010\u03b1,  and  IL-1\u03b2  (Wynn & Barron,  2010).  Indeed, we  found that FSH triggered classical macrophage activation in vitro,     \u2003\u2002 \u2003 | \u20039 of 12ZHANG et Al.  which was characterized by increased transcriptional levels of proin\u2010 flammatory factors. Interestingly, damaged epithelial cells and en\u2010 dothelial cells per se secrete a series of chemotactic cytokines that  can  recruit  macrophages  to  the  site  of  diseased  tissue  (Wynn  &  Ramalingam, 2012). IL-8 is well believed to be a key chemotactic cy\u2010 tokine, which is involved in the recruitment of monocyte (Meniailo et  al., 2018). Profibrotic mediators such as TGF-\u03b2 induced proximal tu\u2010 bular cells to secrete IL-8, and its production was markedly enhanced  in urine proteins obtained from patients with tubular injury (Huang,  Wen, Zhou, & Yu, 2008; Qi et al., 2006; Singhto & Thongboonkerd,  2018). In our results, FSH\u2010treated HK\u20102 cells resulted in the produc\u2010 tion of chemokine IL-8, which, in turn, induced FSHR-mediated mac\u2010 rophage migration.  In conclusion, we have identified that FSH promoted renal dys\u2010 function and tubulointerstitial fibrosis via the AKT/GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2\u2010catenin  pathway in HK\u20102 cells. FSH also activated macrophage polarization  and recruited macrophages to exacerbate renal injury. Our results  revealed a previously unknown function of FSH on nongonadal  tissues of the kidney, which will enhance the understanding of the  pathophysiology of CKD and will benefit millions of aging women.  4\u2003 |\u2003MATERIAL S AND METHODS  4.1\u2003|\u2003Clinical data  The data are from 10,441 participants of SPECT-China, a cross-sec\u2010 tional survey in East China (ChiCTR-ECS-14005052, www.chictr.org. cn). Recruitment and enrollment have been previously described in  detail (Wang, Cheng, et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2015; Wang, Wang, et  al., 2017). A total of 3,226 postmenopausal women were selected.  Postmenopausal  women  were  defined  as  subjects  who  reported  that they had stopped menstruating for a minimum of 12 months  (n = 1,431), who were 55 years of age or older (n = 2,872), or who had  previous hysterectomy or oophorectomy (n = 139). Exclusion criteria  included missing values of FSH,  luteinizing hormone  (LH) or eGFR  (n = 12), and FSH < 25.0 IU/L (per the 2011 Stages of Reproductive  Aging Workshop +10 recommendation, late perimenopausal state is  characterized as FSH level \u2265 25 IU/L; n = 159) (Harlow et al., 2012).  Finally, 3,055 participants were  included  in the study, as shown  in  Figure S1.  The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calcu\u2010 lated according to the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology  Collaboration  (CKD-EPI)  equation  (Levey  et  al.,  2009).  eGFR < 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or 60 ml/min per 1.73 \u2009m2 was de\u2010 fined as decreased eGFR or CKD, respectively. The study protocol  was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's  Hospital,  Shanghai  Jiao  Tong University  School  of Medicine.  All  procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical stan\u2010 dards of the responsible committee on human experimentation  (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki Declaration of  1975, as revised in 2008. Informed consent was obtained from all  patients included in the study.  4.2\u2003|\u2003Animals  Female mice were randomly assigned into the following four groups:  sham operation (Sham, n = 6), bilateral ovariectomy (OVX, n = 7),  OVX + GnRHa (n = 7), and OVX + GnRHa + FSH (n = 8). At 8 weeks, all  mice were subjected to sham operation or bilateral ovariectomy with  a 1\u2010cm dorsal incision. Subsequently, the mice were allowed to recover  for 1 week. Ovariectomy was performed to mimic the postmenopausal  features of high FSH levels. Ovariectomized mice partly received an  intraperitoneal injection of GnRHa triptorelin acetate (Beaufour\u2010Ipsen)  0.5 \u03bcg per day for 6 weeks to inhibit pituitary FSH and LH secretion.  OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice were given an additional injection of re\u2010 combinant FSH (Gonal-f, Merck Serono) 0.3 IU daily for 4 weeks. Mice  without GnRHa or FSH treatment were administered daily with saline  and served as controls. All the procedures were conducted in accord\u2010 ance with the Animal Research Committee of Shanghai Ninth People's  Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  4.3\u2003|\u2003Biochemical measurement  Mice were housed individually  in metabolic cages for 24 hr to col\u2010 lect urine samples. Serum creatinine (Cr), urea nitrogen (BUN), and  other  serum parameters were completed on Beckman Coulter AU  680 in the central laboratory. Serum FSH, LH, and E2 levels in mice  were measured by radioimmunoassay at the North Biotechnology  Institute (Beijing).  4.4\u2003|\u2003Cell culture and treatment  Human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK\u20102) and mouse  macrophage  cells  (RAW264.7)  were  obtained  from  the  ATCC  (American Type Culture Collection). HK-2 cells were maintained  in  Dulbecco's  modified  Eagle's  medium  (DMEM)/Nutrition  Mixture  F\u201012 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone) and  1% penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco). HK\u20102 cells were transfected with  50 nM FSHR siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to block  the  effect  of  FSHR.  LY294002  (50 \u03bcM) or MK 2206  (10 \u03bcM) was  added to inhibit PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. RAW264.7 cells were  cultured in DMEM medium with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-strep\u2010 tomycin and treated with FSH (100 ng/ml) for 24 hr. Cells were col\u2010 lected for gene and protein analyses.  4.5\u2003|\u2003Quantitative real\u2010time PCR  Total RNA was extracted from cells and kidney tissues using TRIzol  reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Real- time  quantitative  PCR was  performed  on  an  ABI Machine with  a  two\u2010step method, and \u03b2\u2010actin was served as an endogenous control.  The relative mRNA expression levels of genes were calculated using  the 2\u2212\u2206\u2206Ct method as previously described. Each RNA sample was  repeated independently at least three times.  http://www.chictr.org.cn http://www.chictr.org.cn   10 of 12\u2003 |\u2003 \u2003\u2002 ZHANG et Al.  4.6\u2003|\u2003Western blot analysis  Cells and kidney proteins were extracted as previously described  (Ning  et  al.,  2017).  Primary  antibodies were  as  follows:  anti-FSHR  (1:1,000;  Abcam),  anti-PAI  (1:1,000;  Abcam),  anti-collagen  IV  (1:1,000;  Abcam),  anti-fibronectin  (1:1,000;  Abcam),  anti-pAKT  (Thr308,  1:1,000;  CST),  anti-AKT  (1:1,000;  CST),  anti-pGSK-3\u03b2  (1:1,000, CST), anti\u2010GSK\u20103\u03b2 (1:1,000, CST), \u03b2\u2010catenin (1:1,000; CST),  anti-lamin  B1  (1:2,500;  Proteintech),  and  anti-GAPDH  (1:5,000;  Sigma). Relative densitometry was calculated by the ImageJ software.  4.7\u2003|\u2003Morphological analyses and immunochemistry  Paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded mouse kidney sections  were used for Masson's trichrome staining and Sirius Red staining.  The fibrotic area was quantified by the ImageJ software. The corre\u2010 sponding values were expressed as a percentage of the entire area.  For immunochemistry staining, paraffin sections were subjected to  further dewaxing, rehydration, and antigen retrieval. Subsequently,  slides were  stained with PAI-1  (1:100; Abcam),  fibronectin  (1:100;  Abcam),  and  F4/80  (1:100;  Abcam)  antibodies.  Images  were  cap\u2010 tured using a Nikon microscope.  4.8\u2003|\u2003Immunofluorescence staining  Histopathologic slides and cultured HK\u20102 cells were incubated with  primary  antibodies  FSHR  (1:100; Abcam),  type  IV  collagen  (1:100;  Abcam), AQP1 (1:100; Abcam), and secondary antibodies including  Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594. Nuclei were counterstained  with  4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  (DAPI).  Images  were  captured  using a Nikon microscope.  4.9\u2003|\u2003ELISA for IL\u20108  HK-2 cells were cultured for 24 hr with FSH or NC siRNA or FSHR  siRNA,  and  their  supernatants  were  collected.  The  levels  of  IL-8  from HK\u20102 supernatant were measured by a commercially available  human IL-8 assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.  4.10\u2003|\u2003Coculture and transwell assay  HK-2 cells were  transfected with NC siRNA or FSHR siRNA using  Lipofectamine  2000  or  IL-8-neutralizing  antibody  or  treated  with  FSH for 24 hr, followed by supernatant collection. Subsequently,  2 \u00d7 105/well macrophages suspended in FBS-free DMEM/F12 me\u2010 dium were seeded into the upper chamber and HK\u20102 cells superna\u2010 tants were added in the lower chamber. This coculture system was  incubated for 24 hr, which attracted macrophages to migrate toward  the underside of the insert membrane. The migrated cells were fixed  and stained with 0.1% crystal violet solution. Images were captured  using a Nikon microscope.  4.11\u2003|\u2003Statistical analysis  Data analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 22  (IBM Corporation). The associations of FSH quartiles with decreased  eGFR and CKD (categorical variable) were assessed by binary logis\u2010 tic regression. The model was adjusted for age, total testosterone  (T), E2, LH, current smoker status, urban/rural residence, high/low  economic  status,  BMI,  dyslipidemia,  diabetes,  and  hypertension.  Two-way analysis of  variance  (ANOVA)  followed by Fisher's PLSD  post hoc test was used to compare significant differences between  groups. All analyses were two-sided. A p value <0.05 indicated sig\u2010 nificance. Error bars in histograms indicate the standard error of the  mean (SEM).  ACKNOWLEDG MENTS  The authors  thank Z.M.L. and L.
