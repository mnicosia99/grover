    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

Upon light exposure, activated rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) in Drosophila PRs is internalized via endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Whether internalized Rh1 can be recycled is unknown. Here, we show that the retromer complex is expressed in PRs where it is required for recycling endocytosed Rh1 upon light stimulation. In the absence of subunits of the retromer, Rh1 is processed in the endolysosomal pathway, leading to a dramatic increase in late endosomes, lysosomes, and light-dependent PR degeneration. Reducing Rh1 endocytosis or Rh1 levels in retromer mutants alleviates PR degeneration. In addition, increasing retromer abundance suppresses degenerative phenotypes of mutations that affect the endolysosomal system. Finally, expressing human Vps26 suppresses PR degeneration in Vps26 mutant PRs. We propose that the retromer plays a conserved role in recycling rhodopsins to maintain PR function and integrity.

Because vision is not required for animal survival, previous  studies in Drosophila mostly focused on viable mutations that  specifically impair PR function [1]. However, it is likely that  numerous additional players encoded by essential genes have  remained unidentified. We performed an eye-specific mosaic  genetic screen [6] and found that loss of subunits of the retromer  causes light-induced PR degeneration.  The retromer, a hetero-multimeric protein complex, re-  trieves specific proteins from endosomes, thereby preventing  the degradation of these proteins in lysosomes [7-9]. The  retromer is composed of Vps26, Vps29, Vps35, and certain  sorting nexins (Snx) (Figure 1A, [7-9]). Most subunits are  evolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7-9]). Mutations in some  subunits (Vps35 or Snx3) of the retromer have been shown to  decrease the abundance of Wntless (Wls) and impair the  secretion of Wingless (Wg), a ligand of the Wnt signaling  pathway [10-14]. Wls is a transmembrane protein that binds  to Wg and is required for Wg secretion [15,16]. Impaired  retromer function leads to excessive degradation of Wls in  lysosomes, severely reducing Wg secretion and signaling [10-  14]. The retromer has also been shown to maintain the levels  of Crumbs, a transmembrane protein required for maintaining  the apicobasal polarity in some tissues [17,18]. More recently,  PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001847&domain=pdf   mutations in human VPS35 have been shown to cause a  dominant inherited form of Parkinson's disease (PD) [19,20].  However, the retromer has not been implicated in neurons of  the visual system in flies or vertebrates.  The Drosophila compound eye comprises ,800 hexagonal units named ommatidia [1,2,21,22]. Each ommatidium contains eight  PRs (R1-R8) that express rhodopsin proteins [1,2,21-23].  Rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) is the major rhodopsin that is primarily  expressed in R1-R6 [1,2,21,22]. It is synthesized and folded in the  endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to rhabdomeres, the  stacked membranous structures in PRs, via the secretory pathway  [1,2,21]. The proper transport of Rh1 from ER to rhabdomeres  requires molecular chaperones [24-30] and Rab GTPases [24-  33]. Binding of opsins to chromophores [34-40] as well as protein  glycosylation and deglycosylation [41-44] are essential for Rh1  folding and maturation. Mutations in genes involved in Rh1  synthesis, folding, or transport can result in defective PR  development or PR degeneration [24,25,32,41-43,45-51].  Phototransduction in the PRs relies on the activation of Rh1 by  photons (Figure S1A, [52]). Active Rh1 (metarhodopsin, M*)  activates phospholipase C (PLC) [53], which hydrolyzes phospha-  tidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol  (DAG) [54]. DAG or its metabolites can activate Transient  Receptor Potential (TRP) and TRP-like cation channels that lead  to depolarization of the PRs [55-59]. Similar to fly PRs, the  vertebrate intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells  (ipRGCs) use melanopsin (a homolog of fly Rh1) as the light  sensor and requires PLC and TRPC channels for activation [60-  63]. ipRGCs project their axons to specific brain areas to control  circadian rhythms [64-67] or pupillary light reflex [64,68,69].  Tight regulation of Rh1 activity upon light exposure is required  to maintain the integrity of PR cells [1,2]. M* can be converted  into its inactive form upon exposure to orange light [52]. In  addition, a significant portion of active Rh1 can be endocytosed  and degraded in lysosomes [70-72]. Mutations that abolish Rh1  deactivation [72-74] or impair the endolysosomal system  [71,75,76] can cause PR degeneration due to Rh1 accumulation.  However, it is unknown whether Rh1 can be retrieved from the  endolysosomal compartments and whether impaired Rh1 recy-  cling leads to PR degeneration.  Here, we show that loss of the fly Vps26 or Vps35 causes early-  onset PR degeneration. We show that retromer subunits are  expressed in PRs in flies and melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs in the  mouse retina. In fly mutant PRs, the numbers of late endosomes  and lysosomes are significantly elevated. The PR degenerative  phenotypes are dependent on exposure to light and the presence of  Rh1. Our data indicate that the fly retromer recycles Rh1,  preventing Rh1 retention in the PR cell bodies and shunting Rh1  from being degraded in lysosomes, thereby promoting Rh1  redelivery to rhabdomeres. In summary, the retromer recycles  Rh1, prevents an overload of the endolysosomal pathway, and  salvages a substantial fraction of Rh1 from degradation in flies. It  may also play a similar role in ipRGCs in the retina of vertebrates.  Results  Vps26 Mutant PRs Display Light-Dependent PR Degeneration  To identify mutations that cause PR degeneration, we  generated large mutant clones of essential genes in the eyes  (Figure S1B) and screened for mutants that exhibit an age-  dependent decrease in amplitude of electroretinogram (ERG)  recordings [6,77,78]. Mutations in a complementation group  XE52, which we later mapped to Vps26 (Figure S2A), result in a  progressive loss of ERG amplitudes compared to the control  (Figure 1B-C and Figure S1C). Reduced amplitudes in ERG  recordings may result from aberrant PR development, a defective  phototransduction pathway, or PR degeneration [1]. To address if  the ERG defects are due to aberrant PR development, we  examined the light response of dark-reared control (y w FRT19A iso  ,  the isogenized y w FRT19A flies, or iso; see Materials and Methods)  and two Vps26 mutant alleles. Upon rearing the flies in the dark,  the Vps26 1  and Vps26 2  mutants exhibit nearly normal ERG  responses and the ERG amplitude and on- and off-transients in  Vps26 1  mutant PRs are slightly reduced when compared to control  (Figure 1B-C and Figure S1C). In addition, imaging of newly  eclosed flies (see definition in Materials and Methods) revealed that  the overall morphology of ommatidia is similar to control,  although loss of a rhabdomere is observed at low frequency in  the Vps26 1  mosaic clones (Figure 1D-E and Figure S1D-E). These  data indicate that mutations in Vps26 do not significantly affect PR  development, allowing nearly normal ERGs in young flies.  To assess the impact of the Vps26 mutations in aged flies, we  raised the animals either in a 12-h light/dark cycle (LD, L = 1,800  lux) or in constant darkness (DD) and recorded the ERGs at 0, 2,  4, 10, and 21 d. In LD, both alleles show a loss of on- and off-  transients, indicating a loss of synaptic transmission. They also  exhibit a reduced depolarization by day 2, and a progressive loss of  the ERG amplitude with age (Figure 1B-C and Figure S1C). At  day 21, the light-induced PR depolarization in Vps26 1  and Vps26 2  mutant PRs is almost completely absent (Figure 1B-C and Figure  S1C). Strikingly, 3-wk-old DD-reared Vps26 1  and Vps26 2  mutants  exhibit nearly normal ERG responses, similar to newly eclosed  flies (Figure 1B-C and Figure S1C). The PR morphology of  Vps26 1  and Vps26 2  mutants is severely affected in flies kept in LD  for 21 d (Figure 1D-E and Figure S1D-E). In addition, we  constructed an EGFP-tagged genomic rescue construct (Vps26-  gEGFP; see below and Figure S2A) that fully rescues the lethality  (Figure S2B), ERG, and morphological defects of both Vps26 1  and  Vps26 2  alleles (Vps26 1  GR in Figure 1B-E; Vps26 2  GR in Figure 1C  and S1C-E). However, PR morphology is nearly wild-type when  the flies are raised in DD (Figure 1D-E and Figure S1D-E). In  summary, PR degeneration in the Vps26 mutant clones is light-  dependent.  Author Summary  Upon light exposure, rhodopsins\u2014light-sensing proteins in the eye\u2014trigger visual transduction signaling to activate fly photoreceptor cells. After activation, rhodop- sins can be internalized from the cell surface into endosomes and then degraded in lysosomes. This mech- anism prevents constant activation of the visual transduc- tion pathway, thereby maintaining the function and integrity of photoreceptor cells. It is not known, however, whether these internalized rhodopsins can be recycled. Here, we show that the retromer, an evolutionarily conserved protein complex, is required for the recycling of rhodopsins. We find that loss of key retromer subunits (Vps35 or Vps26) causes rhodopsin mislocalization in the photoreceptors and severe light-induced photoreceptor degeneration. Conversely, gain of retromer subunits can alleviate photoreceptor degeneration in some contexts. Human retromer components can stand in for depleted fruit fly retromer, suggesting that this complex plays a role in recycling light sensors in both vertebrate and inverte- brate photoreceptors.  The Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin  PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847    Mutations in XE52 Map to Vps26 To identify the mutations in XE52 complementation group  consisting of two alleles, we performed duplication, deficiency, and  P[acman] rescue mapping (Yamamoto et al., in preparation),  narrowing the locus to a 21 kb genomic region (Figure S2A). The  XE52 alleles fail to complement the lethality of P{EP}Vps26 G2008  (Figures S2A-B, [79]), a transposable element inserted in the 59-  UTR of the Vps26 gene. Sanger sequencing revealed mutations in  conserved amino acid residues in both alleles: a nonsense mutation  (K264*) and a missense mutation (V267D) in Vps26 1  and Vps26 2 ,  respectively (Figure 1F). To test if Vps26 is responsible for both the  lethality and PR degenerative phenotypes in XE52 alleles, we  generated the Vps26-gEGFP genomic rescue construct mentioned  above (Figure S2A) as well as a UAS-Vps26 full-length cDNA  construct [80]. Both the genomic rescue and ubiquitously  expressed cDNA (tub-Gal4.UAS-Vps26) rescue all phenotypes  (Figure 1B-E, Figure S1C-E, Figure S2B, and unpublished data),  confirming that the phenotypes are caused by loss of Vps26.  Vps26 is a subunit of the retromer (Figure 1A, [81,82]). Because  loss of retromer function in Vps35 and Snx3 mutants has been  Figure 1. Loss of Vps26 in the eye causes PR degeneration.

We generated mutant clones of Vps26 1  in  wing discs of third instar larvae and observed a failure to secrete  Wg in the wing margin cells. Furthermore, we observed  concomitant loss of Senseless (Sens) expression, a downstream  effector of the Wingless pathway (Figure S2C, [83]). These data  confirm the loss of retromer function in the Vps26 mutants.  Vps26 Is Primarily Localized to Early and Late Endosomes The subunits of the retromer complex have been shown to  primarily associate with endosomes in vertebrates [7-9]. However,  the in vivo subcellular localization of the retromer in Drosophila has  not been documented. We therefore raised a polyclonal antibody  against the full-length fly Vps26 protein (Figure S2D-E) and  costained with antibodies against Avalanche (Avl, fly homolog of  Syntaxin 7, an early endosomal marker, [84]), Rab5 (an early  endosomal marker, [85]), Rab7 (a late endosomal marker, [76]),  Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI, an ER marker, [86]), GM130 (a  cis-Golgi marker, [87]), Peanut Agglutinin (PNA, a marker for the  trans-Golgi network (TGN), [88]), or Rab11 (a TGN or post-Golgi  secretory vesicle marker, [31]). Vps26 shows substantially greater  colocalization with Avl, Rab5, and Rab7 than the ER, Golgi, and  secretory vesicle markers (Figure S2F-G). This distribution is seen  in both wing discs and adult PRs (Figure S2F-G and unpublished  data), indicating that Vps26 associates preferentially with early and  late endosomes in different tissues in vivo.  Loss of Vps35 Causes PR Degeneration Vps35 acts as a scaffolding protein and physically interacts with  Vps26 in the retromer (Figure 1A, [81,82,89]). RNAi knockdown  of vps35 has been shown to reduce Vps26 protein levels in  HEK293 cells [13]. Consistent with work in cultured cells, we find  that mutant clones of the Vps35 null allele (Vps35 MH20  , [13]) in eye  discs cause a nearly complete loss of Vps26 (Figure 2A), showing  that the presence of Vps35 is required for Vps26 in vivo. Next, we  performed ERG recordings and bright field imaging on large  mutant clones of Vps35 MH20  in flies aged for 0, 4, 10, and 21 d and  examined function and morphology of Vps35 MH20  mutant PRs. As  shown in Figure 2B-C, the ERG phenotypes of Vps35 MH20  are  very similar to those of Vps26 shown in Figure 1. In addition,  mutations in the two genes exhibit very similar morphological  defects in aged PRs (compare Figure 2D-E with Figure 1D-E and  Figure S1D-E). These results indicate that the retromer is required  to maintain PR function and morphology. Loss of the retromer  therefore leads to light-dependent PR degeneration.  Sorting nexins can be involved in retromer-mediated protein  trafficking [7-9,90,91]. To test whether these proteins are involved  in the maintenance of PRs, we performed ERGs on Snx1 d1  and  Snx3 d1  null alleles (Figure S3, [10]). Upon keeping the flies for 10 d  in LD, we did not observe a difference in ERG amplitudes of  Snx1 d1  or Snx3 d1  mutants (Figure S3A-B), although we observed a  partial loss of the on-transient in Snx3 d1  (Figure S3A,C). The data  indicate that these sorting nexins are not part of the complex or  play a minor role. In addition, we tested whether the WASH  (Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein and SCAR Homolog) com-  plex, a protein complex that has been shown to be required for the  transport of several retromer cargos in vertebrate cells and the fly  tracheal tubes [8,90,91], is involved in PR degeneration. As shown  in Figure S4, RNAi-mediated loss of a subunit of the WASH  complex, Washout (the single WASH ortholog in Drosophila, [92]),  does not affect PR maintenance and function. Hence, the retromer  can have different compositions in different cells.  Loss of Retromer Subunits Leads to an Expansion of the Endolysosomal Compartments in PRs  The retromer retrieves membrane protein cargos from the  endolysosomal pathway [7-9]. To assess whether endosomes and  lysosomes are affected in the absence of the retromer, we  performed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and examined  the ultrastructure of Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs. Vps26 1  and  Vps35 MH20  flies raised in LD for 4 d show obvious ultrastructural  defects (Figure 3B,D) in PRs when compared to control  (Figure 3A). These defects include a dramatic increase in late  endosomes (inset 1 in Figure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and yellow  arrowheads in Figure S5B,D; [93]) and lysosomes (inset 2 in  Figure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and arrows in Figure S5B-C,E; [94]).  However, PRs of the dark-reared Vps26 1  or Vps35 MH20  flies  (Figure 3C,E-F and Figure S6B-E) do not show an increased  number of late endosomes or lysosomes when compared to control  (Figure 3A,F, Figure S5A, and Figure S6A). These data show that  the endolysosomal pathway is severely affected in retromer  mutants upon light exposure.  Internalized Rh1 Fails to Be Recycled from the Endolysosomal Pathway in Vps26 Mutant PRs  To address whether the trafficking of endocytosed Rh1 is  affected in the retromer mutants, we assessed Rh1 distribution in  PRs that were exposed to light. Two protocols have been used for  Rh1 immunostaining in fly PRs: whole mount preparations [76]  and eye sections [41]. Previously, we showed that the whole mount  protocol is more sensitive than staining of sections for Rh1 present  in the cell body, while sections are better than whole mount  staining for assessing Rh1 in rhabdomeres [6]. Here, we slightly  modified the whole mount protocol to increase Rh1 signals in the  PR cell body by treating the tissues with higher concentrations of  Triton X-100. As shown in Figure S7, Rh1 signals are obviously  enhanced upon increasing Triton X-100 concentration (top  panels) compared to low Triton X-100 treatment (bottom panels).  Here, we use the high Triton X-100 protocol for our immuno-  staining assays.  As previously reported [6,76], immunostaining of Rh1 in dark-  reared wild-type control PRs reveals a typical crescent-shaped  staining pattern at the base of the rhabdomeres, due to the densely  stacked rhabdomeric membranes that do not permit antibody  penetration in whole mount preparations (Figure 4A, top panels).  Similar to this control, we observed that the distribution  (Figure 4A, top panels) and levels (Figure 5A-B) of Rh1 are not  affected in Vps26 1  mutants prior to light exposure. These data are  in agreement with the observation that dark-reared Vps26 1  mutants exhibit nearly normal ERGs and PR morphology  (Figure 1B-E). Upon a 12-h light exposure, Rh1 is internalized  in both control and Vps26 1  mutant PRs, as shown by the dramatic  increase in Rh1 levels in the PR cell bodies (Figure 4A, middle  panels). This increase in Rh1 is not due to the changes in levels of  Rh1 (unpublished data), but rather because Rh1 becomes  those in DD at the indicated time points.

In  addition, this light exposure is not pathological as control flies  exhibit normal ERGs and PR morphology (Figure S8). However,  upon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is  restored to the original levels in control but not in Vps26 1  PRs  (Figure 4A, bottom panels). Similarly, although less obvious, we  also observed Rh1 accumulation in Vps26 1  mutant PRs upon light  exposure in the sectioned eye samples (Figure S9). Hence, the Rh1  subcellular localization is altered in Vps26 1  mutants.  To assess where in the cell body Rh1 accumulates in Vps26 1  mutants, we transiently exposed the flies to light and monitored  the subcellular localization of Rh1 using markers. We briefly  exposed the flies to blue light for 20 min followed by 5-min  exposure to orange light (Figure 4B) to acutely induce endocytosis  of a small amount of Rh1. This light condition is not pathological  as the ERG responses and morphology of control PRs are normal  (Figure S8). Upon recovery in the dark for 4 h, Rh1 can be  detected in very bright punctae that often colocalize with Rab7 or  Lamp1::GFP, a marker for lysosomes [95], in Vps26 1  PRs  (Figure 4B-C), implicating that Rh1 is trapped in the endolyso-  somal compartments.  Rh1 retention in the endolysosomal pathway in Vps26 1  mutants  upon an acute light exposure may be due to reduced Rh1  recycling and/or decreased lysosomal degradation. If Rh1  recycling is decreased, one would expect a reduction in Rh1  levels in Vps26 1  mutants compared to controls upon light exposure  as an increased amount of internalized Rh1 will be delivered to  lysosomes for degradation. On the other hand, if Rh1 degradation  in lysosomes is impaired, one would predict that Rh1 abundance is  elevated in Vps26 mutant PRs when compared to controls exposed  to light. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we exposed  the dark-raised flies to white light (1,800 lux) for 16 h. Prior to this  light exposure, the Rh1 levels are similar in control and Vps26 1  mutants (Figure 5A-B), indicating that Rh1 expression is not  affected in Vps26 1  mutants. Upon a 16-h exposure to white light,  Rh1 levels in Vps26 1  mutant PRs are significantly decreased when  compared to control (Figure 5A-B). Reduced Rh1 levels in Vps26 1  mutants upon light exposure do not appear to be due to impaired  Rh1 synthesis as the Rh1 levels are restored after 6-h recovery in  the dark (Figure 5A-B). Moreover, the ERG responses of Vps26 1  mutants are not affected upon this light exposure (Figure 5C-D).  The data indicate that, in the absence of Vps26, lysosomes are able  Figure 3.

Internalized Rh1 accumulates in late endosomes in Vps26 mutants. (A) Rh1 is aberrantly distributed in Vps261 mutants. Dark- reared control (iso) or Vps261 mutants were kept in the dark, exposed to whole-spectrum light for 12 h, or exposed to light for 12 h and recovered in the dark for 6 h. Both dark-reared control and Vps261 mutant PRs show a normal Rh1 distribution, which is characterized by the crescent-shaped Rh1 staining pattern surrounding rhabdomeres (marked by F-actin) (top panels). The localization of Rh1 in the shape of a crescent around the rhabdomeres is due to the dense packing of membranes in rhabdomeres. Upon a 12-h light exposure, both genotypes show increased Rh1 protein levels in PR cell body (middle panels) as some Rh1 is endocytosed. However, upon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is higher in Vps26  1 than that in wild-type PRs (bottom panels). Scale bar, 2 mm.

However, chronic light exposure (LD for several  days) severely affects the endolysosomal system (Figure 3 and  Figure S5) because accumulated Rh1 in endosomes and/or  lysosomes persistently challenges the endolysosomal system [2].  To examine whether the retromer is recruited to Rh1 punctae  upon endocytosis in the PRs, we performed colocalization studies  of Vps26 and Rh1. In the dark, Rh1 and Vps26 signals do not  overlap (Figure 5E). In contrast, numerous Rh1 punctae colocalize  with Vps26 in the PR cell body upon transient light exposure  (Figure 5E). These data indicate that endocytosed Rh1 is a cargo  of the retromer.  Reducing Endocytosis or Rh1 Levels Suppresses PR Degeneration in Vps26 Mutants  If PR degeneration in retromer mutants is caused by aberrant  accumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal pathway, reducing the  amount of endocytosed Rh1 or the abundance of Rh1 itself may  suppress PR degenerative phenotypes. Dynamin (encoded by the  shi gene) is required for Rh1 endocytosis upon light exposure [73].  shi ts1  , a temperature-sensitive dynamin allele, encodes a mutant  protein that is functional at 18uC but loses its function at elevated temperature [96]. Although impaired dynamin function leads to  death of adult animals at 26uC or higher temperature (unpub- lished data), shi  ts1 mutant flies are viable and do not exhibit ERG  defects at 24uC (Figure 6A-B). This permits us to conditionally reduce dynamin function in adult flies without impairing their  light response. To address whether internalization of Rh1 is  critical for the PR degeneration in Vps26 1  flies, we raised the  Vps26 1 ,shi  ts1 double mutants at 18uC and shifted the newly eclosed  flies to 24uC to decrease dynamin function. We then performed ERGs on Vps26  1 ,shi  ts1 double mutants kept in LD (Figure 6A). As  shown in Figure 6A-B, reducing dynamin function significantly  suppresses the loss in ERG amplitude in Vps26 1  mutants at day 4  in LD, indicating that Rh1 endocytosis plays an important role in  PR degeneration upon loss of retromer function.  To address if a reduction in Rh1 suppresses the demise of the  PRs, we tested flies that lack one copy of the Rh1 gene. Strong  hypomorphic or null Rh1 alleles impair rhabdomere development  in homozygous animals, as Rh1 plays a key signaling role in  maintaining the structure of rhabdomeres [97,98]. However, flies  that are heterozygous for Rh1 loss-of-function alleles do not show  aberrant PR development even when the Rh1 protein levels  are reduced by 50% (Figure S10 and [50]). To assess whether  a reduction of 50% in Rh1 levels is able to suppress the  Vps26-associated PR degenerative phenotypes, we tested ERGs  in mutants that carry a single copy of the Rh1 null allele (ninaE 17  ,  [99]). As shown in Figure 6C-D, flies that carry a single copy of  Rh1 exhibit a significant suppression of the ERG defects seen in  Vps26 1  mutant flies that have been kept in LD for 4 d.  To strongly reduce Rh1 levels, we next raised Vps26 1  mutants  on low vitamin A containing fly food. Vitamin A is a dietary  precursor of 11-cis 3-hydroxyretinal, the chromophore that is  covalently linked to the Rh1 opsin [100]. A decrease in vitamin A  leads to loss of the chromophore. Because the chromophore is  essential for Rh1 folding and stability [39,101], absence of vitamin  A leads to reduced Rh1 levels in flies. Although this manipulation  still allows the formation of rhabdomeres, the size is dramatically  reduced due to the requirement of Rh1 as a major structural  component [102]. Indeed, a reduction in dietary vitamin A leads  to diminished rhabdomere size in both control and Vps26 1  mutants. Remarkably, vitamin A deprivation leads to a very  strong suppression of the PR degeneration observed in Vps26 1  mutants at day 10 in LD (Figure 6E-F). In addition, the reduced  ERG amplitudes of Vps26 1  are strongly suppressed upon vitamin A  deprivation (Figure 6G). In summary, decreasing Rh1 levels  suppresses the retinal degeneration associated with Vps26 1 . This  also suggests that elevated levels of Rh1 trapped in the  endolysosomal pathway, rather than alterations in the levels of  Rh1 in the rhabdomeres per se, underlie PR degeneration in Vps26 1  mutants.  Increased Levels of Vps35 or Vps26 Are Sufficient to Suppress PR Degeneration  Rh1 accumulation in late endosomes causes PR degenera-  tion in flies that lack PLC activity (encoded by the no receptor  potential A (norpA) gene, [76,103]) (Figure 7A). If the retromer  retrieves Rh1 from endosomes, increasing retromer levels  might alleviate PR degeneration in norpA flies. We therefore  overexpressed the fly Vps35 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps35,UAS-w  RNAi) or Vps26 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps26,UAS-w RNAi) in nor-  pA P24  mutants. Upon continuous exposure to white light for  6 d, norpA P24  mutants exhibit reduced numbers of rhabdomeres  compared to control flies (Figure 7B, left and middle left panels  and Figure 7C). In addition, the ommatidia organization is  often aberrant in norpA P24  mutants (Figure 7B, middle left  panel), indicating that the PRs are undergoing a progressive  demise. Expression of Vps35 or Vps26 significantly restores  rhabdomere numbers (Figure 7B, middle right and right panel  and Figure 7C), suggesting that this manipulation is sufficient  Figure 6. Decreasing Rh1 levels suppresses PR degeneration in Vps26 mutants. (A) Decreasing endocytosis with a temperature-sensitive dynamin mutation (shi  ts ) suppresses ERG defects associated with the loss of Vps26. Animals were grown at 18uC in the dark. Newly eclosed flies were  selected and kept in the dark for an additional 12 h at 24uC to reduce dynamin function in shits1 or Vps261,shits1. Subsequently, flies are shifted to LD or kept in DD at 24uC. ERG is performed at the end of the fourth LD cycle. shits1 flies exhibit a normal ERG response. ERG defects in Vps261 mutant PRs are suppressed when dynamin function is partially reduced, as the Vps261,shits1 double mutants show a stronger depolarization than that in Vps261.

Heterozygous Rh1  17 mutants exhibit a normal ERG response. After 4 d in LD, loss of one copy of the Rh1  gene strongly suppresses the reduction of ERG amplitude in Vps261 mutants.

Decreasing vitA lowers the levels of retinal, which is required for Rh1 maturation [39]. Loss of retinal therefore leads to loss of Rh1. Bright field images show that PR degeneration is strongly suppressed in Vps26  1 mutants raised on the low vitA-containing food when flies are kept in LD for 10 d. As vitA is a key component for Rh1  maturation and Rh1 is a key structural component of rhabdomeres, the rhabdomere size is much reduced when the flies were raised on low vitA food.

In  addition, expression of human Vps26B also suppresses the  norpA P24  phenotypes (unpublished data). These data indicate  that rerouting some of the Rh1 slated for lysosomal degrada-  tion delays PR degeneration.  Mutations that impair lysosomal function can also lead to  Rh1-induced PR degeneration [76]. We therefore assessed  whether increasing Vps35 or Vps26 expression suppresses PR  degeneration in mutants that affect a subunit of the AP-3  complex. AP-m3, encoded by carmine (cm), is required for the proper biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles [104]. Upon  6 d of light exposure, cm 1  mutant PRs showed degenerative  features [76], including loss of rhabdomeres and disruption of  the ommatidia organization (Figure 7D, bottom left panel and  Figure 7E). In addition, cm 1  mutant PRs exhibit decreased  ERG amplitudes (Figure 7F-G). Similar to norpA P24  mutants,  increasing Vps35 or Vps26 in cm 1  mutants restores the number  of rhabdomeres (Figure 7D-E) and suppresses ERG defects  (Figure 7F-G). These data indicate that increased retromer  function can not only prevent PR degeneration in mutants with  impaired late endosomal trafficking but also suppress PR  degeneration caused by defective lysosomal function.  Vertebrate Retromer Homologs Because the genes that encode the retromer proteins are  evolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7-9]), we investigated  whether the vertebrate Vps26 and Vps35 may also function in  the visual system. As shown in Figure S11A, vps26A is expressed  in the mouse retina based on Northern blots. In addition, we  stained the retina of wild-type control or heterozygous mice  containing a lacZ inserted in the vps35 gene [105]. Most of the  melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs (92%) also express b-GAL (Figure S11B). To test whether human Vps26 homologs can  substitute for the function of fly Vps26 in PRs, we ubiquitously  expressed the human vps26A or vps26B cDNA in the Vps26 1  mutant background. Both human Vps26A and Vps26B were able  to rescue the lethality of Vps26 1  mutant flies (Figure 8A-D). We  also recorded ERGs from adult flies kept in LD for 21 d. As  shown in Figure 8A-B, we observed a full rescue of the loss of  ERG amplitude and on-off transients. In addition, PR degen-  eration in Vps26 1  mutants is fully suppressed by overexpressing  human Vps26 proteins (Figure 8C-D). These results show that  the human Vps26 homologs are able to perform the same  function as the fly Vps26 protein.  Discussion  The Retromer Complex Is Required for Maintenance of Fly PRs  The retromer recycles specific proteins from endosomes to the  TGN or plasma membrane [7-9]. Here we show that, although  the loss of the retromer does not obviously affect eye development,  mutations in Vps26 or Vps35 genes lead to strong light-dependent  PR degeneration (Figure 1B-E, Figure 2B-E, and Figure S1C-E).  The demise of Vps26 1  and Vps35 MH20  PRs is associated with a  significant increase in the number of late endosomes and  lysosomes upon light exposure (Figure 3 and Figure S5), showing  that the endolysosomal pathway is strongly affected when Rh1  recycling by the retromer is impaired. Indeed, Rh1 accumulates in  late endosomes or lysosomes in the mutant PRs (Figure 4B-C).  Although Rh1 can be degraded and the function of Vps26 1  mutant  PRs is not abolished upon short light exposure (Figure 5A-D),  chronic exposure to light is detrimental to Vps26 1  mutants because  persistent Rh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal pathway is  toxic to PR cells [71,75,76]. Hence, reducing Rh1 endocytosis or  Rh1 levels in the rhabdomeres suppresses PR degeneration upon  prolonged light exposure (Figure 6). Interestingly, increasing  Vps35 or Vps26 in mutants that show PR degeneration due to  Rh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal compartments [76]  suppresses the degenerative phenotypes (Figure 7). In summary,  the retromer is required to retrieve Rh1 from endosomes to  maintain PR function and integrity (Figure 8E).  How does Rh1 internalization affect the endolysosomal  pathway in retromer mutants? One possibility is that lysosomes  in the mutants are unable to cope with the increased levels of  internalized Rh1 over time as Rh1 is one of the most abundant  proteins in PRs [106,107]. This in turn triggers an increase in the  number of lysosomes (Figures 3B,D,F and Figure S5B-C,E), the  accumulation of aberrant lysosomes (Figure S5C), and the  accumulation of endolysosomal intermediates, including late  endosomes (Figure 3B,D,F and Figure S5B,D). Alternatively, loss  of the retromer may increase the flux in the endolysosomal  pathway, which overpowers the rate of endolysosomal maturation  and leads to an adaptive response that eventually leads to the  expansion of these compartments. Both pathways can lead to an  apparent accumulation of Rh1 in the cell body when stained and  analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4 and Figure S9).  Defective regulation of Rh1 can lead to the demise of PRs via  apoptosis [72,108]. Does apoptosis play a critical role in the PR  Figure 7. Increasing the levels of Vps35 or Vps26 suppresses PR degeneration associated with PLC and AP-m3 mutants. (A) Schematic showing that mutations affecting PLC (norpA) or the m3 subunit of the AP-3 complex (cm) lead to PR degeneration due to Rh1 accumulation in late endosomes.

We argue that this is not the  case based on the following observations. First, the retromer  mutants exhibit progressive PR degeneration over a 3-wk period  (Figure 1B-C, Figure 2B-C, and Figure S1C-E), whereas  apoptosis typically occurs within hours [109]. Second, mutants  that lead to PR loss via apoptosis lose most PRs within ommatidia  by the engulfment of surrounding glial cells [110]. However, the  degenerating Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs are not removed,  although their morphology is very severely disrupted. Indeed, they  can still be identified in 3-wk-old flies (Figure 1D, Figure 2D,  Figure 8C, and Figure S1D), indicating a lack of engulfment by  surrounding cells [111]. Third, overexpressing p35, a pan-caspase  inhibitor of apoptosis [108], fails to suppress the PR degeneration  in Vps26 mutants upon light exposure (unpublished data). Indeed,  Rh1 accumulation in different subcellular compartments triggers  different cellular responses, which leads to PR degeneration of  varying severity [2]. Accumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal  pathway seems particularly toxic to PRs but often does not cause  the removal of PRs for many weeks.  Loss of Wg affects eye development [112], whereas loss of  Crumbs leads to short and/or fused rhabdomeres [113,114].  Although the retromer can recycle Wls or Crumbs in some fly  tissues [10-14,17,18], Vps26 1  or Vps35 MH20  mutants do not exhibit  obvious eye developmental defects. It is therefore very likely that  the composition of the eye retromer is different from the wing  retromer. Indeed, loss of Snx3 does not cause obvious degener-  ative phenotypes when compared to loss of Vps26 or Vps35  (compare Figure S3 with Figures 1 and 2), yet these proteins are all  essential for the recycling of Wls and wing development [10-14].  The Retromer in Photosensitive Cells in Flies and Vertebrates  Many players required for phototransduction in Drosophila are  conserved in a phototransduction cascade in vertebrate ipRGCs.  These include melanopsin, PLC, and the TRP channels [60-63].  This phototransduction pathway plays a role in photoentrainment  of circadian rhythms [64-67] and the control of the pupillary light  reflex [64,68,69]. We find that vps35 is expressed in 92% of the  melanopsin-expressing RGCs in the mouse retina (Figure S11B).  This may be an underestimate due to technical difficulties with b- GAL immunostaining in mouse tissues. In addition, the human  Vps26 proteins are able to substitute for the function of the fly  homolog in PRs (Figure 8A-D). Because vertebrate melanopsin  has very similar photochemical properties to fly rhodopsin  [115,116], the retromer may play a conserved role in vertebrate  ipRGCs. As deletion of vps35 leads to early embryonic lethality  [105], a vps35 conditional KO in ipRGCs will need to be  established to address its role in ipRGCs.  Implications of the Retromer Complex in Human Neurodegenerative Diseases  The retromer has been implicated in human neurodegenerative  disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and PD [19,20,117].  In AD, a retromer deficiency has been proposed to affect  subcellular distribution of b-secretase, which leads to increased amyloid-beta (Ab) deposits and defective neuronal function  [105,118]. In PD, a missense mutation in VPS35 (D620N) has  been shown to cause an autosomal dominant late onset form of the  disease [19,20]. The Vps35 D620N mutant protein appears to  function as a dominant negative, and Vps35 and LRRK2  (Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2) have been shown to interact  [119]. It will therefore be interesting to assess if these mutants  affect ipRGCs as PD patients often have sleep issues [120].  Materials and Methods  Fly Strains and Genetics Vps26  1 and Vps26  2 alleles were isolated as described [6,78].  Male large duplications (,1-2 Mb) covering the X chromosome [121] were crossed with female y,w,mut*,P{neoFRT}19A  isogenized flies  that were balanced with FM7c,Kr-GAL4,UAS-GFP(Kr.GFP). For  the XE52 group, the lethality of alleles was rescued by  Dp(1;Y)y 2 67g19.2 (1A1;2B17-18 + 20A3;20Fh). XE52 alleles  complemented all the available deficiencies covered by  Dp(1;Y)y 2 67g19.2 [122,123]. Therefore, we turned to cross the  XE52 alleles with 80 kb P[acman] duplications that cover the gaps  among deficiencies [124] and found three overlapping duplica-  tions (Dp(1;3)DC446, Dp(1;3)DC033, and Dp(1;3)DC034) that  rescued the lethality of the mutants. These P[acman] duplications  share a ,21 kb interval. We then performed PCR sequencing for genes localized to this region and identified mutations in Vps26. A  lethal insertion P{EP}Vps26 G2008  in Vps26 failed to complement  both XE52 alleles.

(E) Model: the retromer recycles Rh1 in fly PRs. In the absence of the retromer, endocytosed Rh1 is trapped in the endolysosomal compartments upon a short-term light exposure and an increased amount of endocytosed Rh1 is degraded. However, upon chronic light exposure, persistent Rh1 accumulation leads to an expansion of late endosomes and lysosomes. Imbalanced Rh1 homeostasis in the endolysosomal pathway in turn stresses PR cells, causing PR degeneration. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1001847.g008  The Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin  PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 14 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847    P{neoFRT}19A/Dp(1;Y)901 males were crossed with ubi-  GFP,cl,FRT19A ; hh-GAL4,UAS-FLP [13] females to generate large  mutant clones in the posterior region.

Immunostaining of Fly Tissues For whole mount staining, we dissected fly tissue samples in ice  cold PBS and fixed them with 4% paraformaldehyde at room  temperature for 30 min as described [6]. For tissue sections, we  fixed fly tissues with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated the tissues  with acetone, and embedded them in LR white resin (Electron  Microscopy Sciences). Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM  710 confocal microscope. Antibodies were used at the following  concentrations: rabbit anti-Rab5 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-Avl  [84], 1:500; rabbit anti-Rab7 [76], 1:500; mouse anti-PDI  (abcam), 1:100; rabbit anti-GM130 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-  Rab11 (abcam, [6]), 1:500; chicken anti-GFP (abcam), 1:1,000;  mouse anti-Rh1 [4C5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank  (DSHB)], 1:50; mouse anti-Wash (P3H3, [131]), 1:20; guinea pig  anti-Vps26, 1:1,000 (this study); biotin-conjugated PNA (Vector  Labs), 1:1,000; Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen),  1:100; and Alexa 405-, Alexa 488-, Cy3-, or Cy5-conjugated  secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:600.  Western Blotting Fly heads were homogenized in 16 Laemmli sample buffer  (Bio-Rad) containing 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich). Tissue samples were loaded into 10% gels, separated by SDS-  PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).  Antibodies were as follows: mouse anti-actin (ICN Biomedicals),  1:2,500; mouse anti-Rh1 (4C5, DSHB), 1:1,000; and rabbit anti-  TRP [58].  Molecular Biology Cloning.

A C9-  terminal V5 tag was designed in-frame with Vps26. The Vps26  The Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin  PLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 15 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847    PCR product and the pUAST-attB vector were digested with EagI  (NEB) and XbaI (NEB). T4 ligase (NEB) was used to ligate the fly  Vps26 PCR products with pUAST-attB vector. Full-length fly  Vps35 cDNA was cloned from a plasmid (SD03023 from BDGP)  using primers 59-CTTCTCGAGGCCACCATGTATCCCTG-  GAGCTCC-39 and 59-TTCTCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTG-  GGACGTCGTATGGGTAATTGAGAGTTATGCCCG-39. A  C-terminal HA tag was added to Vps35. Vps35 PCR product  was digested with XhoI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with  the pUAST-attB vector. Full-length human vps26A and vps26B  were cloned from plasmids (HsCD00296497 and HsCD00076427,  respectively) (Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University). The  following primers were used for PCR cloning: for hvps26A, 59-  GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGTTTTCTTGGAGGCTT-39  and 59-GCATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGT-  ATGGGTACATTTCAGGCTGTTCGGCAG-39; for hvps26B,  59-GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGCTTCTTCGGCTTCGG-  39 and 59-GAATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCG-  TATGGGTACTGCCTGCAGTTGTTGTCAG-39. A C-termi-  nal HA tag was added to human vps26 isoforms. PCR products  were digested with EcoRI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with  pUAST-attB vectors. Fly Vps26::V5 and Vps35::HA and human  vps26A::HA and vps26B::HA cDNA constructs were purified and  injected into y,w,WC31 ; VK33 (fly cDNAs) or y,w,WC31 ; VK37 embryos (human cDNAs), and the transgenic flies were selected.  Genomic tagging. Recombineering was performed to tag  EGFP at the C-terminus of the Vps26 gene. We used primers 59-  GCAATTACGCCCAATACGAAAAAGACCGGTGCAACGC-  CGTTGGCCACCGATGCAGCCCAATTCCGATCATATT-  C-39 and 59-GTTACTACTTATCCCCCTGAAGATGGAAA-  TCCTCTCCAGCTTCCCACTCATTACTTGTACAGCTCG-  TCCATG-39 to amplify a PCR product containing the EGFP tag  from the PL452-EGFP template vector [132]. We then electro-  porated the EGFP-tagged PCR products into DY380 bacteria,  which had been previously transformed with a 20 kb P[acman]  genomic rescue construct that covers the entire Vps26 genomic  locus (clone CH322-92A18 from the BACPAC Resources Center,  [133]). Recombineering and related procedures were performed  according to the standard protocol [132]. Vps26-gEGFP-tagged  genomic construct was injected into y,w,WC31 ; VK31 embryos, and the transgenic flies were selected.  Generation of Anti-Fly Vps26 Antibody Full-length fly Vps26 cDNA was cloned from LD29140 by PCR  with primers 59-CTTGGATCCATGAATTTCCTGGGATTC-  GGCCA-39 and 59-CTGGCGGCCGCTCAATCGGTGGC-  CAACGGC-39. PCR products were then digested with BamHI  (NEB) and NotI (NEB) and ligated with a pET28a(+) vector containing a Hisx6 tag at the N9-terminus (Novagen). The Vps26-  pET28a(+) construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria (Invitrogen). Expression of Hisx6-Vps26 was induced  with 0.5 mM isopropylthio-b-galactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich), and the recombinant protein was purified with a Ni-NTA column  (Qiagen) and inoculated into guinea pigs to generate polyclonal  antibodies (Cocalico Biological Inc.).  Light/Dark Cycle and Blue-Orange Light Exposure In general, mosaic flies were grown in the dark at 25uC, and the  newly eclosed flies were selected and shifted to a 12-h light/dark  cycle (LD, 1,800 lux in the light cycle) or constant darkness (DD) at  25uC for the indicated periods. In the shits suppressor assay, animals were raised in the dark at 18uC to avoid reduced dynamin protein function. Newly eclosed flies were then shifted to 24uC in the dark for 12 h. Flies were then kept in LD or DD at 24uC. For  aging experiments, flies were flipped to new vials every 3 d to  maintain food conditions, and the positions of the vials were  randomly shuffled to normalize light exposure. For pulse-chase  assays, flies were kept in a box with a blue LED [6] for 20 min and  then an orange LED for 5 min.  Low Vitamin A-Containing Food Low vitamin A-containing food was made according to [134].  In brief, a solution containing 10% dry yeast, 10% sucrose, 0.02%  cholesterol, and 2% agar was microwaved and poured into fly  vials. After drying at room temperature overnight, fresh low  vitamin A food was used for experiments.  TEM and Bright Field Imaging To prepare fly retina samples for TEM and bright field imaging,  fly heads were dissected and fixed at 4uC in 4% paraformalde- hyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, and 0.005%  CaCl2 (PH 7.2) overnight; postfixed in 1% OsO4; dehydrated in  ethanol and propylene oxide; and then embedded in Embed-812  resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with vacuum attachments.  PRs were then sectioned and stained in 4% uranyl acetate and  2.5% lead nitrate. TEM images of PR sections were taken using a  JEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope with an AMT  XR-16 mid-mount 16 mega-pixel digital camera, while bright field  pictures were captured using the Zeiss Imager.Z2 light microscope  with an AxioCamMRm digital camera. The morphology and  quantity of rhabdomeres, endosomes, and lysosomes were  determined in Image J.  ERGs ERG recordings were performed as described [6]. Briefly, adult  flies were glued to a glass slide, a recording probe was placed on  the surface of the eye, and a reference probe was inserted in the  thorax. A 1-s flash of white light was given, and the response was  recorded and analyzed using the AXON TM  -pCLAMPH8 software.  Mouse Retina cDNA Preparation and Northern Blot Analysis  Mouse retina cDNA was prepared as described [135]. vps26A  was PCR-amplified using primers 59-GAGTTTTCTTGGAGG-  CTTTTTTGGTCC-39 and 59-TTACATCTCAGGCTGCTC-  CGCAGAGG-39 and a 30 ng cDNA template. The PCR product  was cloned into pBluescript by blunt-end ligation and verified by  sequencing. DNA probes were generated from gel-purified insert  (excised with EcoRI and HindIII) by random-prime labeling with  [a- 32  P]dCTP using the DECAprimeII kit (Ambion). Unincorpo-  rated nucleotides were removed with a MicroBio-Spin 30 column  (Bio-Rad).  For Northern blot analysis, total RNA was prepared from  retinas of 3-4-mo-old CD-1 mice by homogenization in TRI  reagent (Ambion) using a motorized pestle and passage  through a 20-gauge needle, extraction with 1-bromo-3-  chloro-propane, and purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).  We resolved 10 mg of total RNA on a formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred it to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (GE Healthcare) by capillary transfer. Membranes were prehybrid-  ized in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) for 1 h, then incubated at 42uC overnight with a ,2.56107 cpm denatured probe diluted in ULTRAhyb. Blots were washed several times in 26SSC+0.1% SDS and several times in 0.16 SSC+0.1% SDS. Washes were performed at 42-45uC. For imaging, blots were exposed to a storage phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon (GE  Healthcare).

The cornea and lens were removed, and eyecups were  embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek) and flash-frozen. Cryosectioned  retina were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in 16PBS for 10 min and stained with the indicated antibodies: chicken anti-b-GAL (abcam, 1:1,000) and rabbit a-melanopsin (Advanced Targeting Systems, 1:5,000). Alexa 488- or Cy3-conjugated secondary  antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:600) were used for  immunostaining. Images were captured using the Zeiss LSM  710 confocal microscope and analyzed using the Image J software.  Statistical Analysis Two-tailed Student's t test was used to analyze experimental  results.  Supporting Information  Figure S1 Vps26 2  mutants exhibit light-dependent PR degener-  ation.

(B) Adult mosaic  eyes of control (iso), Vps26 1 , and Vps26  2 mosaic mutant eyes  generated by ey-FLP in a cell lethal (cl) background. White regions  mark mutant tissues in the Vps26 alleles. Similar to control, Vps26  mutants exhibit large clones with normal gross eye morphology.  (C) ERG traces of Vps26 2  mosaic eyes at day 0, kept in LD (light  intensity = 1,800 lux) for 2, 10, and 21 d; Vps26 2  rescued by the  Vps26-gEGFP genomic rescue construct kept in LD for 21 d; and  Vps26 2  kept in DD for 21 d. The UAS-w RNAi is expressed in the  rescued animals. On- and off-transients disappear and the  amplitude decreases upon 2 d in LD, but remain unchanged  upon keeping the flies in DD for 3 wk. The loss of on- and off-  transients and reduced depolarization can be fully rescued by the  Vps26-gEGFP genomic construct. (D) Bright field sections of Vps26 2  and rescued Vps26 2  flies kept in LD for the indicated periods, or  Vps26 2  kept in DD for 21 d. Newly eclosed Vps26 2  mutants are  mostly normal. The UAS-w RNAi is expressed in the rescued flies.  The PRs of Vps26 2  are severely impaired after 21 d in LD but  remain largely intact in DD. The Vps26-gEGFP rescue construct  rescues the PR degeneration of Vps26 2  mutants. Scale bar, 2 mm. (E) Quantification of intact rhabdomere numbers in (D).

(TIF)  Figure S2 Characterization of Vps26 mutant alleles and the  subcellular localization of fly Vps26 protein in vivo. (A) Mutations  in the XE52 alleles mapped to a 21 kb genomic region by  deficiency and duplication mapping. The Vps26 gene was tagged  with EGFP at the C-terminus of Vps26 in a 20 kb P[acman]  genomic rescue construct (CH322-92A18; green) [132,133]. (B)  Lethal staging and rescue of Vps26 mutant alleles. Vps26 mutants  die at pupal stages and fail to complement the P{EP}Vps26 G2008  allele. The Vps26-gEGFP genomic construct and ubiquitously  expressed fly Vps26 full-length cDNA rescue the lethality of both  alleles. (C) Wingless signaling is impaired in Vps26 1  mutants.  Vps26 1  mutant clones were generated in wing imaginal discs of the  third instar larvae using hh-GAL4 to drive UAS-FLP. Immuno-  staining of Wg and Sens were performed to measure Wingless  signaling capacity. GFP marks wild-type control tissue. In Vps26 1  clones, Wg accumulates in the Wg-producing cells, and neighbor-  ing Sens expression is lost. (D) Immunostaining of Vps26 protein  in mosaic wing discs of third instar larvae using an anti-fly Vps26  polyclonal antibody shows that it specifically recognizes Vps26.  The Vps26 1  mutant clones are generated in the posterior wing disc  using hh-GAL4 and UAS-FLP. Wild-type control cells are marked  with GFP. The antibody recognizes Vps26 punctae in the  cytoplasm of wild-type cells, but no signal is observed in mutant  cells. Scale bar, 10 mm. (E) Immunostaining of anti-Vps26 and anti-GFP in wing imaginal discs of third instar Vps26-gEGFP  transgenic animals.

Both dark-  reared control and Vps26 1  mutant PRs exhibit a normal Rh1  distribution in the rhabdomeres (top panels). Upon 12-h light  exposure, both genotypes show increased Rh1 punctae in the PR  cell body (arrowheads in the middle panels). Upon a 6-h recovery  in the dark, more Rh1 punctae were observed in the cell body of  Vps26 1  PRs when compared to controls (bottom panels). Scale bar,  4 mm.
