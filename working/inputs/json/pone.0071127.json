    "summary": "The POU5F1 gene codes for the OCT4 transcription factor, which is one of the key regulators of pluripotency. Its transcription, alternative splicing, and alternative translation leading to the synthesis of the active, nuclear localized OCT4A has been described in detail. Much less, however, is known about actively transcribed OCT4 pseudogenes, several of which display high homology to OCT4A and can be expressed and translated into proteins. Using RT-PCR followed by pseudogene-specific restriction digestion, cloning, and sequencing we discriminate between OCT4A and transcripts for pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4. We show that expression of OCT4 and its pseudogenes follows a developmentally-regulated pattern in differentiating hESCs, indicating a tight regulatory relationship between them. We further demonstrate that differentiated human cells from a variety of tissues express exclusively pseudogenes. Expression of OCT4A can, however be triggered in adult differentiated cells by oxygen and FGF2-dependent mechanisms.",

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a key role in cellular stress. We hypothesized that placental expression of the small HSP 27 would be altered during labor and expression would vary in different regions of the placenta. Six women in labor who delivered vaginally and 6 women not in labor, who were delivered by Cesarean section, were recruited. Four equally spaced pieces were sampled from the inner, middle and outer regions of each placenta (total 12 samples per placenta). HSP 27 expression was investigated by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. For non-labor, there was less HSP 27 protein in the inner placenta region compared with both the middle region (p,0.05) and outer region (p,0.05). For labor, there was also less HSP 27 protein in the inner region compared with both the middle (p,0.02) and outer region (p,0.01). When the 3 regions of the placenta were compared for non-labor versus labor there was less HSP 27 in the labor group at both the inner (p,0.05) and middle regions (p,0.005) compared to non-labor. Similar to HSP 27 protein, there was less HSP 27 mRNA in the labor group in both the inner region (p,0.05) and middle region (p,0.02) compared to non-labor. This study suggests that placental HSP 27 may play a role in labor and is spatially controlled. The results have important implications for how data obtained from studies in the placenta can be influenced by sampling methods.

When the production of reactive oxygen species overwhelms the  intrinsic anti-oxidant defenses oxidative stress occurs. It can induce  a range of cellular responses depending upon how severe the insult  is and the cellular compartment in which reactive oxidative species  are generated [4,5].  The contractions that occur during labor are associated with  intermittent utero-placental perfusion and could lead to an  ischemia-reperfusion type injury to the placenta. Indeed Doppler  ultrasound studies have demonstrated a linear inverse relationship  between uterine artery resistance and the intensity of the uterine  contractions during labor [6]. Labor is also associated with placental  alterations in several pathways linked to oxidative stress [7].  Heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins expressed  by all cells. They have many important physiological functions,  one of the most important being to help cells to cope with stressful  situations. Some HSPs are expressed constitutively while others  are induced by a range of damaging insults including heat shock,  ischemia, hypoxia, oxidative stress and physical injury [8]. HSPs  are named according to their molecular weight. HSP 27 belongs to  the family of small heat shock proteins (15-30 kDa). In response to  stress, changes in expression of HSP 27 occurs and, like many  proteins, HSP 27 function can also be regulated by at the post-  translational level [9]. The functions of HSP 27 include protein  chaperone, control of apoptosis, regulation of cell glutathione  levels, inhibition of actin polymerisation as well as protection  against heat shock, oxidative stress and mechanical stress [9]. HSP  27 also plays a role in atherosclerosis [10], in regulation of cytokine  production from monocytes as well as expression of toll-like  receptors [11].  Since HSP 27 plays a role in oxidative stress and inflammation,  both features of labor, we hypothesised that HSP 27 expression  would alter during labor in the placenta. Thus the aim of this study  was to examine the spatial expression of HSP 27 in placentae  obtained from women who delivered by cesarean section and were  not in labor and secondly to compare the expression of each zone  with the equivalent zone of placentas obtained from women who  delivered vaginally following an uncomplicated labor.  Materials and Methods  Subjects Human term placentae were collected from pregnant women at  the Southern General Hospital, Glasgow. All ethics protocols were  followed as per Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by  \u2018\u2018Yorkhill ethics committee''. Signed patient consent was obtained  prior to delivery. Patients were handed an information sheet telling  them about the study before being handed the consent sheet. The  information and consent sheets were also approved by the ethics  committee. All signed consent sheets were stored incase of the need  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71127    for audit. Placentae were collected from: (i) women who had  uncomplicated pregnancies and delivered at term either vaginally  (labor group, n = 6) or by caesarean section (non-labor group, n = 6).  The labor group were all spontaneous labor and were a tight group  (labor time minimum 3 hours maximum 8 hours). All placentae  were free of infection, confirmed by the pathology report of every  placenta. The non-labor were group were all definitely without  labor. All were planned Caesarean sections performed for obstetric  reasons: breach presentation (2) previous caesarean section (2) or  maternal request (2). The groups studied had no underlying  maternal conditions such as hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes  or gestational diabetes or any other medical disorders. There was no  fetal pathology such as fetal growth restriction. The details of  patients recruited are shown in Table 1.  Sample Collection For each patient (6 patients per group), placental samples  (,1 cm3) were obtained from three sites by taking measurements from the cord insertion point: inner third closest to cord insertion  point (inner zone), middle of placenta (middle zone) and outer third  of placenta (outer zone) of placenta. Within each zone four separate  samples were obtained representing the four quadrants (Figure 1).  Placentae had a central cord insertion. Samples were rinsed and  immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For this study we had  performed a power analysis using G*Power 3.1 for Macintosh and  based the numbers on our previous published work [12].  Chemicals All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (U.K.) unless  stated otherwise.  Tissue Homogenizing For Western Blot Samples were recovered from storage at 270uC and ground in  liquid nitrogen to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Tissues  was homogenised in the presence of protease inhibitors as  described previously [12]. Placenta homogenates were spun at  5000 g for 10 minutes at 4uC to remove debris then supernatants were collected and divided into aliquots and stored at 270uC. Protein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis  using bovine serum albumin as a standard.  Western Blotting Western blotting was performed as described previously [12] with  some modifications. A volume corresponding to 50 mg of each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on 10%  sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide resolving gels. Pre-stained  low range molecular weight markers (BioRad) were loaded onto  each gel. Transfer of proteins to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose  membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out at 22V  and 200 mA for 30 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% donkey  serum (Serotec) in TBSTB buffer (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 0.5 M  NaCl, 0.4% Tween and 0.25% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at  room temperature (RT). Primary antibodies were pre-absorbed in  5% human serum in TBSTB at RT during the blocking process.  Membranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with primary antibody  solution. The HSP 27 (mouse monoclonal antibody) was obtained  from Cell Signalling TechnologyH (number 2402) and used at concentration of 1:1000. Membranes were washed and then  incubated for 1 h at RT with horseradish peroxidase conjugated  donkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Abcam (ab6820) diluted  1:1000 in TBSTB. Membranes were rinsed with TBSTB (265 min) and once with distilled water. The same samples were exposed to ab- actin antibody (Sigma) to confirm even protein loading as shown  previously [12]. Immunologically reactive proteins were visualised  and quantified as described previously [12]. A standard curve was  performed for different blot exposures and densitometry was  performed when bands were on the linear part of the loading graph  as described previously [12]. For each group of experiments the  same loading control placenta sample was added to every gel and the  densitometry units were normalized to that. We previously  confirmed that this method of analysis gives similar findings to  other quantitative methods of densitometry [12]. Statistical analysis  was performed using MiniTab on a PC using analysis of variance.  Comparison of groups was performed by the Mann Whitney test.  Graphs show median values along with mean absolute deviation  range, a robust measure of the variability of the data.  Quantitative Rt-Pcr Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasyH Midi Kit (Qiagen,  75142). RNA (100ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Buffers  and primers were obtained from the QuantiTectH Kit (Qiagen, 205310) and GoScript  TM reverse transcriptase from Promega  (A501C). HSP 27 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using  validated TaqManH Gene Expression assays with StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems). b-actin was used as an endogenous control. A positive control human placenta cDNA (Primer design) was  Table 1. Demographics of patients used for placenta collection.

The relative target gene levels were calculated by  comparative CT (DDCT). Statistical analysis was performed as described above.  Results  Table 1 shows the demographics of the patients.  Western Blotting The first set of experiments was designed to test whether there  was a difference in HSP 27 expression within an individual  placenta in either labor or non-labor. Figure 2 shows HSP 27  expression in the four zones of the inner, middle and outer area  sampled from the cord insertion point. The upper panel shows a  placenta obtained from a non-laboring caesarean section delivery.  The bottom panel shows a placenta obtained from a women who  was in labor and delivered vaginally. Figure 3 shows the combined  analysis of all the placentae for either non-labor (upper graph) or  labor (lower graph). Overall there was a significant difference  between the 3 areas of the placenta for both the non-labor group  and labor group (ANOVA p,0.05). For the non-labor group there  was less HSP 27 in the inner compared with both the middle  (p,0.05) and outer area (p,0.05). For the labor group there was  also less HSP 27 in both the inner compared with the middle  (p,0.02) and outer area (p,0.01). Thus HSP 27 is expressed in a  spatial manner within the placenta and the distribution patterns  are similar in labor and non-labor.  The next set of experiments was designed to test whether there  was a difference in HSP 27 expression between labor and non-  labor groups for each of the three sites. Figure 4 shows one  representative blot of non-labor versus labor for each of the three  different areas of the placenta (upper panel; inner, middle panel;  middle and lower panel; outer). Each of the 3 blots were  performed on separate days so only labor with non-labor can be  compared for this. Figure 5 shows the combined analysis for each  of the three groups. Overall there was a significant difference  between the 3 areas of the placenta when comparing each non-  labor group and labor group in each zone (ANOVA p,0.05).  When individual zones were compared there was less HSP 27 in  the labor group at both the inner (p,0.05) and middle zones  (p,0.005).  The final set of experiments was to determine whether the  protein changes found in Figure 5 were reflected by changes at the  mRNA level. The results are shown in Figure 6. As for HSP 27  protein there was less HSP 27 mRNA in the labor group in both  the inner zone (p,0.05) and middle zone (p,0.02).  Discussion  This study shows for the first time that HSP 27 is expressed in a  spatial manner in the placenta with the highest expression being in  the 2-4 cm (middle) area in both labour and non-labour groups.

Most previous reports of placental protein  expression do not take this into account. Taking a single or a few  samples or averaging protein expression of several samples may  well mask possible changes in expression. The study also shows  that HSP 27 protein and mRNA are reduced during labor at  defined zones. Apart from the reported changes and their link to  placental pathology the results have important implications for  how results in placental disease (and perhaps other organs) can be  influenced by sampling methods.  The key finding of this study was the fall in both HSP 27 mRNA  and protein at the inner and middle zones of the placenta during  labor and which was particularly striking in the middle zone.  Many HSPs are increased to protect against stress in disease states  [13] however in the present study HSP 27 was reduced. One  reason for this may be that a fall in HSP 27 may be necessary to  facilitate the inflammatory steps of labor which is, after all, a  normal physiological process, not a disease. HSP27 protects  against apoptosis, decreases oxidative stress, reduces the pro-  inflammatory cytokine balance, stabilizes actin, and inhibits NFkB activation [13] but during labor the opposite effect of these events  needs to occur.  Previous publications of HSP 27 expression in the placenta are  few. One study examined the expression of HSP 27 in placenta in  labor and non-labor [7]. A different approach was taken: since  different regions of the placenta were not compared, it is  impossible to directly compare the present study with that one.  In another study HSP 27 was reported to be unaltered in the  placenta in samples from labor and non-labor. However only one  biopsy was taken from each placenta and no quantification  analysis was performed or presented [14].  Figure 5.

HSP27 can be  phosphorylated at serine 15, 78 and 82 by MAPKAPK-2 and 3  [13]. Phosphorylation favours small oligomers to form whereas de-  phosphorylation favours formation of large oligomer [13]. Small  and large forms may have different functions for example larger  forms are important in chaperone and anti-oxidant roles whereas  smaller forms are important in actin regulation [13]. The HSP 27  gene contains two functional HSE binding sites, a cAMP response  element as well as HSF-1 and 2 binding sites [13]. In view of the  findings of this study future studies will be directed to understand  whether any changes in phosphorylation of HSP 27 or  MAPKAPK-2 or 3 occurs at defined zones during labor.  We have previously examined the expression of HSP 70 in the  placenta [12]. In non-labor HSP 70 was reduced in the outer area  of the placenta compared with the middle area. In contrast in the  present study HSP 27 was reduced in the inner and middle areas  compared with the outer area. With regard to labor our previous  study showed that HSP 70 was increased in the inner and middle  areas, the opposite of the findings for HSP 27. At this stage it is  only possible to speculate why such zonal differences exist but may  relate to the functions of HSP 27 and 70, some of which differ and  some overlap. Placental separation is an important part of labor.  Herman et al [15] showed that the process of placental separation  from the uterine wall can be divided into three distinct phases i.e  latent, contraction/detachment and expulsion. They showed that  placental separation is accomplished by means of an orderly  multiphasic process with a definite direction and sequence. They  found in most cases the placenta separated from the uterine wall in  a \u2018\u2018down-up'' separation i.e initiating from the lower pole.  Interestingly cases with a previous Cesarean section had a higher  rate of up-down separation. In contrast in the case of \u2018\u2018fundal  placentae'' separation started at the placental poles (bipolar  separation) and the central area of the placenta was the last to  separate. It would be therefore of interest in a future study to  investigate whether there was a link between the zonal distribution  of HSP 27 or HSP 70 and the method of placental separation.  Placentas collected at term by cesarean section are not subjected  to the stress of labor however one possibility is that zonal  differences in HSPs might reflect the fact that labor is not far off  and that the molecular steps to allow labor to proceed have  started. Thus it would be interesting to compare placentas from  the second trimester where labor is not close to determine if such  zonal differences still exist. In contrast at labor zonal differences in  HSPs may be linked to the response to the stress of labor, extent of  exposure to hypoxia or may contribute to the process that allows  the placenta to separate at delivery.  Wataba et al [16] showed that HSP 27 and 70 were increased in  syncytial knots, avascular villi and the presence of thrombus  whereas both were reduced in the presence of infarction suggesting  different stresses evoke different responses in HSPs in the placenta  and the response may very depending on the area of the placenta  exposed to the stress. It has been shown that HSP 27 regulates  apoptosis through key components of the apoptotic signalling  pathway, in particular, those involved in caspase activation and  apoptosis [17]. HSP 70 can also inhibit caspase 3 and 9 [18]. HSP  70, via the TLR-2 receptor, can increase IL-10 production; IL-10  can be pro-inflammatory at labor which may accelerate parturi-  tion [19]. This may also explain why HSP 70 increases at labor  when HSP 27 decreases. Of interest is the observation that  reduced matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity has been shown to be  linked to reduced HSP 27 [20]. Whether this is linked to the zonal  distribution requires further investigation. The expression of HSP  27 was also reported to be reduced in placentae from SGA  neonates although zonal distribution was not investigated [21].  Small HSPs have been studied in myometrium during labor.  The myometrium undergoes substantial remodeling at the time of  labor including rearrangement of the cellular contractile machin-  ery. Since HSP 27 can modulate actin polymerisation one study  investigated changes in small HSPs in the myometrium at labor  [22]. A 69% decrease in the small HSP aB-crystallin was found in the myometrium at labor plus multiple isoforms of HSP 27.  Immunoblotting using phosphospecific HSP 27 antibodies (HSP  27-serine15, 278, and 282) detected marked changes in HSP 27  phosphorylation at labor. HSP 27-Ser15 was 3.0-fold higher in  laboring myometrium. In contrast, levels of HSP 27-Ser82 were  85% less in laboring myometrium. There was no significant  change in HSP 27-Ser78. It was proposed that decreased  expression of aB-crystallin at the time of labor liberates HSP 27 enabling it to participate in other cellular events such as  cytoskeletal remodeling. Clearly the functions and structure of  the myometrium and placenta are different, however since both  play a role in labor future work should investigate the expression of  aB-crystallin within the placenta during labor. Also that particular study highlights how different changes in HSP 27 can occur  depending on the cellular event to be targeted. In summary HSP  27 is expressed in a spatial manner in the human placenta and  changes in expression occur during labor suggest that HSP 27 may  be part of the signaling process of labor and thus warrants further  investigation particularly with regard to a role on pre-term labor.
