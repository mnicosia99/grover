Decursin (D), purified from Angelica gigas Nakai, has been proven to exert neuroprotective property. Previous study revealed that D reduced A\ud835\udefd  25\u221235 -induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Our study explored the underlying mechanisms by which D mediates its  therapeutic effects in vitro. Pretreatment of cells with D diminished intracellular generation of ROS in response to A\ud835\udefd 25\u221235  . Western blot revealed that D significantly increased the expression and activity of HO-1, which was correlated with its protection against A\ud835\udefd 25\u221235  -induced injury. Addition of ZnPP, an HO-1 competitive inhibitor, significantly attenuated its protective effect in A\ud835\udefd 25\u221235  - treated cells, indicating the vital role of HO-1 resistance to oxidative injury. Moreover, D induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, the upstream of HO-1 expression. While investigating the signaling pathways responsible for HO-1 induction, D activated ERK and dephosphorylated p38 in PC12 cells. Addition of U0126, a selective inhibitor of ERK, blocked D-induced Nrf2 activation and HO- 1 induction and meanwhile reversed the protection of D against A\ud835\udefd  25\u221235 -induced cell death. These findings suggest D augments  cellular antioxidant defense capacity through both intrinsic free radical scavenging activity and activation ofMAPK signal pathways that leads to Nrf2 activation, and subsequently HO-1 induction, thereby protecting the PC12 cells from A\ud835\udefd  25\u221235 -induced oxidative  cytotoxicity.  1. Introduction  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of senile dementia, affecting millions of people worldwide. It is an age-related neurodegenerative disease pathologically characterized by deposition of senile plaques, intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), and loss of neurons in the brain. Amyloid \ud835\udefd-peptide (A\ud835\udefd), a 39- to 43-amino acid peptide fragment derived from an amyloid precursor protein via a sequential cleavage by \ud835\udefd- and \ud835\udefe-secretases, is the major component of senile plaques and is considered to be tightly related to the development and progress of AD. Extensive evidence indicates that the brains of individuals with AD are characterized by exaggerated oxidative stress [1- 8], and the overproduction of A\ud835\udefd leads to A\ud835\udefd-associated free  radical production and cell death [9-13]. Not only does A\ud835\udefd increase oxidative stress, but its generation is also increased as a result of oxidative stress, which in turn causes more oxidative damage. Given the important role of oxidative stress in AD, therapeutic strategies which are directed at early interventions targeted at oxidative stress may be effective in delaying AD development and slowing its progression. Indeed, increased antioxidant activity confers protection and has been reported to lower the risk of AD [14]. Thus, an approach which simultaneously enhances various intracel- lular oxidative defense capacities may be more effective in combating neurodegeneration.  Among the various cytoprotective enzymes, heme oxyge- nase (HO)has received considerable attention,which consists of three isoforms: HO-1, HO-2, and HO-3. Although HO-2    2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine  and HO-3 are constitutively expressed, HO-1 is inducible in many cell types, such as neuronal cells [15, 16]. HO-1 is one of themajor antioxidant/cytoprotective enzymes that are readily induced in response to oxidative stress. HO-1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the heme degradation process, releasing iron, carbonmonoxide (CO), and biliverdin.The antioxidant potential of HO-1-generated metabolic products highlights theHO-1 pathway as a therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention of various diseases including neurological dis- orders [17-19]. The induction of HO-1 resulted in a relatively higher resistance to glutamate- andH  2 O 2 -mediated oxidative  damage and MPTP- or A\ud835\udefd-induced neurotoxicity [20-23]. Transcriptional regulation of the ho-1 gene is linked to the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor (Nrf2), which plays a crucial role in cellular defense. Nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that resides in the cytoplasm bound to its inhibitor protein, Keap1, and translocated to the nucleus after stimulation. It then binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) sequences in the promoter regions of cluster of antioxidant/detoxifying genes, such as ho-1 [24- 26]. Activation of Nrf2 pathway has been demonstrated to be involved in the protection of the nerve cells against oxidative damage in vivo and in vitro [27-29]. Neurons lacking Nrf2 are highly sensitive to oxidative stress but can be rescued by transfection with a functional Nrf2 construct [30]. In addition, activation of theNrf2/ARE pathway in astrocytes by tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ), an Nrf2 activity inducer, is able to protect neurons from subsequent oxidative stress [31].  To date, multiple signaling kinases related to cell sur- vival/proliferation have been reported to regulate the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and protein kinase C (PKC) [32-34]. MAPK is one of the most common signaling pathways that serve to coordinate the cellular response to a variety of extracellular stimuli.These are well characterized inmammals and include c-JunN-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAP kinase (p38), and mitogenic signal- ing, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK). Several members of MAPK family are implicated in neurodegenera- tive processes [35] and its activation also modulates several gene and protein expressions, such as that of HO-1 [36, 37].  Thus, in light of the cytoprotective role of HO-1, the specific activation of Nrf2 and upregulation of HO-1 gene expression by pharmacological modulation may represent a novel target form therapeutic intervention of AD. Angelica gigasNakai (Umbelliferae) root is used in traditional oriental herbal medicine to treat female afflictions and is regarded by herbalists as female ginseng for its hemopoietic and health- promoting activities [38]. Decursin (D) is a pyranocoumarin which is the major active ingredient present in Angelica gigas Nakai. Reported in vivo and in vitro studies indicated that D possesses anticancer [39-43], antibacterial [44], antiplatelet aggregation [45], antinematodal activities [46], and antiox- idant activities [47] properties. Growing bodies of evidence have supported the fact that D exhibits potent neuropro- tective activity against glutamate-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of rat cortical cells [48] and greatly improves scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice [49, 50]. Our previ- ously study indicated that D increases cellular resistance to  A\ud835\udefd-induced oxidative injury in the rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, presumably through not only the induction of Nrf2 and related antioxidant enzymes, but also the antiag- gregation of A\ud835\udefd [51]. However, the upstream signaling and the detailed molecular mechanisms by which D exerts its neuroprotective effects in vivo remain largely unresolved. To gain a further insight into the biological roles of D, we attempt, in this study, to elucidate the correlation between its neuroprotection effect andHO-1 production.We designed an experiment to investigate whether the D-induced HO-1 expression is associated with the activation of MAPKs/Nrf2 in PC12 cells following treatment with A\ud835\udefd as an in vitro model.  2. Materials and Methods  2.1. Materials. Amyloid beta-protein (25-35) trifluoroacetate salt (A\ud835\udefd  25-35) was provided by Bachem California (Tor- rance, CA). RPMI+GlutaMAX-l, penicillin-streptomycin, fetal bovine serum (FBS), and horse serum (HS) were purchased from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY). BCA protein assay kit was purchased fromThermo Fisher Scientific (Bar- rington, IL). The assay kit for cytotoxicity (WST-8) was sup- plied by CaymanChemical Company (AnnArbor,MI). Lipid peroxidation colorimetric assay kitwas obtained fromOxford Biochemical Research (Rochester Hills, MI). SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), SP600125 (JNK inhibitor), and Protoporphyrin IX zinc (II) (Znpp, HO-1 Inhibitor) were obtained from Sigma- Aldrich, Inc. (St. Louis, MO). Antibodies to Nrf2 (C-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); phosphor- SAPK/JNK rabbit mAb, phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) rabbit mAb, phosphor-p38 MAP kinase rabbit mAb, HO- 1 (P249) rabbit mAb, glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehy- drogenase (GAPDH) rabbit mAb, anti-rabbit IgG alkaline- phosphatase- (AP-) linked antibodies, and U0126 (ERK inhibitor) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). All the other reagents were of the highest grade and were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), unless otherwise indicated.  2.2. Preparation of Decursin. Dwas prepared by Dr. Kim's lab in theDepartment of Smart Foods andDrugs, InjeUniversity, as described previously [52]. Briefly, dried and powdered root of A. gigasNakai (1 kg) was extracted with 5 L of 95% ethanol for 24 h at room temperature. Extracts were filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and were concentrated using a rotary evaporator (R-200, Bu\u0308chi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland) under reduced pressure, and 50 g A. gigasNakai ethanol extract (AGNEX) was obtained. D was purified from AGNEX using recycling preparative HPLC (LC-9104, JAI, Tokyo, Japan). The AGNEX (20 g) was dissolved in 30mL of 70% acetonitrile/water and filtered with a 0.45\ud835\udf07mmembrane filter. 3mL of sample was injected to the JAIGEL ODS-AP column (20 \u00d7 500mm, JAI) at a flow rate of 4mL/min. Isocratic elution was applied using 70% acetonitrile/water as the mobile phase, and the peaks were detected using an RI and UV/Vis detector at 328 nm. Finally, 5.3 g of D was obtained.    Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3  2.3. Preparation of A\ud835\udefd 25-35 Stock Solution. A\ud835\udefd25-35, the most  toxic peptide fragment derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), was dissolved in deionized distilled water at a concentration of 1mM and was incubated in 37\u2218C for 3 d to induce maximal aggregation according to the previous report [53]. In order to create stable conditions for the aged stock solution, the solutionwas stored at\u221280\u2218Cand diluted in serum-free medium to desired concentrations immediately before use.  2.4. Cell Culture. The rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell line kindly provided byDr. Kam (Inje University) wasmaintained in RPMI+GlutaMAX-l supplemented with 5% FBS, 10% HS, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin and cultured at 37\u2218C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO  2 . All cells were plated  in poly-L-lysine coated culture dishes. The medium was changed every other day, and the cells were plated at an appropriate density according to the scale of each experiment. After the 24 h subculture, cells were switched to serum-free medium for treatment.  2.5. Assay for Cell Viability. The cell viability was assessed by the WST-8 cell proliferation assay kit according to the man- ufacturer's instructions (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, PC12 cells were seeded in 96-well cul- ture plates. After incubation, the media were supplemented with 10 \ud835\udf07L/well WST for 2 h prior to spectrophotometric evaluation. Conversion of WST to formazan was measured at 450 nm by fluorescence multidetection reader (Synergy HT, Biotek, Highland Park, IL). This reaction reflects the reductive capacity of the cells, representing the viability of the cells, and the results were expressed as the percentage of control (untreated) cells. Decreased WST reduction was taken as an indication of neuronal cell injury.  2.6. Assay of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species. ROS pro- duction in PC12 cells was measured using the redox-sensitive fluorescent dyeH  2 DCF-DA. Briefly, PC12 cells were seeded in  96-well plates, following treatment, the cells were loadedwith 10 \ud835\udf07MH  2 DCF-DA at 37\u2218C for 30min in the dark and then  washed twice with PBS, and finally, the fluorescence intensity was measured at the excitation wavelength of 485 nm and the emission wavelength of 530 nm using a fluorescence microplate reader (Synergy HT, Biotek, Highland Park, IL). Data were analyzed and expressed as a percentage of the control.  2.7. Assay of HO Activity. The HO activity was measured by spectrophotometric determination of bilirubin formation according to the previously described procedures. Briefly, microsomes obtained from harvested cells were added to a reaction mixture (1mL final volume, pH 7.4) contain- ing NADPH, bilirubin reductase from rat liver cytosol, and the substrate hemin. The reaction was conducted at 37\u2218C in the dark for 1 h, terminated by the addition of 1mL of chloroform, and the extracted bilirubin was mea- sured by the difference in absorbance between 464 and 530 nm.  2.8. Nuclear and Cytosolic Lysate Preparation. Cells were treated with various chemicals, as detailed in the figure legends. Nuclear extracts were prepared with a commercial kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). All steps were carried out on ice or at 4\u2218C unless stated otherwise. Protease inhibitors (10 \ud835\udf07g/mL aprotinin, 10 \ud835\udf07g/mL leupeptin) and a reducing agent (1mM dithiothreitol, 1mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl fluoride) were added to each buffer just prior to use. Briefly, cells were incubated in 5 vol of hypotonic buffer A (20mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5mM MgCl  2 , and 10mMKCl) on ice for 15min  and homogenized. Nuclei were recovered by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7g for 15min, and the supernatant was kept as the cytoplasmic extract. The nuclei were washed once using nuclei wash buffer (10mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.2mM MgCl  2 ,  and 10mM KCl) and extracted for 30min on ice in buffer C (20mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420mM NaCl, 0.2mM EDTA, and 1.5mM MgCl  2 ). Insoluble material was  removed by centrifugation at 21,000\u00d7g for 10min. The supernatant was used as the nuclear extract. All the protein fractions were stored at \u221270\u2218C until use, and the protein concentrations were measured with a BCA protein assay kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Barrington, IL).  2.9. Western Blot Analysis. Western blot was performed by the standard method. Equal amounts of proteins were fractionated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred to an Immun-Blot PVDF membrane (0.2 \ud835\udf07M pore size, Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked overnight at 4\u2218C in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20, 150mM NaCl, and 5% (w/v) bovine serum Albumin (BSA, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by 2 h incubation with primary antibody diluted in the same buffer (Nrf2 1 : 250, HO-1 1 : 1000, phosphor-p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/2) 1 : 1000, phosphor-SAPK/JNK 1 : 1000, phosphor-p38 MAPK 1 : 1000, and GAPDH 1 : 1000). After washing with 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 in TBS, the membrane was incubated with anti-rabbit IgG AP-linked secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature and then washed with the same buffer. The immunoblotted membrane was developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl phosphate (BCIP)/nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) color-developing solution. The blots in the samples were quantified by densitometry analysis using PDQuest software (version 7.0, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). All data from three independent experiments were expressed as the relative intensity compared to the control group for the statistical analyses.  2.10. DPPH-Scavenging Capacities. D and \ud835\udefc-tocopherol were evaluated for their activities to scavenge the stable DPPH radical according to a previously described method. The affinity of the test material to quench the DPPH free radical was evaluated according to the equation scavenging % = (Ac \u2212As)/Ac \u00d7 100%. As and Ac are the absorbance at 517 nm of the reactionmixture with sample and control, respectively.  2.11. Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) Analysis.

This mixture has to remain for 12-24 h until the reaction is complete and the absorbance is stable. For mea- surement, the ABTS\u2219+ solution was diluted to an absorbance of 0.700 \u00b1 0.020 at 734 nm. 1mL ABTS\u2219+ solution and 100 \ud835\udf07L of the antioxidant solution were mixed for 45 s and the absorbance at 734 nmwas recorded after 1min of incubation. TEAC is defined as the concentration (mM) of Trolox having the antioxidant activity equivalent to a 1.0mM concentration of D.  2.12. Statistical Analysis. Data bars represent the means \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) for at least three independent experi- ments in all cases. Two group comparisons were evaluated by student's \ud835\udc61-tests as appropriate. Differences were considered statistically significant when \ud835\udc43 value was <0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Effect of D on Cell Viability of PC12 Cells. Initially, the cytotoxic potential of D on PC12 cells was measured. No cytotoxic effects of D were reported up to a concentration of 10 \ud835\udf07M, using the WST assay. However, higher amount D reduced the viability of the PC12 cells (Figure 1(a)). Thus, for further experiments, the cells were treated with D in the concentration range of 0.01-10\ud835\udf07M. Furthermore, 10\ud835\udf07M D treatment for 24, 48, and 72 h did not show any toxic effect on cultured PC12 cells (Figure 1(b)).  3.2. Effect of D on HO-1 Expression and HO Activity of PC12 Cells. As HO-1 is an important component of the cellular defense against oxidative stress, we assessed whether noncytotoxic concentrations (0.01-10 \ud835\udf07M) of D affected HO- 1 protein expression and HO activity. PC12 cells exposed to D for 24 h caused a dose-dependent increase in HO-1 expression (Figure 2(a)) and HO activity (Figure 2(c)). At a concentration of 10\ud835\udf07MD,HO-1 induction was evident at 3 h, peaked at around 6 h, and decreased after 12 h in PC12 cells (Figure 2(b)). Consistently, D-induced HO activity directly correlated with enhanced HO-1 protein level (Figure 2(d)).  3.3. Effect of D on A\ud835\udefd 25-35-Induced Cytotoxicity and Intra-  cellular ROS Generation in PC12 Cells. To evaluate the in vitro neuroprotective effect of D, we tested its protective effect on A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. PC12 cells were treated with various sub-lethal concentrations of D for 3 h, followed by further incubation for 24 h in the presence or the absence of A\ud835\udefd  25-35. Treatment with A\ud835\udefd25-35 (25 \ud835\udf07M) for 24 h induced approximately 40% cell death, whereas D, at non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.01-10\ud835\udf07M), resulted in marked enhancement of survival of the PC12 cells as compared to the A\ud835\udefd  25-35-treated group (Figure 3(a)). Maximal rescue occurred at a concentration of 10\ud835\udf07M of D. These results showed that A\ud835\udefd  25-35 treatment significantly reduced the viability of PC12 cells and that D blocked the injury caused by A\ud835\udefd  25-35. It has been reported that A\ud835\udefd impairs mitochondrial  redox activity and increases the generation of ROS [54- 56]. The degree of intracellular ROS generation in cells was measured using fluorescence assay with H  2 DCF-DA probe.  H 2 DCF-DA can be deacetylated in cells, where it can react  quantitatively with intracellular radicals, mainly H 2 O 2 , and  convert into its fluorescent products DCF, which are retained within the cell. Therefore, this assay provides an index of cell cytosolic oxidation. As shown in Figure 3(b), treatment with D significantly reduced the A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced ROS generation, indicating that D attenuates ROS production. Moreover, as shown in Figure 3(c), this effect was dependent on the dura- tion of D pretreatment. Thus, attenuation of ROS released by D required the presence of D at least 3 h prior to the addition of D.These results suggest that D induced the expression of a gene(s) essential to ROS antagonism.  3.4. Effect of HO-1 Expression on A\ud835\udefd 25-35-Induced Oxidative  Neurotoxicity Mediated by D in PC12 Cells. Recent reports have described the expression ofHO-1 as an adaptive andpro- tective response against oxidative insult in a wide variety of cells, such as PC12 cells. To test whether the protective effect of D is related to its inductive effect on HO-1 expression, we tried to block the activity of HO-1 using Znpp, the inhibitor of HO activity. As shown in Figure 4, D-induced HO-1    Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5  0.1  0  0.5  1  1.5  2  0 0.01 0.1 1 10  R el  at iv  e  O  D  (f  ol d   of  c  on tr  ol )  1010.010  (\ud835\udf07M)  HO-1  GAPDH  D (\ud835\udf07M)  \u2217  \u2217 \u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217  (a)  0  1  2  3  4  0 3 6 12 Time (h)  R el  at iv  e  O  D  (f  ol d   of  c  on tr  ol )  HO-1  GAPDH  0 3 6 12 (h)  D (10\ud835\udf07M)  \u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217  (b)  0  1  2  3  4  0 0.01 0.1 1 10  H O   a ct  iv ity  (n m  ol  o  f b ili  ru bi  n/ m  g  pr  ot ei  n/ h)  (\ud835\udf07M)  \u2217\u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217  \u2217  (c)  0  1  2  3  4  0 3 6 12 (h)  H O   a ct  iv ity  (n m  ol  o  f b ili  ru bi  n/ m  g  pr  ot ei  n/ h)  \u2217\u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217  \u2217  (d)  Figure 2: Effects of D onHO-1 expression andHOactivity in PC12 cells.

The HO-1 inducer CoPP showed comparable protection to D. ZnPP, abrogated the protective effect of D on A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced cytotoxicity, and partially reversed the inhibitory effects of D onROS production.These results suggest that the cytoprotective effect of D is mediated through HO-1 induction.  3.5. Effects of D on Nrf2 Nuclear Translocation in PC12 Cells. Several studies have reported that nuclear translocation of activated Nrf2 is an important upstream contributor to the mechanism of HO-1 expression. Therefore, we examined whether D could induce the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus in PC12 cells. Using Western blot analysis, we tested  the presence of Nrf2 proteins in nuclear compartments of PC12 cells. The cells were incubated with 10\ud835\udf07M D for 0, 1, 3, and 6 h. As shown in Figure 5(a), the nuclear fractions of D-treated PC12 cells showed a gradual increase in Nrf2 levels which was strongly correlated with the increase in HO-1 expression and HO-1 activity (Figure 2), whereas they were decreased concomitantly in the cytoplasmic fractions (Figure 5(b)).  3.6.

To further elucidate the upstream signaling pathway involved in D-mediated Nrf2 activation and HO-1 induction, we examined the effect of D on activation of MAPKs in PC12 cells. Cells were exposed to D, total protein was harvested, and then West- ern blots were performed using anti-phospho-JNK, ERK, and p38 antibodies. At a concentration of 10 \ud835\udf07M, which strongly induced the levels of HO-1, D caused prolonged ERK activation. As illustrated in Figure 6, phosphorylation of ERK was observed 0.5 h after D treatment and was sustained for up to 1 h after D treatment. In contrast, phosphorylation of p38 kinases was decreased. No changes in the expression of phospho-JNK protein were detected, verifying that similar amounts of proteinswere loaded in each lane.  Next, to address the role of MAPK in D-induced HO- 1 expression against A\ud835\udefd  25-35, we examined the effects of specific inhibitors of ERK (U0126), JNK (SP600125), and p38  (SB203580) on the levels ofHO-1 and cell viability, byWestern blot and WST assay. As shown in Figures 7(a) and 7(b), The U0126 significantly reduced D-induced HO-1 expression and activity. Likewise, D against A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced cell death was effectively abolished by U0126 (Figure 7(c)), whereas p38 inhibitor increased these items. The inhibitor of JNK did not show any changes at any of the tested time periods. Therefore, we suggested that D-induced expression of HO- 1 was mediated through ERK pathway phosphorylation and decreased p38 activation in the PC12 cells. U0126, SP600125, and SB203580 alone did not alter cell viability in control or A\ud835\udefd 25-35-treated cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we examined whether the MAPK pathway  was involved in D-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation. As shown in Figure 7(d), inhibitor of the ERK MAPK pathway blocked D-induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation; on the con- trary, p38 inhibitor facilitated the translocation ofNrf2.These results indicate a role for MAPK signaling in D-mediated HO-1 induction through nuclear translocation of Nrf2.

Effect of D on Free Radical Scavenging Activities. To eval- uate the antioxidant activity of D, we started by investigating its DPPH-scavenging actions. The DPPH stable free radical method is an easy, rapid, and sensitive way to survey the antioxidant activity of compounds or extracts. Figure 8(a) demonstrates that DPPH-scavenging potentials increased as the concentrations of D and \ud835\udefc-tocopherol increased. This result indicates that the antioxidant effect of D is similar to \ud835\udefc-tocopherol for trapping DPPH. The TEAC of D was further measured from the decolorization of ABTS\u2219+, which  was measured spectrophotometrically at 734 nm. Figure 8(b) shows that D has compatible antioxidant potential with positive control Trolox.  4.

In AD, oxidative stress is suspected to be generated by A\ud835\udefd [56]. Recent studies showed that there is a vicious circle among A\ud835\udefd production/accumulation and oxidative stress [61, 62]. Given the important role of oxidative stress in AD, ther- apeutic strategies which are directed at early interventions targeted at oxidative stress may be effective in delaying A\ud835\udefd development and slowing its progression. A feasible ways to prevent ROS-mediated cellular damage is to augment the intracellular oxidative defense capacity through dietary or pharmacological intake of antioxidants. Moreover, the  induction of endogenous phase II detoxifying enzymes or antioxidative proteins seems to be a reasonable strategy for delaying disease progression and the toxic effects associated with A\ud835\udefd-mediated cytotoxicity [63-66]. Indeed, increased cellular antioxidant activity confers protection and has been reported to lower the risk of AD [14].  Previous studies have revealed that D could increase cellular resistance to A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced oxidative injury in PC12 cells. However, themechanisms bywhichDmediates its therapeutic effects against A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced neuronal death in vitro remain an interesting speculation that awaits further investigation.

The extent and the rapidity of quenching the DPPH free radical and ABTS radical cation are the criteria commonly used to assess relative antioxidant capacity of flavonoid compared with standard antioxidants, \ud835\udefc-tocopherol, and Trolox [68, 69]. Current research demonstrates that D has compatible antioxidant potential with positive control, \ud835\udefc- tocopherol, and Trolox (Figure 8).

D possesses powerful antioxidant potency, which are consis- tent with the previous reports showing that D is an oxygen- free radical scavenger. This was also confirmed with our cell- based antioxidant assay in which D significantly reduced the basal intracellular level of ROS (Figure 3). A\ud835\udefd  25-35 caused a significant decrease in PC12 cell viability, and pretreatment cells with D concentration-dependently increased cell via- bility (Figure 4(a)). These results showed a clear and strong correlation among free radical-quenching activities, ROS scavenging activity, and the enhanced resistance to A\ud835\udefd  25-35- induced oxidative damage. As a consequence, the intrinsic antioxidant capacity may play a role for D, in contributing towards the partial or total alleviation of cellular oxidative stress.  HO-1, also known as heat-shock protein 32 (HSP 32) or inducible HO, is a 32-kDa protein transiently activated by a wide variety of noxious stimuli including oxidative stress. Upregulation of HO-1 leading to elevation of HO activity has been shown to provide neuroprotective effects by converting the prooxidant heme to biologically active antioxidant by-products such as biliverdin/bilirubin and also to heme inactivating carbon monoxide. The transgenic mice overexpression HO-1 in the brain attenuated neuronal cell injury caused by ischemic stroke [70]. HO-1 overexpressing cells derived from transgenic mice or the cells treated with a HO-1 inducer are relatively resistant to oxidative stress [20, 22]. Induction of HO-1 is highly recognized as an important therapeutic target for pharmacological intervention of oxida- tive disorders. It has been suggested that an elevation of HO-1 by various stimulimay be protective cellular response to delay the cell death. Therefore, we are interested in determining the potential role of HO-1 in the A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced PC12 cells damage and the D-mediated neuroprotection. We have provided evidence for the induction of HO-1 by D in PC12 cells and showed that D-induced HO-1 protein expression and HO activity occurred in a concentration- and time- dependent manner (Figure 2). Furthermore, the increase of HO-1 expression by D conferred cytoprotection against  A\ud835\udefd 25-35-induced oxidative stress (Figure 3). In addition, we  showed that ZnPP, a potent inhibitor of HO activity, can partially reverse the protective effects of D, thus providing further evidence for HO-1 as a possible cytoprotective path- way for D (Figure 4(a)). The induction of HO-1 expression was also required to suppress A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced ROS gener- ation (Figure 4(b)). These results strongly indicate that in our experimental setting, D may have multiple mechanisms of action that affect cytoprotection both by reducing ROS generation and boosting HO-1 induction for ROS detoxifica- tion.  The central sensor of intracellular oxidative stress is the cytosolic Keap1-Nrf2 complex. In response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 and transmits the stress signal to the nucleus for activation of distinct set of genes encod- ing phase II detoxifying enzymes as well as several stress responsive proteins including HO-1 [71, 72]. Recently, Nrf2- ARE signaling pathways have emerged as key therapeutic targets for treatment of a variety of oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative insults [73]. Nrf2-null mice resulted in a decrease in the basal expression level of detoxifying or antioxidant genes including HO-1 [74]. In contrast, Nrf2+/+ mice protect the brain from cerebral ischemia in vivo [75], whereas primary neuronal cultures treated with chemical activators of the Nrf2-ARE pathway displayed significantly greater resistance to oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity [73]. Phytochemicals including sulforaphane, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), and curcumin activate the Nrf2- ARE system [76, 77]. Using Western blot, we examined whether D activated Nrf2 in PC12 cells and found that Nrf2 was promoted translocation into the nucleus in PC12 cells exposed to a nontoxic concentration of D (Figure 5). The translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus following D treatment was associated with a marked increase in HO-1 induction (Figure 2). Therefore, our results suggest that the transcriptional activation of Nrf2 is involved in the increased expression of HO-1 and the cytoprotection against A\ud835\udefd  25-35 induced in PC12 cells (Figure 7(c)).    Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11  The upstream signaling pathways regulating Nrf2 trans- activation remain poorly defined. Recent studies have impli- cated a major role for the MAPK in Nrf2-dependent translo- cation andHO-1 activation, although other kinases including tyrosine kinases, PI3K, and PKC have also emerged as potential contributing mechanisms coordinately or sepa- rately [78, 79]. In vertebrates, the three major kinase cascades are represented by ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK [80]. The current experiments were designed to verify a possible role of MAPK pathway in D-induced Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression, andDwas found to facilitate the phosphorylation of ERK and dephosphorylation of p38 (Figure 6). In addition, upregulation of HO-1 as well as Nrf2 nuclear translocation by D was remarkably inhibited by U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of ERK pathway.These investigations suggested that the activation of ERK pathway by D contributed to HO-1 expression (Figures 7(a) and 7(b)), Nrf2 nuclear translocation (Figure 7(d)), and cytoprotection (Figure 7(c)) in PC12 cells. It is generally acknowledged that MAPK can be differentially regulated by the same stimuli in diverse cell types. ERK pathway is thought to mediate cellular responses to growth and differentiation factors, whereas JNK and p38 pathway is activated by distinct and overlapping sets of stress-related stimuli [81]. For instance, quercetin induces Nrf2 nuclear translocation and HO-1 upregulation via the ERK and p38 pathway but not the JNKpathway in human hepatocytes [82]. 3H-1, 2-dithiole-3-thione increases nuclear Nrf2 accumula- tion via the ERK pathway but not the p38 and JNK pathway inmurine keratinocytes [83]. In PC12 cells, 15-Deoxy-D12, 14- prostaglandin J2 induces HO-1expression via the ERK and Akt/PI3K pathway but not the p38 and JNK pathway [84]. Shen et al. [79] have shown that the transcriptional activity of Nrf2 transactivation domain was stimulated by ERK and JNK signaling pathways while the p38MAPKplays a negative role. This may be due to the diverse assortment and intensity of the signaling pathways activated by different inducers in different cell types. However, further studies are extensively ongoing to define the exact role of the MAPK pathways in HO-1 expression.  In summary, the intrinsic free radical scavenging activity and inducing the upregulation of HO-1 expression through activation of Nrf2 exposed to D confer protection against the A\ud835\udefd  25-35-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells. One of the most salient features of our present study is that ERK is involved in HO-1 induction via Nrf2 activation in the D- stimulated cells. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of ERK suppressed Nrf2 activation and subsequent HO-1 expression. Results of our study imply the potential involvement of these upstream kinases in Nrf2 activation and HO-1 upregulation by D. However, the complete molecular milieu that links all these events needs to be elucidated. Continued attempts to identify novel target molecules responsible for the HO- 1 regulation and to clarify their cross-talk with upstream and downstream signaling molecules will pave the way to exploiting preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for the management of oxidative stress-mediated disorders. More- over, considering that the D has a property that can cross the blood-brain barrier, further in vivo study with D should substantiate this therapeutic potential of this compound.  These findings indicate that D might prove to be a promising therapeutic approach to combat neural demise in AD and other oxidative stress-related diseases.
