In tissue arrays of RMS tumor cores from 71 patients, 80% of RMS patients expressed high levels of Sp1 protein, whereas low expression of Sp1 was detected in normal muscle tissue. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) tolfenamic acid (TA) inhibited growth and migration of RD and RH30 RMS cell lines and also inhibited tumor growth in vivo using a mouse xenograft (RH30 cells) model. The effects of TA were accompanied by downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes in RMS cells and tumors, and the role of Sp protein downregulation in mediating inhibition of RD and RH30 cell growth and migration was confirmed by individual and combined knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins by RNA interference. TA treatment and Sp knockdown in RD and RH30 cells also showed that four genes that are emerging as individual drug targets for treating RMS, namely c-MET, insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), PDGFR\u03b1 and CXCR4, are also Sp-regulated genes. These results suggest that NSAIDs such as TA may have potential clinical efficacy in drug combinations for treating RMS patients.",

ABSTRACT Background Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease, characterised by synovitis and destruction of articular cartilage/bone. Janus-kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription ( JAK-STAT) signalling pathway is implicated in the pathogenesis of PsA. Objectives To examine the effect of tofacitinib ( JAK inhibitor) on proinflammatory mechanisms in PsA. Methods Primary PsA synovial fibroblasts (PsAFLS) and ex vivo PsA synovial explants were cultured with tofacitinib (1 mM). PhosphoSTAT3 (pSTAT3), phosphoSTAT1 (pSTAT1), suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), protein inhibitor of activated Stat3 (PIAS3) and nuclear factor kappa B cells (NF\u03baBp65) were quantified by western blot. The effect of tofacitinib on PsAFLS migration, invasion, Matrigel network formation and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)2/9 was quantified by invasion/migration assays and zymography. Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, IL- 17, IL-10, MMP3 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) were assessed by ELISA. Results Tofacitinib significantly decreased pSTAT3, pSTAT1, NF\u03baBp65 and induced SOCS3 and PIAS3 expression in PsAFLS and synovial explant cultures (p<0.05). Functionally, PsAFLS invasion, network formation and migration were inhibited by tofacitinib (all p<0.05). In PsA explant, tofacitinib significantly decreased spontaneous secretion of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MMP9/MMP2, MMP3 (all p<0.05) and decreased the MMP3/TIMP3 ratio (p<0.05), with no effect observed for IP-10 or IL-10. Conclusions This study further supports JAK-STAT inhibition as a therapeutic target for the treatment of PsA.  INTRODUCTION Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis (Ps) and charac- terised by synovitis and progressive destruction of articular cartilage and bone. One of the earliest events is new vessel formation and invasion result- ing in a self-perpetuating and persistent infiltration of leucocytes, transforming the synovium into an aggressive tumour-like \u2018pannus'. Previous studies have demonstrated distinct macroscopic vascularity in the PsA joint characterised by elongated, tortu- ous vessels which is associated with increased expression of cytokines, angiogenic growth factors and decreased cell apoptosis.1 2 This facilitates PsA  synovial fibroblasts (FLS) to invade adjacent cartil- age and bone resulting in joint destruction. PsA synovium is the target of interplay for many  proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors, with key circulating mediators controlling cell traffic from the blood stream into the underlying tissue. Recently developed agents for PsA target IL12p40, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17,3-5 several of which signal through the Janus-Kinase ( JAK) family of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. Activated JAKs recruit and activate signal trans- ducer and activator of transcription (STATs), which in turn drive gene transcription.6 The specific JAK-STAT activated depends on the cytokine signal which includes the interferons (IFNs) and IFN-related cytokines, the common \u03b3-chain cyto- kines, and the IL-6-type cytokines. Several studies have demonstrated a key role for JAK-STAT signal- ling in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).7 8 Previous studies have shown increased pSTAT3 and phosphoSTAT1 (pSTAT1) expression in Ps lesional skin9 and shown that IFN\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-22 can induce pSTAT1 or pSTAT3 in keratino- cytes;10 however, no study to date has examined their expression or regulation in PsA synovium or fibroblasts. Tofacitinib is a drug of the JAK inhibitor class and is currently approved for the treatment of RA in 27 countries. A recent study in patients with RA demonstrated that tofacitinib downregulated inflammatory pathways in RA synovial tissue;11  however, a direct effect of tofacitinib on PsA syn- ovial inflammation has not been shown to date.  METHODS Patient demographics, arthroscopy and culture of synovial fibroblasts See online supplementary file 1.  Synovial tissue explant culture ex vivo To investigate the effect of tofacitinib (Selleck Chemicals LLC; Houston, Texas, USA) on cytokine production in the arthritic joint, an ex vivo PsA syn- ovial explant model was established. This system maintains the synovial architecture and cell-cell contact and spontaneously releases proinflammatory mediators. PsA synovial biopsies were sectioned and cultured immediately following arthroscopy (to maintain maximal activity of the inflamed syno- vium) in 96-well plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) in RPMI-1640 supplemented with streptomycin (100 units/mL) and penicillin (100 units/mL) for 24 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2.

Following culture, biopsy wet-weights were obtained and supernatants analysed for cyto- kines. Tissue morphology and cell viability of PsA explants fol- lowing culture are described in online supplementary file 1.  Western blot analysis Protein isolation from Psoriatic Arthritis synovial fibroblasts (PsAFLS) and synovial explants is described in online supple- mentary file 1. Protein (20-50 mg) was resolved on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (5% stacking, 10% resolving), gels were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) prior to 1 h blocking in wash buffer con- taining 5% non-fat milk. Membranes were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-pSTAT3 (Cell-Signaling Technology, UK), total-signal transducer and activator of transcription (tSTAT)3, pSTAT1, tSTAT1, pSTAT2, suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), protein inhibitor of activated Stat3 (PIAS3; Cell Signaling Technology) and nuclear factor kappa B cells (NF\u03baBp65) (Millipore, California, USA) diluted in 5% non-fat milk containing 0.1% Tween 20 at 4\u00b0C overnight. \u03b2-Actin (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a loading control. Membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 3 h at RT. Signal was detected using SuperSignal West-Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Amersham Biosciences, UK) and quantified using EDAS-120 system (Kodak, Rochester, New York, USA).

RESULTS Tofacitinib regulates STAT signalling in primary PsAFLS Initial experiments demonstrated increased expression of pSTAT1 and pSTAT3 in PsA synovium when compared with osteoarthritis (OA) (figure 1A). Tofacitinib inhibited pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 expression in PsAFLS when compared with vehicle control (figure 1B, D). In parallel, tofacitinib induced negative inhibitors of STATs, SOCS3 and PIAS3 compared with vehicle control (figure 1C, D).  Tofacitinib inhibited PsAFLS invasion and migration Figure 2A shows representative images, demonstrating the inhibitory effect of tofacitinib on PsAFLS migration, in compari- son with DMSO control where repopulation of wound margins was observed. Representative images of decreased PsAFLS inva- sion following culture with tofacitinib are shown in figure 2B, an effect that was significant compared with vehicle control (p<0.05; figure 2C). Furthermore, tofacitinib significantly inhibited PsAFLS network formation (figure 2D, E; p<0.05).  Tofacitinib regulates STAT signalling in whole tissue PsA synovial explant cultures To further examine the effect of tofacitinib, PsA synovial explants were cultured with tofacitinib for 72 h. Figure 3A(i-ii) demonstrates intact tissue morphology and cell-cell contact fol- lowing culture, with lining-layer, blood vessels and synovial infil- trate clearly visible. Figure 3Ciii demonstrates calcein uptake into the nucleus of the cells following culture indicating viability of cells. Also evident are tortuous elongated dilated vessels which are a hallmark of PsA synovium (figure 3Aiv), with a mean (\u00b1SEM) vascularity of 75\u00b15.3. Tofacitinib inhibited pSTAT1 and pSTAT3, with no effect on tSTAT1 or tSTAT3  Figure 1 Tofacitinib regulates Janus-kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways components in PsAFLS.

In contrast, tofacitinib induced expression of SOCS3 and PIAS3 (figure 3C, D).  Inhibition of proinflammatory mediators from PsA explant cultures Tofacitinib significantly inhibited spontaneous secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) from PsA explant cultures (*p<0.05; figure 3E) with no effect observed for IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) or IL-10 (figure 3E). IL-17 levels were undetectable. Furthermore, tofacitinib inhibited NF\u03baBp65 in PsA explants and PsAFLS, a key transcriptional factor in the inflamed joint (figure 3E). Tofacitinib significantly inhibited matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)3 expression from PsA synovial explants (p<0.05; figure 3F), had no effect on tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) (figure 3F) and inhib- ited the MMP3/TIMP3 ratio (figure 3F). Finally tofacitinib inhib- ited MMP2 and MMP9 activity as observed by gelatine zymography (figure 3F).  DISCUSSION To date, no study has examined JAK-STAT or the effect of tofa- citinib in primary cells isolated from PsA synovial biopsies. In this study, tofacitinib significantly decreased pSTAT1, pSTAT3 in PsAFLS and PsA synovial explant cultures ex vivo. In parallel, tofacitinib increased SOCS3 and PIAS3 expression  demonstrating negative feedback inhibition. Functionally, tofaci- tinib significantly decreased PsAFLS invasion, migration and network formation. Finally, tofacitinib significantly decreased spontaneous secretion of key proinflammatory cytokines, the MMP/TIMP ratio and NF\u03baBp65 expression. Thus tofacitinib inhibits proinflammatory and invasive mechanisms which are critically involved in the pathogenesis of PsA.  This is the first study to demonstrate regulation of pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 in primary PsAFLS and PsA synovial tissue. Only one previous study in PsA has examined STATsignalling, and this was in synovial fluid (SF) T cells where increased expression of JAK1, pSTAT3 and pSTAT1 was demonstrated compared with periph- eral blood (PB) of healthy controls (HC), suggesting activation of JAK-STATsignalling at the site of inflammation.12 Ps studies have shown that increased pSTATexpression is associated with epider- mal hyper-proliferation, expression of which was modulated by IFN\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-22.9 10 This is consistent with RA studies, showing that pSTAT3 is associated with synovial inflammation, lining-layer hyperplasia and synovial pO2 levels,  13 14 and that STAT3 modulates Th17 differentiation in RA SF and induces RAFLS survival.13  In this study, tofacitinib inhibited pSTAT1, pSTAT3 and NF\u03baBp65 in PsAFLS and PsA explants, an effect that was paral- leled by induction of both SOCS3 and PIAS3. SOCS inhibits cytokine signalling by acting as kinase inhibitors to JAKs or competitive binding for docking sites with STAT. PIAS3 binds to  Figure 2 Tofacitinib inhibited PsAFLS invasion.

In parallel, tofacitinib inhibited PsAFLS invasion, migra- tion and network formation, all associated with progressive and destructive joint disease. While the precise mechanisms by which tofacitinib inhibits invasion/migration is unclear, it may involve (i) inhibition of key cytokines such as IL-6 which results in negative feedback inhibition, (ii) blockade of RhoGTPases (cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA) or growth factors such as platelet- derived growth factor (PDGF), which are critical for cell move- ment, migration and invasion or (iii) through the observed effects of STAT signalling on NF\u03baB which is known in other cell types to mediate proliferation and invasive mechanisms via phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase or protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway.15  Tofacitinib significantly inhibited IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MMP3 and MMP2/9 spontaneous secretion from PsA explants, with no  significant effect on IP-10 or IL-10. The PsA biopsies used to establish the explant model were obtained from the site of inflammation under direct visualisation and closely reflect the patients' inflammatory activity in vivo. Previous studies have shown that tofacitinib inhibits tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and IL-6-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone destruction,16 an effect mediated by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL).17 Tofacitinib decreases the T-cell stimulatory capability of dendritic cells through suppression of type-I-IFN signalling.18 Furthermore, tofacitinib reduces MMP and IFN-regulated gene expression in RA synovium, with clinical improvement correlating with reductions in pSTAT1 and pSTAT3.8 While JAK1-mediated IFN and IL-6 signalling likely play a key role in the synovial response, more recent data have shown that CP690550 inhibits TNF-induced expression of IP10, RANTES and MCP1 in RAFLS,11 inhibits IL-4-dependent Th2 cell differentiation and Th17 cell differentiation and  Figure 3 Janus-kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway components were modulated by tofacitinib in synovial tissues.

Tofacitinib differentially regulated JAK-STAT signalling, inhibiting pSTAT1, pSTAT3 and inducing of SOCS3/PIAS3 in vitro and ex vivo par- alleled by inhibition of invasive mechanisms. These data further support a role for blockade of JAK-STAT signalling pathways in the treatment strategy for PsA.
