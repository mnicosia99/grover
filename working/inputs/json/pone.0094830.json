    "summary": "Recent epidemiological studies suggested that cpb2-positive Clostridium perfringens isolates are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in horses. These putative relationships, indicated by PCR genotyping, were tested in the present study by further genotyping and phenotyping of 23 cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates from horses with GI disease (referred to hereafter as horse GI disease isolates). Our beta2-toxin (CPB2) Western blot analyses demonstrated that all of the tested isolates were unable to produce detectable levels of CPB2. However, Southern blot and nucleotide sequencing analyses identified intact cpb2 open reading frames in all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase PCR and Northern blot analyses showed that cpb2 genes in all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates were transcriptionally active, i.e., an approximately 1.2-kb cpb2-specific mRNA was identified in total RNA from our surveyed isolates. The levels of cpb2 mRNA in CWC245 (a high-CPB2-producing pig strain) and our surveyed horse GI disease isolates differed to such an extent (35-fold) that this difference could be considered as a major cause of the difference in levels of CPB2 production by CWC245 and horse GI disease isolates. This finding received further support from our observation that the complementing strain 106902(pMRS140), which produced significantly higher levels of mRNA than strain 106902, produced high levels of CPB2. Collectively, our results indicated that there is a positive correlation between cpb2 transcription levels and the amount of CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and that decreased transcription and/or message instability may be involved, at least in part, in the low CPB2 production noted for horse GI disease isolates in comparison to that noted for pig GI disease isolate CWC245.",

and Utilization (MOE), Beijing Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, China  Agricultural University, Beijing, China, 2 National Plant Gene Research Centre (Beijing), Beijing, China  Abstract  Heterosis is associated with differential gene expression between hybrids and their parental lines, and the genes involved in cell proliferation played important roles. AtARF2 is a general cell proliferation repressor in Arabidopsis. In our previous study, two homologues (ZmARF10 and ZmARF25) of AtARF2 were identified in maize, but their relationship with heterosis was not elucidated. Here, the expression patterns of ZmARF10 and ZmARF25 in seedling leaves of maize hybrids and their parental lines were analyzed. The results of qRT-PCR exhibited that ZmARF25 was down-regulated in leaf basal region of hybrids. Moreover, overexpression of ZmARF25 led to reduced organ size in Arabidopsis, which was mainly due to the decrease in cell number, not cell size. In addition, the cell proliferation related genes AtANT, AtGIF1 and AtGRF5 were down-regulated in 35S::ZmARF25 transgenic lines. Collectively, we proposed that the down-regulation of ZmARF25 in maize hybrid may accelerate cell proliferation and promote leaf development, which, in turn, contributes to the observed leaf size heterosis in maize.

Introduction  Heterosis is defined as advantageous quantitative and qualita-  tive traits of offspring over their parents, and the utilization of  heterosis principles has been a major practice for increasing  productivity of plants and animals [1]. In spite of its importance  and successful application, the underlying molecular mechanism  for heterosis is still needs to be elucidated [2-5]. Studies on plant  form evolution suggest that phenotype evolution often proceeds  through changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of gene  expression [6]. Theoretically, all the genes in hybrid are inherited  from its two parental lines, but hybrid performance or phenotype  can be quite different from its parents, thereby, demonstrating  heterosis [7,8]. Therefore, the alteration of gene expression in  hybrids may be responsible for hybrid vigor [4,8]. Up to date,  genome wide gene expression profiles of different organs or tissues  between hybrids and their parents in plants have been analyzed  [9-15], and all possible modes of gene action were observed,  including additivity, high- and low-parent dominance, under-  dominance, and overdominance [9-15]. To gain further insight  into the possible roles of differentially expressed genes between  hybrid and its parental lines in plant development and heterosis,  the functions of some differentially expressed genes have been  characterized, and some of which may contribute to the observed  heterosis. For example, overexpression of wheat hybrid up-  regulated gene (ADP-ribosylation factor, TaARF) in Arabidopsis  displayed increased growth rates during the seedling and adult  stages [16]. Overexpression of Larix hybrid up-regulated gene  LaAP2L1, a member of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor  family, led to markedly enlarged organs and heterosis-like traits in  Arabidopsis [17]. Expression of an up-regulated protein ZmACT2  in dry embryos of maize hybrid in Arabidopsis partially comple-  mented the low germination phenotype in the Atact7 mutant [18].  Heterosis affects nearly any trait in nearly every hybrid, hence  one of the major challenges for expression analysis is deciding  which tissue to be analyzed [19,20]. It was proposed that seedling  leaves can be used as a model system to investigate the molecular  basis of maize heterosis, because it is commonly observed that  hybrids produce larger leaf areas than their corresponding  parental lines [20-24]. At the cellular level, a crucial effect of  leaf size heterosis is manifested by primarily increases in cell  number, not cell size [25-27]. Recent study provided molecular  evidence for the relationship between cell proliferation and  heterotic maize growth. For example, the expression level of  maize CNR gene, ortholog of fruit weight 2.2 (fw2.2) in tomato, was  founded to be negatively correlated with growth activity and  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94830  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0094830&domain=pdf   hybrid vigor [28]. Collectively, it reveals that the study of cell  number control is eminently important to understanding the  underlying mechanism for leaf size heterosis.  In Arabidopsis, auxin signaling plays a vital role in leaf growth  and development processes and some key genes, including  AtARF2, AtARF7 and AtARF19, have been identified [29-31]. In  our previous study, 31 maize genes that encode ARFs (Auxin  Response Factors) were identified in maize genome, and  phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that two of them, ZmARF10  and ZmARF25, were homologous to Arabidopsis growth repressor  AtARF2 [32]. In this study, the expression patterns of ZmARF10  and ZmARF25 in seedling leaves of maize hybrids and their  parental lines were investigated and the function of hybrid down-  regulated gene ZmARF25 was characterized. Our data showed that  ectopic expression of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis led to reduced organ  size, indicating that the alteration of auxin signaling pathway  might play an important role in maize leaf size heterosis.  Materials and Methods  Plant Materials and Growth Conditions Maize inbred lines Mo17, B73, Zong3, 87-1 and their hybrids  Mo17/B73, B73/Mo17, Zong3/87-1, 87-1/Zong3, B73/Zong3,  Zong3/B73, B73/87-1 and 87-1/B73 were used for this study.  Maize seeds were imbibed at 28uC in the dark, and the seeds after germination were selected with the same length of coleoptile  (2.0 cm) to grow in hydroponic culture on a 16 h light/8 h dark  cycle, at a temperature of 29uC and 25uC for the light and dark cycle, respectively. In maize leaf, the mature zone is composed of  fully differentiated cells and cell division is restricted to the growing  zone composed of immature cells [19,33]. Therefore, thirty  millimeters from the base of the third leaves and twenty  millimeters from the tip of the same leaf of a seedling 5 days  after germination (DAG) were dissected and harvested for RNA  extractions.

Seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates with 3% sucrose  and 0.8% agar in a culture room at 22uC under a 16/8 light/dark cycle. After germination, 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were  transplanted and grown at a density of four plants per pot  containing a mixture of soil and vermiculite (2:1) at 22uC under a 16/8 light/dark cycle with 70% relative humidity.  Leaf Area Measurements Leaves were scanned using ImageScanner (GE Healthcare,  USA), and measured with a public domain image analysis software  (ImageJ version 1.32; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). For maize leaf  area measurements, the third leaves were harvested in the  morning (10:00-10:30 am) and experiments were done in three  biological replicates and 10 plants of each genotype were analyzed  for each replicate. The t-test was used to determine the significance  of the differences in leaf areas between hybrid and the  corresponding mid-parental value. The mid-parent heterosis  (MPH) was calculated using the following formula: MPH = (F12  mid-parental value)/mid-parental value in %, where F1 is the  average value of hybrid, and the mid-parental value is the average  value of the two parents.  Ten 30-day-old Arabidopsis plants of each transgenic line and  wild-type were selected randomly for the fully expanded fifth leaf  area measurements. The t-test was used to determine the  significance of the differences in leaf area between transgenic  plants and wild-type plants.  Histological Analysis After the area measurements, the fully expanded fifth leaves of  the ten 30-day-old Arabidopsis plants of each transgenic line and  wild-type were used for epidermal cell size measurements. Leaves  were first boiled in water for 10 min to kill the cells, and then  immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol, after decolorized, they were  transferred to hot (96uC) 85% lactic acid for 8 min. Finally, the leaves were transferred to room temperature lactic acid and  examined using a Nikon Stereo Microscope. The number of  epidermal cells was determined in an area of 0.58 mm 2  in the  middle region of the fifth leaf blade. The average cell size was  measured by dividing 0.58 mm 2  by the number of epidermal. The  total number of cells per leaf was calculated by dividing the leaf  area by the average cell size. Statistical calculations were  performed with Microsoft EXCEL.  Isolation of DNA and Total RNA Total DNA was extracted by the cetyltrimethylammonium  bromide (CTAB) method [34] with minor modifications. Total  RNA was extracted using a standard Trizol RNA isolation  protocol (Invitrogen, USA), and then treated with RNase-free  DNaseI (Promega, USA) to remove genomic DNA. The amount  and quality of the total RNA were verified by electrophoresis on a  1% agarose gel. The concentration of RNA was measured using a  NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND- 1000; NanoDrop Technolo-  gies). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 2 mg of DNase digested total RNA with oligodT15 primer according to  the manufacturer's protocol for RT-PCR first-strand synthesis  (TaKaRa, Japan).

Specific primers for qRT-PCR analysis were listed in Table S1.  The PCR efficiency of all primer pairs was determined from  standard curve experiments. PCR conditions consisted of an initial  step at 95uC for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 15 s, followed by 60uC for 15 s, and then 72uC for 30 s. For amplification product specificity, a melting curve was generated  at the end of each run, and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis  of PCR products. All reactions were run in triplicate, and each  reaction was completed with a melting curve and amplification  curve analysis to confirm the amplification specificity. Ct values  were determined using the CFX96 software with default settings.  Differences between the Ct values of target gene and Actin were  calculated as DCt = Cttarget gene2CtActin, and the relative expres- sion levels of target genes were determined as 2  2DCt . For each  sample, PCR was performed on three biological replicates. The  average values of 2 2DCt  were used to determine difference in gene  expression. Actin was amplified as an endogenous control.  Statistical analysis of the difference in the relative expression  levels of target genes was performed by using t-test.  Gene Cloning and Sequence Analysis PCR was performed using the ZmARF25-F/R primer pair  from the first-strand cDNA from the B73 seedling leaves. PCR  conditions consisted of an initial step at 94uC for 5 min followed  by 35 cycles of 94uC for 25 s, 58uC for 25 s, and 72uC for 2 m 45 s; and then a final step at 72uC for 10 min. The PCR products were confirmed by visualization of the samples by electrophoresis  on 1% agarose gel and stained by Ethidium bromide. The samples  were extracted with MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen,  Germany), and these purified PCR products were cloned into  pGEM-T plasmid vector (Promega, USA). Three clones were  subsequently sequenced (Invitrogen, USA). The online tools,  Open Reading Frame Finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  gorf/gorf.html), Compute pI/Mw (http://web.expasy.org/  compute_pi/), and InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/),  were used to analyze the nucleotide and amino acid sequences.  Vector Construction and Plant Transformation The coding region of ZmARF25 was introduced into pDONR221  vector using Gateway BP clonase enzymemix (Invitrogen, USA)  with the following primer pair: Gate-25-F and Gate-25-R (Table  S1). To construct overexpression vector 35S::ZmARF25, the  fragments were transferred from the pDONR221 vectors to  pB2GW7 vector by Gateway LR recombination (Invitrogen,  USA). This construct was transformed into Arabidopsis (Col-0) via  the floral dip method using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain  GV3101 [35]. Transgenic plants were selected on 1/2 MS medium  containing herbicides (Basta). The herbicide resistant seedlings were  transferred to a mixture of soil and vermiculite (2:1) and generated  homozygous lines by self-fertilization. Statistical analysis of the  difference in traits between transgenic plants and wild-type plants  was performed by using t-test.  Results  Comparison of Maize Leaf Area between Hybrids and their Parental Lines  Previous studies revealed that maize hybrid exhibited heterosis  in leaf size [24]. In this study, dynamic growth patterns of maize  hybrid Mo17/B73 and its inbred parental lines were investigated  in terms of the third leaf area and mid-parent heterosis (MPH) was  calculated. The results exhibited that leaf areas of hybrid Mo17/  B73 were significantly larger than its parental lines at 8, 10 and 12  DAG. Remarkably, MPH (72.00%) at 8 DAG was much higher  than that of 10 and 12 DAG (60.50% and 58.26%) [Figure S1].  Thus, the third leaf areas of eight hybrids and their parental lines  at 8 DAG were further measured and compared. It can be seen  that the leaf areas of all hybrids were significantly larger than those  of their parental lines at 8 DAG [Figure 1A].  Identification of a Hybrid Down-regulated Gene ZmARF25 in Maize Seedling Leaves  To gain insight into the relationship of ZmARF10 and ZmARF25  with leaf size heterosis, expression patterns of these two genes in  the third leaves of hybrids Mo17/B73 and B73/Mo17 and their  parental lines. Considering of the time lag between differential  gene expression and the observed heterosis of leaf size at 8 DAG,  the third leaves at 5 DAG were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. As  shown in Figure 1B, the relative expression levels of ZmARF25 in  the basal region of Mo17/B73 and B73/Mo17 hybrids were  significantly lower than the levels observed in parental lines,  whereas no significant differences in the expression patterns of  ZmARF10 were observed in these hybrids. Most notably, no  obvious expression alterations were detected for ZmARF10 and  ZmARF25 in the leaf tip regions of the hybrids and their parental  lines [Figure 1C]. Furthermore, the expression patterns of  ZmARF25 between other hybrids and their parental lines were  also investigated and we observed that ZmARF25 was down-  Figure 3.

Therefore, ZmARF25 was selected for further  investigation.  To obtain the cDNA with complete open reading frame (ORF)  corresponding to ZmARF25, cDNAs from B73 seedling leaves were  amplified with ZmARF25-F/R primer pair and one unique PCR  fragment of about 2500 bp was produced (data not shown). The  PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T and three clones were  sequenced. One 2552 bp fragment was obtained and no  nucleotide polymorphisms were detected for all sequenced clones.  Sequence analysis revealed that the PCR product contains a  complete ORF, which encodes a polypeptide of 801 amino acids  with a calculated molecular mass of 89.79 kD and isoelectric point  of 6.09, which was consistent with our previous study [32].  Structure analysis exhibited that ZmARF25 has a typical ARF-  type structure with a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) that  consists of a plant-specific B3-type subdomain and an ARF  subdomain required for efficient in vitro binding to the auxin  response elements (AuxREs) in the N-terminus, a typical carboxy-  terminal dimerization domain (CTD) with both III and IV  subdomains and a middle region (MR) that might function as a  repression domain (RD) since it is enriched in serine (S) [Figure 2]  [36-39].  Functional Analysis of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis To investigate the possible function of ZmARF25, overexpres-  sion Arabidopsis transgenic plants were generated and herbicide-  resistant T0 transformants were transferred into soil and grown in  a greenhouse to obtain segregating T1 progeny for genetic  analysis. Of the 21 transformants, eight overexpression lines  showed a 3:1 segregation pattern for herbicide resistance, among  which four (35S::ZmARF25 #1-4) were selected for further analysis. As shown in Figure 3A, the insertion of the overexpres-  sion vector was confirmed by genomic PCR. ZmARF25 is a  homologue of AtARF2 in Arabidopsis [32], the relative expression  levels of exogenous gene ZmARF25 and endogenous gene AtARF2  in the transgenic and wild-type plants were analyzed by qRT-  PCR. The results showed that different expression levels of  ZmARF25 were observed in these overexpression lines, but the  transcription of AtARF2 in the transgenic lines was not affected  [Figure 3B]. Subsequent analysis was conducted using these T3 homozygous transgenic plants. As shown in Figure 4,  35S::ZmARF25 #1-4 transgenic lines displayed markedly de- creased leaf areas, shorter siliques and plant height with smaller  inflorescences and flowers in comparison with wild-type. Further  analysis revealed that the size of the fifth leaves of 35S::ZmARF25  plants was decreased by approximately 60,80% as compared to wild-type [Figure 4D]. In addition, the plant height and the silique  length of transgenic plants were about 40-60% and 56% of that of  wild-type, respectively [Figure 4E, F]. Collectively, these data  indicated that overexpression of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis decreased  the size of aerial organs by inhibiting organ growth and  development.  To determine whether it is cell number or cell size, or both that  contribute to the changed leaf size in transgenic lines, we observed  Figure 4. Morphology of 35S::ZmARF25 and wild-type plants.

The  results showed that there was no distinct difference in cell size  between the ZmARF25 overexpression and wild-type plants  [Figure 5A, B], whereas cell number of 35S::ZmARF25 plants  was significantly lower when compared to wild-type plants  [Figure 5C], indicating that the decrease in cell numbers, not  cell size, was associated with the diminution of leaf size in  35S::ZmARF25 plants.  Expression Analysis of Organ Size-associated Genes between 35S::ZmARF25 Transgenic Lines and Wild-type  To elucidate the underlying regulation mechanism of ZmARF25,  expression patterns of organ size-associated genes AtANT, AtGIF1,  AtGRF5 and AtEXP10 between 35S::ZmARF25 and wild-type  plants were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the  expression levels of AtANT, AtGIF1 and AtGRF5 were significantly  decreased in 35S::ZmARF25 plants, whereas no obvious alteration  of AtEXP10 expression was observed [Figure 6]. In Arabidopsis,  AtANT, AtGIF1 and AtGRF5 were reported to be involved in cell  proliferation while AtEXP10 played important roles in cellular  expansion [40-44]. Collectively, it could be concluded that  overexpression of ZmARF25 inhibited the transcription of cell  proliferation associated genes, which is consistent with the  decreased cell numbers observed in 35S::ZmARF25 plants.  Discussion  ZmARF25 Repressed Organ Size by Decreasing Cell Numbers in Arabidopsis  Auxin response factors (ARFs) are transcription factors that bind  with specificity to TGTCTC-containing AuxREs found in  promoters of primary/early auxin response genes and mediate  responses to the plant hormone auxin [36-39]. Genome-wide  analysis revealed that ARF genes are represented by a large  multigene family in plants [32,45-49]. Most ARFs contain a  conserved N-terminal DBD, a variable MR and a typical CTD  [36,37,45-49]. The DBD specifically binds to the conserved  AuXRE, the CTD is modular with amino acid sequence related to  domains III and IV in Aux/IAA proteins, making it function as a  dimerization domain among the ARFs or with several Aux/IAA  proteins. The structure of MR determines whether the ARF acts  as an activator or repressor. Activation domain (AD) of ARFs is  usually enriched in glutamine (Q), serine (S) and leucine (L), while  repression domain (RD) is enriched in either S, L and proline (P);  S, L and/or glycine (G) or S [32,39]. In this study, one hybrid  down-regulated gene ZmARF25 that encoded a typical ARF-type  protein was identified in maize. Most notably, ZmARF25 has a  MR enriched in S, indicating that it might act as a repressor. Our  previous study indicated that ZmARF25 was homologous to  AtARF2 in Arabidopsis and OsARF4 in rice [32]. AtARF2 has been  identified as a general repressor of cell division, one aspect of many  biological processes regulated by auxin [29]. However, our  knowledge about the functions and regulations of ZmARF25 gene  is quite limited. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of  ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis resulted in significant size reduction of  plant organs. Although the results of ZmARF25 overexpression in  Arabidopsis may not fully reflect its precise functions in maize, it is  reasonable to assume that ZmARF25 may be involved in maize  growth and development process, which deserves for further  investigation.  At the cellular level, organ size is determined by two  developmental forces,cell proliferation and cell expansion, which  partially overlap in time and are assumed to be coordinated [50].  Nevertheless, larger organ tends to be composed of more cells  rather than bigger cells in different species [51]. In present study,  we noted that overexpression of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis signifi-  cantly decreased the cell number, resulting in smaller organs in  35S::ZmARF25 transgenic plants when compared to wild-type.  Recently, some regulatory genes that affect leaf development have  been identified and characterized at the molecular level. For  example, loss of AtANT function reduces the size of all lateral shoot  organs by decreasing cell number [41]. AtGIF and AtGRF5 act  together and are required for the development of appropriate leaf  size and shape by promoting and/or maintaining of cell  proliferation activity in leaf primordial [42,43]. On the other  hand, expansins are thought to function in the control of plant cell  growth, and leaf size was substantially reduced in antisense lines  with suppressed AtEXP10 expression, whereas overexpression of  Figure 5.

Remarkably, overexpression of ZmARF25 repressed the expression  levels of AtANT, AtGRF5 and AtGIF1, whereas no significant  alteration in AtEXP10 expression was detected. Collectively, we  speculate that ZmARF25 regulates the process of cell proliferation  by altering the expression of AtANT, AtGRF5 and AtGIF1 in  Arabidopsis.  Expression Patterns of ZmARF25 in Maize Hybrids and their Parental Lines was Tissue and Genotype Dependent  Leaf differentiation proceeds basipetally (from tip to base) in a  highly regular and continuous manner [52-54]. Maize leaves have  a basal growing region, which is composed of immature cells,  enclosed by older leaves [19,33,55]. Dynamics of the third leaf of  maize seedling transcriptome and proteome along the maize leaf  developmental gradient have been discussed. The results showed  that genes and proteins expressed at the highest levels near the  base of the leaf involved in cell wall biosynthesis, DNA synthesis,  cell cycle regulation and chromatin structure regulation, protein  metabolism, potential signaling proteins, auxin and brassinosteroid  biosynthesis and signaling, respiratory pathways and vesicle  transport [19,56]. Interestingly, relative expression level of  ZmARF25 gene in the basal region of hybrids Mo17/B73 and  B73/Mo17 was significantly lower than that of two parental lines.  On the other hand, no significant alteration in expression was  observed in the tip region, which is consistent with the observation  that different regions within a leaf displayed different expression  patterns [19,56]. Taken together, we proposed that leaf basal  region was the appropriate tissue for further investigation of the  molecular basis of leaf size heterosis.  Recently, many studies have analyzed heterosis-associated gene  expression in leaves of maize, rice and wheat [7-14,20], but there  has been no obvious consensus about genes that are differentially  expressed in hybrids, which might be the result of significant  differences in species, different genotypes within species, distinct  tissues, experimental designs and statistical procedures applied [7-  14,20]. In this study, we noted that the ZmARF25 gene was down-  regulated in B73/Mo17, Mo17/B73, Zong3/87-1, 87-1/Zong3,  B73/87-1, 87-1/B73 and Zong3/B73, but no significant expression  difference was detected between B73/Zong3 and its parental lines,  which may be attributed to the influence of maternal affect, because  the mid-parent heterosis of hybrid B73/Zong3 was lower than that  of Zong3/B73.  Down-regulation of ZmARF25 in Hybrids may Contribute to the Observed Heterosis for Leaf Size  Enlarged organ size, such as the increased leaf area, is an  important feature of heterosis and also has a close relationship with  the crop yield [12, 28 and 57]. A key observation made in maize  heterosis was that the greater plant size is primarily (90%) due to  increases in cell number, not cell size [25]. Recently study reported  that transgenic over-expression of Zea mays ARGOS1 (ZAR1)  enhanced maize organ growth [58]. The expression level of CNR  gene was found to be negatively correlated with tissue growth  activity and hybrid vigor [28,57]. In this study, the expression  patterns of ZmARF10 and ZmARF25 in maize hybrids and their  parental lines were analyzed. We found that ZmARF25 gene was  down-regulated in hybrids. Moreover, 35S::ZmARF25 transgenic  Arabidopsis plants displayed markedly decreased aerial organ size in  comparison with wild-type. Considering the decreased cell  number in 35S::ZmARF25 plant leaves, we proposed that the  down-regulation of ZmARF25 gene in maize hybrid could  accelerate cell proliferation and promote leaf development, which,  in turn, contributes to the observed heterosis for leaf size.
