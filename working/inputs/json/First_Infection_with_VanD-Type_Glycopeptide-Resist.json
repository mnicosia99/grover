    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

Based on phenotypic results, PCR sequencing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and Southern blotting, the isolate was assigned to E. faecium with a chromosomally located VanD allele most closely related to the VanD1 allele.  Glycopeptides inhibit cell wall synthesis through the inter- action of their N termini with the D-alanyl-D-alanine termini of peptidoglycan precursors. The resulting complexes prevent the transglycosylases from incorporating disaccharide pentapep- tide subunits into the growing peptidoglycan chain, thereby inhibiting cell wall synthesis (15). Since 1988, many reports described the increase of vancomycin resistance in enterococci from Europe and the United States (6, 13). This resistance to glycopeptides occurs via a common mechanism involving mod- ification of the peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathway (8). Five phenotypes of acquired glycopeptide resistance have been identified in enterococci. VanA and VanB are the most com- mon types. They are caused by complex gene clusters that may be plasmid and/or transposon carried (8). VanE and VanG types have each been identified in single strains of Enterococ- cus faecalis (11, 15). Finally, to date, five Enterococcus faecium strains with VanD resistance have been reported in the United States, in Canada, and in Brazil (4, 7, 16, 18, 19). These isolates were recovered from stool cultures, urine, and blood cultures from immunocompromised patients. Each contained a distinct vanD allele, vanD1 to vanD5 (4, 7, 16, 18, 19).  Since November 2003, a 56-year-old man had been regularly admitted to the hematology and oncology unit of N\u0131\u0302mes Uni- versity Hospital for the treatment of an acute myeloid leuke- mia. He was hospitalized on February 2004 for febrile neutro- penia. Physical examination did not reveal a focal site of infection. E. faecium was isolated from three blood cultures. Despite an intravenous antibiotic therapy using levofloxacin and quinupristin/dalfopristin, the patient died 5 days after his admission.  E. faecium was determined biochemically using the Vitek 2-AST N017 identification card (Biomerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile,  France). Susceptibility to antibiotics was determined with the E-test method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on blood agar plates, and antibiotic MICs were interpreted according to the recommendations of the Antibiotic Susceptibility Testing Committee of the French Society for Microbiology with En- terococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecium B91 (VanA-), and E. faecium B132 (VanB-) as reference strains (20). The three isolates from the blood cultures showed the same resistant pattern. They were resistant to penicillin G (MIC, 16 -g/ml), gentamicin (MIC, -2,000 -g/ml), streptomycin (MIC, -2,000 -g/ml), tetracycline (MIC, 16 -g/ml), linezolid (MIC, -4 -g/ ml), daptomycin (MIC, 16 -g/ml), and macrolide-lincosamide- streptogramin B-type antibiotics (MIC, -8 -g/ml). They were also resistant to vancomycin (MIC, -256 -g/ml) and teicopla- nin (MIC, -256 -g/ml). They were susceptible only to quinu- pristin/dalfopristin (MIC, 0.5 -g/ml) and intermediate to levo- floxacin (MIC, 2 -g/ml). Levels of growth of these strains in the absence of and following the addition of vancomycin (8 -g/ml) were identical (data not shown), indicating that resis- tance was expressed constitutively. One of the three isolates was genotypically studied and named E. faecium NEF1.  To determine the genotype responsible for the unusual re- sistance of this strain, we used a multiplex PCR assay previ- ously described by Dutka-Malen et al., which allows simulta- neous detection of the glycopeptide resistance genotypes vanA and vanB, which encode D-alanine-D-lactate (D-Ala-D-Lac) li- gases, and vanC-1 and vanC-2/3, which encode D-Ala-D-Ser ligases (9). At the same time, multiplex PCR allows the iden- tification to the species level of the following clinically relevant enterococci: E. faecium, E. faecalis, E. gallinarum, and E. cas- seliflavus/E. flavescens. In this assay, PCR amplicons are dis- criminated from each other based on their molecular sizes. This protocol was modified according to Patel et al. in order to bypass the DNA extraction procedure and to process the PCR assay directly on an isolated colony from blood agar or Muel- ler-Hinton plates (17).

Mul- tiplex PCR performed on the enterococcal isolate resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin yielded a 550-bp amplified frag- ment specific for an internal fragment of the gene encoding D-Ala-D-Ala ligase of E. faecium. However, despite the high level of resistance to glycopeptides of this E. faecium isolate, none of the vanA, vanB, vanC1, or vanC2/3 resistance deter- minants could be amplified. Using degenerate V3 (5--GAR GAT GGI TSC ATM CAR GGW-3-) and V4 (5--MGT RAA ICC IGG CAK RGT RTT-3-) primers, which allow amplifica- tion of fragments internal to genes encoding related ligases (12), we obtained a 630-bp fragment. This fragment was cloned  into pGEMT (Promega, Madison, WI) to yield the pGEMT- Van plasmid and introduced into Escherichia coli via transfor- mation. The insert was sequenced. The deduced 223-amino- acid partial peptide showed approximately 90% identity with five VanD ligases listed in the GenBank database. Primer walk sequencing was carried out to amplify the entire D-Ala-D-Lac ligase (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using ClustalW (http://www.ebi .ac.uk/clustalw/). The complete region detected was predicted to encode a ligase of 343 amino acids (Fig. 1). This VanD peptide showed 85 to 95% amino acid identity to the VanD2 (AF153050 [16]), VanD3 (AF175293 [3]), VanD4 (AF277571 [7]), and VanD5 (AAR37060 [2]) ligases and 68% and 67% identity with, respectively, the VanA and VanB (B1 and B2) ligases (M97297 [1], U35369 [10], and AY145441 [14]) (Table 1). It shared a maximum of 98% amino acid identity with the VanD1 ligase (AF130997 [5]).  To search for a possible chromosomal location of the vanD allele, we used pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of I-CeuI-re- stricted DNA as previously described (2). A transfer of DNA from electrophoresis gel to a nylon membrane was accom- plished by capillary transfer. For DNA probing of the Southern blot, we used an amplification product obtained by PCR of E. faecium NEF1 using the vanD1 primers previously described (18). This product was labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP follow- ing the manufacturer's instructions (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.) and hybridized on I-CeuI-restricted pat- terns (Fig. 2). The vanD1 probe hybridized with E. faecium NEF1 DNA, confirming the chromosomal localization of this resistance gene as previously described for the vanD1 gene (18). All these results point to the fact that the resistance gene in E. faecium NEF1 is most closely related to the vanD1 allele.  In this study, we reported to the best of our knowledge the first strain of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium from Europe that contains a vanD allele. Since this episode of bacteremia, no further strains belonging to this genotype have been iso- lated in our hospital. Similar to previous patients reported with VanD-type glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus, this patient  FIG. 1.

For a few months, our patient had been treated several times with vancomycin, but, during this period, the patient had no enterococcal infections. He received also --lactams (amoxi- cillin plus clavulanic acid, imipenem, and cephalosporins), fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, and pristinamycin. How- ever, he did not have any links with the United States, Canada, or Brazil, the countries where the five VanD-type glycopep- tide-resistant E. faecium strains have been previously de- scribed. Interestingly, the five E. faecium strains with VanD- type resistance reported before were isolated in patients with multiple medical problems: diabetes mellitus, aplastic anemia, and, above all, three cases of orthoptic liver transplantation.  Phenotypically, this E. faecium presents a very high level of resistance against teicoplanin compared with the other de- scribed vanD phenotypes. It may represent constitutive high- level expression of the vanD gene cluster. The resistance gene in E. faecium NEF1 is most closely related to the VanD1 allele. The E. faecium NEF1 peptide showed 98% amino acid identity to the VanD1 ligases and a vanD1 probe hybridized with the E. faecium NEF1 DNA. The residues believed to comprise the active site of VanA are conserved in all enterococcal D-Ala-D- Ala ligases, including our isolate (7) (Fig. 1). It will be inter- esting to characterize the entire vanD operon in E. faecium NEF1 to detect potential variations in its organization com- pared to vanD1 to vanD5 operons.  We showed that the vanD gene of our isolate was chromo- somally located as previously described for the other VanD isolates (8). This distribution may contribute to the paucity of VanD-type resistant strains in contrast to the widespread and increasing prevalence of vancomycin-resistant enterococci car- rying vanA or vanB genes in France.
