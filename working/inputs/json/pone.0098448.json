the migration of glioma and endothelial cells, a key process in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis during cancer progression. C6 glioma and human microvascular endothelial cells were treated with conditioned medium from cultures of glioma cells irradiated at a range of doses and the migration of both cell types, tube formation by endothelial cells, as well as the expression and secretion of migration-related proteins were evaluated. Exposure to X-ray radiation-conditioned medium induced dose- dependent increases in cell migration and tube formation, which were accompanied by an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression. However, glioma cells treated with conditioned medium of cells irradiated at a carbon ion dose of 4.0 Gy showed a marked decrease in migratory potential and VEGF secretion relative to non-irradiated cells. The application of recombinant VEGF165 stimulated migration in glioma and endothelial cells, which was associated with increased FAK phosphorylation at Tyr861, suggesting that the suppression of cell migration by carbon ion radiation could be via VEGF-activated FAK signaling. Taken together, these findings indicate that carbon ion may be superior to X-ray radiation for inhibiting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through modulation of VEGF level in the glioma microenvironment.

Radiotherapy, a standard adjuvant  to surgery, improves survival rates in patients, but resistance to  treatment by some gliomas limits the success of clinical application  [2].  High linear energy transfer (LET) heavy ions such as carbon  ions have attracted attention as alternatives to conventional  radiation for radiotherapy\u2014particularly for tumors that are  radiation-resistant under hypoxic conditions\u2014owing to their  superior physical characteristics and high lethality for tumor cells  compared to low-LET radiation such as X- and c-rays [3-4]. Our own studies have shown that carbon ion radiotherapy offers a high  degree of control for targeting tumors and increases progression-  free survival rates without significant radiation-induced toxicity in  skin carcinoma patients [5].  Emerging evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment  contributes to radiation resistance [6] by regulating the levels of  cytokines and growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth  factor (VEGF) [7], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [8], hepatocyte growth  factor (HGF) [9], and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [10], and  promoting extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloprotei-  nases (MMPs) [11].  Due to the scarcity of particle accelerators that can produce  heavy ion radiation, it has not yet been established whether carbon  ions can modify the glioma microenvironment and affect the  migratory behavior of cells during tumor progression and  metastasis. To address this question, the present study evaluated  the contribution of carbon ion radiation to the motility of glioma  and endothelial cells using tumor-conditioned culture medium as  an inducer.  Materials and Methods  Cell culture techniques C6 glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were  grown in Ham's F-12 media (Gibco, Invitrogen Crop, USA)  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone,  China). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1, Amer-  ican Type Culture Collection) were grown in a modified MCDB  131 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) medium containing  20% FBS and 1.0 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma). All cells were  cultured in 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37uC.

Carbon ion irradiation was performed by the equipment at the  Heavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR, Institute  of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou,  China). Glioma cells were exposed to carbon ion irradiation at  energy 350 MeV u 21  and LET 15.4 keV mm21, with a dose rate of 0.5 Gy min  21 . X-rays were from a cabinet X-ray irradiation  system (100 kpv, 3 mA, beryllium window thickness 0.76 mm,  Faxitron X-ray corp.). The dose rate was set to about 1.3 Gy/min.  The film-to-source distance was set to 40.6 cm. Glioblastoma cells  were irradiated with 0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 Gy.  Tumor cell conditioned medium (TCM) and Irradiated conditioned medium (ICM) preparation  To generate TCM, C6 glioma cells were seeded at a density of  56105 cells/25 cm2 culture flasks. At 90% confluence of cell monolayer, culture medium was discarded to remove growth  factors. Thereafter, cells were rinsed with saline solution and fed  with fresh serum-free medium. TCM were collected from sham-  irradiated cells considered as control conditioned medium. To  obtain the ICM, cells were irradiated with carbon ion beams or X-  rays under sterile conditions. And then irradiated cells were  immediately rinsed three times with saline solution and fed with  fresh serum-free medium. After 24 h of incubation, the superna-  tants was harvested and centrifuged at 20006g for 15 min and passed through a 0.22 mm filter to remove cells and cell debris. This supernatant was stocked in 1.5 ml tubes and kept at 280uC.  Transwell migration assays The in vitro cell migration assays were performed by using a  modified Boyden chamber inserted with polyethylene terephthal-  ate filter membrane containing 8 mm pores in 24-well plates (Millipore, Milan, Italy). The upper chamber contained C6 glioma  cells or HMEC-1 cells in serum-free culture medium, and the  lower chamber contained TCM or ICM. After 24 h of incubation,  migrated cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 1 h and then  stained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 10 min and images were  processed using AxioVs40 software (Ver. 4.8.0.0, Carl Zeiss,  Germany). Data were obtained by measuring ten randomly  selected fields of transwell-migrated cells using Image-Pro Plus 6.0  software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).  Gene expression analysis Total RNA was extracted form glioma cells at 24 h after carbon  ion or X-ray irradiation using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life  Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufactur-  er's instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg total RNA using RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Tokyo, Japan)  following the manufacturer's protocols. Real-time polymerase  chain reaction (quantitative PCR) was carried out the SYBR  Premix EX Taq II kit (Takara, China) on an FTC-3000+ instrument (Funglyn Biotech INC, Toronto, ON, Canada). Gene  expression was detected using qPCR primers for VEGF and b- actin which was used to normalize the mRNA and cDNA quantity  and quality. Sequences of the primers are as follows: VEGF sense,  59-GATCATGCGGATCAAACCTCACC-39, and antisense, 59-  CCTCCGGACCCAAAGTGCTC-39; b-actin sense, 59- TGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGTGTGGAT-39, and antisense, 59-  TAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-39. The PCR program  was denatured at 95uC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 5 s, 60uC for 30 s. The fold changes of gene expression of the treatment groups were calculated by the 2  -DDCt method [12].  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay The LDH leakage was determined by using commercially  available kits (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). The  cells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed to release the  intracellular LDH into the new supernatant at 24 h after exposure  to radiation. The supernatant (120 ml) was mixed with 60 ml of LDH reagent solution, sheltered from light and incubated at room  temperature for 30 min. The LDH activity of the medium (LDH  medium) and the cell lysate (LDH cells) were determined using a  colorimetric assay at an absorbance wavelength of 490 nm and a  reference wavelength of 630 nm using an Infinite M200 micro-  plate reader (TECAN, Switzerland). The measured LDH activities  were calculated by percentage of LDH released in the supernatant  to that of cell lysates from intact cells (% LDH released).  Wound-healing assay Cells were seeded in a six-well plate at a concentration of 56105  per well and allowed to form a confluent monolayer. The layer of  cells was scratched with a 1000 ml micropipette tip. Cells were then washed twice with fresh medium and replaced with TCM or  ICM. Cells migrated into the wounded area, and photographs  were taken immediately (0 h) and 24 h. The ability of cell motility  was calculated by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernet-  ics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) in the following way: the area  covered by the migrating cells (24 h)/the wound area (0 h).  Tube formation assay 96-well plates were coated with 60 ml of Matrigel (BD  Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and allowed to solidify at 37uC for 1 h. After the Matrigel solidified, HMEC-1 endothelial cells  (86105 cells/ml) were added in 200 ml of TCM or ICM. The cells were incubated at 37uC with humidified 95% air/ 5% CO2 for 8 h and photographed with the Carl Zeiss. Five randomly selected  microscopic tube length was assayed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0  software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).  Cytokine protein quantification We measured tumor-derived secreted cytokines according to the  manufacturer's instructions. VEGF (ExCell Biology, Inc., Shang-  hai, China), MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,  China) in the TCM or ICM of C6 glioma cells were detected by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).  Western blot analysis Protein sample preparation was basically performed as previ-  ously described [13]. Protein samples were load onto 10%  acrylamide gels for Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then the proteins were trans-  ferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore Corpo-  ration, USA). The membrane was blocked and subsequently  incubated with anti-phospho-FAK antibody (Tyr861, Cell Signal-  ing Technology, MA, USA) and anti-b-actin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., USA). Secondary probes were detected by  ECL Western blot detection reagents (GE Healthcare, USA). And  the images were captured and analyzed by a FluorChem 2  imaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA, USA).  Statistical analysis The results were expressed as means 6 standard error of the  mean (SEM). Multiple comparisons were performed using one-  way ANOVA followed by LSD as a post-hoc test. Statistical  differences between the two groups were analyzed by Student's t-  Carbon Ion Radiation Inhibits Cell Migration  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448    test. A p-value less than 0.05 was selected as a criterion for a  statistically significant difference.  Results  Cancer cell migration and invasion into adjacent tissues, and  intravasation into blood/lymphatic vessels are key events in  malignant tumor progression. To investigate the effect of radiation  on these processes, glioma and endothelial cells were treated with  conditioned media from glioma cell cultures exposed to varying  doses of radiation. Tumor-conditioned media from cultures  exposed to carbon ion radiation suppressed migration by 11.8%  at 2.0 Gy and 17.4% at 4.0 Gy compared to control cells treated  with medium from unirradiated cultures after 24 h of exposure  (Fig. 1A). In contrast, cell migration was markedly enhanced when  media from X-ray-irradiated cultures was used as a chemoat-  tractant (Fig. 1B).  Endothelial cell migration is essential for angiogenesis, a process  that is closely associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progres-  sion. HMEC-1 cells incubated with conditioned media from  carbon ion-irradiated cultures showed a decrease in migration at  4.0 Gy compared to controls (Fig. 2A, C), while in cells incubated  with media from X-ray-irradiated cultures, a dose-dependent  increase in migration was observed compared to control cells  (Fig. 2B).  In later stages of angiogenesis, endothelial cells self-assemble  into tubes to form new blood vessels. To investigate the effect of  radiation on neovascularization, HMEC-1 cells were cultured on  Matrigel-coated plates in the conditioned media. After an 8 h  incubation, control cells formed tubular structures (Fig. 3A, B).  Cells cultured in media from X-ray-irradiated glioma cell cultures  formed a greater number of capillary-like structures than control  cells (Fig. 3B); however, cells exposed to media from heavy ion-  irradiated cells formed fewer tubules than controls (Fig. 3C).  VEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels in conditioned media from  cultures of glioma cells treated with varying doses of X-ray or  carbon ion radiation were evaluated by ELISA. All three proteins  were present at higher levels in the media of X-ray-irradiated  cultures than in unirradiated cell culture medium (Fig. 4). There  were no differences in the secretion of MMP-2 and -9 between  carbon ion-irradiated cells and controls; however, VEGF concen-  tration was 17.5% lower in the medium of cells irradiated with  carbon ion at 4.0 Gy compared to the control culture (Fig. 4A).  To determine whether the altered levels of VEGF protein in  tumor-conditioned media were due to transcriptional upregula-  tion, the VEGF mRNA level in glioma cells was assessed by RT-  Figure 1.

VEGF transcript levels in the 2.0, 4.0,  and 8.0 Gy X-ray radiation groups were higher by approximately  1.44-, 1.79-, and 2.66-fold relative to the control group (Fig. 5A).  In contrast, exposure to carbon ion radiation resulted in the  downregulation of VEGF gene expression at 4.0 (0.4660.09) and  8.0 Gy (0.4860.09). LDH is a sensitive indicator of the metabolic  state of cells, and is rapidly released into the culture medium upon  damage to the plasma membrane. Irradiated glioma cells had  higher LDH activity in the medium compared to unirradiated  control cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, cells exposed to 8.0 Gy carbon ion  radiation had increased LDH in the medium compared to those  exposed to the lower doses of 2.0 and 4.0 Gy, indicating that  higher carbon ion radiation doses produced greater plasma  membrane damage.  To examine the functional significance of altered VEGF level in  the culture medium of irradiated tumor cells, conditioned media  were supplemented with recombinant VEGF165 (50 ng/ml) and  the effect on cell migration was evaluated by wound-healing assay.  The migration of HMEC-1 and C6 glioma cells was increased by  1.31- and 1.58-fold, respectively, in the presence of VEGF165  (Fig. 6C). Moreover, after a 4 h incubation in media from carbon  ion-irradiated cell cultures supplemented with VEGF165, both cell  types showed increases in levels of phosphorylated FAK (Y861)  (Fig. 6D).  Discussion  Radiotherapy with or without surgery is a standard treatment  for malignant gliomas [14]. However, tumor cell responses to  radiation are complex, with evidence suggesting that radiation  from X- and c-rays not only cause the death of tumor cells, but can alternatively lead to the emergence of greater aggressivity and  malignancy, allowing cells to escape the lethal effects of radiation  and remain resistant to conventional therapy [15-16].  Heavy ion radiation therapy has shown promise for the  treatment of head and neck cancers\u2014even those that are resistant  to standard radiation by directly targeting the DNA of tumor cells  [17-18]. In the present study, the effects of high LET carbon ion  and low LET X-ray radiation on glioma and endothelial cell  migration were compared, using tumor-conditioned medium as an  inducer. Media from cultures of C6 glioma cells exposed to 2.0 or  4.0 Gy carbon ion radiation suppressed migration of both cell  types (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that irradiation with heavy ions  can potentially attenuate the growth and metastasis of glioblasto-  mas. In addition, the formation of endothelial cell tubules was  inhibited upon incubation with the same conditioned medium  (Fig. 3), implying that angiogenesis can be similarly blocked.  Carbon ion radiation has been shown to suppress migration and  the formation of capillary-like tube structures in ECV304 and  human umbilical vascular endothelial cells at a dose of 0.1 Gy  Figure 2.

C. Quantification of the number of migratory endothelial cells is expressed as means 6 standard error of the mean from three independent experiments, in which treatments were performed in triplicate. *P,0.05, ***P,0.001 vs. controls (0 Gy). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0098448.g002  Carbon Ion Radiation Inhibits Cell Migration  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448    [19]. In contrast, conditioned media from tumor cells exposed to  X-ray radiation stimulated cell migration and tube formation,  consistent with previous findings [20]. The migration and invasion  of glioma cells into surrounding normal brain tissue and blood  vessels contributes to the limited responsiveness of gliomas to  conventional radiation treatments [21-22]. Thus, for resistant  tumors, carbon ions can offer greater therapeutic effectiveness  compared to X-rays owing to the superior physical properties of  high LET particles that transfer a greater amount of energy per  unit length of track, which consequently increases the spatial  density of energy deposition events [23].  The tumor microenvironment is dynamic and can be altered by  radiation treatment. In accordance with earlier studies [20,24-25],  the present data showed that X-ray radiation enhanced the  secretion of VEGF, a potent angiogenic growth factor [26], as well  as that of MMP-2 and -9, which degrade the basement membrane  and extracellular matrix during tumor cell invasion and metastasis  [27]. In contrast, VEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels were not  significantly increased by carbon ion radiation; indeed, VEGF  secretion was reduced at 4.0 Gy (Fig. 4), implying that carbon ions  may suppress glioblastoma angiogenicity and tumorigenicity by  modulating VEGF production and release into the tumor  microenvironment. However, the secreted VEGF induced by  carbon ion radiation was not dose-dependent, and reached a  minimum at 4.0 Gy. One explanation for this observation is that  the expression of pro-angiogenic genes and disruption of tumor  cell membrane integrity are largely determined by growth factor  secretion. Thus, although VEGF transcript expression was  suppressed at 4.0 and 8.0 Gy carbon ion radiation, the increase  in the permeability of the cell membrane as reflected by LDH  activity in the culture medium was more obvious at 8.0 Gy,  because damage to the plasma membrane at the higher radiation  dose resulted in the release of proteins into the medium.  Therefore, in view of the combined effects of above-mentioned  factors, the minimum production of VEGF in the conditioned  medium was exhibited at 4.0 Gy carbon-ion radiation group.  To identify the mechanism by which carbon ion radiation-  induced VEGF stimulates cell motility, cells were treated with  recombinant VEGF165 and the phosphorylation status of the  downstream factor FAK was examined. FAK is a non-receptor  tyrosine kinase present at cell-cell contacts that is involved in  integrin-mediated signal transduction [28], and tyrosine phos-  phorylation of FAK is required for cell migration [29-30]; VEGF  induces FAK phosphorylation at Y397, Y407, and Y861 [31-32].  Here, the application of exogenous VEGF increased migration in  endothelial and glioma cells concomitant with increased FAK  phosphorylation at Y861 (Fig. 6), indicating that carbon ion  radiation may promote the metastatic and angiogenic potential of  tumors through VEGF/FAK signaling.  In summary, the present results demonstrate that high-LET  carbon ion radiation is superior to low-LET X-rays for suppressing  the migration of glioma and endothelial cells, and thus inhibiting  tumorigenesis and angiogenesis via regulation of VEGF-mediated  signaling in the tumor microenvironment. These findings provide  evidence in favor of carbon ion over X-ray radiation for the  treatment of tumors that are resistant to conventional radiother-  Figure 3.
