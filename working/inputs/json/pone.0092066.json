    "summary": "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity is an essential enzymatic step in the formation of neutral lipid i.e., triacylglycerol in all living cells capable of accumulating storage lipid. Previously, we characterized an oleaginous yeast Candida tropicalis SY005 that yields storage lipid up to 58% under a specific nitrogen-stress condition, when the DGAT-specific transcript is drastically up-regulated. Here we report the identification, differential expression and function of two DGAT2 gene homologues--CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b of this C. tropicalis. Two protein isoforms are unique with respect to the presence of five additional stretches of amino acids, besides possessing three highly conserved motifs known in other reported DGAT2 enzymes. Moreover, the CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are characteristically different in amino acid sequences and predicted protein structures. The CtDGAT2b isozyme was found to be catalytically 12.5% more efficient than CtDGAT2a for triacylglycerol production in a heterologous yeast system i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant strain H1246 that is inherently defective in neutral lipid biosynthesis. The CtDGAT2b activity rescued the growth of transformed S. cerevisiae mutant cells, which are usually non-viable in the medium containing free fatty acids by incorporating them into triacylglycerol, and displayed preferential specificity towards saturated acyl species as substrate. Furthermore, we document that the efficiency of triacylglycerol production by CtDGAT2b is differentially affected by deletion, insertion or replacement of amino acids in five regions exclusively present in two CtDGAT2 isozymes. Taken together, our study characterizes two structurally novel DGAT2 isozymes, which are accountable for the enhanced production of storage lipid enriched with saturated fatty acids inherently in C. tropicalis SY005 strain as well as in transformed S. cerevisiae neutral lipid-deficient mutant cells. These two genes certainly will be useful for further investigation on the novel structure-function relationship of DGAT repertoire, and also in metabolic engineering for the enhanced production of lipid feedstock in other organisms.",

Glucotoxicity mediated by chronic hyperglycaemia is detrimental to the function and survival of pancreatic beta cells. The aim of our study was to determine whether proteasome dysfunction could be involved in beta cell apoptosis in glucotoxic conditions, and to evaluate whether such a dysfunction might be pharmacologically corrected. Therefore, UPS activity was measured in GK rats islets, INS-1E beta cells or human islets after high glucose and/or UPS inhibitor exposure. Immunoblotting was used to quantify polyubiquitinated proteins, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress through CHOP expression, and apoptosis through the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, whereas total cell death was detected through histone-associated DNA fragments measurement. In vitro, we found that chronic exposure of INS-1E cells to high glucose concentrations significantly decreases the three proteasome activities by 20% and leads to caspase-3- dependent apoptosis. We showed that pharmacological blockade of UPS activity by 20% leads to apoptosis in a same way. Indeed, ER stress was involved in both conditions. These results were confirmed in human islets, and proteasome activities were also decreased in hyperglycemic GK rats islets. Moreover, we observed that a high glucose treatment hypersensitized beta cells to the apoptotic effect of proteasome inhibitors. Noteworthily, the decreased proteasome activity can be corrected with Exendin-4, which also protected against glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings reveal an important role of proteasome activity in high glucose-induced beta cell apoptosis, potentially linking ER stress and glucotoxicity. These proteasome dysfunctions can be reversed by a GLP-1 analog. Thus, UPS may be a potent target to treat deleterious metabolic conditions leading to type 2 diabetes.

Although glucose is the main regulator of beta cell functional  mass, it can be deleterious when present in excessive amounts  during prolonged exposure [2]. Such a glucotoxicity is responsible  for apoptosis of beta cells [3], mainly through inducing an  oxidative stress, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and an  inflammatory reaction. Understanding the exact mechanisms that  link glucotoxicity to beta cell apoptosis is crucial for the  preservation of a functional pancreatic beta cell mass.  The ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is one of the major  degradation pathways for maintaining protein homeostasis. It  degrades misfolded, oxidized or damaged proteins, but also  regulates proteins involved in many cellular processes, such as  signal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cell death, and gene  transcription [4,5]. Proteins to be degraded in the UPS are first  tagged with a polyubiquitin chain, then enter the 26S proteasome,  a multicatalytic complex that associates a regulatory complex (19S  proteasome) with a catalytic core (20S proteasome). The 20S  proteasome is a cylindrical structure made of two outer rings of a- subunits and two inner heptameric rings of b-subunits that carry the proteolytic activities, classified as caspase-like (b1), trypsin-like (b2), and chymotrypsin-like (b5), which cleave after acidic, basic and hydrophobic amino acids, respectively [6].  The precise role of UPS in the beta cell remains elusive. UPS  regulates key proteins of the beta cell secretory cascade such as  KATP channels [7], voltage-dependent calcium channels [8], or  proinsulin [9], thus playing a major but complex role in the  regulation of insulin secretion [10,11,12,13]. The role of UPS in  the control of apoptosis/survival balance is also controversial [14].  Indeed, UPS regulates key proteins for beta cell survival such as  IRS-2, MafA, or CREB [15], but also major regulators of  apoptosis such as caspases (review in [16]). High doses of  proteasome inhibitors (PIs), that totally block UPS activities,  induce severe apoptosis in beta cell lines [13,17] but only limited  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/   decrease in viability in human islets [17], have no impact on rat  islet viability [13], or can improve rat islets viability in the presence  of cytokines [13].  A link between an alteration of the UPS and the progression of  diabetes has never been demonstrated. Indeed, proteasome  dysfunction correlates with obesity in humans [10,18,19], and  kidneys from diabetic Akita rats or streptozotocin-injected mice  show a decrease in chymotrypsin-like activity and an increase in  polyubiquinated proteins [20], but this is not seen in others tissus.  Pancreatic islets from Zucker diabetic rats [21] or human diabetic  obese donors [22] also exhibit an increased level of polyubiqui-  tinated proteins, suggesting a default in the elimination of  damaged/misfolded proteins, but the implication of a proteasome  activity default is lacking. A recent study shows a decreased in islets  proteasome activity of type 2 diabetic patients [23] together with a  decrease of UPS proteins transcription and expression. However,  whether hyperglycemic environment is deleterious for beta cells  through an alteration of the proteasome is still unknown.  In this aim, we studied the importance of proteasome  dysfunction as a potential molecular mechanism associated with  beta cell failure in glucotoxic conditions, in the INS-1E beta cell  line and in primary rat and human islets. We chose to explore the  role of ER-stress in this process. Finally, we investigated if this  decreased proteasome activity can be pharmacologically corrected  through the use of GLP-1 analogs. Our results clearly show that  proteasome activity is a key determinant of the survival/apoptosis  balance in beta cells, that could be part of the glucotoxicity  mechanisms involved in diabetes pathophysiology.  Materials and Methods  Ethics statement Male diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and Wistar control rats  were obtained from the Paris colony (GK/Par), and maintained at  the University Paris-Diderot animal core (Agreement A-75-13-17).  The experimental protocol was approved by the institutional  Animal Care and Use Ethical Committee of the Paris-Diderot  University (registration number CEEA-40), in accordance with  accepted standards of animal care as established in the French  National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) guidelines.  Human pancreas were harvested from brain-dead non-diabetic  donors, identified from the CRISTAL register of the Agence de la  Biomedecine, which inventories all graft recipients in France.  Informed consent from the donor family and agreement for  scientific research was obtained through the Departement de la  Coordination Hospitalie\u0300re de Pre\u0301le\u0300vements d'Organes of Mon-  tpellier Hospital. Experiments were performed in agreement with  the Institutional Ethical Committee of the French Agence de la  Biomedecine (ref. PFS13-008).  Cell culture INS-1E beta cells were originally cloned and characterized [24]  by Pr. P. Maechler from the parental rat INS-1 cell line in the  Laboratory of Pr. C.B. Wollheim (CMU, University of Geneva,  Switzerland). INS-1E cells (a kind gift from Pr. P. Maechler) were  cultured between passages 55-90 in RPMI-1640 medium contain-  ing 10 mM glucose and 5% FCS (InVitrogen, St-Aubin,  France)[24]. Cells were grown for four days in RPMI-1640 to  reach 75% confluency, then incubated for 48 hours in RPMI-  1640 medium with glucose ranging from 10 to 33 mM, in the  presence of BSA 0.5% instead of FCS in order to sensitize cells to  glucotoxicity [25]. Proteasome inhibitors MG-132, ALLN,  lactacystin (Calbiochem, VWR, France) or Bortezomib (VelcadeH Janssen, France) were added during the last 16 hours. Exendin-4  was from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Following treatments,  cells were washed in PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (see  composition in [26]) for Western-blot analysis, or in proteasome  lysis solution (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20%  glycerol, 0.05% Nonidet-P40, 1 mM mercapto-ethanol, and  1 mM ATP) for proteasome activities measurement.  Animals Twelve-week-old male non-diabetic Wistar and diabetic Goto-  Kakizaki (GK) rats were maintained at constant temperature (21-  23uC) with a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated as previously  described [27] and groups of 300-500 islets were stored at 280uC until studied. Islets were harvested in similar lysis buffer than INS-  1E for Western-blot analysis or proteasome activities measure-  ment.  Human pancreatic islets processing Human islets were isolated from four brain-dead non-diabetic  donors at the Laboratory for Diabetes Cell Therapy (Montpellier,  France) or the Cell Isolation and Transplantation Center (Geneva,  Switzerland) according to a modified version of the automated  method [28,29]. After isolation, islets were cultured for recovery  during 1-5 days in CMRL-1066 medium (InVitrogen) containing  5.6 mM glucose, 10% FBS, antibiotics and glutamine [15]. For  experiments with proteasome inhibitors, islets were then cultured  during 16 h in RPMI-1640 medium containing 5.6 mM glucose  and 1% human albumin (LFD Biomedicaments, Les-Ulis, France),  and treated like rat islets. For chronic high-glucose experiments,  islets were cultured for 14 days in RPMI-1640 medium containing  5.6 or 33.3 mM glucose, in the absence of FCS but the presence of  0.4 mM palmitate bound to BSA (0.5% BSA, molar ratio  palmitate/BSA = 5:1) in order to sensitize islets to glucotoxicity  [30].  Western-blot analysis Following treatments, INS-1E cells, rat or human islets were  lysed for 30 min at 4uC in a cold lysis buffer as described above, then rapidly sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min.  Supernatants were denatured by boiling them in Laemmli's  sample buffer, normalized for protein content by a BCA assay, and  equal amounts of proteins (25 mg of protein/lane) resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes,  membranes were cut up into 3 or 4 pieces according to the  molecular weights profile, in order to observe simultaneously  different proteins on the same blot. Each piece was incubated with  primary then secondary antibodies, and proteins were visualized  by chemiluminescence detection, as previously described [15].  Band densities were quantitatively analyzed by Image J (NIH,  USA) and normalized to actin, used as our loading control. Anti-  cleaved caspase-3, anti-PARP (Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase), anti-  ubiquitin, anti-CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), and anti-  rabbit IgG antibodies were from Cell-Signaling (Ozyme, St-  Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-proteasome 20S-b5 subunit and anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Santa-Cruz (Tebu-bio,  Le-Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-b-actin was from Sigma- Aldrich (St-Quentin-Fallavier, France).  Proteasome activities measurement Following treatments, INS-1E cells and islets were lysed and  processed for proteasome activity as described [31]. After rapid  sonication, lysates were centrifuged (12,000 g) and supernatants  collected. After proteins level equalization, 5 mg supernatants were  Proteasome Dysfunction Mediates Glucotoxicity in Beta Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066    combined with substrate buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM  EGTA) and 50 mM of each proteasome substrate; Z-ARR-MCA, Suc-LLVY-MCA, and Z-LLE-MCA (Calbiochem) were used to  measure trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like activities,  respectively. The three proteasome activities were distinguished  from background proteolytic activities by using a proteasome  inhibitor that nearly totally inhibit fluorescence changes. The  fluorescence intensity was measured at 380 nm excitation and  460 nm emission with a Flexstation3 Reader (Molecular Devices,  France) using free MCA as standard. Proteasomal activities were  expressed as arbitrary units.  Apoptosis and cell death detection Apoptosis was investigated using immunoblot by evaluating  cleavage of caspase-3 into a 17/19 kDa fragment corresponding to  the active pro-apoptotic form of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP  (a caspase-3 target involved in DNA repair and cell survival) into a  89 kDa fragment. Total cell death was evaluated using the Cell  Death Detection ELISA PLUS  kit (Roche), as per the manufactur-  er's instructions, using 20 ml of culture supernatant. Due to our prolonged treatments ($48 h), DNA fragments will be present in  the supernatant of cells culture as the result of the lysis of late  apoptotic cells as well as necrotic cells. Absorbance was measured  at 405 nm using a Mithras LB940 Reader (Berthold, Thoiry,  Figure 1. Chronic high glucose induces apoptosis and proteasome activities decrease in INS-1E cells. INS-1E cells were cultured for 48 hours at increasing concentrations of glucose ranging from 10 mM (G10) to 33 mM (G33).

Results  Chronic exposure of INS-1E cells to high-glucose affects proteasome activity and ubiquitination  In INS-1E cells, increasing glucose from an optimal (10 mM) to  a supra-physiologic (33 mM) level during 48 h is deleterious and  leads to dose-dependent increases in cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-  PARP (Figures 1A and 1B), and total cell death (Figure 1C).  Besides, this chronic exposure to high-glucose significantly  decreases the 3 proteasome activities, with a 20-25% loss of the  chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities  (Figure 1D). In parallel, the polyubiquitinated proteins level is  increased by 26% in the presence of high glucose, whereas the  20S-b5 proteasome subunit level is not significantly altered (Figures 1E and 1F). Finally, we confirm that endoplasmic  reticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by the two fold increase in  CHOP expression (Figures 1E and 1F), is involved in the increased  apoptosis observed in beta cells submitted to high glucose.  Impaired proteasome activities in hyperglycemic GK rat islets  We assess ex vivo the impact of a hyperglycemic environment on  beta cell proteasome function using the GK rat diabetic model  [32,33]. Pancreatic islets from 5 GK rats exhibiting mild  hyperglycemia (around 9.0 mM) are compared to islets from 9  Wistar control rats exhibiting normoglycemia (around 5.0 mM).  GK rats islets show a slight increase in apoptosis, as revealed by  PARP cleavage (Figures 2A and 2B). More importantly, GK rat  islets display a 25% reduction in caspase-like activity (p,0.01), a  40% reduction in trypsin-like activity (p,0.01), whereas chymo-  trypsin-like activity was not significantly decreased (210%,  p = 0.20) (Figure 2C). This suggests that the hyperglycemic  environment could be linked to decreased proteasome activities  in vivo.  Loss of proteasome activity leads to apoptosis in INS-1E cells  In order to implicate a proteasome dysfunction in beta cell  apoptosis, we treated INS-1E cells with the widely used  proteasome inhibitor (PI) MG-132. In cells cultured into optimal  glucose concentration for survival (i.e. 10 mM), MG-132 (150 nM)  induces a 90, 80 and 50% inhibition of chymotrypsin-like, caspase-  like, and trypsin-like activities, respectively (Figure 3A). This is  accompagnied by a significant increase (+150%) in polyubiquiti-  Figure 2.

In parallel, MG-132 induces the emergence of a caspase-dependent  apoptosis as revealed by the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP  (Figure 3C). The implication of ER stress in the apoptotic effect of  MG-132 is confirmed by the emergence of CHOP expression  (Figure 3C).  The pro-apoptotic effect of PIs is also found using the  structurally different inhibitors ALLN (Figure 3D) and lactacystin  (data not shown). Moreover, increasing MG-132 concentration  from 10 to 1000 nM gradually inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity  (Figure 3E). This sigmoidal-shaped effect shows a low Ki at 50 nM  and a near-total inhibition of UPS activity around 1 mM MG-132. This gradual decrease in proteasome activity is concommittant  with an increase in cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 3F), definitely linking  proteasome dysfunction and apoptosis. Finally, a 50 nM MG-132-  exposure, leading to a minimal loss of proteasome activity about  20%, is sufficient to induce apoptosis (Figure 3G). Interestingly,  chymotrypsin-like activity and apoptotic level are similarly affected  in INS-1E cells exposed either to low dose (50 nM) of MG-132 or  Figure 3. Pharmacological inhibition of proteasome induces polyubiquitinated proteins accumulation and caspase-dependent apoptosis in INS-1E cells.

Thus, slight  impairment of UPS activity in beta cells induced similar apoptosis  than high-glucose exposure.  Chronic high-glucose induces apoptosis and proteasome dysfunction in human islets  In human islets, a 14 days-chronic high glucose (33 mM)  exposure clearly induces a three-fold increase in total cell death  (Figure 4A) and an increase in apoptosis as seen by caspase-3 and  PARP cleavage (Figure 4B). More importantly, all the three  proteasome activities were significantly reduced by 40-50% in  high glucose-exposed islets (Figure 4C). Finally, polyubiquitinated  proteins and CHOP expressions increase in these glucotoxic  conditions (Figure 4B), thus confirming the presence of an ER  stress linked to UPS dysfunction in human islets.  Loss of proteasome activity leads to apoptosis in human islets  In human islets, MG-132 (0.05-1 mM) induces a progressive decrease in chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, without  significantly affecting trypsin-like activity (Figure 5A). In parallel,  MG-132 dose-dependently increases the expression of polyubiqui-  tinated proteins, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP  (Figure 5B and 5C). These effects are also found with 5 mM lactacystin or 100 nM bortezomib (data not shown). Thus PIs, by  reducing proteasome activities, clearly induce polyubiquitinated  proteins accumulation and the emergence of a caspase-dependent  apoptotic program through the promotion of ER-stress in rodent  beta cells and human islets.  Chronic exposure of INS-1E cells to high-glucose induces hypersensitivity to proteasome inhibitors  We further investigated the role of combination of high-glucose  exposure and proteasome inhibitors on beta cells. While 150 nM  MG-132 induces a slight but significant apoptosis in INS-1E cells  cultured in 10 mM glucose medium (Figure 6A), this same  concentration of MG-132 induces a drastic apoptosis in INS-1E  cells cultured at high-glucose, as evidenced by the 8-fold increase  of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP (Figure 6B). However, the  polyubiquitinated proteins level induced by MG-132 is similarly  high in normal or high-glucose concentrations (Figure 6C) as if a  ceiling was reached. Similar results on apoptosis are obtained with  ALLN (Figure 6D and 6E) or lactacystin (data not shown). This  drastic increase of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors coupled to  high glucose culture reveals hypersensitivity of beta cells to UPS  inhibition in glucotoxic conditions.  Exendin-4 prevents proteasome activity dysfunction and protects INS-1E cells from apoptosis  We finally investigated whether pharmacological agents that  activate PKA in beta cells, such as the GLP-1 analog Exendin-4,  could positively interact with proteasome activities. First, in INS-  1E cells cultured into optimal 10 mM glucose medium, Exendin-4  does not significantly modify the chymotrypsin-like activity  (Figure 7A), nor the others proteasome activities (data not shown)  or the cleaved caspase-3 expression (Figure 7B).  Then, in INS-1E cells cultured in the presence of chronic high-  glucose (33 mM), we observe, as expected, an increased caspase-  dependent apoptotic program, decreased UPS activities, and  accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins (Figure 7C and 7D). In  these glucotoxic conditions, Exendin-4 (25 nM) clearly improves  cell survival, with a significant reduction in the emergence of  cleaved caspase-3 induced by high-glucose (236%, p,0.05)  (Figure 7C). Of importance, Exendin-4 also prevents proteasome  dysfunction induced by high-glucose as shown on chymotrypsine-  like activity (Figure 7D) and other proteasome activities (data not  shown). Noteworthily, Exendin-4 tends to decrease (p = 0.13 vs.  G33 alone) the polyubiquitinated levels observed in the presence of  chronic G33 (Figure 7C). Finally, this protective effect of Exendin-  4 is dose-dependent on both proteasome activity and cell survival,  reaching an optimum at 25 nM (Figure 7E).  Figure 4. A chronic high glucose treatment decreases protea- some activities and increases apoptosis in human islets. Human islets were cultured for 14 days in RPMI medium containing an optimal (5.6 mM, G5) or a high (33 mM, G33) glucose concentration.

We report here  that a chronic exposure of rat beta cells or human islets to high-  glucose concentrations leads to a decrease in the proteasome  activity and to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins.  This inhibition of UPS activity leads to beta cell apoptosis in a  dose-dependent manner. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of  UPS in the context of glucotoxicity drastically increases these  apoptotic effects, drawing the concept of hypersensitization of beta  cells to proteasome inhibitors (PIs). UPS activity -in this context of  glucotoxicity- can be partially restored by Exendin-4.  First, we demonstrate that glucotoxic conditions can alter  proteasome activities. This major finding must be connected to a  previous study [20] showing that proteasome activities were  decreased in endothelial cells cultured in high-glucose medium,  and in kidney cells from diabetic mice but not in other tissues. We  show here that this cell type-specific phenomenon can also affect  beta cell population. Accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins  has been previously observed in several models of diabetic beta  cells [21,22], suggesting indirectly an UPS alteration in hypergly-  cemic environment. However, authors attributed this accumula-  tion either 1) to a default in the autophagy system [21], or 2) to a  deficiency in the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L1 [22]. Our  results clearly indicate that a decrease in proteasome activity is also  implicated in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins  observed in beta cells submitted to a glucotoxic environment.  When studying proteasome function in beta cells, special  attention should be paid to the specific proteasome activity  observed. Here we observed that the inhibitory effect of MG-132  on trypsin-like activity is less important in INS-1E cells and totally  absent in human islets compared to the chymotrypsin-like and  caspase-like activities. Indeed proteasomes are very heterogeneous  protein complexes: differences exists in the molecular assembly of  the catalytic active b subunits, as well as differences in their posttranslational modifications and in the presence of distinct  associating partners [34]. Thus, each cell contains a specific set of  proteasome subtypes, exhibiting specific proteasomal activities that  strongly vary between tissues and age in the same animal, and  express different susceptibilities to proteasome inhibitors such as  MG-132 [35]. In this context, it was very recently noticed that  trypsin-like activity shows the greatest interspecies difference [36].  Finally, in both INS-1E and human islets, the decrease of two of  the three proteasome activities in the presence of MG-132 is  enough to induce a global decrease of proteasome activity as  observed with the increase in polyubiquitinated protens level.  The other main point of this study is that the inhibition of  proteasome activity can have per se a deleterious impact on beta  cell survival. Noteworthily, this pro-apoptotic effect of PIs exists  even for a slight 220%- reduction of proteasome activity, the same  percentage of inhibition induced by high-glucose culture or 50 nM  MG-132. Our results are in accordance with previous studies  Figure 5. Pharmacologic inhibition of proteasome activity in human islets increases apoptosis. Human islets were treated for 16 hours with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 at increasing concentrations from 50 nM to 1 mM. Four independent experiments were conducted using human islets from four independent islets isolations (4 different donors). A: Chymotrypsin-like, caspase-like, and trypsin-like activities were measured in the lysates of human islets treated or not with MG-132. Results are presented as means 6 SEM and expressed as a percentage of the value without MG-132. B: Levels of polyubiquitinated proteins, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, and actin were analyzed by Western blotting in human islets after 16 hours of culture.

Results are expressed as a percentage of the value without MG-132. *P,0.05, **P,0.01, and ***P,0.001. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092066.g005  Proteasome Dysfunction Mediates Glucotoxicity in Beta Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066    showing that high doses of PIs reduce viability of clonal MIN6 and  INS-1E beta cells [13,17]. For entire islets, the literature data were  controversial, as a decrease in viability was observed in human  islets cultured with epoxomycin [17], whereas lactacystin had no  impact on beta cell viability of young rats [13]. We confirm here  that immortalized cell lines are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic  effect of PIs than primary cells, even if the latter can still be  impacted by higher dose of PIs [37].  We show that inhibition of proteasome activity in beta cells  could be a new link between glucotoxicity and apoptosis. This  phenomenon -via genetic predisposition or epigenetic regulation-  may thus exist in diabetic patients, participating in beta cell  dysfunction. Indeed, Bugliani et al. [23] recently showed that UPS  genes and activity were particularly altered in beta cells of type 2  diabetic patients. Our study underlines the direct effect of high-  glucose on UPS dysfunction, at a molecular level (probably at a  post-traductional level) and not, as suggested in the latter study, at  a transcriptional level. This is compatible with the hypothesis of  Queisser et al. [20] suggesting that glycation of the 20S-b5 proteasome subunit by high-glucose treatment could affect its  activity. Further studies should be done to confirm this hypothesis.  Endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stresses are widely known  to be the main mechanisms of glucotoxicity [38,39], even if  cytokine production [40] or hypoxia also represent others putative  stressors (review in [2]). Besides, the role of proteasome inhibition  in glucotoxicity is poorly defined. Indeed, the relationships  between ER and proteasome are complex since they can influence  each other. In our study, UPS dysfunction directly participates in  triggering ER stress, CHOP expression, caspase cleavage and  apoptosis onset. This results confirms previous studies showing  that proteasome inhibition by MG-132 or bortezomib can induce  ER stress, thus activating caspases cleavage and apoptosis in  cancerous or primary epithelial cells [41,42]. However, the  opposite is also true since Menendez-Benito et al. [43] first  observed in a panel of UPS reporter cell lines as well as in an in vivo  transgenic mice model that ER stress could have an inhibitory  Figure 6.

In brief, proteasome inhibition by MG-132 or  high-glucose exposure could induce ER stress and apoptosis, but  ER stress alone could also induce a progressive proteasome  inhibition in parallel to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Taken  together, this suggests that the glucotoxic-induced proteasome  dysfunction observed in our study could be placed both above and  below ER stress in the cascade leading from chronic hyperglyce-  mia to beta cell apoptosis and diabetes.  UPS dysfunction and proteasome activity inhibition can  promote neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington and  Alzheimer diseases, both characterized by protein misfolding,  aggregates accumulation, and ER stress increase. Diabetes is often  compared to them because of islet amyloidosis, supposed to be due  to the UPS dysfunction [22]. Here, our study clearly reinforces the  parallel between diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases through  the demonstration of the role of UPS dysfunction and ER stress in  beta cells exposed to high glucose.  Depending on situations and cell types, UPS may play more  than a simple role of garbage collector and can direct cell function  and survival. In lymphocytes, glioma cells or hematopoietic  progenitor cells, UPS is placed at the top of the apoptotic  machinery, upstream of the mitochondrial and caspase activation  [44,45]. Our results support a similar central role of UPS in the  beta cell apoptosis machinery. Indeed, in our study, glucotoxic  conditions - mainly via ER and oxidative stresses- added to  decreased proteasome activity with PIs led to a drastic apoptosis.  This observation is compatible with the recent concept of  sensitization already described on myeloma cells cultured with  Figure 7. Exendin-4 partially prevents chronic high glucose-induced apoptosis and proteasome dysfunction in INS-1E cells.

The sensitivity of myeloma cells to  apoptosis induction by PIs varies greatly between cell types and  correlates with expression levels of proteasome subunits and/or  the proteasome activity itself, as a result of a balance between  proteasome workload and degradation capacity [46]. Similarly,  high-glucose-treated beta cells display a decrease in proteasome  activities together with an increased workload in insulin synthesis  and secretion. In glucotoxic conditions, it seems thus logical that  UPS inhibition can lead to an over-workload, majored ER stress,  and drastic apoptosis. That confirms that the maintenance of UPS  integrity is a key player in the misfolded protein clearance and in  the regulation of essential functions of beta cells. This beta cell  hypersensitivity to PIs under glucotoxicity could have clinical  implications, suggesting hypersensitivity of diabetic patients to  proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib used in myeloma. Indeed,  PIs efficacy may be reinforced on cancerous cells, but their adverse  effects -peripheral neuropathy or anemia- may be more numerous  and severe in diabetic patients [47].  Finally, the demonstration that the GLP-1-receptor agonist  Exendin-4 preserves proteasome activity from the deleterious  effects of chronic high glucose reinforces the fact that the  preservation of UPS activity is crucial for beta cell survival,  especially in glucotoxic conditions. Moreover, a parallel exists  between Exendin-4 dose-responses on proteasome activity increase  and caspase-3 cleavage reduction. This restoration of UPS activity  by a GLP-1 analogue can be explained by the role of PKA in beta  cells. Indeed, GLP-1 analogues act through PKA in beta cells and  PKA has been shown to be a direct activator of proteasome  activity [48,49]. This opens the possibility to increase in vivo the  activity of GLP-1 analogues with activators of UPS.  In conclusion our work integrates UPS as a new key player in  the mechanism of glucotoxicity in beta cells. We report here that  chronic high-glucose exposure decreases proteasome activities in  beta cells, leading to UPS dysfunction. Proteasome dysfunction  could be part of the glucotoxic mechanisms through inducing ER  stress and apoptosis. Apoptotic hypersensitization of beta cells  exists when pre-existing glucotoxicity and UPS inhibition are  added: this creates a vicious circle resulting in increased apoptosis  of beta cells. GLP-1 analogues can help stopping this vicious circle.  Our results suggest that proteasome function constitutes an  important and underestimated target for restoring pancreatic beta  cell survival and GLP-1 analogues efficacy.
