    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

However, the molecular mechanisms  underlying the tumor-promoting properties of CAFs in gastric cancer remain unclear.  Here, we show that CAFs isolated from gastric cancer produce significant amounts of  interleukin-6 (IL-6). CAFs enhances the migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells through  the secretion of IL-6 that activates Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators  of transcription (JAK2/STAT3) pathway in gastric cancer cells, while deprivation of  IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody or inhibition of JAK/STAT3 pathway with specific  inhibitor AG490 markedly attenuates these phenotypes in gastric cancer cells induced by  CAFs. Moreover, silencing IL-6 expression in CAFs or inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 pathway in  gastric cancer cells impairs tumor peritoneal metastasis induced by CAFs in vivo. Taken  together, these results suggest that CAFs in the tumor microenvironment promote the  progression of gastric cancer through IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling, and IL-6 targeted  therapy could be a complementary approach against gastric cancer by exerting their  action on stromal fibroblasts.  INTRODUCTION  Gastric cancer, one of the most common primary  malignant tumors, is the third leading cause of cancer  death in worldwide with the highest estimated mortality  rates in Eastern Asia [1]. Despite advances in early  detection, diagnosis, and treatment of gastric cancer, the  overall prognosis is still poor and the 5-year survival for  patients with gastric cancer has remained 20-25%, which  is due to the recurrence and metastasis after surgery [2]. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms  in promoting the progression of gastric cancer will  be helpful to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and  treatment of gastric cancer.  Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a well- characterized embryological process, has been identified  to play a critical role in tumor progression, including  invasion and metastasis, by which cancer cells could  gain more aggressive properties. In the process of EMT,  epithelial cells undergo a phenotypic switch by lossing   their cell polarity and the epithelial markers (E-cadherin,  \u03b2-catenin), to form mesenchymal cells through acquiring  the mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, ZEB2),  thus these transformed epithelial cells acquire fibroblast- like properties and exhibit reduced cell-cell adhesion  and increased motility [3-5]. The enhanced motility and  invasiveness afforded by EMT is critical in the initiation of  metastasis for cancer progression, and the acquisition of a  mesenchymal phenotype has been also enhanced resistance  to chemotherapy and poor prognosis [6, 7].The expression  of these EMT markers can be induced by a number of  growth factors/cytokines such as hepatocyte growth factor  (HGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, CXCL12 and  hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) [8-11].  Accumulating evidence has indicated that  interactions between tumor and stromal cells create a  unique microenvironment that is essential for tumor growth,  invasion, and metastasis [12, 13]. Therefore, epithelial cell- stromal cell interactions usually act as the regulators of EMT,  and the factors inciting EMTs are often originated from the   Research Paper    Oncotarget20742www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget  stromal cells creating the tumor microenvironment. Cancer- associated fibroblasts (CAFs), the important components  of tumor stroma, are the key players in regulating tumor  progression [12, 13]. It has been observed that CAFs actively  communicate with cancer cells through growth factors or  inflammatory cytokines such as HGF, IL-6, TGF-\u03b2, VEGF,  FGF, and CXCL12 that can promote tumorigenesis and  progression [12-16]. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that  was originally determined to be a regulator of immune and  inflammatory responses [17] and has been also reported to  be associated with certain epithelial tumors such as colon  cancer, prostate cancer [18, 19]. Aberrant production and  signaling of IL-6 is tightly linked to tumor generation and  poor disease outcome in many cancer types, including gastric  cancer. IL-6 exerts its effects by binding to IL-6\u03b1 chain and a  common cytokine receptor signal-transducing subunit gp130,  which leads to activation of the Janus kinases (JAKs) family  of tyrosine kinases and the signal transducers and activators  of transcription (STAT) family, particularly STAT3 [20].  Activation of IL-6-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway plays an  active role in the oncogenesis of a variety of tumors [21-23].  Previous studies have demonstrated that STAT3 is activated  in gastric cancer tissues. Menheniott TR, et al. detected  STAT3 in antral biopsies, and have demonstrated that  both total STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 increased in  intestinal-type gastric cancer compared with normal stomach.  Zhang XM et al also found that activated STAT3 is positive  in early gastric cancer, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma  and metastatic lymph node tissues [24, 25]. However, the  role of CAFs and IL-6 in gastric cancer has not been well  addressed. Therefore, our aim was to determine how CAFs  can enhance tumor metastasis and EMT changes of gastric  cancer cells, and link CAFs with activation of the IL-6-JAK- STAT3 signaling pathway in the progression of gastric cancer.  In this study, we find that CAFs isolated from gastric  cancer produce considerable amounts of IL-6. CAFs-derived  IL-6 enhances the migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells  by the activation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway in gastric cancer  cells, while deprivation of IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody  or inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 pathway with specific inhibitor  AG490 markedly reduces these phenotypes in gastric  cancer cells induced by CAFs. Moreover, knockdown the  expression of IL-6 in CAFs by RNAi or inhibiting JAK2/ STAT3 pathway in gastric cancer cells by the specific  inhibitor AG490 significantly retards the tumor peritoneal  metastasis induced by CAFs in vivo. These results suggest  that suppressing IL-6 or its downstream targets could serve  as an effective therapeutic strategy against gastric cancer by  exerting their action on stromal fibroblasts.  RESULTS  IL-6 is highly expressed in CAFs in the tumor  microenvironment of gastric cancer  Cancer-associated stroma secretes a plethora of  factors such as HGF, IL-6, TGF-\u03b2 to promote the growth   and invasion of the underlying tumor [16]. It has been  reported that IL-6 is associated with certain epithelial  tumors. To determine the expression level and cellular  source of IL-6 in gastric cancer, we first detected IL-6  expression in both serum and cancer tissues in gastric  cancer patient by ELISA. As shown in Figure 1A,  IL-6 levels in the serum of gastric cancer patients were  significantly elevated in comparison with healthy  volunteers. Similarly, the expression level of IL-6 was  also significantly higher in the cancer tissues compared  with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (Figure 1B). To  further illustrate which cell component(s) in gastric  cancer tissues is (are) responsible for the high expression  of IL-6, we detected IL-6 expression in tissues by  immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Figure 1C,  the expression of IL-6 was noted in stromal cells of peri-  and intra-tumoral areas rather than in the cytoplasm or  the nucleus of the cancer cells. Anti \u03b1-SMA antibody  are used to identify CAFs. Upon immunofluorescence  staining, we identified both \u03b1-SMA and IL-6 expressing  stromal cells in peri- and intra-tumoral areas (Figure 1C).  We further quantified expression levels of IL-6 in CAFs,  normal fibroblasts (NFs) and gastric cancer cells (SNU-1,  MKN45, SGC7901 and MKN28) by ELISA. We found  IL-6 level were significantly higher in CAFs compared to  NFs and gastric cancer cells (Figure 1D). These findings  suggest that IL-6 is overexpressed in gastric cancer and  CAFs is one major cell source in producing IL-6 in the  tumor microenvironment of gastric cancer.  CAFs enhance the migration of gastric cancer  cells via the secretion of IL-6  We examined the migration of gastric cancer cells  induced by CAFs, a key determinant of metastasis in  tumor progression. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, SGC- 7901 cells co-cultured with CAFs showed enhanced  ability of migration than SGC-7901 cells alone (SGC- 7901 cells alone, 15.8 \u00b1 5.0 cells per field; SGC-7901  cells co-cultured with CAFs, 156.4 \u00b1 55.5 cells per field;  P < 0.01). However, adding neutralizing IL-6 antibody  into the co-culture system led to significantly decreased  migration (neutralizing IL-6 group, 93.6 \u00b1 24.9 cells per  field; isotype control group, 179.0 \u00b1 41.9 cells per field;  P < 0.01) of SGC-7901 cells. Similarly, MKN28 cells  co-cultured with CAFs also exhibited higher ability of  migration than MKN28 cells alone (MKN28 cells alone,  10.6 \u00b1 7.3 cells per field; MKN28 cells co-cultured with  CAFs, 48.8 \u00b1 15.4 cells per field; P < 0.01), while the  migratory ability of MKN28 cells co-cultured with CAFs  was significantly reduced by the addition of anti-IL-6  neutralizing antibody (neutralizing IL-6 group, 27.2 \u00b1  17.7 cells per field; isotype control group, 53.0 \u00b1 20.8  cells per field; P < 0.01) (Figure 2A and 2C). Moreover,  we determined the migration ability of gastric cancer  cells induced by exogenous IL-6. Gastric cancer cells  stimulated by IL-6 showed enhanced ability of migration     Oncotarget20743www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget  compared with gastric cancer cells alone (Supplementary  Figure 1). Thus, these data suggest that CAFs enhance the  migration of gastric cancer cells via the secretion of IL-6.  CAFs promote EMT changes of gastric cancer  cells via the secretion of IL-6  EMT, a well-characterized embryological process,  has been identified to play a critical role in tumor  metastasis, which is characterized by losing epithelial  markers (e.g. E-cadherin), and acquiring of mesenchymal  markers (e.g. N-cadherin, ZEB2) [5].To examine the role  of CAFs in mediating EMT in gastric cancer cells, we  cultured SGC-7901 cells or MKN28 cells with CAFs in  a previous described co-culture system [14]. As shown in   Figure 3A and 3B, co-culture of CAFs with SGC-7901  cells markedly decreased the expression of E-cadherin  and simultaneously increased the expression of N-cadherin  and ZEB2 in SGC-7901 cells. The similar phenotype  changes of EMT were also occurred in MKN28 cells after   co-cultured with CAFs (Figure 3A and 3B). To determine  whether IL-6 contributes to the EMT effect of CAFs  on gastric cancer cells, we added the IL-6 neutralizing  antibody into the co-culture system. As shown in  Figure 3A and 3B, EMT induced by CAFs was impaired  when the IL-6 was abolished by its specific neutralizing  antibody, which was demonstrated by inhibition of  E-cadherin decrease, and N-cadherin or ZEB2 increase.  These data suggest that CAFs promote the EMT of gastric  cancer cells via the secretion of IL-6.  Figure 1: IL-6 is highly expressed in gastric CAFs.

Oncotarget20745www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget  CAFs-derived IL-6 mediates the migration and  EMT of gastric cancer cells via the activation of  JAK2/STAT3 pathway  The canonical IL-6 signal transduction pathway is  initiated by binding to IL-6R and phosphorylation STAT3  through the activation of JAK2. To interrogate the role of  IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway in mediating CAFs-induced  migration and EMT changes of gastric cancer cells, we  first explored the activation of IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway  in gastric cancer cells after co-culture with CAFs. As   shown in Figure 4A-4D, CAFs significantly induced  the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in both SGC- 7901 cells and MKN28 cells. In contrast, adding IL-6  neutralizing antibody or JAK-2 protein tyrosine kinase  inhibitor AG490 into the co-culture system significantly  reversed CAF-mediated phosphorylation of JAK2 and  STAT3 in gastric cancer cells (Figure 4A-4D). We further  examined whether block the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by  AG490 could also inhibit the tumor-promoting effects on  gastric cancer cells via the secretion of IL-6 by CAFs. As  shown in Figure 4B and 4D, inhibition of JAK2-STAT3   Figure 4: CAFs-derived IL-6 enhances the migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells via the activation of JAK2/ STAT3 pathway. (A, B) Protein levels of p-STAT3, STAT3, p-JAK2 and JAK2 in both SGC-7901 and MKN28 co-cultured with CAFs  in the presence of IL-6 neutralizing antibody or AG490 were analyzed by western blot.

Oncotarget20746www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget  pathway activation by AG490 significantly dampened  cell migration (Figure 4E) and EMT (Figure 4F and 4G)  induced by CAFs. These results indicate that IL-6-JAK2- STAT3 signal pathway plays an important role in CAFs- induced migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells.  Blocking IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway impairs  the peritoneal dissemination and metastasis of  gastric cancer cells induced by CAFs in vivo  Peritoneal metastasis is a prevalent form of  recurrence and metastasis in advanced gastric cancer. We  further determined the contribution of IL-6-JAK2-STAT3  pathway to the peritoneal dissemination and metastasis  of gastric cancer cells in vivo. CAFs were transiently   transfected with human IL-6 siRNA (siIL-6) or with  control scrambled siRNA (siNC). Knockdown of IL-6  expression in CAFs with IL-6 siRNA was confirmed by  qRT-PCR and ELISA assay (Figure 5A and 5B). We then  mixed CAFs with gastric cancer cells in a 1:4 ratio and  intraperitoneally inoculated them into immunodeficient  nude mice. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, SGC-7901  cells mixed with CAFs-siIL-6 developed fewer peritoneal  metastases than those developed by SGC-7901 cells mixed  with CAFs-siNC (P < 0.05). We next examined whether  inhibiting the activation of JAK2-STAT3 pathway by  AG490 could also impair peritoneal metastasis induced by  CAFs in vivo. We observed fewer peritoneal metastases of  the CAFs/SGC-7901/AG490 group but not in CAFs/SGC- 7901 group (Figure 5C and 5D). These results indicate   Figure 5: Blocking IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway impairs tumor peritoneal dissemination and metastasis induced by  CAFs in vivo. (A) IL-6 mRNA levels in CAFs treated with siRNA or siNC were detected by qRT-PCR. (B) IL-6 protein concentration  in the medium conditioned by CAFs treated with (siIL-6) or control siRNA (siNC) were measured by ELISA. (C) SGC-7901 cells and  SGC-7901 cells mixed with CAFs that were transfected with IL-6 siRNA (siIL-6) or control siRNA (siNC) were inoculated into nude mice.  Mice co-injected with SGC-7901 cells and CAFs were administered i. p with AG490 (500 \u03bcg/100 ul/mouse) or equivalent concentration of  DMSO once a week. The peritoneal nodules (red arrows) were observed after 30 days (N = 5 per group). (D) Average peritoneal nodules  from nude mice are shown. Data are representative of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.    Oncotarget20747www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget  that IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway is required for peritoneal  dissemination and metastasis of gastric cancer cells  induced by CAFs in vivo, and pharmacologic blocking  IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric cancer  could reduce peritoneal dissemination and metastasis  induced by CAFs.  DISCUSSION  CAFs, the activated fibroblasts in cancer stroma, are  the most abundant cells in the tumor microenvironment.  Accumulating evidences demonstrate that CAFs play  a prominent role in tumor growth and progression, and  could be a promising tool to cancer therapeutics [26].  Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular  mechanism for the tumor-promoting prosperities of CAFs  is of obvious importance for understanding in gastric  cancer progression and finding novel strategies to it. In this  study, we demonstrate that IL-6 secreted by CAFs plays  an important role in the progression of gastric cancer. We  show that CAFs derived-IL-6 promoted the migration and  EMT of gastric cancer cells via the activation of JAK2- STAT3 pathway, and blocking this pathway with IL-6  neutralizing antibody or JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490  impaired gastric cancer metastasis induced by CAFs  in vivo. Therefore, the activation of JAK2-STAT3 pathway  by IL-6 may play a central role in the interplay between  CAFs and gastric cancer cells.  Previous studies have shown that cancer-associated  stroma secretes a plethora of factors which promote  the growth and invasion of the underlying tumor [16].  IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that was originally  determined to be a regulator of immune and inflammatory  responses [17]. Increasing evidences have suggested that  IL-6 plays a critical role in modulating the function and  activity of tumor-associated immune cells. For example,  IL-6 inhibits the differentiation of dendritic cells, activates  a Th17 cell response promoting tumorigenesis and  expands myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) [27].  In contrast to the effects of IL-6 on tumor-associated  immune cells, IL-6 is also a direct critical driver of tumor  growth and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that  aberrant expression of IL-6 is tightly linked to tumor  generation and poor disease outcome in many cancer  types, including gastric cancer [18, 19, 28]. In this study,  we reveal that IL-6 was overexpressed in both serum and  cancer tissue of gastric cancer patients, and significantly  higher expression was found in stromal fibroblasts. These  results indicate CAFs is the major cell source in producing  IL-6 in the tumor microenvironment of gastric cancer.   Interestingly, although NFs secreted lower IL-6  than CAFs, it also produced abundant IL-6 and significant  higher than that from gastric cancer cells. Cancer- associated fibroblasts can be activated in incipient  neoplasia to orchestrate tumor-promoting inflammation in  an NF-kB-dependent manner [12, 29, 30]. Tissue-resident   fibroblasts are suggested as precursors for CAFs, activated  by tumor and immune cell-derived factors to express pro- inflammatory genes such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and SDF-1.  We previously showed that H. pylori infection induces  the secretion of PGE2 by gastric epithelial cells that  consequently silences stromal miR-149. The silence of  miR-149 removes the suppression of its target gene IL-6,   leading to elevated level of IL-6 that acts on fibroblasts to  stimulate the transformation of NF into CAF [31]. Thus,  cancer cells take advantage of the enormous plasticity  of stromal fibroblasts and produce multiple signals that  generate a tumor-promoting microenvironment.  EMT is an important embryonic process that is  hijacked by tumor cells to facilitate execution of most of  the invasion-metastasis cascade. Recently, Yadav et al.  have shown that IL-6 induces EMT changes in head  and neck tumor by up-regulating snail expression [32].  Breast cancer cells that constitutively expressed Twist,  a EMT regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of  E-cadherin, exhibited aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3  activation [33]. Initiation of metastasis requires tumor  cell migration and invasion, which is enabled by EMT.  In the present study, we have shown that IL-6 secreted  by CAFs induced EMT of gastric cancer cells, which is  characterized by losing epithelial markers E-cadherin and  acquiring of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and ZEB2.  Then these EMT changes contribute to the enhanced  capability of active locomotion of gastric cancer cells,  which is demonstrated by increased migratory ability  triggered by CAFs.  IL-6 exerts its effects by binding to a cell-surface  type I cytokine receptor complex consisting IL-6a  chain (CD126) and a common cytokine receptor signal- transducing subunit gp130, which forms a complex to  activate STAT3 with the phosphorylation of Tyr705  via the JAK signaling pathway [20, 34]. Accumulating  evidences show that activation of IL-6-JAK2-STAT3  signaling pathway by growth factors or cytokines plays  an active role in tumor growth and progression. However,  the role of CAFs and IL-6 in gastric cancer has not  been well addressed. Our present study has shown that  CAFs induced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3  of gastric cancer cells via the secretion of IL-6, and  inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 pathway activation with AG490  significantly impaired cell migration and EMT, as well as  peritoneal dissemination and metastasis in vivo induced by  CAFs. CAFs are known to secrete multiple growth factors  and chemokines such as SDF-1, VEGF, FGF, and CXCL14  into the tumor microenvironment that promote the growth  and invasion of the underlying tumor by triggering  multiple pathways [14, 35-37]. In the present study, we  found that IL-6 neutralizating antibody partly suppressed  the STAT3 or JAK2 phosphorylation, which suggested that  IL-6 contributed partially to the tumor-promoting effect of  CAFs on GC cells. Although we cannot preclude the likely  involvement of other growth factors and/or cytokines, the     Oncotarget20748www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget  studies of neutralizing IL-6 or inhibiting JAK2-STAT3  pathway activation with AG490 reveal that IL-6 is an  important mediator in tumor-promoting effects of gastric  CAFs that promotes EMT and peritoneal metastasis via  the activating JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric  cancer.   In summary, we find that the crosstalk between  gastric cancer cells and their stromal cells-CAFs  contributes to tumor progression through IL-6-JAK2- STAT3 signaling. Recently, anti-IL6 directed therapies  have been used clinically to treat various diseases, such  as rheumatoid arthritis [38]. Thus, our results suggest that  IL-6 targeted therapy could be a complementary approach  against gastric cancer by exerting their action on stromal  fibroblasts.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Patient samples and cell lines  Plasma samples were collected from 66 preoperative  gastric cancer patients, and 24 age-matched healthy  volunteers. Gastric cancer tissues were obtained from  73 patients, between 2009 and 2012 at Ruijin hospital,  School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University. None  of the gastric cancer patients received radiotherapy or  chemotherapy before surgery. Informed consent was  obtained from each patient and healthy control for the use  of their blood samples in this study. All the tissue samples  were identified by clinical pathologist.  Gastric cancer cell lines SNU-1, MKN45, SGC7901  and MKN28 were purchased from Shanghai Institutes  for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences,  and were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere  of 5% CO2 with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10%  fetal calf serum with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml  streptomycin. Fibroblasts were isolated from 4 independent  gastric cancer patients during radical gastric resection as  previous described [14].  Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)  The protein levels of IL-6 in plasma and tissue  lysates were measured by an ELISA kit (R&D Systems,  Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturer's  instructions.  Immunofluorescence  Tissues were fixed in 10% neutralized formalin  and embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections (4 \u03bcm) were  dewaxed with xylene and rehydrated with gradient  ethanol, and then gently rinsed with phosphate buffered  saline (PBS) for three times. After blocking with normal  nonimmune goat serum for 30 min, tissue sections were  incubated with anti-\u03b1-smooth-muscle actin and anti-IL-6   antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, USA) at 37\u00b0C for 2 h.  After 5 times rinses with PBS, cells were stained with  appropriate Alexa dye-conjugated secondary immune  reagents, Alexa dye-conjugated phalloidin, and Hoechst  33342 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Negative control  staining was performed by omission of the primary  antibody.   Quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR)  Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent  (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the  manufacturer's manual. RNA (1 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed  into cDNA using Reverse Transcription system (Promega,  Madison, WI, USA). QRT-PCR was performed to  quantify IL-6 mRNA level with the SYBR Green PCR  core Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA,  USA). GAPDH was used as the endogenous reference.  Data were analyzed by using the comparative Ct method.  Specificity of resulting PCR products was confirmed  by melting curves. The primers used in this assay were:   IL-6: 5\u2032-CGGTCCAGTTGCCTTCTCCC-3\u2032 (upper) and  5\u2032-GAGTGGCTGTCTGTGTGGGG-3\u2032 (lower); GAPDH:  5\u2032-GGACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAG-3\u2032 (upper) and  5\u2032-GTAGCCCAGGATGCCCTTGA-3\u2032 (lower).  Cell migration assay  Cell migration assays were performed by using 8 \u03bcm  transwell chambers (Corning Life Science, MA, USA).  Cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h and  then were added to the upper chamber, and 5 \u00d7 104 CAFs  in 500 \u03bcl in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS  were added to the lower chamber. Non-migrating cells  from the interior of the inserts were removed with cotton- tipped swabs 48 h later, and cells that migrated to the  bottom of the membranes were stained with 0.1% crystal  violet for 30 min. The stained cells were counted and  photographed. At least ten randomly selected fields were  counted and the average number was presented.   Western blot analysis  Cells were lysed with RIPA cell lysis buffer in  the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma,  USA). The same amount of protein samples were  loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto  PVDF membranes. After blocked by skim milk, the  membranes were incubated in the primary antibodies  diluted by TBST buffer for overnight at 4\u00b0C and then  in the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at  room temperature. Finally the protein bands images were  captured by a Tanon detection system with ECL reagent  (Thermo). The primary antibodies used in the experiments  were Anti-GADPH, anti-E-cadherin, anti-N-cadherin, and  anti-ZEB2 antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.    Oncotarget20749www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget  RNA interference   Human IL-6 siRNA and scrambled siRNA (Santa  Cruz, CA, USA) at the final concentration of 100 nmol/L  were transfected into CAFs cells with Lipofectamine  2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells  were collected for further assay at 24 h and 48 h after  transfection.  Tumor xenograft model and tumorigenicity  assay  Male BALB/c nu/nu nude mice at the age of  4-5 weeks (Institute of Zoology Chinese Academy  of Sciences), were housed at a specific pathogen-free  environment in the Animal Laboratory Unit, Shanghai Jiao  Tong University School of Medicine, China. Fibroblasts  and SGC-7901cells were mixed at the ratio of 1:4 within  0.25 ml PBS and inoculated peritoneally. Some mice were  administered i.p with AG490 (500 ug/100 ul/mouse) or  equivalent concentration of DMSO once a week. All mice  were sacrificed after 30 days and peritoneal metastasis  nodules were counted. All animal studies were conducted  with the approval of the Committee on Animal Care in  Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.  Statistical analysis  Results were summarized as means \u00b1 SD. Student   t test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was  used to analyze the data and the significance level was set  at P \uff1c 0.05.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  The authors made no disclosures.
