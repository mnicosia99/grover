Anderson2, Feroz R. Papa3, Peter M. Haggie1*  1 Department of Nephrology, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America, 2 Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, San  Francisco State University, San Francisco, California, United States of America, 3 Lung Biology Center, Diabetes Center, and California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences,  University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California, United States of America  Abstract  Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections are associated with high mortality rates and occur in diverse conditions including pneumonias, cystic fibrosis and neutropenia. Quorum sensing, mediated by small molecules including N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl) homoserine lactone (C12), regulates P. aeruginosa growth and virulence. In addition, host cell recognition of C12 initiates multiple signalling responses including cell death. To gain insight into mechanisms of C12-mediated cytotoxicity, we studied the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in host cell responses to C12. Dramatic protection against C12-mediated cell death was observed in cells that do not produce the X-box binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s). The leucine zipper and transcriptional activation motifs of XBP1s were sufficient to restore C12-induced caspase activation in XBP1s- deficient cells, although this polypeptide was not transcriptionally active. The XBP1s polypeptide also regulated caspase activation in cells stimulated with N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserine lactone (C14), produced by Yersinia enterolitica and Burkholderia pseudomallei, and enhanced homoserine lactone-mediated caspase activation in the presence of endogenous XBP1s. In C12-tolerant cells, responses to C12 including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a were conserved, suggesting that C12 cytotoxicity is not heavily dependent on these pathways. In summary, this study reveals a novel and unconventional role for XBP1s in regulating host cell cytotoxic responses to bacterial acyl homoserine lactones.

P. aeruginosa is the fourth most-commonly isolated  nosocomial pathogen and infections can be fatal, particularly in  immuno-compromised subjects such as those with burns or  undergoing chemotherapy [1,2,3,4]. Chronic conditions including  cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-CF bronchiectasis  are also associated with P. aeruginosa infection [5,6,7]. Antimicro-  bials are currently used against P. aeruginosa; however, infections  are typically refractory to therapeutic interventions [8]. Further-  more, drug resistant P. aeruginosa strains have been isolated and  biofilm formation in chronic conditions enhances antimicrobial  resistance and pathogenicity [9,10]. As such, there is urgent need  to understand mechanisms of P. aeruginosa virulence and for new  strategies to combat infections [10,11].  The process of quorum sensing (QS) has evolved as a  mechanism by which bacterial communities sense cell density  and consequently regulate processes such as growth, biofilm  formation and expression of virulence factors [12,13]. Bacteria  synthesize small, diffusible molecules to coordinate QS and a  major signal generated by P. aeruginosa is N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)  homoserine lactone (C12, Figure 1A). In addition to regulating P.  aeruginosa responses, C12 activates host cell responses via a process  termed inter-kingdom signalling [14]. C12 is cytotoxic in a dose  dependent manner in macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts and  epithelial cells [15,16,17,18]. Additional C12-activated host  responses include phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated  protein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation  initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) and synthesis of c-jun mRNA [17]. C12 represses transcriptional activation of nuclear factor k-light chain- enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) -responsive genes in stimulated macrophages, T-cells and fibroblasts [19,20,21]. In  contrast, C12 has also been reported to intrinsically activate pro-  inflammatory responses, including elevation of prostaglandin E2  and cyclooxygenase 2 levels, in certain cell types [22,23]. Finally,  C12 affects calcium homeostasis by releasing calcium stores from  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [18,24,25].  Knowledge of how host cells recognize and respond to C12 is  incomplete, although it is believed that C12 may interact with  multiple host targets in a cell-type dependent manner [14]. The  bitter taste receptor T2R38 was recently demonstrated to  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576    recognize C12 [26]. Stimulation of T2R38 by C12 activates  mucociliary clearance and nitric oxide production to facilitate  bacterial clearance and killing in primary airway epithelial cultures  [26]. Polymorphisms in the T2R38 gene associated with Gram-  negative sinonasal infections were demonstrated to reduce airway  responsiveness to C12 indicating that C12-host interactions are  pathologically relevant [26]. C12 is cell permeable and members  of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor nuclear hormone  receptor family have been proposed to respond to C12 [27]. In  contrast, it has been suggested that C12 and other similar acyl  homoserine lactones interact directly with host cell membranes to  alter membrane polarity and consequently mediate cellular  responses [28]. Although innate immune system receptors are  capable of recognizing diverse pathogen-derived molecules, Toll-  like receptors (TLRs) and the nucleotide-binding, oligomerization  domain (NOD)-like receptors Nod1 and Nod2 are not required for  C12 recognition [17].  The overall objective of this study was to gain insight into how  C12 causes cell death. Several C12-induced cellular responses,  including morphological changes to ER structure, phosphorylation  of eIF2a and disruption of calcium homeostasis, are characteristic of ER stress [17,24,25]. ER stress typically activates intrinsic  apoptosis [29,30] and additional C12-initiated responses including  cytochrome c release, mitochondrial depolarization and caspase 9  activation, suggest that this pathway is involved in C12 cytotoxicity  [17,18,25]. As such, we tested the hypothesis that ER stress  initiates C12-mediated cell death. Unexpectedly, these studies  identified the X box-binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s)  as a major regulator of C12-mediated cell death. In this study, we  report that: (i) XBP1s regulates C12 cytotoxicity by a novel, non-  transcriptional mechanism; (ii) XBP1s mediates cellular responses  to C12 and similar acyl homoserine lactones in a cell type-  independent manner and; (iii) C12-mediated cellular responses  occur via XBP1s-dependent and independent pathways.  Results  Deletion of inositol-requiring enzyme 1a is protective against C12-mediated cell death  Three sensors monitor ER protein folding stress; PERK (protein  kinase RNA-like ER kinase), IRE1a (inositol-requiring enzyme 1a) and ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) [30,31]. Of these  sensors, PERK and IRE1a have been associated with ER stress- activated apoptotic responses [31,32,33]. Therefore, to investigate  the role of ER stress response pathways in C12 cytotoxicity, wild  type (wt) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and knockout  MEFs that do not express PERK (Perk 2/2  ) or IRE1a (Ire1a 2/2  )  were challenged with C12 and cytotoxic responses characterized.  Significant cell death was observed in C12-treated wt MEFs  (,40% at 4 hours), as assessed by comparison of cell labelling with the supravital dye calcein before and after C12-treatment  (Figure 1B, first panels, and Figure 1C). The response of Perk 2/2  MEFs to C12 was similar to that in wt MEFs indicating that C12  cytotoxicity is not dependent upon PERK activity (Figure 1B, third  panels, and Figure 1C). In contrast, Ire1a 2/2  MEFs were resistant  to C12 cytotoxicity suggesting that C12-induced cell death is  IRE1a-dependent (Figure 1B, fourth panels, and Figure 1C). RT- PCR and western blot analysis was performed to verify the identity  of knockout cell lines used in these studies (Figure 1B, right).  Caspase (cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease) acti-  vation has previously been implicated in C12-mediated cell death  [17,18]; however, caspases have not definitively been demonstrat-  ed to mediate C12 cytotoxicity. As such, caspase activity in C12-  challenged MEFs was characterized to further investigate the  mechanism of C12 cytotoxicity. In wt MEFs, the pan-caspase  inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited C12-cytotoxicity (,90% cells remained at 4 hours) suggesting that cell death requires caspase  activation (Figure 1B, second panels and Figure 1C, grey bar). Several  families of cysteine proteases can be inhibited by z-VAD-fmk;  however, inhibition of cathepsin B (CA-074-Me) or calpain  (ALLN) did not reduce C12 toxicity in wt MEFs (Figure S1A).  As such, z-VAD-fmk effects in C12-treated MEFs were caspase  specific and C12 cytotoxicity is dependent upon caspase activa-  tion. Direct measurements of executioner caspase (caspase 3 and 7)  activity in MEF cell lines stimulated with 25 mM C12 indicated that Ire1a deletion dramatically reduced caspase activation relative to wt and Perk  2/2 MEFs (Figure 1D). Reported concentrations of  C12 in liquid culture and biofilms vary from 5 to 600 mM [21,34]; therefore, we assessed caspase activation in wt MEFs in response  to low C12 concentrations (Figure 1E and Figure S1B).  Executioner caspase activation was significantly enhanced by  4 hour treatment with low C12 concentration (5 mM and 10 mM C12 produced ,2-fold and ,5-fold increases respectively) and progressively increased with higher C12 doses. Taken together,  these studies indicate that C12-cytotoxicity in MEFs: (i) requires  caspases such that cell death can formally be classified as  apoptosis, (ii) is highly dependent on IRE1a activity and, (iii) is independent of PERK activity.  IRE1a deletion indirectly prevents C12 apoptosis IRE1a is a transmembrane protein that resides in the ER and  contains cytoplasmic kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activ-  ities [30,35]. During homeostatic conditions, IRE1a RNase activity is limited, although it does mediate sequence specific,  non-conventional splicing of a pre-mRNA (Xbp1u) to generate  mature mRNA (Xbp1s) that encodes the X-box binding protein 1  transcription factor (XBP1s) [30,33,35]. Xbp1u pre-mRNA also  encodes XBP1u protein that binds to and regulates XBP1s stability  [36]; the internal location of the Xbp1u splice site dictates that  XBP1u and XBP1s share a common amino terminus. During  periods of irremediable ER stress, as observed in pathological  conditions such as neurodegeneration and type II diabetes, IRE1a becomes hyper-activated leading to apoptosis driven by promis-  cuous IRE1a RNase activity and/or activation of apoptosis signal- regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and its downstream target c-jun NH2-  terminal kinase (JNK) [33,37,38,39].  Author Summary  Chronic and acute infections associated with P. aeruginosa constitute a major healthcare burden. Antimicrobial approaches are currently used against P. aeruginosa; however, infections are typically refractory to treatment and drug resistant strains have been isolated. As such, there is urgent need to understand mechanisms of P. aeruginosa virulence and for new strategies to fight infections. The P. aeruginosa-derived quorum-sensing molecule C12 is recognized by host cells and initiates stress responses including cytotoxicity. In this study, the X- box binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s) was identified as a host factor critical for apoptotic responses initiated by C12 and other similar quorum sensing molecules. Additional C12-initiated host responses, includ- ing phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eIF2a were found to be of lesser importance for C12-initiated cytotoxicity. These studies have broad implications for our understand- ing of bacterial virulence mechanisms and for develop- ment of potential new strategies to combat infections.  XBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576    Treatment of wt MEFs with STF-083010, a selective and  irreversible inhibitor of IRE1a RNase activity [39,40], did not inhibit C12-mediated toxicity or caspase 3/7 activation (Figure 2A,  left and Figure 2B). Similarly, treatment of wt MEFs with a JNK  inhibitor (SP600125) did not reduce C12 cytotoxicity (Figure 2A,  right) or activation of caspase 3/7 (Figure S1C). A prerequisite for  IRE1a-mediated apoptotic signalling is IRE1a activation, a process that involves oligomerization and trans-autophosphory-  lation [33,37]. Therefore, to further investigate a possible role of  IRE1a in C12-mediated cytotoxic responses, IRE1a activity was directly assessed using a luciferase-based reporter (XBP1-luc). The  XBP1-luc reporter encodes cDNA containing the Xbp1u pre-  mRNA splice site fused upstream of a luciferase gene ([41], see also  MATERIALS AND METHODS). In the absence of IRE1a activity, an \u2018in-frame' stop codon prevents luciferase expression  (Figure 2C, top left); however, upon IRE1a-mediated pre-mRNA splicing (which removes 26 nucleotides), the stop codon is shunted  \u2018out-of-frame' and luciferase is expressed to report IRE1a activity (Figure 2C, bottom left). In wt MEFs expressing XBP1-luc, IRE1a activity was not increased above control levels after 2 hours of C12  stimulation (Figure 2C, right). In contrast, exposure of cells to  thapsigargin, a known ER stress-inducing agent, produced  significant enhancement of IRE1a activity over the same time frame (Figure 2C, right). Treatment of wt MEFs for 2 hours with  C12 or thapsigargin produced relatively little cell loss (,10%,  Figure S1A). Data obtained in an additional cell type suggested  that the absence of significant IRE1a activation in response to C12 stimulation is a generalized phenomenon (Figure S1D). In  summary, these studies: (i) provide pharmacological evidence that  IRE1a is not directly involved in C12-mediated cytotoxicity and, (ii) demonstrate that C12 stimulation of cells does not significantly  activate the IRE1a ER stress sensor. Ire1a  2/2 MEFs synthesize Xbp1u pre-mRNA; however, Xbp1u  splicing and XBP1s protein are undetectable in this cell type  indicating that IRE1a is uniquely responsible for processing of Xbp1u pre-mRNA in MEFs ([33,42], see also Figure S2A). As such,  C12 cytotoxic responses were assessed directly in Xbp1 2/2  MEFs  to test the hypothesis that reduced C12 cytotoxicity in Ire1a 2/2  MEFs results from loss of XBP1s function(s). C12 stimulation of  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs produced little apparent reduction in cell density  Figure 1. Deletion of Ire1a prevents C12 cytotoxicity. A.

The identity of  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs used in these studies was confirmed by RT-PCR  and western blot analysis (Figure 2D, bottom). Additional experi-  ments were performed to characterize the apparent tolerance of  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs to C12 cytotoxicity. Treatment of wt MEFs with  C12 produced time- and dose-dependent increases in caspase 3/7  activity, similar to observations made in other cell types  [15,16,17,18] (Figure 2E, black bars). In contrast, caspase 3/7  activation only increased by ,2-4-fold in Xbp12/2 MEFs stimulated with 25 mM C12 for up to 8 hours or with C12 concentrations increasing to 100 mM (Figure 2E, grey bars). Similar results were obtained in Ire1a  2/2 MEFs although control  experiments verified that levels of executioner caspases in  Xbp1 2/2  and Ire1a 2/2  MEFs were similar to those in wild type  cells (Figure S1E and data not shown). As such, these studies  indicate that C12 cytotoxicity requires the presence of XBP1s and  that reduced levels of the XBP1s do not merely alter the kinetics or  sensitivity of cellular responses to C12.  To investigate whether XBP1s loss-of-function was directly  responsible for C12 tolerance, Xbp1 2/2  and Ire1a 2/2  MEFs were  transiently transfected with Xbp1 cDNA and responses to C12  were characterized. As predicted from direct measurement of  executioner caspase activation, treatment of wt MEFs with C12  produced robust caspase 3-cleavage that could be detected by  immunostaining (Figure 3A). Similarly, as expected from mea-  surements of executioner caspase activity, cleaved caspase 3 was  essentially absent in C12-stimulated Xbp1 2/2  and Ire1a 2/2  MEFs  (Figure 3B and C, left panels). Transfection of Xbp1 2/2  MEFs with  cDNA encoding either Xbp1u pre-mRNA (which can be processed  by IRE1a; Figure 3B, middle) or Xbp1s mRNA (Figure 3B, right) restored caspase 3 cleavage upon C12 treatment in a large number  of cells. In contrast, transfection of Ire1a 2/2  MEFs with Xbp1s  cDNA (Figure 3C right), but not Xbp1u cDNA (which is present  endogenously but remains unspliced, Figure 3C, middle), restored  caspase-3 cleavage upon C12 treatment. In control experiments,  C12-treatment of Xbp1 2/2  MEFs transfected with an empty  plasmid was not associated with caspase 3-cleavage, verifying that  transfection of this cell type was not responsible for caspase  activation (Figure S1F). Taken together, these experiments  indicate that expression of XBP1s in XBP1s-deficient MEFs  (Xbp1 2/2  or Ire1a 2/2  MEFs) is sufficient to re-establish C12-  mediated caspase cleavage.  C12-mediated apoptosis does not require XBP1s transcriptional activity  XBP1s is a member of the cAMP response element-binding  protein (CREB)/ATF basic region-leucine zipper family of  transcription factors and, consistent with this function, XBP1s is  modular containing a polybasic region, a leucine zipper motif and  a transcriptional activation domain [36] (Figure 4B). Therefore,  experiments were conducted to investigate whether XBP1s  transcriptional activity was required for C12-mediated apoptosis.  Treatment of wt MEFs with inhibitors of transcription (actino-  mycin) or translation (cycloheximide) during C12 stimulation did  not prevent caspase activation (Figure 4A). As such, in response to  C12-stimulation, neither acute activation of XBP1s transcriptional  activity nor acute protein synthesis of an XBP1s-dependent  transcript are responsible for C12-induced apoptosis.  To gain insight into the role of XBP1s domains in C12-  mediated apoptosis, a series of XBP1s truncation constructs were  generated (Figure 4B). In wt MEFs, XBP1s is predominantly  localized to the nucleus, although in agreement with prior  biochemical analysis, low levels of XBP1s could also be detected  in the cytoplasm [36] (Figure 4C and Figure S2B). Deletion of the  amino terminus and polybasic region from XBP1s produced a  truncation construct (XBP1D1) that was distributed throughout the  cell (Figure 4B and 4C). When expressed in Ire1a 2/2  or Xbp1 2/2  MEFs, XBP1D1 was able to re-establish caspase 3 cleavage upon  C12 treatment (Figure 4D, left). In a similar manner, an XBP1s  truncation construct that consisted of only the leucine zipper and  transcriptional activation domains (XBP1D2) was distributed  throughout the cell (Figure 4B and 4C) and restored caspase 3  cleavage in C12-stimulated Ire1a 2/2  and Xbp1 2/2  MEFs  (Figure 4D, middle). A truncation construct encompassing the  amino-terminal domains of XBP1s (XBP1N, Figure 4B) failed to  re-establish caspase 3 cleavage in C12 stimulated Ire1a 2/2  or  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs (Figure 4D, right). As such, consideration of C12-  mediated caspase 3-cleavage in XBP1s-deficient MEFs expressing  XBP1D2 or XBP1N suggested that the transcriptional activation  domain of XBP1s contains a protein sequence that is responsible  for C12-mediated caspase activation. However, instability of  additional XBP1s truncation constructs that were generated  precluded further analysis to identify a minimal XBP1s region  that is necessary for C12-mediated caspase 3-cleavage. For  instance, truncation constructs such as those that encode the  XBP1s transcriptional activation domain and carboxy-terminus or  the XBP1s transcriptional activation domain alone could not be  detected by immunocytochemistry or western blot analysis (Figure  S2C and data not shown). As such, our analysis indicates that the  leucine zipper and transcriptional activation domains of XBP1s  (XBP1D2) constitute a minimal XBP1s region that can be stably  expressed and is sufficient for caspase activation in C12-treated  Ire1a 2/2  or Xbp1 2/2  MEFs.  Next, experiments were performed to assess the ability of XBP1s  truncation constructs to mediate transcriptional activity. In these  assays, wt MEFs were co-transfected with an XBP1s-responsive  luciferase reporter and either XBP1s or an XBP1s truncation  construct [43,44]. As expected, robust transcriptional responses  were observed when XBP1s was co-expressed with the reporter  (Figure 4E). In contrast, XBP1N, which lacks a transcriptional  activation domain, was not associated with transcriptional activity  (Figure 4E). The XBP1D1 and XBP1D2 truncation constructs that  restore caspase 3-cleavage in C12-treated Ire1a 2/2  and Xbp1 2/2  MEFs were also not associated with XBP1s-dependent transcrip-  tional activity (Figure 4E and Figure S2A). Taken together, these  studies indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptional  activation domains of XBP1s (XBP1D2) constitute a minimal,  stable XBP1s fragment that restores caspase activation upon C12  stimulation in XBP1s-deficient cells and; (ii) C12-mediated  apoptosis does not require XBP1s-transcriptional activity.  XBP1s regulates a common mechanism for acyl homoserine lactone-mediated caspase activation  Acyl homoserine lactones are a common chemical scaffold used  by diverse bacterial species for QS [12]. Therefore, experiments  were performed to investigate if XBP1s-dependent mechanisms  mediate cellular responses to N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserine  lactone (C14, Figure 5A), a QS molecule generated by the gram-  negative, pathogenic bacteria Yersinia enterolitica and Burkholderia  pseudomallei. Treatment of wt MEFs with C14 produced significant  cell death, as assessed by calcein AM fluorescence (Figure 5B, left),  and activation of executioner caspases (Figure 5C, right). In  contrast, Ire1a 2/2  MEFs were largely resistant to C14-mediated  cytotoxicity (Figure 5B, right) and demonstrated significantly  reduced caspase activation (,20%) relative to wt cells (Figure 5C, right). As expected from direct measurements of  caspase activity, robust cleavage of caspase 3 could be detected in  XBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576    C14-treated wt MEFs; however, cleaved caspase 3 immunostain-  ing was largely absent in Ire1a 2/2  MEFs (Figure 5D). Transfection  of Ire1a 2/2  MEF cells to express either XBP1s or XBP1D2 restored caspase 3-cleavage in C14 treated cells (Figure 5D), as  observed in C12-treated cells.  Studies were also performed to investigate whether XBP1D2 affects cytotoxic response to acyl homoserine lactones in other cell  types. A Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cell line was generated that was  highly enriched for expression of XBP1D2 (FRT-XBP1D2,  Figure 5E, left). Treatment of FRT-XBP1D2 with C12 or C14  resulted in increased activation of executioner caspases relative to  control cells (FRTcon, Figure 5E, right). Similarly, enhanced  caspase activation was observed in a Hela cell line enriched for  XBP1D2 expression upon treatment with C12 or C14 (Figure 5F).  It is noteworthy that in all cell types studied C14 produced higher  levels of caspase activation than C12. Studies with further acyl  homoserine lactones indicated that acyl chains of .12 carbon  atoms and substitution at the third carbon of the acyl chain are  required for toxicity (Figure S3). Taken together, these experi-  ments indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptional  activation domains (XBP1D2) of XBP1s regulate activation of  caspases in response to different homoserine lactones and, (ii)  XBP1D2 results in increased caspase activation in the presence of  endogenous XBP1s.  C12 activates alternative cellular responses via XBP1s- independent mechanisms  C12 activates multiple stress response signalling pathways in  host cells [14,17]. The observation that Ire1a 2/2  and Xbp1 2/2  MEFs are protected from C12-induced cell death afforded the  opportunity to investigate whether distinct cellular signalling  responses are associated with or unrelated to C12 cytotoxicity.  Phosphorylation of eIF2a and p38 MAPK have previously been reported in primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells  [17]. In agreement with this study, increased phospho-eIF2a (p- eIF2a; ,2.5-fold change) and phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK; ,2.5-fold change) could also be detected in wt MEFs after C12 exposure for 45 minutes (Figure 6A, top panels). A similar  pattern of phosphorylation of eIF2a and p38 MAPK was observed in C12-treated Ire1a  2/2 and Xbp1  2/2 MEFs (Figure 6A, middle and  bottom panels; ,2.5 and ,3-fold increases in p-eIF2a, and ,2.5  Figure 2.

As both Ire1a  2/2 and Xbp1  2/2 MEFs are resistant to C12 cytotoxicity,  these studies also suggest that phosphorylation of p-eIF2a and p- p38 MAPK does not contribute greatly to C12-mediated cell  death in MEFs. Consistent with this notion, inhibition of p38  MAPK activity (using SB203580 or SB202190) did not inhibit C12  cytotoxicity or caspase 3/7 activation in wt MEFs (data not  shown).  PERK phosphorylates eIF2a during periods of ER stress [32]; therefore, experiments were performed to investigate whether  PERK is activated by C12. Phosphorylation of eIF2a was, however, preserved in C12-treated Perk  2/2 MEFs (Figure 6B,  top; ,3-fold increase). As expected, control experiments confirmed that ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA) produced p-eIF2a in wt MEFs (,4-fold increase) but not Perk2/2 MEFs (,0.9-fold change) (Figure 6B, middle and bottom). Together, these studies  indicate that C12 challenge activates alternative kinase(s) activity  to generate p-eIF2a; however, they do not formally demonstrate that PERK does not contribute to eIF2a phosphorylation.  Levels of c-jun mRNA have also been reported to increase in  C12-treated primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells  [17]. In wt MEFs, c-Jun protein levels increased by approximately  two-fold after 90 minutes treatment with 25 mM C12 (Figure 6C, left, and Figure 6D). In contrast, c-Jun protein levels were not  altered by C12 in Ire1a 2/2  or Xbp1 2/2  MEFs (Figure 6C, middle  Figure 3.

D. Number of cells showing cleaved caspase 3 immunostaining after C12 treatments. Data is shown for wt MEFs (white bars) and Xbp1  2/2 and Ire1a  2/2 MEFs transiently  transfected with cDNA encoding XBP1u (black) or XBP1s (grey) in the presence and absence of C12 (25 mM, 2 hours).

At present, these studies cannot  distinguish whether c-Jun levels increase in wt MEFs in an XBP1s  (or IRE1a) -dependent manner or due to C12-mediated cytotox- icity; however, these studies confirm that C12 cytotoxicity is  associated with increased c-Jun levels. It is noteworthy that in  unstimulated conditions, c-Jun levels in wt and knockout MEFs  varied by approximately three-fold; as such, elevated levels of c-  Jun, at least in the absence of XBP1s, are not sufficient to mediate  C12 cytotoxicity. These studies indicate that C12-mediated host  cell responses occur via both XBP1s-dependent and -independent  mechanisms and C12-mediated production of p-eIF2a and p-p38 MAPK in MEFs does not contribute greatly to cell death.  Discussion  Infections associated with P. aeruginosa result in significant  mortality and constitute a major worldwide healthcare burden.  Our understanding of P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms is  limited and there is an urgent need to identify new approaches  that can be employed to reduce P. aeruginosa infectivity. P.  aeruginosa employ QS to regulate growth, virulence factor  expression and biofilm formation. In addition to quorum  signalling, P. aeruginosa-derived C12 homoserine lactone activates  several host cell responses including cytotoxicity. The major  conclusion of this study is that C12-mediated host cell cytotoxic  responses largely require expression of the XBP1s transcription  factor (Figure 7). Cell death and caspase activation were  dramatically reduced (,95%) in cells that cannot generate XBP1s (Ire1a  2/2 MEFs) or lack the XBP1 gene (Xbp1  2/2 MEFs).  To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first  description of cells that are C12-tolerant due to genetic ablation  of a protein. Restoring XBP1s expression in either Ire1a 2/2  or  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs was sufficient to re-establish caspase 3 cleavage  upon C12 stimulation. Although the present study does not  provide full mechanistic detail, we demonstrate that a fragment of  XBP1s encompassing the leucine zipper and transcriptional  Figure 4.

Knockout  cell lines were used to incisively demonstrate the role of XBP1s in  homoserine lactone-mediated cell death; however, expression of  XBP1D2 in rat and human epithelial cells resulted in enhanced  caspase activation in response to C12- and C14-stimulation,  indicating that XBP1s can mediate apoptotic responses in distinct  cell types. Further experiments will be required to establish that  XBP1s regulates C12-mediated apoptosis in cells that are exposed  to P. aeruginosa, including macrophages, neutrophils and airway  epithelial cells; however, XBP1s is expressed at high levels in  these cells [45].  The concentration of C12 observed in liquid cultures is ,5 mM and biofilms may generate up to ,600 mM C12 [21,34]. Caspase  Figure 5.

Cellular responses, including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK  and eIF2a were reported in cells exposed to 5-10 mM C12 [17]. In vivo studies indicate that low concentrations of C12 (1-10 mM) produce profound responses [46]. Furthermore, it has been  proposed that host cells may be exposed to high local C12  concentrations generated by P. aeruginosa structures including  micro-colonies and biofilms [47,48]. The only rigorous validated  C12 receptor is T2R38, this bitter taste receptor is activated by  C12 to stimulate host antimicrobial responses including nitric  oxide synthesis and mucociliary clearance [26]. In human subjects,  common loss-of-function polymorphism in T2R38 were linked to  host susceptibility to sinonasal gram-negative bacterial infections,  suggesting that T2R38 is a key determinant of upper airway innate  defense mechanisms [26]. In primary cell cultures, TR238-  mediated antimicrobial responses were stimulated by C12 in the  concentration range 10-100 mM. As such, we predict that C12 concentrations considered in these studies will be clinically  relevant. Formal verification that C12-mediated cytotoxicity  enhances P. aeruginosa virulence will require identification of  pharmacological tools that can be used to block caspase activation  in vivo.  XBP1s is a member of the CREB/ATF basic region-leucine  zipper family of transcription factors and performs pleiotropic  transcriptional functions. Approaches including expression profil-  ing and chromatin immunoprecipitation have revealed that  XBP1s regulates gene expression for both constitutive and  inducible arms of ER stress response pathways; however,  XBP1s-responsive promoter regions also regulate expression of  genes involved in signal transduction, redox homeostasis, cell  growth and differentiation and carbohydrate metabolism  [35,44,49]. Studies in knock-out mice have revealed that XBP1s  is essential for hepatogenesis, B lymphocytes differentiation,  cardiac myogenesis and development of exocrine tissue  [50,51,52,53]. Targeted deletion of XBP1s in murine intestinal  epithelial cells results in enhanced inflammatory responses and  Figure 6. XBP1-independent cellular responses to C12. A.

Role of XBP1s in C12-mediated cellular responses. Activation of caspases is dependent upon XBP1s, albeit by a mechanism that does not involve transcription. Phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eIF2a is XBP1s-independent. Stimulation of cells with C12 does not activate IRE1a and presumably does not activate other ER stress response pathways. No inferences about c-Jun synthesis can be drawn from the current study. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003576.g007  XBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576    Xbp1 polymorphisms are associated with Crohn's disease and  ulcerative colitis [54]. In C. elegans, P. aeruginosa-mediated PMK-1  p38 MAPK activation during development induces ER stress that  is lethal in the absence of XBP1s [55]. In general, these studies  indicate that XBP1s typically acts in a protective manner to restore  cellular homeostasis when protein load on the ER is excessive [35].  XBP1s function has, however, been linked to cell death and over  long time courses (days) increased levels of XBP1s have been  associated with apoptosis in endothelial and pancreatic b cells [56,57]. The current study represents the first descriptions of an  unconventional (non-transcriptional) role for XBP1s and of a  function for XBP1s in regulating acute apoptosis.  Additional insights into the role of cell stress response pathways  in C12 stimulated cells are afforded by the present study  (summarized in Figure 7). Activation of ER stress response  pathways has been proposed as a mechanism by which C12  initiates host cell responses [14,48]. Direct assessment of IRE1a splicing activity and pharmacological inhibition of apoptotic  pathways that are initiated by IRE1a suggests that C12 does not activate IRE1a. An additional inference that can be drawn from these observations is that \u2018house-keeping' levels of XBP1s are  sufficient to mediate apoptotic responses to C12. However, it is  noteworthy that immune responses initiated by P. aeruginosa (via  TLR4 and TLR5) will result in IRE1a-activation and increased levels of XBP1s [58]. ER stress-induced PERK activation has also  been proposed to be responsible for C12-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation; however, robust eIF2a phosphorylation was observed in Perk  2/2 MEFs suggesting that an alternative kinase(s)  catalyzes this response. Although the present studies do not  formally rule out PERK-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation, this scenario seems unlikely given that: (i) C12-mediated IRE1a ER stress responses are negligible, (ii) PERK and IRE1a sense ER stress by a similar mechanism [59] and, (iii) deletion of PERK does  not alter cytotoxic responses to C12. In response to cell stress,  eIF2a is also phosphorylated by eIF2a kinase 1 (the heme- regulated inhibitor kinase), eIF2a kinase 2 (protein kinase RNA- activated, PKR) or eIF2a kinase 4 (GCN2) [60]; further work will be required to establish which eIF2a kinase(s) responds to C12. The role of individual stress response pathways to overall C12-  mediated cytotoxicity is not well understood. The observations  that p38 MAPK phosphorylation is conserved in Ire1a 2/2  and  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs and that pharmacological inhibition of p38  MAPK does not prevent C12-mediated apoptosis suggest that this  pathway is of limited importance to C12-mediated cell death.  Similarly, eIF2a phosphorylation is preserved in Ire1a 2/2  and  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs also suggesting that this cellular response has little  relevance to C12-mediated apoptosis. Finally, it is noteworthy that  caspases are activated in Ire1a 2/2  and Xbp1 2/2  MEFs in response  to C12-stimulation, albeit at dramatically reduced levels (,5%) relative to wt MEFs. As such, our study indicates that XBP1s-  dependent and -independent processes that contribute to caspase  activation are initiated in C12-stimulated cells, but that XBP1s-  dependent mechanisms are dominant.  How might XBP1s contribute to cell death in C12-stimulated  cells? Our study formally verifies that caspase activation mediates  apoptotic cell death in MEFs. Executioner caspase activity was  ostensibly used as a metric of cell death; however, caspase 8 was  also activated in C12-stimulated MEFs (data not shown) as  previously reported in other cell types [16,18]. Caspase 8  activation typically indicates that extrinsic apoptotic pathways  initiated by cell surface receptors are operating [29]. As such, we  speculate that XBP1s promotes initiation of extrinsic apoptotic  responses through formation of the death-inducing signalling  complex in a C12-dependent manner. Precedents of leucine  zipper-containing proteins causing intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis  have been reported. Similar to XBP1s, the prostrate apoptosis  response-4 protein (Par-4) contains a leucine zipper motif and  nuclear localization sequences. Depending upon cell type, Par-4  has been demonstrated to either sensitize cellular responses to  apoptotic stimuli or to directly activate apoptosis; however, the  mechanism of these responses is not fully elucidated [61]. Further  studies will be required to test the hypothesis that XBP1s mediates  activation of extrinsic apoptotic responses in a C12-dependent  fashion.  In summary, the present study identifies XBP1s as a key  determinant of apoptotic responses initiated by QS molecule  generated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterolitica and Burk-  holderia pseudomallei. The leucine zipper and transcriptional  activation domains of XBP1 are sufficient to mediate apoptotic  responses; however, XBP1s transcriptional activity is not required  for cell death. These studies advance our understanding of host  responses to C12 and should facilitate rational design of  approaches to investigate whether C12-mediated host cell  apoptosis is pathologically relevant.  Materials and Methods  Cell lines and cell culture Immortalized wt and knockout MEF cell lines used in this study  were previously described and RT-PCR analysis of these cells was  performed using published primer sequences [32,33,37,39]. MEFs  were cultured in DMEM H21 supplemented with 10% fetal  bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and nonessential amino acids. Fischer rat thyroid  (FRT) epithelial cells were obtained from the UCSF cell culture  facility and cultured in Ham's F12 supplemented as for MEFs.  Hela cells were obtained from the UCSF cell culture facility and  cultured in DMEM H21 supplemented as for MEFs. MEF and  FRT cells were transfected using jetPRIME (Polyplus Transfec-  tion) and Hela cells were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX  with Plus reagent (Life Technologies).  Reagents and chemicals Homoserine lactones (including C12 (N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-L-  homoserine lactone) and C14 (N-(3-oxodotetradecanoyl)-L-homo-  serine lactone)) were obtained from Sigma. For some experiments,  C12 was prepared using a previously described synthetic route  [62]. Structure and purity (.99%) of synthesized C12 were  confirmed by proton NMR, and caspase activation in wt or  Xbp1 2/2  MEFs was similar in response to synthesized or  purchased C12. Details of homoserine lactone dosing is provided  in Figure Legends or text. Calcein acetoxymethyl ester (AM),  DAPI and thapsigargin was obtained from Life Technologies and  used as directed by the manufacturer. Pharmacological modula-  tors were purchased from various sources (as detailed below) and  cells were typically pre-treated with compounds for 30 minutes, at  concentrations given in parenthesis, prior to homoserine lactone  challenge or other experimental maneuvers. Cycloheximide  (5 mg/ml) and CA-074-Me (10 mM) were obtained from Calbio- chem. STF-080310 (50 mM) was obtained from Tocris. Z-VAD- fmk (10 mM) was obtained from Promega. SB203580 (10 mM), SB202190 (10 mM), SP600125 (10 mM), ALLN (10 mM), brefeldin A (1.25 mg/ml) and actinomycin (1 mg/ml) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.  Antibodies, western blotting and immunocytochemistry Antibodies against, IRE1a, PERK, cleaved and full length  caspase 3 and 7, p-eIF2a, p-p38 MAPK and c-Jun were obtained  XBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 10 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576    from Cell Signalling. Antibody against XBP1 was purchased from  Santa Cruz. Antibody against FLAG-tag was obtained from  Sigma. Western blotting was performed using standard procedures  with chemiluminescence detection. Immunocytochemistry was  performed on fixed and permeabilized cells using indirect  immunodetection with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated sec-  ondary antibodies and DAPI as a counterstain. Imaging was  performed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope  equipped with an Exfo X-Cite light source, Hamamatsu EM-CCD  deep-cooled camera and appropriate filter cubes and objectives  (Nikon S Fluor 206N.A. 0.75 or Plan Fluor 406N.A. 0.75). For quantitative immunodetection, cell from different experiments  were labelled in parallel, imaged with identical microscope settings  and analyzed using Fiji image processing software.  Apoptosis assays and cell density analysis Caspase activity was measured using Caspase-Glo homoge-  neous luminescent assays (Promega). In different experiments,  caspase activation in C12-treated wt MEFs varied by ,50% for undetermined reasons. As such, control experiments were always  performed and are presented, such that control data and  experimental maneuvers can be directly compared. Normalized  caspase activation data is presented as mean 6 S.D. for an  individual experiment (comprised of 6-12 individual measure-  ments), and is representative of at least duplicate experiments. To  characterize cell density, cells were labelled with calcein-AM and  imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope  (described above) equipped with a Nikon Plan Fluor 106/NA 0.3 objective. Relative cell number was calculated from background-  corrected, integrated fluorescence areas and cell density was  derived by comparison of relative cell number before and after an  experimental maneuver. Data is presented as mean 6 S.E. and  was derived from 3-5 independent experiments in which 3-6 cell  areas were imaged per experiment.  Plasmids, molecular biology and luciferase-based reporter assays  Plasmids containing FLAG-tagged murine XBP1u and XBP1s  cDNA were obtained from Addgene (plasmids 21832 and 21833;  [63]). For experiments, the coding regions for XBP1u and XBP1s  were excised as HindIII/XbaI fragments, subcloned into  pcDNA3.1/Hygro, and an oligo duplex was used to regenerate  the FLAG-tag (amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDL). Carboxy-  terminal FLAG-XBP1s truncations (Figure 4B) were generated by  pcr as HindIII/XbaI-tagged amplicons that were subcloned into  pcDNA3.1/Hygro containing an in-frame FLAG-tag. The amino-  terminal FLAG-XBP1s truncation (Figure 4B) was generated by  pcr as a BglII/EcoRI-tagged amplicon that was subcloned into the  BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1; for experiments, FLAG-tagged  XBP1 amino terminus was subsequently subcloned into  pcDNA3.1/Hygro as an NheI/XbaI fragment. Domain boundaries  for truncations were based on those previously reported for human  XBP1s [36]. For FLAG-XBP1s, the polybasic, leucine zipper  (which contains amino acids involved in transcription factor  dimerization) and transcriptional activation domains start at  Arg76, Ala94 and Ala168, the transcriptional activation domain  ends at Val283 and the amino terminal domain ends at Iso197  (corresponding to residues Arg68, Ala86, Ala160, Val275 and  Iso189 of untagged XBP1s). Sequence analysis was used to  confirm all constructs generated in this study. For experiments in  MEFs that assessed the role of full length and truncated XBP1  regions in caspase activation, pcDNA3.1/Hygro was used as a  control (empty) vector. Cell lines enriched for expression of an  XBP1s deletion construct (XBP1D2, Figure 4B) were generated by  repeated culture of transfected cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin; cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro and selected in 300 mg/ ml hygromycin (FRTcon and Helacon) were used as a control.  A luciferase-based reporter of IRE1a activity was generously provided by Albert Koong (Stanford University). Briefly, this  reporter (termed XBP1-luc) consists of cDNA encoding the first  208 amino acids of human Xbp1, including a 26-nucleotide splice  site that is recognized by IRE1a, fused to firefly luciferase [41]. A plasmid-based vector was generated for the current studies by  subcloning reporter cDNA (provided in the pLPCX retroviral  vector, Clontech) into pcDNA3.1/Hygro as a HindIII/NotI  fragment. Assays of IRE1a splicing activity were performed in transiently transfected wt MEFs or in an FRT cell population  enriched for expression of the reporter construct by repeated  culture of cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin. A luciferase based reporter of XBP1s activity was purchased (pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/  Hygro] (Promega)); this reporter contains five direct repeats of the  sequence 59-ATCGAGACAGGTGCTGACGTGGCATTC-39  and is similar to a previously described XBP1s-responsive reporter  (UPRE/56ATF6GL3) [43,44]. Assays of XBP1 transcriptional activity were performed in MEFs transiently transfected with  plasmids expressing full length or truncated XBP1s (or  pcDNA3.1/Hygro as a control) and pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/  Hygro] at a ratio of 9:1. Luciferase-based reporter assays were  performed using the Bright-Glo Assay system as directed by the  manufacturer (Promega).  Supporting Information  Figure S1 A.

C12 did not significantly increase IRE1a activity relative to control levels although C12-stimulation resulted in robust caspase 3/7 activa-  tion. ER stress inducing agents did not induce caspase 3/7  activation over the duration of experiments. Statistical analysis was  by ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc test using untreated cells as the  control condition; ** p,0.0001. E. Western blot of (uncleaved)  caspase 3 and caspase 7 in wt, Ire1a 2/2  and Xbp1 2/2  MEFs. F.  Transfection of Xbp1 2/2  MEFs with a control (empty) plasmids  did not result in caspase 3 cleavage upon C12 treatment (25 mM, 2 h). Staining is shown for DAPI (left) and cleaved caspase 3 (right)  (see also Figure 3).  (TIF)  Figure S2 A. Measurement of XBP1s-mediated transcrip-  tional activity in wt, Ire1a 2/2  and Xbp1 2/2  MEFs (see also  Figure 4E). In all cell types, Xbp1s co-transfection with the XBP1s-  responsive reporter construct produced robust transcriptional  XBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576    activity. Co-transfection of wt and Xbp1 2/2  MEFs with Xbp1u  cDNA produced limited transcriptional activity, consistent with  the ability of these cells to process Xbp1u pre-mRNA and generate  XBP1s via IRE1a activity (as expected, intrinsic activity of IRE1a is limited such that XBP1s-transcriptional activity in Xbp1u  transfected cells is lower than that in Xbp1s transfected cells). In  contrast, Ire1a 2/2  MEFs were unable to process Xbp1u cDNA  such that no transcriptional activity was reported. No transcrip-  tional activity was reported in any cell type for co-transfection with  plasmids encoding XBP1N and XBPD2. Statistical analysis was by  ANOVA with Dunnett post hoc test; * p,0.05 and ** p,0.0001  versus control data. (inset) Anti-FLAG-tag western blot of wt MEFs  expressing XBP1s truncation constructs to confirm appropriate  expression. B. Immunostaining of FLAG-XBP1s transfected wt  MEFs. Camera sensitivity was adjusted such that low levels of  XBP1s could be detected in the cytoplasm of certain transfected  cells (see also Figure 4C). C. Schematic representation of XBP1s  truncation constructs that were generated, confirmed by sequence  analysis and failed to express in wt MEFs. XBP1s contains a  polybasic domain (grey), leucine zipper domain (black; which  consists of the amino acids involved in transcription factor  dimerization) and transcriptional activation domain (blue). The  location of the splice site that converts XBP1u pre-mRNA to  XBP1s mRNA is also shown (red). Leu-to-ala mutants of XBP1s  and XBPD2 contained alanine residues in place of leucine residues  at all seven positions in the leucine zipper motif and were  generated using gBlocks Gene Fragments (Integrated DNA  Technologies).  (TIF)  Figure S3 A. Structures of acyl homoserine lactones used in  these studies: C6 (N-(\u00df-Ketocaproyl)-L-homoserine lactone); C10  (N-(3-Oxodecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone); C12; C14; C14-b (N-  Tetradecanoyl-DL-homoserine lactone); C14-OH (N-(3-Hydroxy-  tetradecanoyl)-DL-homoserine lactone). Carbons at position 1 and  3 are highlighted in red (top). B. Representative images of calcein  AM labelled wt MEFs treated with acyl homoserine lactones (4 h,  25 mM or 50 mM of racemic mixtures; see also Figs. 1 and 5). C. Caspase 3/7 activation in wt (left) and Ire1a  2/2 (right) MEFs after  treatment with acyl homoserine lactones (4 h, 25 mM or 50 mM of racemic mixtures). No activation of caspases was observed when  acyl chains were ,12 carbon atoms in length. Substitutions at  carbons one and three are required for caspase activation and 3-  oxo- substitutions produce significantly greater activation of  caspases than 3-hydroyx- substitutions. Ire1a 2/2  MEFs are  protected from C12, C14 and C14-OH caspase activation relative  to wt MEFs.  (TIF)  Acknowledgments  The authors thank Drs Alan S. Verkman, Alex J.
