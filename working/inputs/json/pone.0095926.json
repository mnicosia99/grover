  Stac3 Inhibits Myoblast Differentiation into Myotubes Xiaomei Ge., Yafei Zhang., Sungwon Park\u00a4, Xiaofei Cong, David E. Gerrard, Honglin Jiang*  Department of Animal and Poultry Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America  Abstract  The functionally undefined Stac3 gene, predicted to encode a SH3 domain- and C1 domain-containing protein, was recently found to be specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and essential to normal skeletal muscle development and contraction. In this study we determined the potential role of Stac3 in myoblast proliferation and differentiation, two important steps of muscle development. Neither siRNA-mediated Stac3 knockdown nor plasmid-mediated Stac3 overexpression affected the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes as evidenced by increased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA and protein expression of myogenic markers including myogenin and myosin heavy chain. In contrast, Stac3 overexpression inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes as evidenced by decreased fusion index, decreased number of nuclei per myotube, and decreased mRNA and protein expression of myogenic markers. Compared to wild-type myoblasts, myoblasts from Stac3 knockout mouse embryos showed accelerated differentiation into myotubes in culture as evidenced by increased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA expression of myogenic markers. Collectively, these data suggest an inhibitory role of endogenous Stac3 in myoblast differentiation. Myogenesis is a tightly controlled program; myofibers formed from prematurely differentiated myoblasts are dysfunctional. Thus, Stac3 may play a role in preventing precocious myoblast differentiation during skeletal muscle development.  Citation: Ge X, Zhang Y, Park S, Cong X, Gerrard DE, et al.

The  process of formation of myofibers from muscle progenitor cells is  called myogenesis, and this process is controlled by a set of  transcription factors, including Myf5, Mrf4, MyoD, and myogenin  (MyoG). While Myf5 and MyoD determine the myogenic lineage  of muscle progenitor cells [1-3], MyoG and Mrf4 drive the  terminal differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into myotubes, the  developing myofibers [4-7]. Skeletal muscle plays important roles  in initiating movements, supporting respiration, and maintaining  homeostasis; loss of skeletal muscle mass or function is associated  with ageing and diseases such as cancer and diabetes [8,9].  Skeletal muscle in meat-producing animals is a tissue of major  economic importance. Therefore, identification of new factors and  mechanisms that control skeletal muscle development and  physiology has significant implications for improving human  health and animal productivity.  The functionally undefined Stac3 gene appears to be a new  factor regulating skeletal muscle development and function. This  gene is predicted to encode a protein containing two Src homology  three (SH3) domains and a cysteine rich (C1) domain [10]. The  Stac3 gene is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle [10-14].  Stac3 knockout in mice caused perinatal death and marked  abnormalities in skeletal muscle [11,13]. In zebrafish, morpholino-  mediated Stac3 knockdown resulted in defective myofibrillar  protein assembly [14]; absence of Stac3 expression due to a  missense mutation in a splice donor site or morpholino-mediated  Stac3 knockdown caused the fish to be immobile or shiver [12]. It  was proposed that Stac3 plays a role in excitation-contraction  coupling through interaction with the dihydropyridine receptor  and the ryanodine receptor [11,12].  The function of Stac3 has also been studied in C2C12 myoblasts  [14]. Bower and colleagues observed that Stac3 knockdown  prevented C2C12 myoblasts from fusing into myotubes and  concluded that Stac3 is essential for myoblast differentiation and  myotube formation [14]. However, an essential role of Stac3 in  myoblast differentiation does not appear to be supported by the  facts that Stac3 knockdown or mutation did not prevent the  formation of myofibers in zebrafish [12,14] and that Stac3  knockout did not block the formation of myofibers in mice [11,13].  In this study, we examined the role of Stac3 in myoblast  differentiation and myotube formation by determining the effects  of Stac3 knockdown, overexpression, and knockout on myoblast  differentiation and fusion into myotubes in both C2C12 myoblast  line and mouse embryonic myoblasts. Our results suggest an  inhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast differentiation and myotube  formation.

Differentiation was induced by replacing the growth medium with differentiation  medium consisting of DMEM, 2% horse serum, and 1% ABAM.  Cell culture media and supplements were purchased from  Mediatech Inc. (Manassas, VA) unless otherwise specified.  Stac3 knockdown C2C12 cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to  approximately 70% confluence. Cells in each well were transfected  with Stac3 siRNAs (MSS239387, MSS239388, MSS239389 from  Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in combination of three (10 nM per  siRNA) or separately (30 nM). Control cells were transfected with  30 nM scrambled siRNA (Invitrogen). The transfection reagent  was Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Since an appropriate Stac3  antibody was not available, knockdown efficiency was estimated by  quantitative RT-PCR of Stac3 mRNA.  Stac3 overexpression Stac3 cDNA was amplified from mouse skeletal muscle total  RNA and linked to a Flag tag at the 39 end via PCR using primers  59-GAGGATCCGGGGCCCAATCTCTTGTAA-39 and 59-  TCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCG-  TAAATCTCCTCC-39. The Stac3-Flag fusion cDNA was cloned  into the pcDNA3.1-hygro (+) vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI and XbaI sites to generate the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Stac3-Flag. To  overexpress Stac3 in C2C12 cells, the cells at 70% confluence  were transfected with 0.5 mg of pcDNA3.1/Stac3-Flag using Lipofectamine 2000 as the transfection reagent. Transfection of an  equivalent amount of pcDNA3.1-hygro (+) plasmid served as a control. Overexpression of Stac3 was confirmed by quantitative  RT-PCR of Stac3 mRNA and western blot analysis of Stac3-Flag  fusion protein using an anti-Flag antibody (see details below).  Stac3 mutant mice Generation, breeding, and genotyping of Stac3 mutant mice  were described in detail in a previous report [13]. Mice were  housed on a timed 12 h light/dark schedule with free access to  standard rodent diet and water. All procedures involving animals  were approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Animal Care  and Use Committee.  Isolation and culture of myoblasts from mouse embryos Mouse embryonic myoblasts were isolated as described [15],  with minor modifications. Briefly, limb muscles from embryonic  day 17.5 (E17.5) embryos were dissected and digested in a solution  consisting of 1.5 U/ml collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 2.4  U/ml dispase (Roche), and 2.5 mM CaCl2 at 37 uC for 30 minutes. The released cells were collected by centrifugation and  resuspended in Ham's F-10 medium supplemented with 20% FBS,  2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Promega, Madison, WI),  and 1% ABAM. The cells were allowed to attach to the plates for 2  h at 37 uC. The medium containing the unattached cells was transferred to collagen I-coated dishes (BD Biosciences, San Jose,  CA). When the cells reached 50% confluence, they were subjected  to 3 to 5 times of 20-min preplating or until 70% of them were  estimated to be myoblasts [16]. To induce differentiation, cells at  80% confluence were switched to DMEM medium supplemented  with 2% horse serum and 1% ABAM.  Quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent according to the  manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Research Center, Cincin-  nati, OH). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed essentially as  described previously [13]. Stac3, myogenin (Myog), myosin heavy  chain 3 (Myh3), myoglobin (Mb), troponin T type 1 (Tnnt1),  troponin T type 3 (Tnnt3), and creatine kinase, muscle (Ckm)  mRNAs were quantified by PCR using primer pairs 59-  TACAGCGACCAACAGTACGC-39 and 59-TCTGCATTGT-  TTCCATCCTG-39; 59-CGGCTGCCTAAAGTGGAGAT-39  and 59-AGGCCTGTAGGCGCTCAA-39; 59-CGCAGAATCG-  CAAGTCAATA-39 and 59-ATATCTTCTGCCCTGCACCA-  39; 59-ATGTGAGGGCCAGAGAAAGG-39 and 59-TCCAGG-  TACTTGACCGGGAT-39; 59-AAACCCAGCCGTCCTGTG-  39 and 59-TCATCTCCCGACCAGTCTGT-39; 59-GCCCAA-  GAGGAAGAAGTCCA-39 and 59-TAGCTGCTGTAGTTGG-  CACC-39; and 59-CGCAGCATCAAGGGTTACAC-39 and 59-  AGGTGCTCGTTCCACATGAA-39, respectively. mRNA abun-  dance was calculated as relative to 18S rRNA, which was  quantified by RT-PCR using primers 59-TTAAGAGGGACG-  GCCGGGGG-39 and 59-CTCTGGTCCGTCTTGCGCCG-39.  Based on the Ct values, expression of 18S rRNA was not different  (P.0.1) between the conditions used in this study.  Immunocytochemistry Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate  buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeated with 0.25% Triton  X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then blocked  with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween-20) and incubated with anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC)  antibody (MF20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,  University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) at 1:200 dilution at 4uC overnight. The anti-MHC antibody was detected by incubating  the cells with anti-mouse IgG FITC antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St.  Louis, MO) at 1:200 dilution at room temperature for 1 h. Cell  nuclei were stained by incubating the cells in 1 mg/ml DAPI (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was  detected with a Nikon eclipse E600 florescence microscope (Nikon  Metrology, Inc., Brighton, MI).  Cell proliferation assay The numbers of viable cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation  of culture were measured using the nonradioactive CellTiter 96  assay kit, according to the manufacturer's (Promega) instructions.  The absorbance at 570 nm reflected the number of viable cells.  Cell proliferation rate was represented by the slope of the line that  connected the absorbance at different times in culture.  Characterization of myotubes To visualize myotubes and nuclei, differentiating myoblasts  were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10  min. Cells were then stained with Giemsa (Invitrogen) for 10 min.  Total cell nuclei and nuclei within myotubes were counted using  the NIH ImageJ software. A muscle cell containing 3 or more  nuclei was considered as a myotube, as defined previously [17].  Fusion index was calculated as the number of nuclei in myotubes  divided by the total number of nuclei counted. Average number of  nuclei per myotube was determined by dividing the number of  nuclei in myotubes by the total number of myotubes.  Western blot analysis Total cellular protein lysates were prepared and western blot  analyses were conducted essentially as described previously [18],  Role of Stac3 in Myoblast Differentiation  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926    except that the primary antibodies were detected using IRDye  secondary antibodies at 1:20,000 dilution (LI-COR, Lincoln,  Nebraska) and the ODYSSEY CLx system (LI-COR). The  following primary antibodies were used: anti-myosin heavy chain  MF20 at 1:500 dilution (Developmental Studies Hybridoma  Bank), anti-myogenin F5D at 1:500 dilution (Developmental  Studies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-b-actin N21 at 1:1,000 dilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).  Statistical analyses Two-tailed student's t test was used to determine the  significance of the difference between two groups. The differences  between more than two groups were analyzed by ANOVA  followed by Tukey HSD multiple comparisons. These tests were  performed using the JMP software (SAS, Cary, NC). A difference  was considered significant when the associated P value was less  than 0.05. All data were expressed as means 6 s.e.m. (standard  error of the mean).  Results  Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes  We investigated the potential role of Stac3 in myoblast  proliferation by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Stac3 in C2C12  myoblasts. Transfecting these cells with a pool of three siRNAs  targeting Stac3 mRNA decreased the expression of endogenous  Stac3 mRNA by 65% as compared to the transfection of a  scrambled siRNA (P,0.01, Fig. 1A). However, Stac3 siRNAs had  no effect on the proliferation rate of C2C12 myoblasts (P.0.1,  Fig. 1B). To determine the potential role of Stac3 in myoblast  differentiation, C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Stac3 siRNAs  or scrambled siRNA were induced to differentiate, and their  differentiation status was assessed by measuring the fusion index  and average number of nuclei per myotube. At 72 h of  differentiation, more C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Stac3  siRNAs formed myotubes than those transfected with scrambled  siRNA (66% vs. 40%, P,0.05; Fig. 1C and 1D). Myotubes formed  from Stac3 siRNAs-transfected C2C12 myoblasts had more nuclei  on average than those from scrambled siRNA-transfected C2C12  myoblasts (19 vs. 7 nuclei/myotube, P,0.01, Fig. 1C and 1E).  These morphological data indicated that Stac3 knockdown  stimulated the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.  We also assessed the differentiation status of C2C12 myoblasts  by measuring the mRNA levels of 6 myogenic markers including  myogenin (Myog), myosin heavy chain 3 (Myh3), myoglobin (Mb),  troponin T type 1 and 3 (Tnnt1 and Tnnt3), and creatine kinase,  muscle (Ckm), and the protein levels of 2 myogenic markers  including myogenin (MyoG) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) at 0,  24, 48, and 72 h of differentiation. The cells transfected with Stac3  siRNAs had greater expression of Myog, Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1,  Tnnt3, and Ckm mRNAs than those transfected with scrambled  siRNA at 24, 48, and/or 72 h of differentiation (P,0.05, Fig. 1F).  The former cells also had greater expression of MyoG and MHC  proteins than the latter at 24, 48, and/or 72 h of differentiation  (Fig. 1G). These myogenic marker expression data further  indicated that Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of  C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.  To validate the specificity of the effect of siRNA-mediated Stac3  knockdown on myoblast differentiation, the three Stac3 siRNAs  used as a pool in the above experiments were transfected  individually into C2C12 myoblasts. These transfections decreased  Stac3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A) and increased the fusion index  (Fig. 2B and 2C) and mRNA expression of Myog, Myh3, Mb,  Tnnt1, Tnnt3, and Ckm (Fig. 2D) in a similar manner to  transfection of the three siRNAs in combination. These data ruled  out the possibility that off-target effects mediated Stac3 siRNAs-  enhanced differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts.  Stac3 overexpression inhibited the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes  We also determined the effect of Stac3 overexpression on  proliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. We achieved  Stac3 overexpression by transfecting the cells with a Stac3-Flag  fusion protein expression plasmid and confirmed Stac3 overex-  pression at both the mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B) levels.  Stac3 overexpression did not alter the proliferation rate of C2C12  myoblasts (P.0.1, Fig. 3C). At 72 h of differentiation, approxi-  mately 25% of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the Stac3-Flag  expression plasmid formed myotubes, whereas this percentage was  nearly 40% for those transfected with the empty vector (P,0.05,  Fig. 3D and 3E). Myotubes formed from Stac3-overexpressing  C2C12 myoblasts had 4 nuclei on average, whereas those formed  from control cells had 7 nuclei (P,0.05, Fig. 3D and 3F). At 48  and 72 h of differentiation, myotubes formed from Stac3-  overexpressing C2C12 myoblasts had less expression of Myog,  Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1, Tnnt3, and Ckm mRNAs than those formed  from C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the empty vector (P,  0.05, Fig. 3G). The former cells also expressed less myogenin  protein than the latter at 24, 48, and 72 h of differentiation, and  less myosin heavy chain protein than the latter at 48 and 72 h of  differentiation (Fig. 2H). These changes caused by Stac3  overexpression were opposite to those caused by Stac3 knockdown  in C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1).  Myoblasts from Stac3 mutant mouse embryos showed accelerated differentiation in culture  We isolated myoblasts from E17.5 Stac3 homozygous mutant  mouse embryos and wild-type littermates and compared their  potential to differentiate into myotubes in culture. Quantitative  RT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of Stac3 mRNA in  myoblasts from Stac3 homozygous mutant embryos (Fig. 4A). At  72 h of differentiation, 53% of Stac3 mutant myoblasts fused into  myotubes, whereas this percentage was much lower (18%) for  wild-type myoblasts (P,0.01, Fig. 4B and 4C). On average,  myotubes formed from Stac3 mutant myoblasts contained 2 more  nuclei than those from wild-type myoblasts (P,0.01, Fig. 4B and  4D). These morphological differences indicated that Stac3 mutant  myoblasts differentiated more rapidly than wild-type myoblasts in  culture. At 72 h of differentiation, Stac3 mutant myoblasts  expressed 50 to 150% more Myog, Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1, and  Tnnt3 mRNAs than wild-type myoblasts (P = 0.2 to 0.3; Fig. 4E).  Discussion  In this study we determined whether Stac3 plays a role in  myoblast proliferation and differentiation in two myogenic cell  systems: C2C12 myoblast line and primary murine myoblasts.  While Stac3 knockdown had no effect on proliferation of C2C12  myoblasts, it stimulated their differentiation into myotubes, as  evidenced by increased fusion rate, increased average number of  nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA and protein expression  of myogenic markers including myogenin, the myogenic regula-  tory factor that controls the terminal differentiation of myoblasts  into myotubes [4,7]. In contrast, Stac3 overexpression inhibited  the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes, as  evidenced by decreased fusion rate, decreased average number  of nuclei per myotube, and decreased mRNA and protein  Role of Stac3 in Myoblast Differentiation  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926    expression of myogenic markers. Judged by the number and size of  myotubes formed, myoblasts from Stac3-null mouse embryos  differentiated more rapidly in culture than wild-type myoblasts.  These results imply an inhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast  differentiation into myotubes.  Our finding that Stac3 inhibits C2C12 t differentiation into  myotubes is seemingly at odds with an earlier report concluding  that Stac3 is essential for myotube formation from C2C12 cells  [14]. The cause for this discrepancy is not clear. It could be due to  the different culture conditions or different passage numbers of  C2C12 cells, which are difficult to control, used between the two  studies. However, an essential role of Stac3 for myotube  formation, as concluded in the earlier study [14], is not supported  by the phenotypes of Stac3 knockout mice and Stac3 knockdown  zebrafish, where myofibers clearly are formed [11-14]. An  inhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast differentiation into myotubes  indeed can explain some of the phenotypes in Stac3 knockout  mice. Skeletal muscle of Stac3 knockout mice had fewer yet larger  myofibers and had a disproportional number of myofibers with  large cross-sectional areas [13]. In theory, the increased size in  myofibers can be caused either by hastened myoblast differenti-  ation and fusion into myotubes or by hypertrophy of fused  myotubes. However, it is unlikely that Stac3 mutant myotubes  were undergoing hypertrophy because they indeed had fewer and  smaller myofibrils than wild-type or Stac3 heterozygous mutant  myotubes [13]. The relative number of proliferating myoblasts  versus differentiating myoblasts during muscle development  determines the total number of myofibers formed in mature  muscle [19,20]. If myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and  begin differentiation before an adequate number of founder  myoblasts have developed, this will decrease the overall number of  myofibers formed. Therefore, hastened myoblast differentiation  and fusion into myotubes could also explain why Stac3 knockout  skeletal muscle had fewer total myofibers than wild-type or Stac3  heterozygous mutant skeletal muscle [13].

Myogenesis is a tightly controlled program; premature  myoblast differentiation would lead to the formation of dysfunc-  tional myofibers [21,22]. Thus, Stac3 could be one of those factors  that prevent precocious myoblast differentiation during skeletal  muscle development. Obviously, the mechanism by which Stac3  inhibits myoblast differentiation into myotubes is an interesting  future question to investigate. The SH3 domain contained in the  Stac3 protein is a classical protein-protein interaction domain  [23,24]; therefore, Stac3 might inhibit myoblast differentiation  through interaction with other proteins. It would be interesting to  know if Stac3 interacts with or affects the expression of proteins  such as Delta-like protein 1, myogenin, MRF4 (Myf6), Stat1, and  Stat3 that are known to play a role in normal or premature  myoblast differentiation [21,22,25].  cell cultures).
