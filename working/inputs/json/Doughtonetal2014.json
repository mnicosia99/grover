The effects of TA were accompanied by downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes in RMS cells and tumors, and the role of Sp protein downregulation in mediating inhibition of RD and RH30 cell growth and migration was confirmed by individual and combined knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins by RNA interference. TA treatment and Sp knockdown in RD and RH30 cells also showed that four genes that are emerging as individual drug targets for treating RMS, namely c-MET, insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), PDGFR\u03b1 and CXCR4, are also Sp-regulated genes. These results suggest that NSAIDs such as TA may have potential clinical efficacy in drug combinations for treating RMS patients.",

It faces the blastocoel cavity and later gives rise to the extraembryonic parietal and visceral endoderm. Here, we investigate a key step in primitive endoderm development, the acquisition of apico-basolateral polarity and epithelial characteristics by the non- epithelial inner cell mass cells. Embryoid bodies, formed from mouse embryonic stem cells, were used as a model to study this transition. The outer cells of these embryoid bodies were found to gradually acquire the hallmarks of polarised epithelial cells and express markers of primitive endoderm cell fate. Fgf receptor/Erk signalling is known to be required for specification of the primitive endoderm, but its role in polarisation of this tissue is less well understood. To investigate the function of this pathway in the primitive endoderm, embryoid bodies were cultured in the presence of a small molecule inhibitor of Mek. This inhibitor caused a loss of expression of markers of primitive endoderm cell fate and maintenance of the pluripotency marker Nanog. In addition, a mislocalisation of apico-basolateral markers and disruption of the epithelial barrier, which normally blocks free diffusion across the epithelial cell layer, occurred. Two inhibitors of the Fgf receptor elicited similar phenotypes, suggesting that Fgf receptor signalling promotes Erk-mediated polarisation. This data shows that primitive endoderm cells of the outer layer of embryoid bodies gradually polarise, and formation of a polarised primitive endoderm layer requires the Fgf receptor/Erk signalling pathway.

The primitive  endoderm forms an epithelium which localises between the  blastocoel cavity and the epiblast, these three components are  surrounded by a second epithelium, the trophectoderm. Two  subpopulations are formed from the primitive endoderm, the  parietal and visceral endoderm give rise to the yolk sac, whilst the  visceral endoderm also contributes to the gut endoderm and  provides embryonic patterning signals [2]. In contrast, cells of the  epiblast give rise to the embryo proper. Recently, there has been a  rapid increase in our understanding of how the primitive  endoderm versus epiblast cell fate decision is regulated (Reviewed  in [2,3]). These studies have used mouse embryos, as well as  embryoid bodies which can be formed from mouse embryonic  stem (mES) cells. The outer cell layer of embryoid bodies is an  epithelium with many similarities to the embryonic primitive  endoderm, and has therefore been used as a model of its  development [4,5].  Cell fate decisions in the ICM cells are a dynamic process: cells  initially express both epiblast (e.g. Nanog) and primitive endoderm  markers (e.g. Gata6 and Gata4), the expression then resolves into a  salt-and-pepper pattern within the ICM, where cells express either  epiblast or primitive endoderm markers [6-8]. The cells of the  primitive endoderm then migrate to their final position facing the  blastocoel cavity where they form an epithelial sheet.  Fgf receptor (Fgfr) signalling via the Raf/Mek/Erk signalling  (Erk signalling) pathway has an important role in promoting  primitive endoderm formation (Reviewed in [9]). For instance  Grb2, an adaptor protein that links receptor tyrosine kinases to the  Erk cascade, is essential for primitive endoderm development [10].  Interestingly, activated H-Ras expression in Grb2-deficient mES  cells promotes endoderm differentiation in embryoid bodies,  suggesting Grb2 functions through activation of Ras in this  context [10]. A more detailed analysis of the Grb2 2/2  mouse  phenotype demonstrated that Gata6 expression is lost and all ICM  cells are Nanog positive [6]. In addition, when embryoid bodies  are formed from mES cells transfected with a constitutively active  Mek mutant, Nanog expression is repressed, and primitive  endoderm differentiation occurs [11]. This suggests that the Erk  signalling pathway mediates Nanog repression, which is known to  be required for differentiation of ICM cells into primitive  endoderm. These results led to the hypothesis that the mosaic  expression of epiblast and primitive endoderm markers is  dependent upon a Grb2-Ras-Mek/Erk signalling cascade.

Fgf4 activation of Fgfr appears to be the input responsible for  activating the Erk signalling pathway to promote primitive  endoderm cell fate [13-15]. Treatment of embryos with a  combination of inhibitors for both the Fgfr and Mek causes  ICM cells to express Nanog whilst repressing primitive endoderm  markers Gata6 & 4 [16,17]. Conversely, treatment of embryos  with Fgf4 and heparin causes all cells of the ICM to become Gata6  positive [17,18]. In Fgf4 2/2  embryos Gata6 and Nanog colocalise  until the 32-cell stage, but by the 64-cell stage only a small number  of weakly Gata6 positive cells could be detected, whilst Gata4 was  never detected. This mutant could not be rescued by addition of  exogenous Fgf at a uniform concentration suggesting in vivo it is  regional differences in Fgf concentration which produce the salt-  and-pepper pattern [19]. Together, these studies provide convinc-  ing evidence that Fgf4/Fgfr activation of Erk signalling is essential  for primitive endoderm specification.  In contrast to our growing understanding of cell fate specifica-  tion less is known about the mechanisms which regulate  polarisation of primitive endoderm cells. A number of studies  have shown a polarised localisation of proteins within the epithelial  cells of the primitive endoderm. E-cadherin is localised to their  basolateral membrane [20], and Lrp2 localises to the apical  surface of the primitive endoderm in E4.5 mouse embryos [21].  The adaptor protein Disabled-2 (Dab2) also localises apically and  is required for the establishment of epithelial polarity [22,23] and  Laminin, a constituent of the basement membrane is required for  proper epithelial organisation of the primitive endoderm [24].  In the trophectoderm epithelial polarisation has been tightly  linked to the regulation of cell fate [25] and a role for polarity in  the control of the primitive endoderm cell fate has also been  suggested. One aspect to this is that epithelial polarity in the  primitive endoderm cells appears to anchor the sorted cells to their  final localisation on the outer surface of the epiblast [20,22,23]. If  aPkc, a key regulator of cell polarity, is inhibited the primitive  endoderm cells do not become anchored [26]. No effect was  observed on early primitive endoderm markers (e.g. Pdgfra), but  later there was a reduction in Gata4 positive cells. This suggests  that in addition to being essential for sorting, aPkc is also required  for maturation of the primitive endoderm cell fate [26]. Despite its  well established role in promoting primitive endoderm fate, it is  not clear if the Erk signalling pathway is required for formation of  a polarised primitive endoderm.  Here, we use embryoid bodies as a model to investigate the  mechanisms which promote polarisation of the primitive endo-  derm, and determine whether the Fgfr/Erk signalling pathway is  required for polarisation of this tissue. We show that embryoid  bodies gradually expressed markers of primitive endoderm cell fate  and down regulate Nanog. Polarity complex, tight junction,  adherens junction, and basement membrane proteins also  developed a polarised localisation in the primitive endoderm  layer. Treatment with small molecule inhibitors of Mek or the Fgfr  caused the outer cells of the embryoid body to fail to upregulate  primitive endoderm markers and no longer downregulate Nanog  expression. Mislocalisation of the proteins which normally show  apico-basolateral polarisation in the primitive endoderm cells also  occurred. Additionally, disruption of the epithelial barrier, which  normally blocks free diffusion across the epithelium of the  primitive endoderm, was observed. These results show that Fgfr  driven Erk signalling is required for the formation in embryoid  bodies of a primitive endoderm layer which exhibits apico-  basolateral polarity and epithelial barrier function.  Methods  Culture of mESCs The E14tg2A mES cell line (Clone R63) was a kind gift of Dr  Owen Witte, UCLA, California, [27]. mESCs were routinely  cultured on dishes coated in 0.1% (w/v) porcine gelatin (Sigma) in  Knock-out Dulbecco's modified Eagles Medium (Gibco) supple-  mented with 15% (v/v) knockout serum replacement (Gibco),  2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-  Rad), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Gibco) and 10 3  units/ml  murine Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (ESGRO; Chemicon:  ESG1106). Occasionally, cells were cultured with 1i, addition of  2 mM 1m (GSK3b inhibitor (Bone et al. 2009)), to maintain the pluripotency of the cells.  For embryoid body formation, cells were tryspinised in 0.05%  Trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen) and resuspended at a density of  40,000 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagles Medium (Invitro-  gen) supplemented with 20% serum (Invitrogen) and 25 mM 2-  mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Small-molecule inhibitors were added  to the cell suspension at concentrations indicated in main text;  0.5 mM-4 mM PD-0325901 (Axon MedChem: 1408), 1 mM-8 mM AZD-4547 (Santa Cruz: Sc-364421), 100 nM PD-173074 (Sell-  eckchem: S1264). Control embryoid bodies were formed from  media containing the same DMSO percentage as used with the  inhibitors, this ranged from 0.02% to 0.08% (See figure legends for  the concentration used in each experiment). 25 ml drops of the cell suspension were pipetted onto the inside of the lid of a 10 cm  tissue culture dish. 10 mls of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)  (Invitrogen) was placed in the bottom of the plate. If cultured for  longer than 5 days, on day 5 embryoid bodies were washed using  PBS, put in fresh media and plated on a ultra-low adherent dish  (Corning: 3471). Images of unstained embryoid bodies were taken  on a Leica MZFLIII microscope.  Cell Lysates Lysates were prepared by washing embryoid bodies twice in  PBS. Ice-cold RIPA buffer was added which contains 150 mM  NaCl (Sigma), 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8 (Sigma), 1% NP-40 (VWR),  0.5% Na Deoxycolate (Fisons), 0.1% SDS (Sigma), 25 units/ml  Benzonase nuclease (Sigma: E1014), supplemented with either  phosphatase inhibitor cocktails 2 and 3 (Sigma: P5726 & P0044)  and cOmplete Mini, EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail  (Roche: 04693159001) or the following protease/phosphatase  inhibitors: 1 mM sodium vanadate (Sigma: S-6508), 1 mM  sodium molybdate (BDH AnalR: 10254), 10 mM sodium fluoride  (Sigma: S6521), 10 mg/ml Phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) (Sigma: P7626), 0.7 mg/ml Pepstatin A (Sigma: P5318), 10 mg/ml Aprotinin (Roche: 236624), 10 mg/ml Leupeptin (Sigma: L8511), 10 mg/ml Soyabean trypsin inhibitor (Roche: 109886) in H2O. Samples were kept at 220uC until required. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay  (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's directions.  Immunoblotting Cell lysates were separated by SDS PAGE using 7.5 or 10%  polyacrylamide gels using the Bio-Rad system or gradient Novex  Bis-Tris Gels using an XCell SureLock Mini Cell (Invitrogen).  Immunoblotting was performed using a semi-dry blotter (Amer-  sham Biosciences, Multiphor II) or the Bio-Rad wet-transfer  system, transfer buffer used contained 39 mM glycine, 48 mM  Tris base, 0.00375% SDS, 20% (v/v) methanol.

Anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, and anti-goat secondary  antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at  1:10,000 (DAKO), or 1:5000 (GE). Blots were developed using  ECL prime (GE Healthcare) or ECL2 (Thermo Scientific)  according to manufacturer's directions. Detection was carried  out using an ImageQuant RT ECL system or Amersham  Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare) with quantification using ImageJ  (NIH). Nitrocellulose blots were stripped for 60 minutes at 55uC in stripping buffer (0.2 M Tris PH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 0.1 M b- mercaptoethanol), PVDF blots were stripped for 10 minutes at  room temperature using 0.5 M NaOH. Blots were subsequently  washed in TBST and then blocked. For statistical analysis a 1-way  ANOVA with a Dunnetts post-hoc test was performed using  GraphPad Prism 5.  Immunofluorescence Staining At the appropriate time point, embryoid bodies were fixed with  4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde fixation buffer (PFA) in PBS for 1  hour and permeabilised in 0.25% triton (Sigma) (vol/vol) in PBS  for 20 minutes. Non-specific binding was blocked by 3% BSA  (sigma) +0.1% tween (Sigma) in PBS for 30 minutes. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% BSA (w/v) +0.1% tween (vol/vol) in PBS. Embryoid bodies were incubated with primary  antibodies for 2 hours, and with secondary antibodies for one  hour. 1:1000 DAPI (Sigma: D9564) was added to the secondary  antibody. Primary antibodies used: 1:25 mouse anti-Zo-1 (Invitro-  gen: 33-9100), 1:100 rabbit anti-aPkcf/l (Santa Cruz: sc-216), rabbit anti-b-catenin (CST: 9562), goat anti-Gata6 (R&D systems: AF1700), rabbit anti-Gata4 (Santa Cruz: Sc-9053), rabbit anti-  Hnf4a (Santa Cruz: H-171), 1:200 rat anti-Nanog (eBioscience: 14-5761), cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell signalling technology: 9661),  1:250 rabbit anti-Fibronectin (Sigma: F3648).

Embryoid bodies were washed five times with 0.1% tween in  PBS following all antibody incubations. Stained embryoid bodies  were then mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) within the middle of  two 13 mm diameter stationery self-adhesive reinforcement rings  stacked on top of each other, a coverslip was placed over the top.  Immunostained embryoid bodies were examined on a Zeiss  LSM510 Meta or a Leica SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope.  Image processing was done using Photoshop CS2 (Adobe) and  Image J (NIH). Quantification was done by analysis of a field of  view of at least three embryoid bodies per condition per  experiment for at least three independent experiments. This gave  at least 181 cells per experiment. Areas were randomly chosen  using only the DAPI channel to avoid bias. Counts were done of  surface layer cells only using the cell counter plugin in Image J  (NIH). For statistical analysis a 1-way ANOVA with a Dunnetts  post-hoc test, or a paired t-test were performed using GraphPad  Prism 5.  Biotinylation The biotinylation method was adapted from previous protocols  [28,29]). Embryoid bodies were washed in PBS, and incubated  with 10 mM EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Thermo Scientific  21335) diluted in DMEM for 30 minutes at room temperature.  Two washes in DMEM were performed followed by a wash in  PBS. Embryoid bodies were then fixed in 4% PFA in PBS for one  hour, permeabilised in 0.25% triton (vol/vol) in PBS (Sigma), for  20 minutes and blocked for 30 minutes in 3% BSA (w/v) in 0.1%  Figure 4. Reduced expression of primitive endoderm markers Gata4 and Gata6 and increased expression of Nanog was observed in embryoid bodies upon inhibition of Mek.

Embryoid bodies were mounted  and imaged as stated in the immunofluorescence protocol.  Results  Embryoid Bodies Express Primitive Endoderm Cell Fate Markers by Day 7  Before studying the polarity of the primitive endoderm in  embryoid bodies, the temporal development of the primitive  endoderm was characterised. A hanging-drop method was used to  culture the embryoid bodies, and their morphology and expression  of primitive endoderm transcription factor cell fate markers was  examined. Embryoid bodies on day 3 were round and had a fairly  homogeneous morphology (Figure 1A). Over time, the embryoid  bodies showed increased heterogeneity and at day 7 and 10  balloon-like cysts were present (Figure 1A), which resembled those  observed previously [30].  Whole-mount immunostaining of the outer-layer of the  embryoid body showed that a small percentage of nuclei were  positive for the primitive endoderm fate markers Gata6, Gata4 or  Hnf4a on day 3 (Figure 1B). As the embryoid bodies grew, the number of nuclei which expressed these markers increased,  reaching a peak on day 7 (Figure 1B). Additionally, expression  of the pluripotency protein Nanog decreased (Figure 1C). It was  expressed in approximately 35% of nuclei on day 3, this fell to 7%  on day 5 and no cells expressed Nanog by day 7. Increasing  expression of the primitive endoderm fate markers and loss of the  pluripotency marker Nanog suggests that the outer layer of the  embryoid bodies is undergoing a developmental program similar  to that observed in the embryonic primitive endoderm.  Primitive Endoderm of the Embryoid Body Develops Apico-basolateral Polarity by Day 5  The outer layer of the embryoid bodies appears to be following  a developmental pathway which recapitulates primitive endoderm  development. As polarity has been shown to change as the  primitive endoderm forms [26], whole-mount immunostaining  was used to observe the localisation of key markers of epithelial  polarisation in embryoid bodies. After 3 days of culture, the  embryoid bodies showed expression of the polarity complex  protein aPkcf/l in the outer layer of cells, where it localised to the cytoplasm (Figure 2A). By day 5, aPkcf/l localisation was mostly apically restricted across the whole of the outer surface of cells of  the embryoid body, this localisation remained unchanged on day 7  and 10. The tight-junction protein Zo-1 was localised to the  border between the apical and lateral side of the epithelial cells,  forming rings which outlined the cells by day 3 (Figure 2B). By day  5 the apical puncta were uniformly present in cells of the outer layer.  b-catenin, an adherens junction protein was predominantly present at the lateral side of cells of the outermost cell layer from  day 3, but in some areas was also apically localised (Figure 2C). By  day 5, b-catenin was consistently localised to the lateral side of the outer-most cell layer. Fibronectin is a basement membrane  protein, on day 3 it localised to patches directly below the  outermost cell layer, and deeper into the embryoid body  (Figure 2D). This localisation gradually became more specific, by  day 5 the staining was more restricted to the basal side of the  outermost cell layer, whilst there were still patches of apical  Fibronectin. By day 7 the Fibronectin was restricted to below the  basal-side of the outermost cells and no staining was observed in  cells below the outer cell layer. The gradual localisation of these  apico-basolaterally polarised proteins shows that the epithelium  surrounding the embryoid body has begun to polarise on day 3  and has clear polarisation by day 5.  Inhibition of Mek with PD-0325901 Results in a Loss of Gata4 and Gata6 Expression in Embryoid Bodies  Erk signalling has previously been shown to have a role in  primitive endoderm fate specification [10,11], but its role in  polarisation of these cells is less well established. To investigate the  role of Mek signalling in this process PD-0325901, a potent Mek  inhibitor [31,32] was added to the cell suspension (day 0) and  analysis of the phenotype of the embryoid bodies was carried out  after 7 days of development (Figure 3A). Diphosphorylated Erk1  and 2 was markedly decreased (Figure 3B) demonstrating that,  when added to the media PD-0325901 successfully inhibited Mek  signalling. There was a slight reduction in size of the embryoid  bodies at the highest dose tested (4 mM) in comparison to embryoid bodies treated with vehicle, but this was not statistically  significant (Figure 3C). A statistically significant increase in the  circularity of the embryoid body (Figure 3D) in comparison to  control was observed. To establish if the addition of PD-0325901  caused an increase in apoptosis, whole-mount immunostaining for  cleaved Caspase-3 was performed (Figure 3E). No significant  change in the number of nuclei positive for cleaved Caspase-3 was  observed in the outer layer of the embryoid bodies showing that  inhibiting Mek did not cause a significant increase in apoptosis  that might have affected the development of these cells.  Disruption of Mek-signalling causes a loss of Gata6 and Gata4  expression, and an increase in Nanog expression preventing the  fate specification of the primitive endoderm both in vivo and in vitro  [6,10]. The expression levels of Gata6, Gata4 and Nanog were  analysed to assess the effect Mek inhibition has in this system.  Western blotting of embryoid bodies showed a dose-dependent  decrease in Gata6 and Gata4 protein expression levels, resulting in  very little protein remaining at the highest concentration of PD-  0325901 (4 uM) (Figure 4A & B). This result was confirmed using  whole-mount immunostaining of Gata6 (Figure 4C). In contrast,  the percentage of Nanog positive nuclei increased from 0% in  control to an average of 76% upon addition of 4 mM PD-0325901 (Figure 4D). This confirms that upon inhibition of Mek the cells of  the outer-layer of the embryoid body failed to become primitive  endoderm cells, but instead remained pluripotent.  Mek Inhibition Results in Disruption of Epithelial Polarity Having observed a disruption in the specification of the  primitive endoderm cell fate following inhibition of Mek signalling  (Figure 2), embryoid bodies were cultured in PD-0325901 and the  localisation of polarity and junctional proteins examined (Figure 2).  The addition of 2 mM PD-0325901 appeared to cause maximal inhibition of ppErk1/2, but 4 mM caused a bigger reduction in Gata4/6 staining. The expression of these proteins in the primitive  endoderm is Mek dependent [33] arguing that in this system there  may be a low level of Mek signalling which is inhibited by addition  of 4 mM PD-0325901. For this reason 4 mM PD-0325901 was chosen for subsequent experiments. aPkcf/l was apically localised in the control embryoid bodies, but when treated with the Mek  inhibitor aPkcf/l was also present in the cytoplasm and in cell layers below the outer layer (Figure 5A). After treatment with the  Mek inhibitor the tight-junction protein Zo-1 remained localised  at the apical side of the outer layer cells but did not form a belt-like  structure around the cells (Figure 5B). Occasional labelled  junctions remained, but the majority of protein was present in  isolated puncta. This suggested that inhibition of Mek disrupted the  formation of the tight junctions and the localisation of aPkcf/l.  Fgfr/Erk and Primitive Endoderm Polarisation  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95434    b-catenin localisation was also disrupted by treatment with the Mek inhibitor. It localised apically as well as laterally in the outer  cell layer of embryoid bodies treated with PD-0325901 (Figure 5C)  and was observed in the second layer of cells (the layer below the  outer-layer). This localisation was not observed in the controls  (Figure 5C, 2 nd  layer panel). Lastly, a disruption in the localisation  Figure 6.

Upon addition of PD-0325901, Fibronectin formed  small aggregates of protein instead of a fibrous network as  observed in the control embryoid bodies. In addition, the  Fibronectin protein in embryoid bodies treated with PD-  0325901 was not basally restricted, but was present in all cell  layers observed. The mislocalisation of aPkcf/l, as well as tight junction, adherens junction and basement membrane proteins  shows that the apico-basolateral polarity of the outer layer of  embryoid bodies was disrupted following Mek inhibition.  Loss of Gata6 and Gata4 Expression upon Inhibition of Fgfr Signalling  As disruption of the Erk signalling cascade resulted in a  disruption in the apico-basolateral polarity of the outer-layer of the  embryoid body, we wished to identify the receptor responsible for  Erk activation in this system. A leading candidate for this was the  Fgfr, as its inhibition has previously been shown to decrease  expression of Gata6 and Gata4, disrupting further fate specifica-  tion of the primitive endoderm [13-15]. A newly developed potent  and selective inhibitor of the Fgfr, AZD-4547, was used to treat  embryoid bodies (Figure 6A). This inhibitor was chosen as it is  more selective than previously available compounds such as PD-  173074 [34,35]. Addition of this inhibitor caused a reduction in  ppERK1 and 2 (Figure 6B). Some ppErk expression remained,  perhaps due to other signalling pathways upstream of Mek such as  GPCRs, integrins or other receptor tyrosine kinases. Addition of  AZD-4547 produced embryoid bodies which were smaller than  controls even at the lowest dose tested (1uM) (Figure 6A&C).  There was also a dose dependent increase in the circularity of the  embryoid bodies, resulting in embryoid bodies which were  significantly more circular than controls when cultured with  4 mM and 8 mM PD-0325901 (Figure 6A&D). To determine if addition of AZD-4547 caused an effect on apoptosis whole-mount  immunostaining for cleaved Caspase-3 was carried out. There was  a small, but not statistically significant, increase in the number of  nuclei in the outer-layer of the embryoid body which were positive  for cleaved Caspase-3 (Figure 6E). The majority of cells (.85%)  remained Caspase negative, arguing that any changes in  development of the primitive endoderm are not due to cell death.  A dose-dependent decrease in expression levels of both Gata4  and Gata6 was observed by western blotting when embryoid  bodies were grown in increasing concentrations of the Fgfr  inhibitor (Figure 7A&B). Additionally, whole-mount immuno-  staining confirmed a reduction in Gata6 positive nuclei when  4 mM AZD-4547 was used (Figure 7C). Nanog expression increased from 0% in control to an average of 82% upon  inhibition of the Fgfr (Figure 7D). This suggests that Fgfr signalling  is activating Erk to drive an increase in size, heterogeneity of  shape, loss of Nanog, and expression of primitive endoderm fate  markers in embryoid bodies.  Loss of Apico-basolateral Polarity upon Fgfr Inhibition Having observed a loss in expression of primitive endoderm  markers, we examined apico-basolateral polarity components  following inhibition of the Fgfr. This analysis was performed  using 4 mM AZD-4547 as a clear inhibition of ppERK, loss of Gata6 and Gata4 expression and, morphological changes were  observed at this concentration. Following inhibition of the Fgfr,  aPkcf/l localised throughout the cytoplasm of the outer-layer and was found in the layers below (Figure 8A). A disruption in both  adherens junctions and tight junction proteins was also observed.  Zo-1 localised to apical puncta, but did not form a belt around the  periphery of the cells, instead only patches or short lines of Zo-1  were detected (Figure 8B). b-catenin was observed apically in some cells and was also found in the cells below the outer layer  (Figure 8C). Localisation of Fibronectin was also investigated. The  protein was spread throughout the outer layer, as well as in layers  Figure 7. Reduced expression of the primitive endoderm markers Gata4 and Gata6 and increased expression of Nanog was observed in embryoid bodies following inhibitor of the Fgfr. Embryoid bodies were grown in different concentrations of AZD- 4547 or 0.08% DMSO for 7 days. Expression levels of (A) Gata6, and (B) Gata4 were analysed using western blotting.

The mislocalisation of  these proteins was similar to that seen when embryoid bodies were  treated with the Mek inhibitor, suggesting that Mek dependent  polarisation is driven by activation of the Fgfr.  Inhibition of Mek Or Fgfr Signalling does not Significantly Alter the Expression Levels of Polarity and Junction Proteins  To determine whether inhibition of Mek or the Fgfr altered the  levels of the polarity proteins, the expression of aPkcf/l, b- catenin, Fibronectin were assessed following treatment with PD-  0325901 or AZD-4547 using western blotting (Figure 9). Quan-  tification suggested some small changes following inhibitor  treatment, but none of these were statistically significant. This  argues that, although small changes cannot be ruled out, inhibition  of Mek or the Fgfr predominantly caused a re-localisation of these  proteins rather than a change in their expression levels.  Inhibition of the Fgfr with PD-173074 Causes a Disruption in Polarisation of the Outer-layer of Cells  Treatment of embryoid bodies with the recently developed Fgfr  inhibitor AZD-4547 caused a mis-localisation of apico-basolater-  ally polarised proteins. To confirm the specificity of this effect and  allow comparison with previous literature, the polarisation of  embryoid bodies was observed using the structurally distinct and  more commonly used inhibitor PD-173074. This is an effective  inhibitor of Fgfr1, but also inhibits the Vascular endothelial  growth factor receptor 2 (Vegfr2) [35]. The polarisation of the  primitive endoderm was observed following treatment with  0.1 mM PD-173074 which is the concentration commonly used for studying primitive endoderm in vivo [16,17]. In these in vivo  studies it is often used in combination with a Mek inhibitor  [16,17]. Embryoid bodies were therefore also treated with 0.1 mM PD-173074 and 1 mM PD-0325901, the combination and concentration of inhibitors previously used to assess primitive  endoderm development [16,17].  The tight-junction protein Zo-1 localised to junctions in control  embryoid bodies, but this localisation was disrupted following  treatment with either 0.1 mM PD-173074 or the combination of 0.1 mM PD-173074 and 1 mM PD-0325901 (Figure 10A). The localisation of the adherens junction protein b-catenin was also disrupted following treatment with PD-173074 and when treated  with the combined inhibitors (Figure 10B). The use of two  structurally distinct inhibitors of the Fgfr, which gave very similar  results, argues that the phenotypes described above are caused by  specifically inhibiting Fgfr signalling.  Inhibition of Mek or the Fgfr Signalling Results in a Loss of Epithelial Barrier Function  The maintenance of a diffusion barrier is a common function of  epithelial layers [36]. We therefore investigated if, in addition to  the mislocalisation of apico-basolateral polarity proteins described  above, the cells of the embryoid bodies had defects in their barrier  Figure 9. Inhibition Mek or the Fgfr did not significantly alter the expression levels of polarity and junction proteins. Embryoid bodies were grown in different concentration of the (A, C, E), Mek inhibitor PD-0325901 and 0.04% DMSO or the (B, D, F) Fgfr inhibitor AZD-4547 and 0.08% DMSO for 7 days. Expression levels of polarity and junction proteins were assessed using western blotting (A&B) aPkcf/l, (C&D) b-catenin, and (E&F) Fibronectin. A representative blot and quantification from 3 independent experiments is shown for each marker. No statistically significant change was seen in any of the markers observed.

The diffusion of a membrane-impermeable biotin, which  covalently links to amino groups on extracellular proteins, was  used as a test for epithelial barrier function. The bound biotin can  be readily visualised using fluorescently labelled streptavidin. In  control embryoid bodies (Figure 11), binding of biotin was  restricted to the outer, apical layer of the embryoid bodies. When  embryoid bodies were treated with the Mek inhibitor (PD-  0325901) or Fgfr inhibitor (AZD-4547), the biotin was observed  throughout the lateral side of the outer-layer cells, and in deeper  cell layers (Figure 11). This demonstrated that the barrier function  of the embryoid body epithelium was disrupted following  inhibition of signalling by Mek or the Fgfr.  Figure 10. Inhibition of the Fgfr with PD-173074 or the Fgfr and Mek disrupted the normal localisation of polarity and junction proteins in the outer layer of embryoid bodies.

This suggests a disruption in the apico-basolateral polarisation of these cells. A representative image from 3 independent experiments is shown. Scale bars 10 mm.

Our data demonstrates  a gradual increase in expression of primitive endoderm markers,  loss of Nanog expression and establishment of epithelial polarisa-  tion in the primitive endoderm layer of embryoid bodies.  Inhibition of both Mek and the Fgfr caused a loss of primitive  endoderm markers, maintenance of Nanog and mislocalisation of  all the polarity proteins examined; polarity complex protein  aPkcf/l, tight junction protein Zo-1, adherens junction protein b- catenin, and basement membrane protein Fibronectin. Associated  with the disruption in polarity and junctional protein localisation  was a loss of the barrier function of the epithelium. This argues  that Fgfr signalling activates Erk 1 and 2 which then promotes cell  fate specification, polarisation and establishment of a functional  epithelial barrier.  Embryoid Bodies as a Model of Epithelial Polarity The polarised localisation of a number of proteins has been  previously reported in the primitive endoderm [20-24], however,  the temporal localisation of multiple epithelial polarity proteins has  not previously been examined. The results presented here show  that the primitive endoderm of an embryoid body gradually  polarises in an order which is similar to that observed in other  epithelia (Reviewed by [37]). Zo-1 and b-catenin localise at junctions at the initial stage of cell polarisation, followed by  localisation of aPkcf/l at the apical membrane and deposition of Fibronectin to form a basement membrane.  There are many different models which can be used to study  epithelial polarisation, including model organisms such as  Drosophila melanogaster, polarised cell culture cells such as MDCK  cells, and epithelial organs from embryonic and adult mice [38-  40]. However, the primitive endoderm of an embryoid body has a  number of characteristics which we believe will make it a valuable  model for future experiments. It is a 3 dimensional model  composed of a variety of non-transformed cell types, which  gradually polarise and express cell fate markers. There are also a  growing number of knockout and transgenic ES cell lines which  could be studied in this system [41,42]. In particular, embryoid  bodies are well suited for studying the relationship between  polarisation and fate specification in a developing epithelium.  Fgfr/Erk Signalling is Required for Cell Fate Specification and Polarisation of the Primitive Endoderm  The Fgfr/Erk signalling pathway is known to be required for  cell fate specification of the primitive endoderm [9]. Our data  confirms that inhibition of either the Fgfr or Mek signalling causes  a loss of primitive endoderm cell fate markers and maintenance of  Figure 11. Inhibition of the Fgfr or Mek caused a loss in barrier function of the cells in the outer layer of the embryoid body. Embryoid bodies were treated with (A) 0.04% DMSO, or 4 mM PD-0325901(Mek inhibitor), (B) 0.04% DMSO or 4 mM AZD-4547 (Fgfr inhibitor) for 7 days. A membrane impermeable biotin which covalently links to amino groups was added to the embryoid bodies and subsequently visualised using Alexa-fluor-488-conjugated Streptavidin. The biotin was largely restricted to the apical surface of the embryoid body in DMSO controls. Following treatment with either a Mek or an Fgfr inhibitor, biotin also bound to basolateral membrane proteins of the outer cell layer and the membranes of cells under this layer. This shows that the normal epithelial barrier has been disrupted. A representative image from 3 independent experiments is shown. Scale bars 10 mm. Dotted lines represent position that the relevant orthogonal or aerial images were taken. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0095434.g011  Fgfr/Erk and Primitive Endoderm Polarisation  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95434    the pluripotency protein Nanog. Interestingly, inhibition of the  Fgfr caused a stronger reduction of primitive endoderm fate  markers, despite inducing less inhibition of Erk than the Mek  inhibitor. This suggests that another receptor may be activating  Mek. It also raises the possibility that the Fgfr might be activating  other signalling pathways, such as Pi3k-Akt, Stat, Plcc, p38 MapK, and Jnk [43] to promote expression of Gata4 and Gata6.  These additional pathways may regulate embryoid body size, as  the Fgfr inhibitor caused a bigger reduction in size than addition of  the Mek inhibitor. Another interesting phenotype seen following  inhibition of both Fgfr or Mek was an increase in circularity. This  may be caused by a failure to become cystic, causing the embryoid  bodies to remain more homogeneous. Gata4 2/2  embryoid bodies  are also smaller than controls and non-cystic [44] and embryoid  bodies made with Laminin c1 2/2  mES cells do not cavitate [45].  Therefore, the increase in circularity may be linked to a failure in  primitive endoderm development and polarisation.  Our data also show that Fgfr/Erk signalling is required for the  formation of a polarised primitive endoderm layer with an efficient  barrier function. This hypothesis is supported by a several other  findings. Firstly, aPkc does not polarise in the primitive endoderm  of embryos grown in 2i medium, which includes a Mek and a  GSK3b inhibitor [26]. Secondly, expression of a truncated form of Fgfr2 in mES cells has been reported to disrupt basement  membrane formation [46], while Grb2 knockout embryoid bodies  show an absence of Laminin basal to the outer cell layer [10].  Combining our data with previous studies leads us to propose that  the Fgfr/MAPK signalling pathway promotes polarisation of the  primitive endoderm as well as its fate. There are at least three  possibilities to explain this dual role; 1) Fgfr/Erk signalling  regulates primitive endoderm cell fate specification which then  promotes polarisation. 2) Fgfr/Erk signalling initiates the polar-  isation of the primitive endoderm which then drives fate  specification. 3) MAPK independently regulates both the polar-  isation and fate determination of the primitive endoderm.  In embryoid bodies, the cells start to polarise prior to the  maximal nuclear localisation of Gata6, Gata4, and Hnf4a (Figures 1 and 2). This suggests that in embryoid bodies the onset  of polarisation occurs before cell fate specification and argues  against model one where cell fate regulators promote polarisation.  There is also evidence that disrupting polarisation of the primitive  endoderm does not affect fate determination, arguing against  model two. Embryoid bodies formed with mES cells which do not  express Laminin c1, a key component of the basement membrane, have primitive endoderm cells in the outer-layer although they  were not properly organised [24,45]. Additionally, E-cadherin 2/2  ES cells showed normal primitive endoderm development, but the  embryoid bodies did not form a cavity, consistent with defects in  epithelial barrier formation [23]. In Dab2 null mouse embryos  cells of the primitive endoderm lose their apico-basolateral  polarity. In these embryos Gata4 expression was observed, but  positive cells were positioned throughout the epiblast, suggesting a  failure in positioning but not fate regulation [22,23].  The studies described above argue against the idea of polarity  regulating cell fate (model 2). However, there is also conflicting  evidence that loss of proteins required for epithelial polarisation  can disrupt primitive endoderm fate specification. In Integrin  b12/2 embryoid bodies, a-fetoprotein (a marker of visceral endoderm) is only expressed in clusters of endoderm cells, Dab2  protein was not observed by immunostaining, and Gata4 became  cytoplasmic [47]. This suggests that the absence of integrins  disrupts the development of the primitive endoderm. The mutant  embryoid bodies had no diphospho-Erk1/2, and had reduced p38  and Akt activation suggesting that Integrins control endoderm  differentiation via the Raf/Erk and Akt signalling pathways [47].  Live-imaging of embryos treated with an aPkc inhibitor revealed  that the primitive endoderm cells migrate but fail to remain on the  ICM surface when they reach the cavity. This resulted in primitive  endoderm cells being present throughout the epiblast rather than  forming a distinct layer on the edge of the blastocoel [26]. No  effect was seen on early markers of the primitive endoderm fate  (Pdgfra, and Gata6), but some cells were negative for both Nanog  and Gata4, suggesting a defect in primitive endoderm maturation  [26]. Co-transfection experiments also showed that the Dab2  promoter can be transactivated by forced expression of Gata6, in  NIH-3T3 cells [48] suggesting the polarity regulator Dab2 may be  a downstream target of the cell fate regulator Gata6. In summary,  current evidence appears to support the idea of a hybrid model  where early regulation of primitive endoderm fate acts upstream of  polarisation, but that aPkc and possibly other regulators of  polarity, are required for the maturation of the primitive  endoderm fate. This is clearly a complex process, and the  mechanistic elucidation of Fgfr/Erk signalling's dual role in cell  fate determination and cell polarisation, and how these two  processes are interlinked and interact will be a key aim goal for  future work.  Conclusion In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the Fgfr/Erk  pathway is required for the formation of a polarised primitive  endoderm cell layer in embryoid bodies. Further studies into the  mechanisms responsible for this requirement and the relationship  between cell fate specification and cell polarity are needed to  improve our understanding of the development of this key  embryonic cell type. These studies are likely to be relevant to  the development of other embryonic and adult epithelia.
