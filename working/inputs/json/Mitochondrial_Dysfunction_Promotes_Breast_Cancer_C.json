    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

To further explore the function of mitochondria and their involvement in the pathogenic mechanisms of cancer development, mitochondrial dysfunction clones of breast cancer cells were generated by rotenone treatment, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport complex I. These clones were verified by mitochondrial respiratory defect measurement. Moreover, those clones exhibited increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and showed higher migration and invasive behaviors compared with their parental cells. Furthermore, antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, PEG-catalase, and mito-TEMPO effectively inhibited cell migration and invasion in these clones. Notably, ROS regulated malignant cellular behavior was in part mediated through upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 a and vascular endothelial growth factor. Our results suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction promotes cancer cell motility partly through HIF1a accumulation mediated via increased production of reactive oxygen species.

Introduction  Cancer cells display mitochondrial dysfunction to make cells  adapt glycolysis to generate ATP even in the presence of oxygen,  namely Warburg effect [1]. The mitochondrial dysfunction has  been found to be associated with the development of human  cancers [2], [3]. It has been reported that mitochondrial  dysfunction could be caused by inhibitors of mitochondrial  electron transport chain [4], pathogenic mutations in mitochon-  drial DNA (mtDNA) [3], and mutations in nuclear gene coded  electron transport chain proteins [2]. Additionally, accumulating  evidence suggests that cancer cells exhibit increased intrinsic  reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress partly due to mitochondrial  malfunction [5], [6]. The increased ROS in cancer cells may in  turn affect certain redoxsensitive molecules and further lead to  stimulation of cellular proliferation, cell migration and invasion,  contributing to carcinogenesis [7], [8]. However, the underlying  molecular mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction  increases ROS production and subsequently leads to tumorigen-  esis are not fully understood.  Emerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial malfunction and  hypoxia in the tumor microenvironment are considered as two  major factors contributing to the Warburg effect [9], [10]. In solid  tumors, hypoxia, which is an oxygen tension below physiologic  levels, develops as abnormal proliferation outstrips the blood  supply [11]. This hypoxic region is involved in tumor malignancy  and proliferation, resulting in the development of resistance to  radiotherapy [12]. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a tran-  scription factor that regulates the cellular response to hypoxia,  induces several genes that mediate tumorigenesis [13], [14]. It is  known that HIF-1 is a heterodimer that consists of the oxygen-  sensitive HIF-1a subunit and the constitutively expressed HIF-1b subunit [15], [16]. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1a is  hydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases on the proline residues in  the oxygen-dependent degradation domain [17], [18]. In hypoxic  conditions, low oxygen leads to HIF-1a stabilization due to the inhibition of prolyl-hydroxylation and subsequent reduction in  HIF-1a ubiquitination and degradation [18].  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69485    In addition to the regulation of HIF-1a by oxygen supply, there are also different HIF activators that include growth factors,  hormones, cytokines and viral proteins [19]. Interestingly, related  observations of ROS regulating HIF-1a expression appear to be controversial. For example, multiple studies have shown that  increased HIF-1a expression contributes to mitochondrial activity and ROS formation during hypoxia [20], [21]. However, other  studies have demonstrated a decrease in HIF-1a with increasing ROS [22]. Moreover, some studies have shown no effects on  mitochondrial ROS [23]. These controversy results suggest that  further study is required to investigate the relationship between  HIF-1 a and ROS. In the present study, we treated SKBR3 and 4T1 breast cancer  cells by an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport complex I,  rotenone, for 1-2 weeks to establish mitochondrial dysfunction  subclones. Each subclone was confirmed to have mitochondrial  dysfunction by measurement of oxygen consumption, glucose  uptake, and lactate production. We found that mitochondrial  dysfunction subclones had elevated levels of ROS production. We  further analyzed (a) whether ROS are required for induction of  tumor cell migration and invasion; (b) whether ROS production  regulate HIF-1a and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression; (c) whether ROS govern tumor cell migration and  invasion through the regulation of HIF-1a and VEGF expression. This work provides the molecular insight into the role of ROS in  the regulation of breast cancer cell migration and invasion.  Materials and Methods  Reagents Antibody against HIF-1a was purchased from BD Biosciences.  Antibodies against VEGF and b-actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Rotenone, PEG-catalase, and antioxidant N-  acetyl cysteine were obtained from Sigma. 29,79-Dichlorofluor-  escein diacetate (CM2-DCFHDA) was purchased from Invitrogen.  mitoTEMPO was purchased from Enzo Life Sciences. 8 mm pore Transwell inserts and Matrigel were bought from BD Biosciences.

It is important to note that  rotenone was absent after clone generation during the clone  studies. Briefly, cells were treated for 24 h with rotenone  (100 nmol/L), then cultured in drug-free medium for 48 h.  Followed by two more cycles of rotenone treatment, cells were  then plated at a density of 200 per dish in drug-free medium to  allow the formation of colonies, which caused an increase in  superoxide generation measured by flow cytometry. Among these  clones, two clones with higher ROS from SKBR3 cells were  named as A and B, and two clones with higher ROS from 4T1  cells were marked as C and D for further studies.  ROS Measurement Intracellular ROS generation was assessed using 29,7,-dichloro-  fluorescein diacetate. Briefly, 16106 cells were plated on the 6-well plates and incubated with DCFH-DA (10 mmol/L) for 30 min at  37uC. Cells were washed and harvested in Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) and analyzed immediately using a BD FACScan  flow cytometer. Data were analyzed as single parameter frequency  histogram using cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Results are  presented as mean fluorescence intensity.  Hydrogen Peroxide Measurement The cells were lysed in 100 ml lysis buffer supplied by the H2O2  assay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) to determine  the intracellular H2O2 concentration. The supernatants were  obtained by centrifuging at 12,0006g for 10 min. The H2O2  Figure 3. The migration capacity of subclones and their parental cells was measured by wound healing assay.

Briefly, 50 ml sample solution was incubated with 100 ml reaction solution at room temperature for 30 min, and then the absorption at 560 nm was measured.  The H2O2 concentration was calculated by the standard curve  made from the standard solutions.  Mitochondrial Respiratory Defect Measurement ATP measurements were performed using ATP assay Kit  (Beyotime). We also investigated the mitochondrial oxidative  phosphorylation contribution on ATP production with the  addition of ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin, as previously  described [25]. Briefly, cells were grown to approximately 80%  confluence, and then incubated in DMEM containing the  following combinations of substrates and inhibitors: 4.5 mg/ml  glucose plus 110 mg/l pyruvate; glucose plus 15 mg/ml of  oligomycin. Cells were incubated with 15 mg/ml of oligomycin  for 20 min before harvesting. The remaining steps were following  the manufacturer's instructions.  Cellular glucose uptake was measured by incubating cells in  glucose-free medium with 0.2 Ci/mL [3H] 2-deoxyglucose  (specific activity, 40 Ci/mmol) for 60 minutes. After the cells  were washed with ice-cold PBS, the radioactivity in the cell pellets  was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Cellular lactate  level was measured under normoxia with lactate assay kit  (Biovision) following the manufacturer's instructions. The absor-  bance was recorded using a microplate reader at a 570-nm  wavelength. The data were normalized to the control group.  Transwell Migration and Invasion Assays The migration of breast cancer cells and their subclones was  performed using a 24-well transwell chamber (Corning) containing  gelatin-coated polycarbonate membrane filter (6.5 mm diameter,  8 mm pore size). 16105 cells suspended in 100 ml culture medium with 1% FBS were seeded into the upper chamber. The lower  chamber contained 600 ml culture medium with 10% FBS as a chemoattractant. After 24 h incubation at 37uC in 5% CO2, non- migrated cells were scraped from the upper surface of the  membrane with a cotton swab, and migrated cells remaining on  the bottom surface were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, staining  with giemsa and photographed under a microscope at 20  magnification. The numbers of migrated cells were counted under  a light microscope in 5 randomly-selected fields for each chamber.  The invasion of the cancer cells were performed by the same  procedure as in the migration assay except that the chamber filter  were coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences) and 56105 cells were seeded into the upper chamber.  Wound Healing Assay 26105 cells were added to each well of 6-well plate and cultured  at 37uC in 5% CO2 until more than 80% confluent. They were then scratched with a standard 200 ml pipette tip, wounded monolayers were washed twice to remove nonadherent cells and  images were captured at 0 h, 24 h and 48 h after wounding using  a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and a Nikon Plan Fluor  460.13 objective.  Figure 5. ROS promoted HIF-1a and VEGF expression in subclone cells. A, ROS led to increased expression of HIF-1a and VEGF in SKBR3 subclones. SKBR3 subclones showed higher normoxic and hypoxic HIF-1a level than the parental SKBR3 cells. VEGF expression was more increased in SKBR3 subclones than in the parental SKBR3 cells. HIF-1a and VEGF expression in SKBR3 subclone were significantly inhibited by NAC. B, ROS led to increased expression of HIF-1a and VEGF in 4T1 subcloneswhereas NAC was able to attenuate the ROS induced expression of HIF-1a and VEGF. C-D, H2O2 promoted HIF-1a expression, while PEG-catalase and mito-TEMPO inhibited HIF-1a expression in A clone (C) and C clone (D). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069485.g005  Mitochondrial Dysfunction Increases ROS/HIF1a  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69485    Mitochondrial Dysfunction Increases ROS/HIF1a  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69485    Western Blotting Analysis Western blotting was performed as previously described [26].  Briefly, cells were lysed with a whole-cell extract buffer (50 mM  Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% sodium dodecylsulfate, 5 mM EDTA,  4 mg/ml glycerophosphate) containing freshly protease inhibitors.  Total proteins were collected by centrifugation. The proteins were  quantified by BCA protein assay. Twenty-five micrograms of  lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently  transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked  with a solution of Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween-20  (TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk. The membranes were  incubated overnight at 4uC with primary antibodies against human HIF-1a, VEGF, and b-actin. The membranes were washed with TBS-T, and secondary antibodies were added to  the membrane for 1 h at 37uC. Membranes were washed with TBS-T, visualized with ECL reagent (Millipore), and exposed to  film.  RNAi-mediated Inhibition of HIF-1a The target sequence of HIF-1a was selected [27] as followed:  59-TACGTTGTGAGTGGTATTATT-39. The 21 nt target se-  quence served as the basis for the design of the two complemen-  tary 55-mer siRNA template oligonucleotides that were synthe-  sized, annealed, and ligated annealed siRNA template were  inserted into the pSilencer 4.1-CMV vecter (Ambion). Briefly,  shRNA was designed by using the siRNA software according to  the sequence target as follows: Forward oligo, 59-GAT CCC GTT  GTG AGT GGT ATT ATT TTC AAG AGA AAT AAT ACC  ACT CAC AAC GTA A-39, Reverse oligo, 59-AGC TTT ACG  TTG TGA GTG GTA TTA TTT CTC TTG AAA TAA TAC  CAC TCA CAA CGG-39. The double stranded DNA sequence  was obtained through annealing after chemosynthesis and was  inserted into PsilencerTM4.1-CMV vector. The insert production  was transformed into E. coli cells. Then the clones were picked and  sequenced to verify the inserts. Transient transfection was  performed using the Cationic lipid Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen)  with HIF-1a shRNA vector.  Results  Generation of Subclones with Higher ROS Rotenone has been accepted as a blocker of the electron flow  through inhibition of complex I and subsequently causing an  increase in the production of superoxide due to electron flow  bifurcation [4]. Therefore, we used rotenone to increase superox-  ide generation which leads to subsequent induction of ROS stress  in SKBR3 and 4T1 cells. After three cycles of rotenone treatment,  cells were plated in drug-free medium to allow the formation of  colonies. After subclones are generated, each 18 subclones from  SKBR3 and 4T1 cells were picked to measure ROS level. Among  18 SKBR3 subclones, 15 subclones showed significantly higher  ROS production compared to their parental SKBR3 cells, 3  subclones showed almost the same ROS level as their parental  SKBR3 cells (data not shown). Among 18 4T1 subclones, 14  subclones have obviously higher ROS production than that of  their parental 4T1 cells, and 4 subclones showed no difference in  ROS production with their parental 4T1 cells (data not shown).  Four clones with highest ROS were selected for further studies.  Two SKBR3 cells' subclones with higher ROS were named A and  B (Figure S1A), while C and D subclones were selected from  4T1cells (Figure S1B).  Subclones Exhibiting Mitochondrial Dysfunction To determine whether increased ROS affect mitochondrial  dysfunction, we performed the mitochondrial respiratory defect  measurement. As illustrated in Figure 1A, both A and B clones  showed increased in glucose uptake and lactate production  compared to their parental SKBR3 cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover,  both A and B clones had similar total ATP content compared with  the parental SKBR3 cells: however; ATP synthesis sensitive to  oligomycin that assumed to be contributed by mitochondrial ATP  synthase further decreased in A and B clones compared with  parental SKBR3 cells (Fig. 1B). Similar results were found in 4T1  cells (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that up-regulation of glycolysis  was sufficient to compensate the decreased ATP generation in the  mitochondria.  ROS Promoted Cell Motility and Invasion As ROS have been reported to be involved in tumor metastasis  [8], we tested the motility and invasive potential of each subclones.  Furthermore, to evaluate whether increased ROS were essential  for this process, cells were pretreated with the antioxidant N-acetyl  cysteine (NAC) before the Transwell assay and wound healing  assay. As we expected, four subclones exhibited greater motility  compared to their parental cells. More importantly, these  migration capacities were significantly inhibited by NAC  (Fig. 2A, 2B). Consistent with these results, we observed that  these subclones with higher ROS showed highly invasion capacity,  which can be inhibited by NAC (Figure S2). In agreement with the  Transwell assay, the wound healing assay showed significantly  accelerated wound closure in these subclone cells compared to  their parental cells after scratch assay (Fig. 3A, 3B). NAC  effectively inhibited the wound closure in these subclones  (Fig. 3A, 3B). These results indicated that the aggressive cellular  behaviors of subclones might be regulated by ROS.  Inhibition of ROS Generation Decreased Cell Motility and Invasion To further confirm whether ROS were increased in subclone  cells, we measured the H2O2 concentrations in these subclones  using the commercial assay kit [24]. As expected, we found that  H2O2 was increased in these subclones (data not shown), and NAC  significantly inhibited generation of H2O2 in subclones (Figure 4A).  Furthermore, H2O2 promoted cell migration and invasion, while  its scavenger PEG-catalase decreased cell migration and invasion  in subclone cells (Figure 4B, 4C, 4D, Figure S3), suggesting that  ROS play a role in cell motility and invasion. More importantly,  mitochondria-target SOD mimetic, mito-TEMPO [28] inhibited  migration and invasion in subclone cells (Figure 4B, 4C, 4D,  Figure S3).  ROS Induced HIF-1a and VEGF Expression Next, we explore the molecular mechanism of ROS-mediated  migration and invasion. Since mitochondrial ROS production has  Figure 6.

As cobalt chloride (CoCl2) has been  accepted as a hypoxic mimetic agent, we used 500 mmol/L CoCl2 to treat cells for 30 minutes before the cells were lysed. As shown in  Figure 5, the subclones exhibited increased expression of HIF-1a under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. NAC inhibited not only  normoxic HIF-1a expression but also hypoxic HIFa expression in both subclones (Figure 5A, 5B). VEGF, a crucial angiogenic factor  for controlling angiogenesis and vasculature, is one of the most  prominent HIF-1 target genes. Therefore, we further measured  VEGF expression in these subclones. We found that these  subclones have increased expression of VEGF (Figure 5A, 5B).  We also observed that VEGF expression was significantly  decreased after NAC treatment in both subclones (Figure 5A,  5B). These results suggest that ROS could induce HIF-1a and consequently leads to increased VEGF expression. To further  validate the role of ROS in regulation of HIF-1a, the subclone cells were treated with PEG-calatase and mito-TEMPO, respec-  tively. We observed that H2O2 upregulated HIF-1a expression, whereas both PEG-calatase and mito-TEMPO down-regulated  the expression of HIF-1a in subclone cells (Figure 5C, 5D). Taken together, our findings demonstrated that ROS play a critical role  in cell migration and invasion partly through induction of HIF-1a.  ROS Promoted Cell Motility by Upregulation of HIF-1a Expression To determine the role of HIF-1a in ROS-mediated cell motility  and invasion, we constructed the expression vector of HIF-1a small interfering RNA to silence HIF 1a expression. The constructs were sequenced to confirm that there are no unwanted  mutations (Fig. 6A). The interfering effects were determined by  Western blotting analysis. HIF-1a protein expression was signif- icantly inhibited by its shRNA transfection (Fig. 6B). Then we  measured cell mobility and invasion ability after depletion of HIF-  1a. The results indicate that HIF-1a shRNA transfected cells significantly decreased cells mobility and invasive capacity  compared to control cells (Fig. 6C, 6D, 6E). Our results suggest  that rotenone initially generate mitochondrial dysfunction and  increased ROS production which, in turn, affect tumor cell  motility and invasive capacity by upregulation of HIF-1a expression.  Discussion  Mitochondria possess many biological functions, including the  production of ATP, housing numerous biochemical reactions,  generating ROS, and governing apoptosis [29]. Numerous studies  have suggested that these mitochondrial processes may play  important roles in tumor initiation and progression [30], [31]. For  example, mitochondrial ROS have been implicated in malignant  cell transformation [32]. Moreover, it has been suggested that  mitochondrial ROS may be important in the maintenance of  malignant phenotype through regulation of HIF-1a [28]. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that additional mitochondrial  alterations acquired after malignant transformation may increase  ROS production which will further contribute to cancer develop-  ment via ROS-dependent HIF-1a and VEGF pathways to promote cancer cell migration and invasion.  To achieve our goal, we choose rotenone to induce mitochon-  drial dysfunction to investigate whether rotenone could induce  ROS production. Both subclones of breast cancer cells showed  higher ROS consistent with declined mitochondrial respiration  function, as suggested by decreased ATP generation through  oxidative phosphorylation, increased ATP generation through  glycolysis, higher glucose uptake and lactate production. These  subclones also exhibited increased cellular motility and ability to  invade through Matrigel. These malignant behaviors were  inhibited by the antioxidant NAC, PEG-Calatase, and mito-  TEMPO, indicating the important role of ROS, which is  associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.  Although some researchers investigated the role of ROS in  carcinogenesis, the exact mechanisms how ROS are involved in  tumorigenesis are unclear. Recently, a number of studies have  suggested that mitochondrial ROS are involved in the stabilization  and activation of HIF under hypoxic conditions [21]. It is known  that HIF-1a, which is induced by hypoxia, growth factors, and oncogenes, plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and angiogenesis  [13]. ROS affect HIF-1a expression under gastric ischemic conditions, suggesting that ROS can regulate HIF-1a expression in gastric ischemia [33]. Moreover, increased ROS and ROS-  dependent stabilization of HIF under conditions of normal oxygen  tension have also been reported in cancer cells by suppression of  SdhB expression [20]. Furthermore, Xia et al. found that the  stabilization of HIF-1a via ROS generation led to the binding of HIF-1a to the FoxM1 promoter, resulting in increased FoxM1 oncoprotein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma [34]. Recent-  ly, mitochondria-target antioxidant mito-TEMPO has been  demonstrated to inhibit redox-dependent HIF-1a-mediated can- cer pro-survival signaling pathways [28]. Consistent with these  reports, our results clearly suggest that increased ROS production  is required for HIF-1a stabilization in the mitochondrial dysfunction cells induced by rotenone, and these effects were  attenuated by antioxidant NAC, PEG-Calatase, and mito-TEM-  PO. Therefore, our study indicates that ROS promote breast  cancer progression, which is in part mediated through up-  regulation of HIF-1a expression in breast cancer cells. Multiple studies have demonstrated that ROS regulate VEGF  expression in various human cancers [35]. For example, Xia et al.  reported that ROS regulate angiogenesis and tumor growth,  which is mediated through upregulation of VEGF [36]. Moreover,  Liu et al. found that ROS up-regulate VEGF and HIF-1a through the activation of Akt and p70S6K in human cancer cells [37].  Interestingly, HIF-1a has been found to control VEGF in a variety of human cancer cells [38], [39]. Notably, HIF-1a-mediated up- regulation of VEGF is important in the switch to the angiogenic  phenotype during early tumorigenesis [40]. Therefore, these  findings suggest that ROS govern VEGF production which is in  part mediated through up-regulation of HIF-1a. In line with these reports, we revealed that high levels of ROS production caused  elevated VEGF expression by regulating HIF-1a. Conversely, the decrease of HIF-1a expression by ROS inhibitors suppressed VEGF transcriptional activation. Taken together, our present  study suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction in breast cancer cells  with high ROS production promotes cell mobility and invasion  which is in part mediated through HIF-1a and VEGF. However, further in-depth investigation is warranted to explore the  molecular insight into the role of ROS-mediated tumorigenesis  in vivo.
