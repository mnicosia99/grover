Jesse Gore, Julie L. Wilson, Murray Korc*  Departments of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, The Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center and the Center for  Pancreatic Cancer Research, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America  Abstract  Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly cancer with a poor prognosis that is characterized by excessive mitogenic pathway activation and marked chemoresistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs. Dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) is a key negative regulator of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Yet, DUSP1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) in PDAC where it paradoxically enhances colony formation in soft agar and promotes in vivo tumorigenicity. However, it is not known whether DUSP1 overexpression contributes to PDAC chemoresistance. Using BxPC3 and COLO-357 human PCCs, we show that gemcitabine activates c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), key kinases in two major stress-activated signaling pathways. Gemcitabine-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation mediates increased apoptosis, but also transcriptionally upregulates DUSP1, as evidenced by increased DUSP1 mRNA levels and RNA polymerase II loading at DUSP1 gene body. Conversely, shRNA-mediated inhibition of DUSP1 enhances JNK and p38 MAPK activation and gemcitabine chemosensitivity. Using doxycycline-inducible knockdown of DUSP1 in established orthotopic pancreatic tumors, we found that combining gemcitabine with DUSP1 inhibition improves animal survival, attenuates angiogenesis, and enhances apoptotic cell death, as compared with gemcitabine alone. Taken together, these results suggest that gemcitabine-mediated upregulation of DUSP1 contributes to a negative feedback loop that attenuates its beneficial actions on stress pathways and apoptosis, raising the possibility that targeting DUSP1 in PDAC may have the advantage of enhancing gemcitabine chemosensitivity while suppressing angiogenesis.

While resection prolongs survival and  offers a potential cure, 80-85% of PDAC are unresectable at the  time of diagnosis due to the presence of distant metastases,  peritoneal seeding, or invasion into adjacent vital structures [2].  The chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine (29,29-difluorodeoxycy-  tidine, dFdC) has been the standard of care for patients with  locally advanced or metastatic disease [3]. Recently, the Food and  Drug Administration approved the combination of gemcitabine  and nab-paclitaxel, based on the finding that this combination  improved overall survival to 8.5 months versus 6.7 months with  gemcitabine alone [4]. It is generally accepted that improving  responsiveness to gemcitabine in PDAC would lead to an  additional increase in patient survival.  The resistance of PDAC to gemcitabine and many other  chemotherapeutic agents is due, in part, to a wide range of genetic  and epigenetic alterations which lead to abnormal activation of  cell survival and anti-apoptotic pathways [5], an intense desmo-  plasia which interferes with drug delivery to the tumor mass [6,7],  and changes in expression of key molecules involved in  gemcitabine uptake, intracellular activation and efflux [8]. There  is an urgent need, therefore, to advance our understanding of the  mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in PDAC, in order to  devise new and more effective chemotherapeutic strategies.  Abnormal activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases  (MAPKs) plays a critical role in regulating cell survival and  apoptosis [9,10]. MAPKs can be grouped into three families:  extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun-NH2 kinase  (JNK), and p38 MAPK [9,10]. Upon stimulation by mitogen or  environmental stress, MAPKs are activated through phosphory-  lation on their tyrosine and threonine residues by upstream  MAP2K kinases [9,10]. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate a  spectrum of target substrates, including protein kinases and  transcription factors involved in regulating cell proliferation,  differentiation, survival, and apoptosis [9,10]. Despite the  existence of crosstalk pathways among different MAPKs, most  evidence supports the concept that activated ERK promotes cell  proliferation, survival, and motility, while JNKs and p38 MAPKs  negatively regulate cell cycle progression and induce apoptotic cell  death in response to environmental stress [9,10].  The dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family of proteins  consists of 25 members [11]. DUSPs can dephosphorylate both the  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e84982    threonine/serine and tyrosine residues of their substrates and thus  function as negative regulators of MAPKs [11]. DUSP1/MKP-1 is  a nuclear MAPK phosphatase that is a direct transcriptional target  of p53, E2F-1, c-Jun, and ATF2, and that is induced in response to  oxidative stress, hypoxia, and other stresses such as nutritional  deprivation and chemotherapeutic drugs [12-14]. DUSP1 is  overexpressed in a range of epithelial tumors including PDAC,  non-small-cell lung cancer, breast, ovarian, gastric, and early-stage  prostate cancer [15-20], and this overexpression is correlated with  poor patient survival in ovarian cancer [18]. The increased  DUSP1 expression in breast cancer is inversely correlated with  JNK activity and markers of apoptosis, suggesting an anti-  apoptotic role of DUSP1 via its activity towards JNK [17]. In  support of this conclusion, cancer cells that overexpress DUSP1  are resistant to chemotherapy and Fas ligand-induced apoptosis,  whereas reduction of DUSP1 levels using a small interfering RNA  enhances sensitivity to these agents [21-23]. Conversely, in  hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increased DUSP1 levels correlate  with better prognosis [24]. Moreover, DUSP1 negatively regulates  ERK signaling in HCC cells, thereby inhibiting their proliferative  potential, suggesting that DUSP1 is a tumor suppressor gene in  HCC [24]. Thus, the deleterious consequences of DUSP1  overexpression are likely cancer specific.  We reported that DUSP1 is overexpressed in PDAC, and that  antisense-mediated suppression of DUSP1 expression reduces  tumor development in nude mice [15]. It is not known, however,  whether DUSP1 could be a target for improving response to  gemcitabine-based chemotherapy in PDAC. We now demonstrate  that gemcitabine activates JNK and p38 MAPK, thereby leading  to increased apoptosis and DUSP1 transcription. Conversely,  shRNA-mediated inhibition of DUSP1 enhances gemcitabine-  induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation and sensitizes PDAC cells  to gemcitabine. Using a doxycycline-inducible strategy to suppress  DUSP1 in established orthotopic pancreatic tumors, we show that  combining gemcitabine with DUSP1 inhibition prolongs survival,  attenuates angiogenesis, and enhances apoptotic cell death. Thus,  DUSP1 can be a potential therapeutic target for enhancing PDAC  sensitivity to gemcitabine.  Results  JNK and p38 MAPK Signaling Pathways are Activated in Response to Gemcitabine  The effects of gemcitabine on the PCC growth were evaluated  using the MTT assay. In all three cell lines, gemcitabine exerted a  dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. AsPC-1 was most  resistant to gemcitabine, with an IC50 greater than 100 ng/mL,  whereas BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells were more sensitive to  gemcitabine, with IC50 values of 10 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL,  respectively (Fig. 1A).  To evaluate the effects of gemcitabine on the activation of  MAPKs, cells were incubated with gemcitabine at a concentration  close to their respective IC50 s. In BxPC-3 and COLO-357,  gemcitabine induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK,  key kinases in two major stress-activated signaling pathways  (Fig. 1B). Gemcitabine also increased the levels of phospho-c-Jun  in these cells (Fig. 1B). Given that phospho-c-Jun is a common  downstream target of p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, this  observation confirmed the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK  signaling. Moreover, the levels of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved  PARP correlated with p38 MAPK, JNK, and c-Jun activation,  suggesting that p38 MAPK and JNK pathways mediate apoptotic  Figure 1.

By contrast, AsPC-  1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine, as evidenced by the  absence of p38 MAPK and JNK activation and the lower levels of  cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP, even at a concentration as  high as 100 ng/mL (Fig. 1B). To determine whether gemcitabine  induced apoptosis through p38 MAPK and JNK activation,  BxPC-3 cells were incubated with gemcitabine in the absence or  presence of p38 MAPK (SB203580) or JNK (SP600125) inhibitors.  The levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 were decreased  by SB203580 and SP600125, when added to gemcitabine (Fig. 1C).  Thus, in sensitive cell lines, gemcitabine activates p38 MAPK and  JNK signaling which induces apoptotic cell death, whereas  gemcitabine-resistance is associated with lower levels of apoptosis  and markedly attenuated p38 MAPK/JNK activation.  Gemcitabine Activates DUSP1 Transcription through JNK and p38 MAPK Signaling  Considering that DUSP1 is a key regulator of MAPK activities  [11], we next examined the expression of DUSP1 in response to  gemcitabine and the underlying mechanism regulating its expres-  sion. In both BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells, DUSP1 mRNA and  protein levels were induced at 24 h and 48 h following  gemcitabine addition, coinciding with the activation of p38  MAPK and JNK (Fig. 2A). By contrast, no significant changes  in DUSP1 levels were observed in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1  cells, consistent with the low levels of apoptosis and the absence of  p38 MAPK and JNK activation upon treatment (Fig. 2A).  In response to various stimuli, the transcription factor AP-1 (c-  Jun, c-Fos, ATF2), which is the major downstream target of p38  MAPK and JNK signaling, has been shown to associate with the  DUSP1 promoter and regulate its transcription [14,25]. To  determine whether p38 MAPK and JNK signaling mediate the  induction of DUSP1 expression by gemcitabine, BxPC-3 and  COLO-357 cells were treated with gemcitabine in the absence or  presence of SB203580, SP600125, or their combination.  SB203580 and SP600125 decreased the induction of DUSP1  mRNA levels by gemcitabine, whereas their combination com-  pletely blocked this induction. By contrast, ERK inhibition with  U0126 failed to alter gemcitabine-mediated induction of DUSP1,  supporting the conclusion that p38 MAPK and JNK rather than  ERK signaling mediate DUSP1 induction by gemcitabine  (Fig. 2B).  The increase in DUSP1 mRNA levels could be due to enhanced  transcriptional activity or posttranscriptional mRNA stability.  Therefore, chromatin immunoprecipitation against RNA poly-  merase II, which is the core component of the transcription  machinery, was next carried out, followed by Q-PCR to quantify  the amount of RNA polymerase II bound to the gene body region  of DUSP1. This assay allows for direct measurement of the active  elongation step and reflects the transcriptional activity of the  DUSP1 gene. Incubating BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells with  gemcitabine for 24 h increased the amount of RNA polymerase II  loading at the gene body region of DUSP1 by 6 fold and 12 fold  respectively (Fig. 2C), pointing to transcriptional activation of  DUSP1 by gemcitabine. SB203580 and SP600125, but not  Figure 2. Gemcitabine induces DUSP1 transcription through JNK and p38 MAPK signaling.

Together, these results indicate that p38 MAPK and  JNK signaling mediates DUSP1 transcriptional activation by  gemcitabine.  Interruption of the DUSP1 Negative Feedback Loop Enhances Chemosensitivity to Gemcitabine and Cisplatin  To investigate the effect of silencing DUSP1 on MAPK  activities and gemcitabine chemosensitivity, AsPC-1, BxPC-3,  and COLO-357 cells were stably transduced with lentivirus  expressing shRNA against DUSP1 or non-targeting scramble  control and then incubated with various gemcitabine concentra-  tions. In all three cell lines, DUSP1 knockdown using two shRNAs  increased the growth inhibitory actions of gemcitabine. Thus,  silencing DUSP1 shifted the IC50 values for gemcitabine in AsPC-  1, BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells from 500 to 10 ng/ml, from 10 to  5 ng/ml, and from to 5 to 2.5 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 3A). These  results suggest that DUSP1 knockdown enhanced gemcitabine  chemosensitivity, and that the sensitizing effects were more  marked in cells with high chemoresistance.  The anti-DUSP1 antibody routinely revealed 2 closely-migrat-  ing bands on western blots (Fig. 2-3). However, DUSP1  knockdown with two highly specific shRNAs targeting DUSP1  specifically silenced expression of the lower band (Fig. 3B),  indicating that the upper band was non-specific. DUSP1  knockdown with the same highly specific shRNAs also potentiated  gemcitabine-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of  cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 3B). Higher levels of  gemcitabine-induced phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-JNK  were also noted in DUSP1 knockdown cells, compared with  scramble control, suggesting that silencing DUSP1 de-repressed  p38 MAPK and JNK signaling, thereby leading to enhanced  apoptotic cell death in response to gemcitabine (Fig. 3B).  Considering that gemcitabine may be used in conjunction with  cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil to treat locally advanced or metastatic  PDAC [26,27], we next sought to determine whether targeting  DUSP1 would have similar sensitizing effects on other chemo-  therapeutic agents besides gemcitabine. To this end, BxPC-3 and  COLO-357 cells stably expressing shRNA against DUSP1 or  scramble control were treated with various concentrations of  cisplatin. In both BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells, DUSP1  knockdown decreased of the IC50 from 2 to 0.5 mg/ml, and also potentiated cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by  increased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 4A,  4B). Higher levels of cisplatin-induced phospho-p38 MAPK and  Figure 3. Effects of DUSP1 knockdown on gemcitabine response in human pancreatic cancer cells.

Taken together, these results suggest that interrupting  the negative feedback on p38 MAPK and JNK signaling by  suppressing DUSP1 could enhance apoptosis and improve the  chemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer to multiple chemotherapeu-  tic agents.  Knockdown of DUSP4, Another Nuclear DUSP, Fails to Enhance Chemosensitivity  We next sought to determine whether enhanced chemosensi-  tivity is unique to DUSP1 silencing or a common feature of  targeting any DUSP family members. Accordingly, we chose to  knockdown DUSP4/MKP-2, due to its similarity to DUSP1 in  terms of subcellular localization and substrate preference [11].  AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were stably transduced with lentivirus  encoding shRNA against DUSP4 or non-targeting scramble  control. Successful silencing of DUSP4 was confirmed with  immunoblotting (Fig. 5B). However, DUSP4 knockdown failed  to affect MAPK activation or the response to gemcitabine in either  cell line (Fig. 5A, 5B). Thus, DUSP1 is a potential therapeutic  target for potentiating stress-activated MAPKs signaling and  enhancing gemcitabine chemosensitivity, which is not necessarily  a shared characteristic of all DUSP family members.  Gemcitabine and DUSP1 Knockdown Combine to Prolong Survival, Attenuate Tumor Angiogenesis and Proliferation, and Enhance Apoptosis  We next sought to evaluate the effect of inhibiting DUSP1 on  gemcitabine chemosensitivity in an orthotopic mouse model. To  study the therapeutic potential of targeting DUSP1 in fully  established pancreatic tumors, we stably transduced COLO-357  human pancreatic cancer cells with lentivirus expressing doxycy-  cline-inducible shRNA against DUSP1 or a non-targeting  scramble control, before injecting the cells into the pancreas of  immunodeficient mice in a TET-OFF state. Two weeks later, cells  expressing doxycycline-inducible shRNA against DUSP1 or  scramble control formed tumors of similar size, which could be  easily palpated. All the mice were imaged on day 15 post-surgery,  using a high resolution ultrasound, and tumor volumes were  calculated based on acquired 3-D images, confirming that both  groups formed tumors of equal volume (Fig. 6). Starting at day 18  post-surgery, doxycycline was continuously administered in the  drinking water, and mice were randomized into 2 groups to  receive vehicle or gemcitabine (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injec-  tion, twice weekly). Gemcitabine alone or DUSP1 silencing alone  failed to prolong animal survival (Fig. 7A). However, comparison  of the shRNA-scramble/gemcitabine group and the shRNA-  DUSP1/gemcitabine group revealed that DUSP1 knockdown  Figure 4.

The increase in survival time  was even greater when comparing the shRNA-DUSP1/gemcita-  bine group with the shRNA-scramble/vehicle group (p = 0.009),  suggesting that DUSP1 silencing enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity  in vivo (Fig. 7A).  In agreement with in vitro findings, gemcitabine treatment  increased DUSP1 mRNA levels in shRNA-scramble tumors.  Most of the shRNA-DUSP1 tumors had relatively low levels of  DUSP1, whereas one tumor showed high DUSP1 levels, possibly  due to shorter doxycycline exposure or contamination with  adjacent non-tumor tissue when harvesting the sample. These  results suggest that doxycycline successfully induced shRNA  expression. However, due to high variability among each mouse,  the difference in DUSP1 levels among different groups was not  statistically significant (Fig. 7B).  To evaluate the effects of DUSP1 silencing and gemcitabine  treatment on tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis,  tumor tissues were next analyzed by immunohistochemical  staining for CD34 (angiogenesis) and Ki67 (proliferation), as well  as by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end  labeling (TUNEL) and cleaved caspase 3 immunoreactivity, both  of which are markers of apoptosis. Gemcitabine slightly attenuated  CD34 and Ki67 signals, while DUSP1 knockdown had a marked  inhibitory effect on CD34 staining and a more moderate but  highly significant inhibitory effect on Ki67 staining (Fig. 7C, 7D).  DUSP1 silencing also led to enhanced cleaved caspase 3  immunoreactivity and TUNEL signals, compared with scramble  control tumors, indicating that there was an increase in apoptotic  cell death following DUSP1 knockdown. The increase in caspase 3  cleavage and DNA fragmentation was even greater when  combining DUSP1 silencing with gemcitabine (Fig. 7C, 7D).  Thus, targeting DUSP1 in vivo led to suppressed angiogenesis and  cancer cell proliferation, and enhanced gemcitabine-induced  apoptosis.  Discussion  JNK1, -2, and -3 are encoded by MAPK8, MAPK9 and  MAPK10, respectively, and alternative splicing gives rise to at  least ten isoforms [9]. By contrast, p38 MAPK-a, -b, -c and -d are encoded by MAPK14, MAPK11, MAPK12, and MAPK13, respec-  tively, and there are two alternatively spliced isoforms of MAPK14  [9]. Globally, JNK and p38 MAPK stress activated pathways  Figure 5. Knockdown of MKP2 does not affect JNK/p38 MAPK signaling activity or pancreatic cancer chemosensitivity to gemcitabine.

In the current study we determined that gemcitabine activated  JNK and p38 MAPK, thereby inducing apoptosis in PCCs. While  the role of specific isoforms was not evaluated, gemcitabine-  activated JNK and p38 MAPK signaling also induced DUSP1  transcription, as evidenced by increased DUSP1 mRNA levels and  increased RNA polymerase II loading at DUSP1 gene body.  Moreover, shRNA-mediated inhibition of DUSP1 enhanced  gemcitabine-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation and  sensitized PDAC cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin, leading to  decreased cell proliferation and increased PARP and caspase 3  cleavage. These results suggest that gemcitabine-mediated activa-  tion of JNK and p38 MAPK leads to the upregulation of DUSP1,  which in turn contributes to a negative feedback loop that  attenuates JNK and p38 MAPK activities, thereby interfering with  the beneficial actions of gemcitabine on stress pathways and  apoptosis (Fig. 8). These observations raise the possibility that  DUSP1 can be a potential therapeutic target for enhancing PDAC  sensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover,  DUSP1 targeting leads to increased levels of p-ERK1 and p-  ERK2 [15], and ERK activation in pancreatic cancer cells  enhances gemcitabine chemoresistance [28]. Thus, gemcitabine-  induced increases in JNK and p38 MAPK activities are crucial for  its pro-apoptotic actions.  Downregulation of DUSP1 suppresses the expression of  angiogenic factors, such as SH2D2A and VEGF-C in non-small-  cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and functional assays have  confirmed the role of DUSP1 in promoting tumor angiogenesis  [29]. Furthermore, in human NSCLC specimens, DUSP1 co-  localizes with CD31-positive vascular structures, and a close  correlation between increased VEGF-C and DUSP1 expression  has been demonstrated [29]. These results support the concept  that DUSP1 may play an important role in tumor angiogenesis.  Although PDAC is characterized by marked desmoplasia and  hypoperfusion, it also exhibits a high propensity to metastasize via  hematogenous or lymphatic routes, even when the primary tumor  is small [30]. Moreover, PDAC exhibits foci of micro-angiogenesis  and overexpress multiple pro-angiogenic factors, and enhanced  angiogenesis, high serum VEGF-A levels, and increased VEGFR-  2 expression have been correlated with a worse prognosis in  PDAC patients [30]. Together, these reports underscore the  potential importance of aberrant angiogenesis in PDAC and  implicate DUSP1 as contributing to this process.  Using doxycycline-inducible knockdown of DUSP1 in estab-  lished orthotopic pancreatic tumors, in the present study we  determined that combining gemcitabine with DUSP1 inhibition  prolonged animal survival and enhanced apoptotic cell death,  compared with gemcitabine alone. In addition, DUSP1 knock-  down markedly attenuated PCC proliferation and tumor angio-  genesis. Our use of immune deficient mice precludes an  assessment of the consequence of DUSP1 inhibition on the  Figure 6. Quantitation of orthotopic tumors. COLO-357 cells were stably transduced with lentivirus expressing Tet-inducible control shRNA (shScramble) or DUSP1-targeting shRNA (shDUSP1). Cells were injected into the pancreata of immunodeficient mice, and 15 days later, tumors were imaged using a Vevo2100 high-resolution ultrasound. (A-B) Representative high-resolution ultrasound images (A) and quantitation of tumor volumes using 3D abdominal scans (B) show that prior to Dox or gemcitabine treatments, shScramble and shDUSP1 tumors (T, indicated by arrows) were similar in size. Data in (B) are the means 6 SEM. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0084982.g006  DUSP1 in Pancreatic Cancer  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e84982    immune system or on macrophage number and activation within  the pancreatic tumor mass. Given that DUSP1 is known to  modulate macrophage proliferation and activation [31], studies  with syngeneic or genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC  will be required to address this aspect of DUSP1 function in  PDAC.  The mechanisms that lead to increased DUSP1 expression in  PDAC are not known. It has been demonstrated, however, that  hypoxia can upregulate DUSP1 transcription [14], and PDAC is a  highly desmoplastic tumor with a markedly hypoxic microenvi-  ronment [5-7]. Moreover, in the presence of oxidative stress,  E2F1 induces DUSP1 expression [13], and E2F1 is upregulated in  PDAC as a consequence of RB dysfunction and excessive PI3K  activation [32,33]. Taken together with the present findings, these  observations suggest that PDAC may be \u2018\u2018primed'' to exhibit  increased DUSP1 activation in response to gemcitabine, and  suggest that targeting DUSP1 in PDAC could enhance the  beneficial actions of gemcitabine by promoting apoptosis and  suppressing pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumor  angiogenesis.

COLO-357 cells were a gift from Dr. R. Metzger at Duke  University, and were originally placed in culture by Morgan, et al.,  [34] from a patient with metastatic PDAC. They have been used  extensively [15,35,36], and were authenticated by chromosomal  analysis. AsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were grown in RPMI 1640,  and COLO-357 cells were grown in DMEM. Unless otherwise  specified, media were supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum  (FBS), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (complete medium).  3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) Assay  MTT assay was performed as described [35].  Immunoblotting Immunoblotting was done as described previously [35] using  antibodies against the following antigens: PARP, Caspase-3,  Cleaved Caspase-3 (Asp175), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/  Tyr182), p38 MAPK, phospho-JNK (G9), and phospho-c-Jun  (Ser63) from Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA;  DUSP1(C-19), MKP2(S-18), JNK (FL) and ERK2 (C-14), from  Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Horseradish perox-  idase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies  were from BioRad, Hercules, CA.  Reverse Transcription and Real-time Quantitative PCR Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy purification kit  (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Total RNA (1 mg) was reverse transcribed using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit. Taqman  quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) was carried out on an ABI  Prism 7300 machine, and analyzed using a StepOnePlus Real-  Time PCR system, all from Applied Biosystems, (Carlsbad, CA).  All probes were pre-designed and obtained from Applied  Biosystems. 18S was used as internal control. Gene expression  levels were calculated using the relative DCt method [37].  Chromatin Immunoprecipitation BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells were cross-linked with 1%  formaldehyde for 10 min at 37uC. The cells were then rinsed with cold PBS, harvested and lysed with 1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA,  and 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) containing a protease inhibitor  cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Chromatin fragmentation was  subsequently achieved by two sequential sonications (10 min each)  using 30 sec on/off cycles and a Bioruptor sonicator (Diagenode,  Denville, NJ) at the highest intensity. The soluble chromatin was  diluted in buffer containing 1% Triton, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM  NaCl, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.1) and added into Dynal  magnetic beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) which were pre-incubated  with anti-RNA polymerase II antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, MA)  or control IgG. After 24 h, beads were washed and immune  complexes were eluted using 100 ml of 1% SDS and 0.1 M  NaHCO3 [38]. Samples were incubated overnight at 65uC to reverse cross-linking, and DNA was purified using PCR  purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Fold enrichments were  determined using SYBR green Q-PCR (Applied Biosystems,  Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The  following primers were used for Q-PCR: DUSP1 gene body  forward, TGTGGGCAACATTCCTGTAA; DUSP1 gene body  reverse, CAAAGGATGGCACAGGATTT.  Lentivirus-mediated Delivery of shRNA The pTRIPZ lentiviral vectors for DUSP1 (V3THS_407291,  V2THS_160994) and non-silencing shRNA control (RHS4743),  and the pGIPZ lentiviral vectors for MKP2 (V3LHS_333999,  V3LHS_334001) and non-silencing shRNA control (RHS4348)  were purchased from Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL. Packaging  was performed using a second generation plasmid transfection  system as previously described [36]. After infecting AsPC-1,  BxPC-3, and COLO-357 cells with lentivirus in the presence of  8 mg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO), cells were selected with 6 mg/ml puromycin. For cells transduced with pTRIPZ lentivirus, DUSP1 levels were assessed by immunoblot-  ting 72 h following the addition of 2 mg/ml doxycycline. Both puromycin and doxycycline were from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis,  MO).  Orthotopic Implantation of Tumor Cells and Treatment Schedule  Twenty four 6- to 8-week-old male NOD/SCID/IL-2Rg null  mice were obtained from the In Vivo Therapeutics Core of  Indiana University Simon Cancer Center. COLO-357 cells  (0.56106) were stably transduced with pTRIPZ/sh-scramble or pTRIPZ/sh-DUSP1, suspended in 50 ml sterile PBS, and injected into the subcapsular region of the pancreas [39]. Tumors were  imaged on day 15 post-surgery, using a Vevo2100 high resolution  ultrasound (Visual Sonics Inc., Toronto, Canada), and tumor  volumes were calculated based on acquired 3-D abdominal scans,  using Vevo2100 System software (Visual Sonics). On day 18 post-  surgery, mice were started on drinking water supplemented with  2 mg/ml doxycycline and 2% sucrose, and further randomized  into two treatment groups: (1) vehicle control (saline); (2) 50 mg/kg  gemcitabine (Biotang, Waltham, MA), intraperitoneal injection,  biweekly. Individual mice were sacrificed when moribund  Figure 8. Model of the role of DUSP1 in promoting PDAC chemoresistance.

Survival time was recorded,  and tumor tissues were collected for further analysis. RNA was  extracted from pancreatic tumors as previously described [40]  using pre-cooled RNA extraction buffer consisting of 5 M  guanidium thiocyanate, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5 mM  EDTA, and 8% b-mercaptoethanol.  Immunohistochemistry Orthotopic tumors were fixed in 10% formalin and embedded  in paraffin. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry were  performed using 5 mm thick sections [41]. The following antibodies were used: Ki67 (Novacastra Leica Microsystems,  Buffalo Grove, IL), cleaved caspase 3 (Asp175, Cell Signaling  Technology, Danvers, MA), and CD34 (MEC 14.7, Abcam,  Cambridge, MA). Sections were incubated in HRP-labeled  secondary antibody and staining was detected by DAB (Dako,  Carpinteria, CA). TUNEL assay was performed using the In Situ  Cell Death Detection POD Kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN)  according to the manufacturer's protocol. Images were taken  using an Olympus BX60 microscope (Olympus, Center Valley,  PA) equipped with a QImaging EXI Blue camera and ImagePro  software (Media Cybernetics, Atlanta, GA).  Statistical Methods Statistical analysis was conducted using the GraphPad InStat  software (version 3.00; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).  Significance was determined using one-way ANOVA, followed by  the Dunnett test to compare all groups against the corresponding  control group, and the Bonferroni test for specific pairwise  comparisons. Statistical significance was taken as p#0.05.  Author Contributions  Conceived and designed the experiments: FL MK. Performed the  experiments: FL AJG JLW. Analyzed the data: FL MK AJG.
