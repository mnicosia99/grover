This critical role of OCT4 is maintained in  embryonic stem cells [7-10], the developing germline [11-13],  and germline tumors, such as seminomas and embryonic  teratocarcinomas [14-18]. When inducing pluripotency in differ-  entiated cells, OCT4 appears to be an essential, but not the only  required transcription factor [19,20]. OCT4 acts as a transcrip-  tional activator of genes involved in maintenance of undifferen-  tiated state and as a repressor of differentiation-specific genes  [7,21,22].  In addition to its presence in embryonic and germ-derived cells,  expression of OCT4 and other pluripotency markers has been  reported in cancers, adult stem cells and various adult somatic  tissues. The most abundant reports about OCT4 expression can  be found for hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells  from umbilical cord blood and bone marrow [23-28]. Detection  of OCT4 transcripts in these compartments has led to a suggestion  that embryonic OCT4A may participate in maintenance of  stemness in adult stem cell compartments [29], somatic tissue  cancers (bladder [30], squamous cell carcinoma [31], breast  carcinoma [32,33] and may even be expressed in normal  differentiated tissues [34,35]. Most astoundingly, existence of true  pluripotent embryonic stem-like cells in adult organs has been  proposed [23-25,36,37]. We have described expression of OCT4  in adult human fibroblasts undergoing induction into a regener-  ation competent cell type (iRC) using low oxygen culture and  medium supplementation with FGF2 [35,38,39]. iRC cells display  increased life span, maintain normal karyotype, express a number  of stem cell genes, participate in in vivo regeneration of skeletal  muscle, but do not form tumors [39]. While we observed that the  amount of OCT4 transcript does not change before and after  induction, we at the time did not examine whether the transcript  belonged to the OCT4A or its pseudogenes.  The POU5F1 gene produces three transcripts by alternative  splicing [40,41] and three protein isoforms by alternative codon  use [42] (Figure 1). Only the OCT4A transcript contains the first  exon at its 59 sequence and only protein translated from this  transcript consequently contains the unique N-terminal transacti-  vation domain that regulates DNA binding of OCT4A to target  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/   promoters. It is only this full length OCT4A - a 360 amino acid  protein - that localizes to the nucleus, binds to OCT4-regulated  promoters, and contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency  and self-renewal [43]. OCT4A transcript and protein can be  distinguished from the non-pluripotency variants (OCT4B) using  primers specific for 59 sequence of OCT4A mRNA and N-  terminal-recognizing antibodies, respectively, as well as by their  distinct subcellular localization [41,42,44,45].  With a more recent description of OCT4 pseudogenes and their  expression [46-48], however, studies examining OCT4 expression  have to consider an additional level of complexity (Table S1,  Figure S1). Eight OCT4 pseudogenes have been identified using  bioinformatics approach [47] and several of these are expressed  and translated into proteins in somatic tumors, but not in  embryonic carcinomas, fibroblasts or normal tissues [48-51].  Among the OCT4 pseudogenes, OCT4-pg1, OCT4-pg3 and  OCT4-pg4 pseudogenes share a high sequence homology to  OCT4A and share the unique N-terminal coding sequence.  Similarly, cell types isolated from umbilical cord or adult bone  marrow express OCT4-pg3, OCT4-pg4, and OCT4-pg5 but do  not express embryonic OCT4A [52], and reports identifying these  transcripts as OCT4A may have been erroneous. The only adult,  non-cancer cell type that has been reported to express pseudo-  genes are cells derived from peripheral blood [36]. It has been  suggested that pseudogenes may play regulatory roles in expres-  sion of genes from which they originate, potentially by an RNA  interference-like mechanisms [53,54] or even as weak transcrip-  tional activators [48].  When studying expression of OCT4 it is therefore critically  important to account for OCT4 transcripts, OCT4 pseudogene  transcripts and all the possible protein products, the majority of  which have no demonstrated DNA-binding activity. While  methods and reagents to distinguish between OCT4A and  OCT4B transcripts and protein variants are available, unavail-  ability of similar reagents to distinguish between embryonic  OCT4A and its pseudogene transcripts and proteins remains an  obstacle to studying activity of these genes in more detail. Here we  describe unique endonuclease restriction sites within OCT4A and  its pseudogenes that enable differentiation between their tran-  scripts, and investigate their expression in undifferentiated and  differentiated human cells.  We demonstrate that embryonic stem cells express exclusively  OCT4A and that during differentiation this expression ceases and  is replaced by expression of pseudogenes. Similar regulation,  however faster, takes place in teratocarcinoma cells. We also show  that all differentiated cell types express exclusively pseudogenes,  but this expression can shift to predominantly embryonic OCT4 in  adult human fibroblasts undergoing induction of regenerative  competence (iRC) by FGF2 and low oxygen.  Materials and Methods  Cell Culture Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs, WA09) and induced  pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs, DF19-9-7T) were obtained,  cultured, and maintained as recommended by the supplier  (WiCell). For differentiation into embryonic bodies (EBs), stem  cells were either trypsinized (hESCs) or mechanically dissociated  (iPSCs) and plated onto low attachment culture plates in  differentiation medium consisting of DMEM-F12, 7.5% serum  replacement, 10% FBS, 0.56NEAA (Gibco), 0.005% b-mercap- toethanol (Gibco), and 2 mmol of retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium was changed with fresh medium twice a week. On day 5 of  differentiation, EBs were transferred to cell culture plates where  Figure 1.

NTERA, NCCIT (both  teratocarcinoma), HeLa, and NHSY (glioblastoma) cells were  obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC).  For differentiation, NTERA cells were seeded at density 16106  cells per 75 cm 2 in expansion medium (DMEM +10% FBS). After  attachment the medium was changed to differentiation medium  consisting of DMEM +10% FBS supplemented with 0.01 mM trans-retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium was changed twice a week  and samples for RNA isolation taken during 21 days post-  differentiation.  Other cell types or their total RNA was obtained from Lonza  (human mesenchymal stem cells - hMSCs, human umbilical cord  vascular endothelium - HUVEC), Clontech (testis RNA), Lonza  (smooth muscle cells, and Clontech (RNA from heart). All cell  types were cultures as recommended by suppliers. Control adult  primary human fibroblasts CRL-2352 (ATCC) were cultured in  DMEM-F12, 10% FBS at ambient oxygen, or in 2% oxygen in the  same medium, supplemented with 4 ng/mL of FGF2 (Pepro-  Tech).  Total RNA Extraction and RT-PCR Total RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen).  RNA integrity was examined on 1% agarose gel. 1 mg of total RNA was reverse transcribed using QuantiTech Reverse Tran-  scription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Total RNA was first treated with DNA Wipeout buffer to remove  potential contamination of genomic DNA and then used for  reverse transcription. The cDNA samples were stored at 220uC. The polymerase chain reaction contained 26 GoTaq Green Mastermix (Promega), 20 pmols of primers and PCR water. The  PCR primers used for PCR were: NANOG F: 59-  TGTCTTCTGCTGAGATGCCTCACA-39 and R: 59-  CCTTCTGCGTCACACCATTGCTAT-39; CRIPTO1 F: 59-  GACGAGCAAATTCCTGATGG-39 and R: 59-  GCCTCTTTTCCCCCTAATTG-39; GAPDH F: 59-ATCAC-  CATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-39 and R: 59-  TTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACG-39; OCT4 F, 59-  GTTGATCCTCGGACCTGGCTA-39; R, 59-  GGTTGCCTCTCACTCGGTTCT-39. The OCT4 primers  were designed to bind at nucleotides 142-162 and 768-788 of  the coding OCT4 sequence and amplify OCT4 as well as  pseudogene 1, 3 and 4 transcripts (Figure 1). PCR cycling  parameters consisted of an initial cDNA denaturation of 2 min at  95uC, followed by 15 sec at 94uC, 30 sec at annealing temperature 60uC, and DNA extension for 1 min at 72uC for 31 cycles. A final extension step was performed at 72uC for 10 min and held at 4uC until analysis. All PCR reactions included no template controls or  no RT reaction. PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel  electrophoresis and were visualized by exposure to 535 nm light  on Kodak MM4000 image analyzer.  PCR Clean-up Four 25 microliter reactions were combined and PCR product  cleaned using NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). Briefly,  PCR reactions were diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer NT and  loaded on NucleoSpin Extract II column and centrifuged 1 min at  11,0006g. Flow-through was discarded and column washed with 700 mL of buffer NT3 and then the membrane was dried for 2 min at 11,0006g. DNA was eluted into a new 1.5 mL tube and DNA concentration was determined with Nanodrop.  Restriction Digest Sequence alignments between OCT4A and OCT4-pg1,  OCT4-pg3 and OCT4-pg4 were used to identify restriction sites  that were then used for differentiation between the transcripts  (Figure 2). A previously described ApaI restriction site specific for  embryonic OCT4A [55] and three novel restriction sites for  pseudogenes were selected (HinfI for OCT4-pg1; BglI for OCT4-  pg3, XhoI for OCT4-pg4; all from NEBiolabs). 500 ng of PCR  amplicons were digested with 12.5U ApaI, 10U XhoI, 10U BglI,  or 10U HinfI. ApaI digestion reaction was incubated for 1.5 h at  room temperature and the other three for 1.5 h at 37uC. Digested products were separated on 2% agarose gel with ethidium  bromide and visualized by exposure to 535 nm light on a Kodak  MM4000 image analyzer.  Cloning and Sequencing PCR amplicons were cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (TOPO  TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing, Invitrogen), were transformed  into TOPO10 competent E. coli, and were then plated onto LB-  agar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Antibiotic resistant colonies were selected, expanded, and plasmid was isolated, and  bi-directionally sequenced from both T3 and T7 promoters  (Genewiz). Three clones were sequenced for OCT4A from ESCs,  3 clones for each pseudogene from control fibroblasts and 6 clones  for OCT4A from treated fibroblasts.  Western Blotting Total cell lysates were prepared using common procedures.  Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as follows: cells  were collected using 0.05% trypsin (Cellgro) and washed twice  with PBS and pelleted. Buffer A (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES  pH8.0, 500 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine,  0.15 mM spermine, 0.2% Triton X-100, 7 mM 2-mercaptoeth-  anol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor cocktail  (Roche) was used to isolate cytoplasmic fractions. The cell pellets  were then washed with buffer B (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES  pH8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine,  0.15 mM spermine, 7 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented  with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Buffer C  (350 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES pH8.0, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mM  EDTA, 0.5 mM spermidine, 0.15 mM spermine, 7 mM 2-  mercaptoethanol) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor  cocktail (Roche) was used to isolate nuclear extracts. Protein  concentration was quantified using Bradford Protein Assay Kit  (Thermo Scientific). Lysates, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions  were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto PVDF  membrane using Towbin's transfer buffer. Membranes were  blocked with 5% dry milk and 5% FBS in TTBS and incubated  with primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer. Primary anti-  human OCT4 antibodies used were rabbit polyclonal ab19857  derived against the C-terminus of human OCT4, rabbit polyclonal  ab18976 derived against amino acids 1-14 (both from Abcam);  and mouse monoclonal sc-5279 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)  developed against the N-terminus. The anti-a-tubulin antibody (Sigma) was used as a loading control. Appropriate secondary  HRP-conjugated antibodies were used and signal detected by  enhanced chemilluminescence (Amersham, BioRad) on Kodak  MM4000.  Immunocytochemistry The same three anti-OCT4 antibodies were used for ICC: sc-  5279 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), ab19857, and ab18976 (both  from Abcam). The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-  mouse AlexaFluor568 and anti-rabbit AlexaFluor568. Alexa-  Fluor488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) was used to stain  actin filaments and DAPI to stain DNA.

HinfI digestion results in several smaller fragments among which the 434 bp fragment is specific only for OCT4-pg1. BglI digests only OCT4-pg3 into two fragments of 412 bp and 232 bp. XhoI does not digest OCT4-pg4. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0089546.g002  Expression of OCT4 and Its Pseudogenes  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546    with appropriate excitation/emission on Leica confocal micro-  scope using identical image acquisition settings.  Results  The Pool of OCT4 Transcripts in Various Cell Types is Composed of Messages Originating from its Gene and its Pseudogenes To establish a baseline expression levels for stem cell genes in  hESCs and iPSCs, we first examined expression of OCT4,  NANOG and CRIPTO1 by RT-PCR. As expected, strong  expression of all three stem cell genes was maintained during  hESC (Figure 3A) and iPSC maintenance culture (data not  shown). Starting 10 days after induction of differentiation, the  expression of these embryonic markers gradually decreased and  was undetectable for CRIPTO1 on day 14 and NANOG on day  17. Low levels of OCT4 transcript, however persisted and were  still detectable on day 21 (Figure 3B). Expression of the same genes  in control adult human fibroblasts resembled the expression of  these genes in day 21 differentiated hESCs. We next examined  whether expression of these genes can be detected in adult human  fibroblasts cultured in 2% oxygen culture in the presence of FGF2.  RT-PCR amplified transcripts could be detected for all three  genes after 3 days and increased on day 7 (Figure 3C), confirming  our previously published observations [37].  In addition to recognizing the OCT4A, our OCT4 primers  were designed to amplify a fragment including 59 region which is  common for OCT4A and pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, but which is  missing in all other pseudogene transcripts and OCT4B transcripts  (Figure 1). The expected 646 bp amplicon, therefore could contain  any of the four transcripts. This allowed us to examine the OCT4  amplicon in these cells in more detail. To identify the composition  of the transcripts that could contribute to the 646 bp OCT4  amplicon at any time and to distinguish between the individual  transcripts, we searched otherwise highly homologous sequences of  OCT4 and OCT4-pg1, 3 and 4 for potentially unique endonu-  clease restriction sites. In addition to previously described ApaI  site, that is specific only for OCT4A [55], we were able to identify  three restriction sites that were then selected for differentiation  between pseudogene transcripts (Figure 2). Restriction analysis of  the amplicon from hESCs during differentiation is presented in  Figure 3D. ApaI restriction analysis of the 646 bp PCR product  identified the persistence of OCT4A until day 14 of differentiation,  as evident by ApaI restriction of the amplicon into 146 and 500 bp  fragments. By day 17 the amplicon could not be digested by ApaI  any longer. This indicated that the embryonic OCT4A transcript  was no longer present and the entire 646 bp amplicon on day 17  and after consisted of pseudogene transcripts. Digestion of the  amplicon with XhoI, which digests all but the OCT4-pg4  indicated very low amounts of this transcript in hESCs and  started gradually increasing between days 10 and 14 after  differentiation. Digestion with BglI which cuts only OCT4-pg3  (412 and 232 bp fragments) revealed a gradual increase of this  transcript 14 days after differentiation. Lastly, digestion with HinfI  which cuts all transcripts into 5 fragments except OCT4-pg1 (4  fragments) similarly indicated the start of OCT4-pg1 transcription  on day 14 by the virtue of the longer, 424 bp fragment unique to  OCT4-pg1. Overall, the amount of all pseudogene transcripts  increased with a concomitant decease in transcription of OCT4A  over the 21 days of hESC differentiation. The pattern of OCT4A  and pseudogenes expression in control fibroblasts resembled the  pattern observed in differentiated hESCs and control fibroblasts,  which expressed only OCT4 pseudogenes (Figure 3E). However,  ApaI digestion of the OCT4 amplicon from fibroblasts grown in  2% oxygen and with 4 ng/ml FGF2- the conditions we have  previously used to induce a phenotype switch to a regeneration  competent cell [38] - identified embryonic OCT4A transcript at  both day 3 and day 7 of culture in these conditions, indicating a  reversal of expression from OCT4 pseudogenes to embryonic  OCT4A (Figure 3G), resembling the pattern of ApaI digestion in  hESC and iPSCs (Figure 3D and 3F). When a variety of other cell  types were examined, only hESCs and teratocarcinoma cell lines  (NTERA and NCCIT) expressed ApaI-sensitive OCT4A tran-  script (Figure 3H). Similar downregulation of OCT4A transcript  was observed during differentiation of teratocarcinoma cells  (Figure 4), however, simultaneous expression of pseudogenes  started increasing much earlier during differentiation, and could  be observed from day 5 onward.  To confirm our restriction digestion results, the 646 bp PCR  amplicons from hESCs, 2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts and  control fibroblasts were cloned into TOPO vector and three clones  from each sample for each pseudogene and six clones from  2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts were sequenced. Sequencing  confirmed our restriction data; hESCs and 2%O2/FGF2 treated  fibroblasts expressed only embryonic OCT4A, while control  fibroblasts expressed OCT4-pg1, pg3 and pg4 (Tables S2-S7).  Translation and Localization of Protein Products of OCT4 Gene and its Pseudogenes To determine whether any of the OCT4 transcripts were, in  fact, translated into detectable proteins, Western blotting was  performed. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, the OCT4 sc-5279  antibody, directed against N-terminal protein sequence, recog-  nized several bands in teratocarcinoma cells (NCCIT) and in  fibroblasts, regardless of culture conditions. The doublet that  migrated at 45/43 kDa (OCT4A or OCT4pg1) and a band  migrating around 37 kDa (likely somatic OCT4B) were present in  all samples, while the two faster migrating proteins (30 and  20 kDa) were present only in fibroblasts gown in ambient oxygen,  regardless off FGF2 supplementation. The proteins were detected  in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of fibroblasts. Knowing  that FGF2/2%O2 fibroblasts express OCT4A, however, it is  reasonable to assume that some of the slower migrating doublet  represents embryonic OCT4A. In control fibroblasts these bands  are likely contributed by pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, as the antibody  should recognize sequences in the N-terminal of these proteins  (Figure 5A). The second antibody, ab19857 (against C-terminal),  similarly recognized the doublet of 45/43 kDa and a protein  migrating around 37 kDa, but failed to recognize any other  protein products. The amount of detected protein at 37 kDa was  significantly higher in cells grown in low oxygen and potentiated  by addition of FGF2 (Figure 5B). The third antibody ab18976,  derived against the N-terminal OCT4 sequence could, in principle  detect OCT4A and pseudogenes 1 and 3. Intensity of the band in  treated fibroblast was significantly lower than in hESCs  (Figure 5C). A 31 kDa band was detected in both control and  treated fibroblasts and could represent OCT4pg4. The identity of  the 26 kDa band detected with this antibody remains unknown.  An additional 19 kDa protein, that could be the product pf  OCT4pg3, was recognized in control fibroblasts, but was absent in  stem cells and treated fibroblasts.  Immunocytochemistry revealed OCT4 presence in cell nuclei of  hESCs regardless of the antibody used, as expected (Figure 6). The  N-terminal specific antibody sc-5279 recognized weak nuclear  signal in 2%O2/FGF2 fibroblasts. The C-terminal ab19857  recognized nuclear localized protein in hESCs, and nuclear and  cytoplasmic proteins in control and treated fibroblasts. As none of  the OCT4B variants localize to the nucleus, the nuclear signal can  Expression of OCT4 and Its Pseudogenes  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546    be contributed only by OCT4A or pseudogene OCT4-pg1  derived protein [48,51]. Considering the individual cell type  transcript profile, it is possible that in treated fibroblasts the  antibody recognized OCT4A. The OCT4-pg4 protein has yet to  be detected by any anti-OCT4 antibody, and OCT4-pg3 localizes  to the cytoplasm [51]. The sc-8629, another C-terminal specific  antibody, recognized nuclear OCT4A in hESCs and cytoplasmic  proteins in both control and treated fibroblasts. Cytoplasmic  staining in both fibroblasts may be identifying OCT4A, OCT4B,  OCT4pg1 [42], and/or OCT4-pg3 [51]. These data corroborate  our previously published results [35] and indicate that expression  of OCT4 in somatic cells is under the control of an oxygen and  FGF2-sensitive mechanism.  Discussion  OCT4 has received considerable attention during the past years  and its expression has been reported in various cell types and  across a spectrum of differentiation cell states. Due to the  possibility of multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms, as  well as expressed pseudogenes being detected, more rigorous  analyses of OCT4 are required [44,46]. Existence of high number  of pseudogenes for OCT4 is not an exception. Excessive frequency  of pseudogenes for embryonic stem cells-specific genes was also  described for Nanog (10 pseudogenes), Stella (16 pseudogenes),  and Cripto-1 (6 pseudogenes) [47,52].  We identified expression of Oct-4pg1, Oct-4pg3 and Oct-4pg4  pseudogenes in normal adult human fibroblasts using PCR based  approach followed by pseudogene-specific restriction digestion and  sequencing. Our study confirms that expression of OCT4A  protein is exclusive to hESCs and germ cell-derived tumor cell  Figure 3. RT-PCR for expression of embryonic stem cell specific genes.

None of the other examined somatic cells, somatic tumor cell  lines or adult stem cells expressed OCT4A. In an exact opposite  pattern, all cell types examined except hESCs and germ cell  tumor-derived cell lines expressed pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4.  Monitoring the relationship between OCT4A expression and  expression of pseudogenes in hESCs during differentiation, an  interesting pattern emerges; a gradual decrease of OCT4A occurs  in a parallel with an increase in expression of pseudogenes. This  may indicate a tight regulatory relationship between OCT4A and  its pseudogenes, even though the OCT4 gene and all the  pseudogenes are located on different chromosomes [47]. One of  the pseudogenes, namely OCT4-pg3 is located within the 445 kb  of NANOG, STELLA and GDF3 locus on chromosome 12 [56],  significance of which still needs to be examined.  It is interesting that similar changes occur in reverse during  acquisition of regeneration competence in adult human fibroblasts.  After a short term culture in reduced oxygen and supplementation  with FGF2 [35,38] human fibroblast cease expressing OCT4  pseudogenes in favor of OCT4A. We have reported previously  that these cells do not acquire the pluripotent phenotype [35], but  rather undergo a phenotype switch that demonstrates regeneration  competence in vivo [38]. Cells demonstrate an increased life span,  doubled population doubling capacity, maintain a normal  karyotype and do not form tumors in SCID mice. They do,  however, demonstrate long term engraftment and acquire PAX7  positive phenotype when transplanted into a skeletal muscle defect  in mice [38]. Significance and relevance of OCT4A expression, if  any, during acquisition of regeneration competence, is not clear  and is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, this is the first  study in which a switch from pseudogene to OCT4A expression  has been reported and induced by selective manipulation of  culture conditions. We speculate that pseudogene silencing is  induced in adult somatic cells using our culture system, an event  that may be required for re-activation of OCT4A. While clearly  not pluripotent, regeneration-competent cells express low levels of  OCT4A. It has been shown that OCT4 is controlling pluripotency  in a quantitative manner [57]. Specifically, high level of OCT4  expression drives ES cells to endoderm and mesoderm lineages,  while stem cells with low level of OCT4 differentiate into  trophoectoderm. Only a specific level of OCT4 can maintain  stem cells in a pluripotent state. These observations suggest that  OCT4 is different from many known transcription regulators that  appear to function in an on-off manner. Consequently, low levels  of embryonic OCT4A may not be functionally relevant for either  induction or maintenance of pluripotency, but may be relevant for  induction of this novel regeneration-competent cell phenotype.  Our data indicate that chromatin plasticity may be an inherent  feature of adult fibroblasts and that the manifestation of this  plasticity may be influenced by the extracellular environment. Our  data also support the notion that regeneration competence does  not depend on cell pluripotency and may be regulated by a novel,  OCT4A-dependent mechanism.

Neither OCT4 nor its  pseudogenes, for example, are required for multipotency of human  stromal cells from different tissues [49]. There is no common  regulatory network that has been shown to exist between the  various somatic stem cell types and that can be compared to gene  regulatory network that maintains pluripotency in ES cells with  OCT4 as its cornerstone [52,58]. It is more likely that  Figure 5. Protein expression of stem cell specific genes.

Complete cell lysates or nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (N and C, respectively) were separated on 10% SDS PAGE, transferred to PVDF and blotted with different antibodies. Fibroblasts were grown for 7 days under low (2 or 5%) or ambient (19%) oxygen, in the presence or absence of FGF2 (+ and 2, respectively). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0089546.g005  Figure 6.

Several reports argue that detection of OCT4A in somatic cells  is an artifact; possibly a consequence of DNA contamination and/  or inability of currently available methods to distinguish between  OCT4A and its pseudogenes. Misidentification of OCT4 in  somatic tissues and cancer cell lines can also result from detection  of pseudogene transcripts by RT-PCR and/or nuclear detection of  pseudogene proteins by ICC. Most studies indeed do not exclude  the possibilities of pseudogene expression [16,44,46,59] and do not  distinguish between OCT4 isoforms [46]. All OCT4 protein  isoforms are identical in their C-terminal region and distinct in N-  terminal region so the location of the epitope recognized by any  anti-OCT4 antibody should be considered first [42,46] and  combined with a diligent analysis of the OCT4 transcript. Adding  the possibility that OCT4 pseudogenes translate into proteins and  that OCT4-pg1 can localize to the nucleus [51] and confer  transcriptional activation of some reporter gene constructs [48],  diligent analysis should be employed. This may likely require a  combination of experimental approaches, such as RT-PCR,  restriction analysis for various pseudogenes, and protein analysis.  Additional functional studies, such as chromatin immunoprecip-  itation, electromobility shift assay and/or transcription analysis of  downstream genes may need to be included to reach a valid  conclusion.  Besides accurately characterizing OCT4 expression, relevance  of OCT4 expression should be considered for each chosen  experimental system. While OCT4A expression may be critically  important when studying pluripotency and self-renewal, examin-  ing expression of OCT4A in studies involving stem cells from adult  compartments or in somatic cell cancers may be of little functional  relevance [59,60].
