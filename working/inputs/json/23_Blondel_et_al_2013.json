  The Type VI Secretion System Encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 19 Is Required for Salmonella enterica Serotype Gallinarum Survival within Infected Macrophages  Carlos J.

Santiviago, In\u00e9s Contreras  Departamento de Bioqu\u00edmica y Biolog\u00eda Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Qu\u00edmicas y Farmac\u00e9uticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile  Salmonella enterica serotype Gallinarum is the causative agent of fowl typhoid, a disease characterized by high morbidity and mortality that causes major economic losses in poultry production. We have reported that S. Gallinarum harbors a type VI secre- tion system (T6SS) encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 19 (SPI-19) that is required for efficient colonization of chicks. In the present study, we aimed to characterize the SPI-19 T6SS functionality and to investigate the mechanisms behind the pheno- types previously observed in vivo. Expression analyses revealed that SPI-19 T6SS core components are expressed and produced under in vitro bacterial growth conditions. However, secretion of the structural/secreted components Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG to the culture medium could not be determined, suggesting that additional signals are required for T6SS-dependent secretion of these proteins. In vitro bacterial competition assays failed to demonstrate a role for SPI-19 T6SS in interbacterial killing. In con- trast, cell culture experiments with murine and avian macrophages (RAW264.7 and HD11, respectively) revealed production of a green fluorescent protein-tagged version of VgrG soon after Salmonella uptake. Furthermore, infection of RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages with deletion mutants of SPI-19 or strains with genes encoding specific T6SS core components (clpV and vgrG) revealed that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum survival within macrophages at 20 h postuptake. SPI-19 T6SS function was not linked to Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity or cell death of infected macrophages, as has been described for other T6SS. Our data indicate that SPI-19 T6SS corresponds to a novel tool used by Salmonella to survive within host cells.  The Salmonella genus includes over 2,500 known serotypes dis-tributed between two species, S. enterica and S. bongori (1). Salmonella infections can range from subclinical colonization to serious systemic disease, depending both on the serotype and the infected host. While some serotypes can infect and cause systemic disease in a wide range of animal hosts, others are restricted to a specific host. S. enterica serotype Gallinarum has a host range re- stricted to birds and causes a severe systemic disease called fowl typhoid. This disease is characterized by high morbidity and mor- tality, causing major economic losses in poultry production in several parts of the world (2, 3). S. Gallinarum has been eradicated from most developed countries, such as the United States, Austra- lia, and many Western European countries, as a result of im- proved surveillance and slaughter practices; however, it is still a major concern in developing countries (2).  The ability of Salmonella to invade and survive within host cells depends on the delivery of specialized effector proteins into the host cell cytosol by two different type III secretion systems (T3SS), each encoded in distinct genomic islands known as Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2. The SPI-1 T3SS confers the ability to invade nonphagocytic cells and to colonize and breach the gastrointestinal tract of their hosts. On the other hand, SPI-2 T3SS allows Salmonella to survive within eukaryotic cells and spread to internal organs, such as the liver and spleen (4). Both T3SS are present in every S. enterica serotype and correspond to the most critical virulence determinants in Salmonella. Never- theless, S. enterica serotypes differ greatly in terms of pathogenic- ity and host specificity, suggesting that other virulence factors are involved in the adaptation of different serotypes to specific hosts and/or environments.  The type VI secretion system (T6SS) corresponds to a newly  described mechanism for protein translocation that is widespread among Gram-negative bacteria (5) and has been linked to a wide variety of cellular processes, including virulence in several bacte- rial pathogens (6). We have reported that the Salmonella genus comprises five phylogenetically distinct T6SS, each encoded in differentially distributed SPIs, including SPI-6, SPI-19, SPI-20, SPI-21, and SPI-22 (7, 8). S. Gallinarum harbors one T6SS en- coded in SPI-19 (SPI-19 T6SS), which is required to efficiently colonize the avian host (9, 10). The requirement of a fully func- tional SPI-19 T6SS for systemic infection suggested a role for this system in the interaction of Salmonella with cells of the reticuloen- dothelial system (9).  Interaction of S. Gallinarum with the avian immune system has been reported to be critical for the ability of this serotype to colo- nize and cause disease in chicks (11). This interaction occurs in each of the different stages of the progression of avian systemic salmonellosis, from intestinal invasion and systemic infection to the immune clearance/persistence of the pathogen (reviewed in reference 12). Nevertheless, despite the critical aspects of this Sal-  Received 12 November 2012 Returned for modification 16 December 2012 Accepted 19 January 2013  Published ahead of print 28 January 2013  Editor: A.

Gallinarum with macrophages, especially those of avian origin. In this context, even though several SPIs have been shown to contribute to infection in vivo (3, 9, 13), only SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SS have been evaluated in vitro (14, 15).  In the present work, we aimed to further characterize SPI-19 T6SS and the molecular mechanisms behind the phenotypes pre- viously observed in vivo. To accomplish this, we analyzed the ex- pression, production, and secretion profiles of selected T6SS com- ponents under different in vitro growth conditions and analyzed the role played by SPI-19 T6SS in the interaction of S. Gallinarum with murine and avian macrophages. We determined that SPI-19 T6SS components are expressed and produced, but not secreted, under different growth conditions. On the other hand, we deter- mined intracellular production of the cell-puncturing protein VgrG once the bacteria are internalized by macrophages and that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum survival within murine and avian macrophages.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Bacterial strains and growth conditions. The bacterial strains used in the present study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were routinely grown in Luria- Bertani (LB) medium (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl) at 37\u00b0C with aeration. When required, LB medium was supple-  mented with ampicillin (Amp; 100 mg/liter), chloramphenicol (Cam; 20 mg/liter), and kanamycin (Kan; 50 mg/liter). Media were solidified by the addition of agar (15 g/liter). For SPI-1-inducing conditions, bacteria were grown in LB medium supplemented to reach final concentrations of 0.171 M NaCl, 0.3 M NaCl, or 0.2 M sucrose, as described previously (16). LB medium (0.085 M NaCl) was used as a control condition. For SPI-2- inducing conditions, bacteria were grown in a modified N-minimal me- dium [5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 1 mM KH2PO4, 0.1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 5.5, 38 mM glycerol, 0.1% Casamino Acids] ad- justed to pH 5.5 and supplemented to reach a final concentration of 10 -M MgCl2 (17). N-minimal medium, adjusted to pH 7.4 and supple- mented to achieve/reach a final concentration of 10 mM MgCl2, was used as a control.  Standard DNA techniques. Total genomic DNA was obtained from overnight bacterial cultures using the GenElute bacterial genomic DNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufac- turer's instructions. Plasmid DNA was obtained from overnight cul- tures using either the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit or the QIAprep Spin plasmid Maxikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manu- facturer's instructions. PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) as recom- mended. The multicopy plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for complementation studies. DNA samples were rou- tinely analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels (prepared in 1- Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer) and visualized under UV light after ethidium bromide staining.

Mutant strains with deletions of SPI-19 (SG1024 to SG1054), clpV (SG1034), icmF (SG1031), hcp1 (SG1029), hcp2 (SG1043), and vgrG (SG1044) were constructed using the Red-swap method (18). PCR primers 60 bases long were synthesized with 40 nucleotides (nt) on the ends corresponding to the extreme of the de- sired deletion (Table 2) and 20 nt that anneal to the 5= or 3= end of a Cam resistance cassette flanked by the FRT sites (FLP recombinase target se- quence) present in plasmid pCLF2 (GenBank accession number HM047089), which was used as the template DNA. S. Gallinarum strain 287/91 (10), carrying the temperature-sensitive plasmid pKD46, which expresses the Lambda-Red recombinase system, was grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5 at 30\u00b0C in LB medium containing Amp and L-arabinose (10 mM). Bacteria were made electrocompetent by se- quential washes with ice-cold, sterile 10% glycerol and transformed with approximately 500 ng of the corresponding purified PCR product. Trans- formants were selected on LB Cam agar at 37\u00b0C. The presence of each mutation was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers flanking the sites of substitution. Also, each mutant was assayed for Amp sensitivity to  confirm the loss of pKD46. Finally, mutant alleles were transferred to the wild-type background by generalized transduction using P22 phage.  To obtain nonpolar deletions, the Cam resistance gene was removed by transforming each mutant with pCP20, which encodes the FLP recom- binase. Transformants were plated on LB Amp agar at 30\u00b0C. Individual colonies were replica plated on LB agar, LB Amp agar, and LB Cam agar at 37\u00b0C. Transformants that had lost the resistance cassette and pCP20 were selected as those colonies that were unable to grow in the presence of Amp and Cam. The absence of the antibiotic resistance gene cassette was con- firmed for each mutant by PCR analysis.  To obtain the S. Typhimurium 14028s -SPI-1 mutant strain, a P22 phage lysate from -SPI-1::Kan S. Typhimurium SL1344 (NCTC 13347) (19) was used to transduce this mutation to the 14028s background.  Construction of lacZ operon fusions. To construct lacZ operon fu- sions, the method developed by Ellermeier and collaborators was used (20). This method consists of the specific integration of a suicide plasmid (pCE36) that has an FRT site directly upstream of promoterless lacZY into a chromosomal FRT site from a previous Red-swap mutation.

SPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular Survival  April 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1209  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=HM047089 http://iai.asm.org   Gallinarum mutant strains -hcp1::FRT, -hcp2::FRT, -icmF::FRT, -clpV::FRT, and -vgrG::FRT were transformed with the pCP20 plasmid and selected for Amp resistance at 30\u00b0C. These strains were then grown at 30\u00b0C and transformed by electroporation with plasmid pCE36. Transfor- mants were recovered in LB, and dilutions were plated on LB Kan 5-bro- mo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- -D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) agar at 37\u00b0C. Growth at 37\u00b0C allows for the optimal production of FLP recombinase and blocks the replication of the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20, resulting in the stable integration of pCE36 and the loss of pCP20. Fusions were checked by PCR with the appropriate set of primers (Table 2) to ensure integration of pCE36 in the correct chromosomal location and to rule out the presence of multiple plasmid integrants.  Construction of 3-FLAG gene fusions. Epitope tagging of T6SS components was performed by constructing gene fusions between the hcp1, hcp2, and vgrG open reading frames (ORFs) and the 3-FLAG epitope by a modification of the Red-swap method described by Uzzau and collaborators (21) using primers listed in Table 2. The PCR products were amplified from template plasmid pSUB11 (Table 3), and the Red- swap protocol was similar to that described above. Each fusion was checked by PCR and transduced into a clean wild-type background, and then the resistance marker was excised from the chromosome as described above.  Construction of a VgrG-GFP gene fusion. A gene fusion between the green fluorescent protein (GFP) ORF and the ORF of the VgrG T6SS component (termed VgrG-GFP) was constructed by a modification of the Red-swap method described by Gerlach and collaborators (22). The PCR product was amplified using primers listed in Table 2 and plasmid p3174 as the template (Table 3) and included the ORF encoding the GFP re- porter followed by a Kan resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites. Proper integration of the reporter cassette was confirmed by PCR. Positive clones were moved into a wild-type background by generalized transduction using P22, and the resistance marker was excised from the chromosome as described above.  Protein sample preparations. For whole-cell lysates, bacteria were grown overnight in an orbital shaker at 37\u00b0C and subcultured in the ap- propriate growth media. When the culture reached an OD600 of  0.3 to 0.4, the cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 2 min). The supernatant was removed and the pellet was weighted in order to normal- ize samples. Each mg of bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 -l of 1- protein loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromophenol blue, 5%  -mercaptoethanol). Finally, the samples were boiled for 10 min and stored at -20\u00b0C.  For protein secretion analyses, bacterial cells were removed by centrif- ugation (13,000 rpm for 2 min). The culture supernatant was filter steril-  ized and mixed with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final concentration of 10%. The samples were chilled on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The protein pellet was washed twice with ice-cold ace- tone, air dried, and resuspended in 1- protein loading buffer. Finally, the samples were boiled for 5 min and stored at -20\u00b0C.  SDS-PAGE analyses and immunoblotting. Polyacrylamide gels (12%) were prepared and mounted using a Mini-Protean III (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) PAGE system. The samples were run at 100 V (constant) with 1- protein running buffer (1.44% glycine, 0.3% Tris, 0.1% SDS). Transfer from the polyacrylamide gel was performed in a Mini Trans-Blot system (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). A polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane was activated by immersion in 100% methanol for 15 s. The transfer was performed for 65 min at 230 mA in 1- transfer buffer (1.44% glycine, 0.3% Tris, 0.01% SDS, and 20% methanol). The membrane was blocked by incubation in a solution containing 5% nonfat milk in TBS (25 mM Tris, pH 8, 125 mM NaCl) for 90 min at room temperature. Later, the membrane was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 2 h with the M2 anti-FLAG primary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted at 1:10,000 in TBS. For sigma 70 detection, an anti-RNA polymerase sigma 70 antibody (ab12088) was used (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a 1:1,000 dilution in TBS. After five washes with a TBS- 0.05% Tween solution, the membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with a 1:20,000 dilution of the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxi- dase. For immunodetection, the Supersignal West-Pico solution (Pierce, Rockford, IL) was used, exposing the membrane on a CL-Xposure (Pierce, Rockford, IL) photographic film.  --Galactosidase assays. Bacteria were grown overnight in LB broth and then subcultured and grown in 50 ml of the appropriate medium at 37\u00b0C in an orbital shaker. Every 30 min, a 1-ml sample was withdrawn to evaluate bacterial growth (OD600 and CFU/ml), and the  -galactosidase activity was measured as described previously (20). Enzyme activities (in Miller units), normalized for cell density (OD600), were calculated using the following equation: [A420 - (1.75 - A550)] - 1,000/(reaction time - culture volume - OD600), where reaction time was measured in minutes and culture volume in ml. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate in at least three independent experiments.  Bacterial killing assays. Bacterial strains used for the interbacterial competition studies included Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 700323), Shi- gella sonnei (ATCC 25931), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Escherichia coli K-12 (ATCC 25922), Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus saprofiticus (ATCC BAA750). Each of these strains was tested for competition against antibiotic-resistant derivatives of the wild-type and -SPI-19 mutant strains. A Cam-resistant derivative of S. Gallinarum was generated by transformation with plasmid pWRKC (Camr), a derivative of plasmid  TABLE 3 Plasmids used in this study  Plasmid Feature(s) Source or reference  pKD46 bla PBAD gam bet exo pSC101 ori(Ts), Amp r 18  pGEM-T Easy Cloning vector, Ampr Promega pGEM-T::clpV pGEM-T Easy harboring clpV, Ampr This work p3174 Plasmid encoding the gfpmut3 gene 22 pSUB11 3-FLAG gene fusions plasmid, oriR6K, Kanr 21 pCP20 bla cat cI857 -PR flp pSC101 ori(Ts), Cam  r, Ampr 69 pCE36 aph FRT lacZY- this oriR6K, Kan  r 20 pCLF2 Red-swap-redesigned vector, Camr 70 pCLF4 Red-swap-redesigned vector, Kanr 71 pWRKC Derivative of pir-dependent plasmid pNFB9, integrates at Gifsy-1 attachment site attG1, Camr This work pmCherry Constitutive production of the mCherry fluorescent protein, Ampr C.

The chromosomal insertion of pWRKC, flanking the attG1 site, was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers LepA_F and LepA_R (Table 2). For competition assays, each strain was grown overnight in LB media and then collected and washed three times in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 13,000 rpm for 2 min). The cell suspen- sions were normalized to an OD600 of 0.5 and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with either the S. Gallinarum pWRKC (Camr) or the -SPI-19::Kan (Kanr) strain. Fifty -l of the mixture then was spotted onto a prewarmed brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plate and incubated for 1 week at 37\u00b0C. The initial inoculum was serially diluted and plated to determine the initial CFU/ml. After 1 week, cells were recovered from the plates and resus- pended in 1 ml of sterile PBS, and serial dilutions were plated out on BHI agar with or without kanamycin. The amount of prey CFU was deter- mined by subtracting the Kan-resistant CFU counts from the total CFU counts.  Cell culture conditions. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 and the avian macrophage line HD11 were routinely maintained in Dul- becco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose (high glucose is composed of 584 mg/liter L-glutamine, 4,500 mg/liter glucose, 110 mg/ liter sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% inactivated bovine fetal serum (FBS) and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (10,000 nU/ml penicil- lin, 10,000 mg/liter streptomycin, 25 mg/liter amphotericin B) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.  In vitro infection assays. Gentamicin protection assays were per- formed according to Schwan and collaborators (24). RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were seeded in 48-well cell culture plates at a density of  2.5 - 105 cells per well. Bacterial strains were grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in an orbital shaker, and on the day of the assay they were subcul- tured in LB at a 1:30 dilution and grown until they reached an OD600 of  0.6. The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 2 min), washed three times with sterile PBS, and suspended in prewarmed 10% FBS-DMEM to reach a final concentration of 2.5 - 107 CFU/ml. This suspension was serially diluted, and bacteria were quantified by plating on LB agar plates. Macrophages were washed once with sterile PBS, and then 100 -l of the bacterial suspension was added (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 10). Plates were centrifuged at 250 - g for 5 min at room temperature to synchronize infection, and invasion was allowed to pro- ceed for 45 min (time point 0). After this time, the wells were washed 3 times with warm, sterile PBS and the cells were further incubated for 1 h with 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with gentamicin (200 -g/ml) to kill extracellular bacteria. The gentamicin concentration then was lowered to 10 -g/ml for the rest of the experiment. At 2 and 20 h postuptake, different wells were washed 3 times with warm, sterile PBS, and the macrophages were lysed with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) in PBS. Serial dilutions were prepared and plated on LB agar plates to determine viable intracel- lular bacteria. For each assay, viable macrophages were determined by trypan blue exclusion. The intracellular survival of mutant strains was calculated as CFU per 105 viable macrophages.  Viability and cytotoxicity assays. Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity was determined by the CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega, Madison, WI). For each assay, RAW264.7 and HD11 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of  30,000 cells per well. The next day, the cells were infected with the bacterial strains as described for the infection assays. At 20 h postuptake, the supernatant of infected cells was collected and transferred to a new 96-well plate. The cytotoxicity reagent then was added following 30 min of incubation at room temperature protected from light. After incubation, absorbance at 562 nm was mea- sured and the cytotoxicity levels were calculated as a percentage of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release normalized to the spontaneous release from noninfected cells.  For viability and sub-G1 population analyses, RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were seeded at a density of  300,000 cells per well. Sub-G1 analysis allows the detection of hypoploid cells, which are cells with lower DNA content due to apoptotic cell death. Gentamicin protection assays  were performed as described above. At 20 h postuptake, cells from both the supernatant and the monolayer were recovered (to obtain a complete infected cell population), washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of warm 10% FBS-DMEM. For viability analysis, 5 -l of a 1 mg/ml stock of propidium iodide (PI) was added to 500 -l of the cell suspension, and the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. For sub-G1 analysis, a volume of 500 -l of the cell suspension was used. Cells were collected by centrifugation and then treated with 100% methanol for 1 h at -20\u00b0C. After incubation, cells were collected and resuspended in 500 -l of PBS containing RNase at a concentration of 50 -g/ml. After incubation for 1 h, 5 -l of a 1 mg/ml stock of PI was added. The levels of PI incorporation were quantified on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson). Cell size was evaluated by forward-angle light scattering (FSC). PI-negative cells of normal size were considered alive. A total of 5,000 cells per sample were analyzed.  Epifluorescence microscopy. For epifluorescence analysis of VgrG- GFP production upon internalization of S. Gallinarum into RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages, cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips in 6-well plates at a density of  375,000 cells per well. After 20 h, the cells were infected with the bacterial strains as described for the infection assays. At either 45 min or 2 h postuptake, the cells were washed 3 times with warm, sterile PBS and fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution for 20 min at room temperature. After incubation, the coverslips were washed with sterile PBS and mounted in a 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-contain- ing solution from VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA). For Cytochalasin D analysis, cells were incubated for 1 h with 10 -g/ml Cy- tochalasin D before infection and maintained with this concentration throughout the experiment. The samples were stored at 4\u00b0C and visual- ized under an epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescence microscopy analysis was performed using a Spinning Disk Olympus IX 81 fluores- cence microscope, and fluorescence micrographs were captured using a Zeiss Axiocam MRC5 and CellR software.  VgrG translocation assays. The vgrG ORF (SG1044), without the cor- responding stop codon, was amplified by PCR using as the template a preparation of S. Gallinarum 287/91 genomic DNA and cloned into plas- mid pFlagTEM-1 (25, 26). The production of the VgrG-BlaTEM recom- binant protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using anti-3-FLAG monoclonal antibodies. To demonstrate T6SS-de- pendent VgrG translocation, a modified gentamicin protection assay was performed as described previously (8). RAW264.7 and HD11 macro- phages were seeded in 96-well optical plates (black walls and clear, flat bottoms) and infected with each of the bacterial strains expressing the corresponding BlaTEM fusions.  Bacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.3 and induced with 1 mM iso- propyl- -D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) until they reached an OD600 of 0.6. The cells were collected and washed three times with sterile PBS (13,000 rpm for 2 min) and resuspended in the appropriate volume of prewarmed 10% FBS-DMEM. Infections were performed for 45 min at an MOI of 50. Noninternalized bacteria were removed by three washes with sterile PBS, and cells were further incubated with 200 -l 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 200 -g/ml gentamicin. After 1 h of incubation, the cell supernatant was replaced with 100 -l Hanks' buffered salt solution (HBSS; Gibco) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 3 mM probenecid (pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (designated HBSS- HP), and 20 -l freshly prepared CCF4-AM  -lactamase substrate (Live- BLAzer FRET-B/G loading kit; Invitrogen) was added. After 90 min of incubation at room temperature in the dark, the cells were washed five times with HBSS-HP. Fluorescence emission at 450 and 520 nm was mea- sured from the bottom using a plate reader fluorometer (Synergy H1; BioTek) (410-nm excitation wavelength, 10-nm band pass). The translo- cation level was calculated as recommended in the LiveBLAzer FRET-B/G loading kit manual. Briefly, emission values were first corrected by sub- traction of the average background signals recorded for empty wells, and the mean 450-nm/520-nm emission ratio of a triplicate of wells was cal- culated for each sample. The translocation level is expressed as fold in- crease of the mean 450-nm/520-nm emission ratio of each infected sam-  SPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular Survival  April 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1211  http://iai.asm.org   ple relative to the mean emission ratio of uninfected cells. Epifluorescence microscopy analysis was performed using a Spinning Disk Olympus IX 81 fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence micrographs were captured using a Zeiss Axiocam MRC5 and CellR software. Images were imported into the ImageJ software (v.1.44).  Statistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences in the data was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett's posttest (GraphPad Prism v5.0).  RESULTS SPI-19 T6SS components are expressed and produced under in vitro bacterial growth conditions. A recent report from our group provided genetic evidence of SPI-19 T6SS functionality (9). Nevertheless, no study regarding expression, production, and se- cretion of its components has been performed to date. In order to further characterize SPI-19 T6SS in S. Gallinarum, operon fusions to the lacZ reporter were constructed for the conserved core com- ponents hcp1, hcp2, vgrG, clpV, and icmF, and gene fusions to the 3-FLAG epitope were constructed for hcp1, hcp2, and vgrG, as they encode secreted components of T6SS (Fig. 1A and Table 1). Different in vitro growth conditions were tested to study the ex- pression and production of these components, including (i) stan- dard bacterial culture conditions (growth in LB medium at 37\u00b0C with agitation); (ii) SPI-1-inducing growth conditions modified to mimic the conditions found by S. Gallinarum in the intestinal lumen of the chicken (42\u00b0C, high osmolarity, anaerobiosis) (16); and (iii) SPI-2-inducing growth conditions intended to mimic those found by the bacterium inside macrophages (pH 5.5 and 10 -M MgCl2) (17). Even though these media cannot fully replicate the conditions encountered by Salmonella in the host, they have proven useful for identifying underlying regulatory networks in Salmonella (16, 17, 27-29).  Expression analyses revealed a growth phase-dependent regu- lation of each gene analyzed under standard bacterial culture con- ditions, with the hcp1 gene showing the highest expression levels of all the genes tested (Fig. 2A). Gene expression analyses under SPI-1- and SPI-2-inducing conditions showed a significant in- crease only for hcp1 under SPI-2-inducing conditions (data not shown).  Production of the structural/secreted proteins Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG revealed that these three proteins are produced in vitro (Fig. 2B). The Hcp1 protein was detected under all of the condi- tions tested, and relative quantification by gel densitometric anal- ysis of its production revealed that increased levels of the protein were present under SPI-2-inducing conditions (Fig. 2B). In con- trast to expression analyses, the Hcp2 and VgrG proteins were  detected only at the exponential phase of bacterial growth and were barely detected at stationary phase or under SPI-1- and SPI- 2-inducing conditions (Fig. 2B).  Regardless of the differences observed for the expression and production of T6SS core components, it was not possible to detect secretion of either Hcp1, Hcp2, or VgrG to the culture media under the different growth conditions tested (Fig. 2B). These find- ings suggest that additional signals are required for full activation of SPI-19 T6SS in S. Gallinarum.  SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing under different in vitro growth conditions. An increasing number of T6SSs have been linked to interbacterial killing against different Gram-negative bacteria through the delivery of different toxins which target the peptidoglycan of susceptible bacterial species (30-34). A heuristic informatic approach was recently developed for large-scale identification of T6SS antibacterial effectors (35). In Salmonella, this approach identified several toxin/antitoxin modules inside the SPI-6 T6SS gene cluster and one additional module in a genomic region not associated with T6SS loci (tae3 and tai3 genes in Fig. 1B) (35). Interestingly, this module is pres- ent in every Salmonella enterica genome we have analyzed (data not shown), so it is tempting to speculate that even though the SPI-19 T6SS gene cluster does not seem to encode a toxin/anti- toxin module, it could be involved in interbacterial killing through translocation of the toxin encoded in this novel cluster (Fig. 1B).  To test this, an in vitro competition assay was performed using the wild type or a -SPI-19 derivative of S. Gallinarum against a panel of 6 Gram-negative bacteria, including bacteria previously shown to be susceptible to T6SS killing. A Gram-positive strain was included in the assay as a control. As shown in Fig. 3, each prey strain tested grew at similar levels after coculture with either the wild-type or the SPI-19 mutant strain. When the same experiment was performed under different in vitro growth conditions (30, 37, and 42\u00b0C and SPI-1-inducing conditions), no differences were observed (data not shown). These results indicate that S. Gallina- rum SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing under the conditions studied.  VgrG is produced after S. Gallinarum internalization by mu- rine and avian macrophages. The contribution of the SPI-19 T6SS to S. Gallinarum colonization of orally infected chickens suggested a role for this system in the interaction of Salmonella with eukaryotic cells, especially those of the reticuloendothelial system (7). Because expression of T6SS components in other bac- teria is induced within eukaryotic cells (reviewed in reference 36),  FIG 1 Salmonella pathogenicity island 19 and the T6SS-related toxin/antitoxin gene cluster. (A) Schematic representation of the SPI-19 T6SS gene cluster in S. Gallinarum. (B) The putative toxin/antitoxin module identified by Russell and colleagues (35). T6SS core components are shown in gray. Components studied in this work are shown in black.  Blondel et al.  1212 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity  http://iai.asm.org   we analyzed the production of the VgrG protein within macro- phages. To date, most studies regarding the ability of Salmonella to infect and survive within macrophages have been performed in murine macrophages. However, since S. Gallinarum corresponds to an avian-adapted serotype, we chose to use both murine (RAW264.7) and avian (HD11) macrophages and compare the results obtained for each cell line.  A chromosomal gene fusion was constructed between the vgrG ORF and the ORF encoding the GFP reporter using the method  described by Gerlach and colleagues (22). The vgrG gene was cho- sen because (i) it is an essential T6SS component, (ii) production of VgrG was not detected under the conditions we tested, includ- ing those used prior to infection (either LB medium, 37\u00b0C, and an OD600 of 0.6 or DMEM, 5% CO2, and 37\u00b0C) (Fig. 4A), and (iii) it has been shown that VgrG C-terminal fusions can be constructed without affecting the functionality of the corresponding T6SS (37).  To analyze the production of the VgrG-GFP fusion protein after Salmonella internalization by macrophages, gentamicin pro- tection assays were performed. RAW264.7 and HD11 cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips and infected with an S. Galli- narum strain harboring the VgrG-GFP fusion in its chromosome. This strain also carries the pmCherry plasmid, encoding the red fluorescent protein mCherry under the control of a constitutive promoter, to allow bacterial visualization. After 45 min of infec- tion, cells were washed and cell culture media added with a final concentration of 100 -g/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacte- ria. Two hours postuptake, the cells were washed, fixed, and mounted for their analysis by epifluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP fusion was detected in bacteria expressing cytosolic mCherry in both murine and avian macrophages at 2 h postuptake.  To determine whether production of VgrG was induced by the initial cell contact between Salmonella and the macrophages or occurred after bacterial internalization, cells were pretreated with Cytochalasin D to inhibit Salmonella uptake. As shown in Fig. 4B and C, pretreatment with Cytochalasin D prevented VgrG pro- duction in both murine and avian macrophages infected with S. Gallinarum. Interestingly, infections performed with the HD11 macrophage cell line revealed that S. Gallinarum was detected in granule/vacuolar structures after internalization. This was not seen in infected murine macrophages (Fig. 4C). Further studies will be needed to fully characterize the intracellular fate of S. Gal- linarum in HD11 macrophages compared to results from previ- ous studies performed in murine macrophages. Altogether, our results indicate that production of VgrG is induced once S. Galli- narum is internalized by macrophages of either murine or avian origin.  SPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum intracellular sur- vival within murine and avian macrophages. Intracellular pro- duction of VgrG in RAW264.7 and HD11 cells suggested that SPI-19 T6SS is involved in the interaction of Salmonella with mac- rophages. To test this, a set of defined S. Gallinarum mutants was constructed and tested in intracellular survival assays in both mu- rine and avian macrophages. Gentamicin protection assays were performed, infecting each macrophage cell line with either the wild-type, -SPI-19, or -clpV mutant strain. As controls, -ssaG and -aroA mutant strains were also included, as both genes en- code proteins required for Salmonella survival within macro- phages. The ssaG gene encodes an essential SPI-2 T3SS structural component (38), while aroA corresponds to an auxotrophic mu- tant for aromatic amino acids with impaired ability to survive and grow within macrophages (39).  At 2 and 20 h postuptake, intracellular bacteria were recovered and bacterial loads were determined and expressed as CFU per 105  macrophages. As shown in Fig. 5, none of the T6SS mutants showed a significant intracellular survival defect compared to the wild-type strain at 2 h postuptake. However, at 20 h postuptake, each T6SS mutant strain showed a statistically significant defect in  FIG 2 Expression, production, and secretion analysis of selected SPI-19 T6SS components under different in vitro conditions.

Detection of the RNA polymerase by an --sigma 70 antibody was used as a control to analyze protein secretion in the cell culture supernatants. Under standard bacterial growth conditions (LB), samples were acquired at both exponential (Ex; OD600 of 0.3) and stationary (St; OD600 of 1.8) phases of growth.

Bacterial loads per macrophage at 20 h postuptake were similar to those observed for the ssaG and aroA mutant strains.  To directly link the phenotype observed for T6SS mutant strains to T6SS functionality, the -clpV mutant was transformed with a plasmid harboring a wild-type copy of the clpV gene and gentamicin protection assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 6, introduction of the clpV gene in trans restored the ability of the S. Gallinarum -clpV strain to survive within RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages.  To determine if SPI-19 T6SS contributes to cytotoxicity and host cell death, as described for other T6SS (40-42), macrophages were infected with either the wild-type strain or the -SPI-19 mu- tant. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by release of lactate dehydroge- nase (LDH) to the culture media, and cell viability was assayed by propidium iodide (PI) incorporation and analysis of the sub-G1 population by flow cytometry. The sub-G1 population is com- monly used as an index of apoptotic cell death (43). As shown in Fig. 7, no differences in cytotoxicity, viability, and cell death were observed between the wild-type and mutant strains in either mu- rine or avian macrophages. Altogether, these results clearly indi- cate that SPI-19 and the T6SS encoded therein contribute to S. Gallinarum intracellular survival in both murine and avian mac- rophages, and that this T6SS does not contribute to Salmonella- induced cytotoxicity and host cell death of infected macrophages.  Finally, to assess if the VgrG protein is translocated into the cytosol of infected macrophages, a FRET-based fluorescent assay was performed using the CCF4/AM substrate. This method has been used recently to monitor VgrG translocation in Vibrio chol- erae (37). A reporter gene fusion was constructed by cloning the vgrG ORF into plasmid pFlagTEM-1, which allows the production of  -lactamase fusion proteins under the control of an IPTG- inducible promoter (25). VgrG-BlaTEM translocation into the host cytosol allows processing of the FRET fluorescent sub- strate CCF4/AM. RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were in-  fected with S. Gallinarum strains harboring plasmids encoding either VgrG-BlaTEM or SipA-BlaTEM fusion proteins. The SipA- BlaTEM fusion was used as a positive control, as it corresponds to a known SPI-1 T3SS translocated effector protein (26). As a con- trol, infection experiments were also performed using the S. Ty- phimurium 14028s strain. Translocation was assessed by both fluorometric plate reader quantification and epifluorescence mi- croscopy. As expected, translocation of SipA was observed for S. Typhimurium in both macrophages by fluorometric quantifica- tion (see File S1 in the supplemental material). However, in the case of S. Gallinarum, we could not detect translocation of SipA or VgrG fusion proteins into either macrophage cell line (see File S1). In spite of this, epifluorescence microscopy analysis showed that a very small number of cells per field presented substrate processing in macrophages infected with the S. Gallinarum strains harboring pSipA/FT or pVgrG/FT (see File S1).  DISCUSSION  The recent discovery of at least 5 different T6SSs in Salmonella has generated many questions of whether these systems contribute to Salmonella host and environmental adaptation. We have previ- ously shown that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to efficient colonization of chicks infected with S. Gallinarum, suggesting a role for this T6SS in the interaction of Salmonella with cells of the reticuloen- dothelial system (7). In this study, we characterized SPI-19 T6SS by analyzing the expression, production, and translocation of se- lected components/effectors and by defining its role in the inter- action of S. Gallinarum with murine and avian macrophages.  Expression analysis of five SPI-19 T6SS core components re- vealed a growth phase-dependent regulation, with an increase in their expression when the bacteria reached the onset of stationary phase (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, analysis of the production of the structural/secreted proteins Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG showed an inverse relationship regarding growth phase regulation, with in- creased protein levels detected at exponential phase (Fig. 2B). This  FIG 3 SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing. Survival of prey strains listed below the x axis was determined by measuring the corresponding CFU after 1 week of exposure to either the wild type or a -SPI-19 mutant of S. Gallinarum. Data represent CFU from three independent experiments. Bars represent mean values, and error bars denote standard deviations. No statistically significant differences between the mutant and the wild type were determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's posttest.  Blondel et al.  1214 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity  http://iai.asm.org   discrepancy between gene expression and protein production sug- gests that these components are under posttranscriptional regula- tory mechanisms, as described for other T6SS (44, 45). Growth phase-dependent expression and production of T6SS compo- nents was not unexpected. Core components of the T6SSs of Yer- sinia pestis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to be regulated by the bacterial phase of growth (46, 47), and T6SSs of  Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aerugi- nosa have been linked to quorum-sensing regulatory mechanisms (48-50).  Analysis of culture supernatants failed to demonstrate secre- tion of either Hcp1, Hcp2, or VgrG, even under the growth con- ditions that favored their production (Fig. 2B). In this context, it is possible that secretion of the SPI-19 T6SS is regulated by a post-  FIG 4 Intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP fusion protein.

In agreement with this notion, it has been reported that T6SS activation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires a serine-threonine kinase and a phosphatase that regulate the phosphorylation status of a forkhead-associated (FHA) inner membrane protein (51). Even though the SPI-19 T6SS locus does not encode putative serine-threonine kinase and a phosphatase, it  does encode a putative FHA domain-containing protein (SG1038) (7). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that activation of the SPI-19 T6SS depends on a similar posttranslational regula- tory mechanism.  In order to dissect the putative roles of the SPI-19 T6SS, we tested its contribution to interaction with bacterial cells and mac- rophages. Interbacterial killing assays failed to demonstrate anti-  FIG 5 Contribution of SPI-19 T6SS to Salmonella intracellular survival.

Blondel et al.  1216 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity  http://iai.asm.org   bacterial activity of SPI-19 T6SS under different growth condi- tions (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, it is important to mention that this assay is not comprehensive, as other unidentified Gram-negative bacteria can be the target of SPI-19 T6SS, and other inducing signals might be important for activating SPI-19 T6SS-dependent killing. Furthermore, the presence of a toxin/antitoxin module (Fig. 1B) suggests that the SPI-19 T6SS could indeed be involved in interbacterial killing.  Cell culture-based assays revealed that the VgrG protein was produced after Salmonella internalization by cultured murine and avian macrophages (Fig. 4). Preferential production of VgrG upon phagocytosis was not unexpected, because expression of T6SS components within macrophages has been described for other T6SS, including those encoded in the tss5 locus of Burkhold- eria pseudomallei, the FPI island of Francisella tularensis, the T6SS1 locus of Burkholderia mallei, and the vas cluster of Vibrio cholerae, all of which are upregulated upon phagocytosis (re- viewed in reference 36).  When intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP fusion pro- tein was determined, GFP fluorescence was observed in the cyto- plasm of infected macrophages, suggesting that the VgrG protein could be translocated into the host cell cytosol. To test this, a VgrG-BlaTEM fusion was constructed, and CCF4/AM processing was evaluated in murine and avian macrophages. Even though visual inspection through epifluorescence microscopy revealed translocation in a small percentage of the total cell population, fluorometric plate reader quantification did not determine a sig- nificant increase in the fluorescent substrate processing. Taking into account that S. Gallinarum is internalized significantly less efficiently by macrophages than S. Typhimurium, and that trans- location of the positive-control SipA was observed by epifluores- cence microscopy but not detected by fluorescence quantification in S. Gallinarum, it is plausible to think that VgrG is indeed trans-  located under these conditions. Nevertheless, further experiments will be needed to clarify this issue, including the construction of different reporter fusions attaching to the VgrG protein.  Unexpectedly, fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that the VgrG-GFP protein was detected throughout the bacterial cell and not in punctate foci in the bacterial membrane, as seen for other T6SS structural components (52). One possible explanation is that the GFP reporter affects the normal function of the VgrG protein, including its subcellular localization. To test this hypoth- esis, we performed gentamicin protection assays in murine and avian macrophages infected with either the wild-type or VgrG- GFP strain. Results from these assays suggest that the fusion pro- tein is partially impaired in T6SS function (see File S2 in the sup- plemental material).  The SPI-19 T6SS expression data are reminiscent of what has been described for the Salmonella SPI-2 T3SS. The genes encoding structural components of the SPI-2 T3SS are upregulated upon phagocytosis (53, 54), including the ssaG gene, which encodes a translocon component of the needle complex. Expression of the ssaG gene responds to the DNA supercoiling status of the bacterial cell chromosome, as it adapts to the intracellular environment. This activation depends on the direct binding of the Fis protein to the ssaG promoter region (55). Several Fis-regulated genes show a growth phase-dependent gene expression (56, 57) due to en- hanced levels of the Fis protein at exponential phase. Therefore, the increased levels of Hcp2 and VgrG proteins in the exponential phase of growth could be due to increased levels of Fis. In support of this notion, we have identified the presence of several Fis bind- ing sites in the promoter regions of hcp2 and vgrG (see File S3 in the supplemental material). Further work will be needed to clarify this hypothesis and to identify the global regulators that seem to be regulating the expression, production, and function of SPI-19  FIG 7 SPI-19 T6SS does not contribute to Salmonella-induced cell death of infected macrophages. RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were infected with either the wild-type or -SPI-19 mutant strain, and gentamicin protection assays were performed.

SPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular Survival  April 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1217  http://iai.asm.org   T6SS in Salmonella under in vitro growth and cell culture condi- tions.  Intracellular production of VgrG indicated a possible role of the SPI-19 T6SS in the interaction of S. Gallinarum with macro- phages. Gentamicin protection assays revealed that SPI-9 T6SS contributes to Salmonella intracellular survival in both murine and avian macrophages. Upon phagocytosis, Salmonella is en- gulfed in a compartment known as the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV), and through the orchestrated action of SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SS-secreted effector proteins, the bacterium ensures its survival by avoiding phagosome maturation (58). SCV biogenesis is usually divided in early (-30 min), intermediate (30 min to 5 h), and late stages (-5 h), with a defined set of T3SS effectors involved in each stage (59, 60). By altering phagosome biogenesis, Salmonella is able to reside in mature SCVs that localize in a peri- nuclear region associated with the Golgi network late after infec- tion (60, 61).  In S. Gallinarum, the SPI-2 T3SS has been shown to be impor- tant for the ability of the bacteria to survive within murine and avian macrophages from 1 h postuptake (14, 15). In agreement with this, we observed that the SPI-2 T3SS -ssaG mutant strain showed a significant defect on intracellular survival at 2 h postuptake. In contrast, the -SPI-19 and -clpV mutants showed a significant defect only at 20 h postuptake. These observations sug- gest that either (i) the T3SS and T6SS contribute to Salmonella survival by modulating different stages of SCV biogenesis, or (ii) the T6SS promotes replication of Salmonella once it has escaped from the phagolysosomal fate, as has been shown for other viru- lence-related loci, including the PhoP/Q regulon (62). Further experiments regarding the kinetics of phagolysosomal fusion and replication rates of T6SS mutant strains will be needed to clarify these issues.  Despite the role of SPI-19 in intracellular survival, there was no significant impact on host cell death and cytotoxicity of infected macrophages in vitro, as seen for other T6SSs that are involved in the interaction of the bacteria with cells of the immune system (6). Notwithstanding this, it is plausible to think that the SPI-19 T6SS could influence other processes triggered after infection of mac- rophages, including the production and secretion of proinflam- matory cytokines and chemokines. In this context, it has been shown that immune responses generated by infection with S. Gal- linarum are critical for the virulence and pathogenicity of this serotype both in vitro and in vivo (11, 12, 63, 64). Therefore, con- tribution of the SPI-19 T6SS to in vivo colonization of infected chicks is mediated by these processes in addition to intracellular survival within macrophages. Future work will be needed to de- termine these issues.  In agreement with our findings, other authors have pointed out a role for T6SSs in the interaction of Salmonella with host cells. Libby and colleagues (65) identified several genes linked to the SPI-6 T6SS of S. Typhi which are required for systemic infection in a humanized mouse model. In addition, Wang and colleagues (66) recently reported that a mutant in an essential SPI-6 T6SS core component enhanced the ability of S. Typhi to invade epithe- lial cells and reduced Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity toward these cells. More recently, Liu and colleagues (67) have shown that lack of SPI-6 T6SS in S. Typhimurium leads to reduced Salmonella survival and proliferation within infected murine macrophages and a defect in mice colonization. Finally, Mulder and colleagues (68) reported that several SPI-6 T6SS core components and SPI-6  T6SS-associated gene clusters contribute to S. Typhimurium in- tracellular survival within murine macrophages and systemic dis- semination in mice.  Since the evidence described above shows that both SPI-6 and SPI-19 T6SSs are involved in the ability of Salmonella to survive within macrophages, it is tempting to speculate that despite hav- ing distinct phylogenetic origins, these two T6SSs are functionally redundant.  In the context of Salmonella evolution, the functional implica- tions of this potential redundancy are intriguing. Comparative genomic analysis of T6SSs in Salmonella have suggested that a common ancestor of SPI-19-containing serotypes harbored both SPI-6 and SPI-19 T6SSs in their genomes. During evolution, some serotypes maintained both T6SSs (e.g., Dublin and Weltevreden), others have lost SPI-6 T6SS while maintaining SPI-19 T6SS (e.g., Gallinarum and Agona), and still others lost both T6SS loci (e.g., Enteritidis) (7). Therefore, it would be of interest to determine if these systems are indeed redundant or if there are subtle differ- ences in their function that could explain why some Salmonella serotypes retained one of these systems over the other, and if they differentially contribute to the adaptation of Salmonella serotypes to different hosts and environments.  In conclusion, in this work we have demonstrated that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to Salmonella intracellular survival and that the VgrG protein is preferentially produced once the bacteria have been internalized by the cells. Altogether, our work expands the known set of virulence factors employed by Salmonella to subvert the immune system of its hosts.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  We are indebted to R.

Standard DNA techniques.  Mutant constructions and analyses.  Construction of lacZ operon fusions.  Construction of 3\u00d7FLAG gene fusions.  Construction of a VgrG-GFP gene fusion.  Protein sample preparations.  SDS-PAGE analyses and immunoblotting.  -Galactosidase assays.  Bacterial killing assays.  Cell culture conditions.  In vitro infection assays.  Viability and cytotoxicity assays.  Epifluorescence microscopy.  VgrG translocation assays.  Statistical analysis.   RESULTS  SPI-19 T6SS components are expressed and produced under in vitro bacterial growth conditions.  SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing under different in vitro growth conditions.  VgrG is produced after S. Gallinarum internalization by murine and avian macrophages.  SPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum intracellular survival within murine and avian macrophages.   DISCUSSION  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  REFERENCES",
