Stevioside from Stevia rebaudiana has been reported to exert antihyperglycemic effects in both rat and human subjects. There have been few studies on these effects in vitro. In this paper, radioactive glucose uptake assay was implemented in order to assess improvements in insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 cells by elevation of glucose uptake following treatment with stevioside. Oil Red- O staining and MTT assay were utilized to confirm adipocyte differentiation and cell viability, respectively. Findings from this research showed a significant increase in absorbance values in mature adipocytes following Oil Red-O staining, confirming the differentiation process. Stevioside was noncytotoxic to 3T3-L1 cells as cell viability was reduced by a maximum of 17%, making it impossible to determine its IC  50 . Stevioside increased glucose uptake activities by 2.1 times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001) in normal conditions  and up to 4.4 times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001) in insulin-resistant states. At times, this increase was higher than that seen in positive control group treated with rosiglitazone maleate, an antidiabetic agent. Expressions of pY20 and p-IRS1 which were measured via Western blot were improved by stevioside treatment. In conclusion, stevioside has direct effects on 3T3-L1 insulin sensitivity via increase in glucose uptake and enhanced expression of proteins involved in insulin-signalling pathway.  1. Introduction  Epidemic-level emergence of many noncommunicable dis- eases as a result of modern lifestyle and dietary habits is worrying. Insulin resistance has commonly been linked to metabolic syndromes resulting in type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as obesity. In fact, it is purported to underlie the progression of type 2 diabetes [1] and in cases of burn trauma, hyperlipidaemia and cancer cachexia [2]. It is important to note that insulin resistance occurs in an impaired insulin- signalling pathway, indicative of patients with type 2 dia- betes. In normal individuals with fully functioning insulin- signalling activities, insulin will be secreted once blood glucose levels are increased following intake of food, and will subsequently bind to its receptor.This binding actionwill lead to several stages of signalling and phosphorylation cascades, resulting in migration of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) from cytoplasm to cellular membrane to take up extracellular  glucose. However, in a state of insulin resistance, these signalling activities and cascades are interrupted, blocking said migration of GLUT4, if not disrupting the protein's expression altogether [3]. Hence, a better understanding of these mechanisms will possibly lead to breakthroughs in unravelling the secrets of both insulin resistance and diabetes.  As is often the case, traditional communities use local herbs in their folk and traditional medicines for treating hyperglycaemia and diabetes. Among these is Stevia rebau- diana Bertoni, a perennial herb commonly grown in tropical and subtropical regions, specifically in South America and Asia. In recent years, Malaysians too have taken a particular interest in this herb as it has been promoted as a sweetening alternative to sucrose, beneficial specifically for those with obesity and diabetes. Stevia rebaudiana has little to no caloric value despite its sweetening abilities, thus will not jeopardise patients' blood glucose levels, while fulfilling their cravings for sweet food and drinks [4]. Stevia rebaudiana is sweet    2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine  due to its constituents of steviol glycosides including stevio- side, rebaudioside A and rebaudioside C [5]. Furthermore, previous reports showed this plant has antioxidant [6] and antihyperglycaemic [7] properties, increasing its potential for use in adjuvant management of diabetes mellitus and asso- ciated conditions.There has been little investigation into such assertions which has prompted this study to evaluate how stevioside can affect insulin sensitivity, particularly through observation of glucose uptake, and expression of proteins involved in insulin-signalling pathway at a cellular level through use of 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  2. Methods  2.1. Materials. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were commercially acquired from ATCC (American Type Culture Collections, USA). Chemicals, including stevioside, cell supplements, and media, weremostly purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Ger- many) and Lonza (USA). UltimaGold LLT scintillation cock- tail and 2-deoxy-[1-3H]-glucose were commercially obtained from Perkin Elmer (USA). The antidiabetic drug rosiglita- zonemaleate (AVANDIA)was bought from a local drugstore. \ud835\udefd-Actin, p-IRS1, and pY20 primary antibodies, and donkey anti-goat and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz (USA).  2.2. Cell Culture and Differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM). Cells were later differentiated with supplements of insulin, dexamethasone (DMX), and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl- xanthine (IBMX) following the procedures described by Ahn et al. [8] and Ismail et al. [9]. In order to induce insulin resistance, cells were treated with tumour necrosis factor-\ud835\udefc (TNF-\ud835\udefc) at 1.0 ng/mL for 4 days prior to treatment.  2.3. Oil Red-O Staining. 3T3-L1 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being fixed with a solution of 10% formaldehyde in PBS. After overnight incubation, the solution was discarded and Oil Red-O dye was introduced to cells for 10 minutes at room temperature. Subsequently, excess dye was washed with de-ionised water. The stain was later eluted out with 100% isopropanol and measured spectrophotomerically at 520 nm.  2.4. Cell Viability Test. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured in 96-well plates and were pretreated with stevioside (25- 300 \ud835\udf07M) for 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours. After pretreatment, the cells received 5mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and were further incu- bated for 4 hours. The purple formazan crystals were then dissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before their absorbance values were read on a microplate reader at 590 nm.  2.5. Glucose Uptake Assay. Glucose uptake levels by differ- entiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were analysed using a method previously described by Adam et al. [10], with minor modifi- cations. Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were differentiated on 12- well plates. For insulin-resistance studies, cells were initially  induced to insulin resistance with TNF-\ud835\udefc treatment, as mentioned earlier. Cells were serum-starved for 2 hours. Next, they were washed with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer and preincubated with a range of stevioside concentrations (30-150\ud835\udf07M and 30-120 \ud835\udf07M) for half an hour, with or without insulin addition, with rosiglitazone as a positive control. 2-Deoxy-[1-3H]-glucose (1 \ud835\udf07Ci/mL) was then added to each well to initiate glucose uptake, and incubated for a further hour. Cells were then washed with ice-cold KRB buffer and solubilised by 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). Finally, samples were collected and mixed with 15mL of Ultima Gold LLT scintillation cocktail before being measured in a liquid scintillation counter.  2.6. Western Blotting. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differ- entiated in 6-well plates. Cells were given TNF-\ud835\udefc to induce insulin resistance, as described earlier, prior to treatmentwith stevioside. Treatments of stevioside and rosiglitazonemaleate were given, in 60 and 90\ud835\udf07M concentrations, for 24 hours. Cells were stimulated with insulin for 5 minutes prior to harvesting. From the preparation of cell lysates and loading of samples to Western blot analysis, procedures described by Ismail et al. [9] were followed, with minor modifications.  2.7. Statistical Analysis. Data were presented as mean \u00b1 standard error mean (SEM) for a given number of tests. The results were processed statistically by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett's post-hoc tests, using the Sigma Plot version 12 software. Statistically different means were recognised at \ud835\udc5d < 0.05.  3. Results  3.1. Oil Red-O Staining. Effects of the supplements (insulin, DMX, and IBMX) on adipocyte differentiation are presented in Figure 1. In order to proceed with further experiments, adipocyte differentiation was confirmed by conducting the Oil Red-O staining procedure. Lipid stain from fully differen- tiated adipocytes was eluted out and measured quantitatively in a spectrophotometer, where the readings were found to be significantly increased when compared to control group.  3.2. MTT Cytotoxicity Test. Cells were previously differenti- ated to mature adipocytes before treatment with stevioside (25-300 \ud835\udf07M) for 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability was determined from absorbance readings at 590 nm, corre- sponding to formazan crystals formed by living cells (Figure 2). There were no significant differences in cell viabilities in any of the stevioside treatment groups, at any treatment period, with the exception of those treated for a period of 72 hours. Viability of cells treated with 250 \ud835\udf07M of stevioside for 72 hours was reduced by 17% at most. No half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC  50 ) was found, as cell viability did  not fall lower than the 80% benchmark.  3.3. Glucose Uptake Assay  3.3.1. Optimum Insulin Concentration.

From Figure 3(a), it can be observed that starting from 100 nM of insulin, there was a highly significant increase in glucose uptake, with maximum uptake at 125 nM. There was no significant difference between these two groups. Therefore, 100 nM insulin was selected as the optimum concentration to be used for further experiments.  A separate glucose uptake assay was conducted to find the optimum TNF-\ud835\udefc concentration for inducing an insulin- resistant state in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. TNF-\ud835\udefc reduced glucose uptake in the cells up to a concentration of 1.0 ng/mL, beyond which there was an increase in glucose uptake at 2.5 ng/mL (Figure 3(b)). Since glucose uptake went down furthest at 1.0 ng/mL, this concentration was selected as the opti- mum TNF-\ud835\udefc concentration to induce insulin resistance in cells.  3.3.2. Glucose Uptake in Normal 3T3-L1 Adipocytes. Glu- cose uptake assay was next conducted on normal, non- insulin-resistant adipocytes to study effects of stevioside. Glucose uptake by adipocytes was increased by treatment with stevioside or with rosiglitazone (Figure 4). Stevioside (30 \ud835\udf07M) elicited significant increase in glucose uptake, in both insulin-stimulated and non-insulin-stimulated groups. However, glucose uptakewas higher in the insulin-stimulated group, by 2.1 times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001) compared to control.This was better than what was observed in cells that were treated with rosiglitazone maleate, where glucose uptake in presence of insulin was increased by 1.7 times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001) at a far higher concentration of 120\ud835\udf07M.  3.3.3. Glucose Uptake in TNF-\ud835\udefc Induced Adipocytes. 3T3- L1 cells were induced to insulin resistance using TNF-\ud835\udefc, to test whether stevioside could exert similar effects on these cells as on normal adipocytes in terms of enhancing glucose uptake. Cells were pretreated with TNF-\ud835\udefc prior to stevio- side treatment and their glucose uptake was measured. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, stevioside was still able to stim- ulate glucose uptake although at a higher concentration of 90 \ud835\udf07M compared to the previous 30 \ud835\udf07M observed in normal adipocytes (Figure 5). Maximum increase in glucose uptake was observed in rosiglitazone-treated group (90\ud835\udf07M)without insulin stimulation, with an elevation of up to 4.6 times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001) when compared to control. This was followed by treatment with stevioside (90\ud835\udf07M) with insulin stimulation, which elevated glucose uptake by 4.4-times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001).  3.3.4. Western Blotting. In this study, expressions of two proteins (p-IRS1 and pY20) that are essential to the insulin- signalling pathway were measured by Western blotting tech- nique. Both proteins were poorly expressed or not expressed at all in the insulin-resistant control group (Figure 6). Treat- ment with stevioside led to expression of both proteins while treatmentwith rosiglitazone elicited an increase in expression of pY20, though the effects of both treatments were hardly distinguishable from those observed in normal, non-insulin- resistant cells.  4. Discussion  Aim of this study was to investigate effects of stevioside on insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1 cells. Oil Red-O is a com- mon lipid stain used to colour lipid droplets in vitro, for quantification and for microscopic and imaging purposes. This specific staining method was used here to determine the degree to which adipocyte differentiation process (also called adipogenesis) had progressed since droplets secreted by adipocytes upon full differentiation to mature adipocytes will be stained (also referred to as lipid positive) [11]. Microscopic observation also revealed that lipid droplets were present in cytoplasm of fully differentiated adipocytes in abundance, compared to their absence in preadipocytes before the differentiation process.  As confirmation, there was a significant increase in absorbance values of eluted Oil Red-O stains from mature differentiated adipocytes (Figure 1). The stains from mature adipocytes were increased by 2.4 times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.05) when compared to control, which was the stain from empty wells; and were 4.2 times (\ud835\udc5d < 0.001) higher when compared to preadipocytes. This showed that the insulin-DMX-IBMX supplements combination was successful at hormonally trig- gering adipocyte differentiation in cells, most possibly via activation of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor \ud835\udefe (PPAR\ud835\udefe) andCCAAT/enhancer binding protein\ud835\udefc (C/EBP\ud835\udefc), as reported by Jin et al. [12].  Fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were then sub- jected to MTT assay to determine effect of stevioside on cell morphology and viability. 3T3-L1 Cells were treated with stevioside at concentrations ranging from 25 to 300\ud835\udf07M, for several different treatment periods: 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours.    4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine  Stevioside concentration (\ud835\udf07M) 0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300  C el  l v ia  bi lit  y  (%  )  120  100  80  60  40  20  0  (a)  Stevioside concentration (\ud835\udf07M) 0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300  C el  l v ia  bi lit  y  (%  )  120  100  80  60  40  20  0  (b)  Stevioside concentration (\ud835\udf07M) 0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300  C el  l v ia  bi lit  y  (%  )  120  100  80  60  40  20  0  (c)  \u2217 \u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217\u2217  Stevioside concentration (\ud835\udf07M) 0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300  \u2217\u2217\u2217 C  el l v  ia bi  lit y   (% )  120  100  80  60  40  20  0  (d)  Figure 2: Viability of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with stevioside for (a) 14 hours, (b) 24 hours, (c) 48 hours, and (d) 72 hours.

Treatment for 14 hours was done as it was the stipulated doubling time for 3T3-L1 adipocytes [13]. Viability of cells was not markedly altered by exposure to stevioside except at concentrations greater than 100\ud835\udf07M following incubation for 72 hours. Even then cell viability was still higher than 80% with a maximum decrease of only 17%. Thus, median inhibitory concentration (IC  50 ) could not be estimated from  this study. Some slight, nonsignificant increase in cell viability of 3T3-L1 adipocytes was observed as has been previously reported [11, 14, 15]. It can be surmised that stevioside did not exert cytotoxicity on 3T3-L1 adipocytes.  To test effects of stevioside on insulin-sensitivity of 3T3- L1 adipocytes, its effects on glucose uptake by the adipocytes was determined. Radioactively labelled glucose uptake assays  were conducted with use of antidiabetic agent, rosiglitazone as a positive control, as previously reported [10].  Prior to subjecting 3T3-L1 adipocytes to stevioside, response of the cells to insulin and toTNF-\ud835\udefcwere determined in separate assays to estimate optimum concentrations.These studies showed that glucose uptakewas elevatedwith increase in insulin concentration in concentration-dependentmanner reaching a plateau at 100 nM of insulin. This insulin con- centration was taken as the optimum concentration for use in further glucose uptake assays using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as previously reported [16].  TNF-\ud835\udefc has been implicated in the progression of insulin resistance; it disrupts phosphorylation of several pro- teins involved in insulin-signalling pathway, including IRS1,    6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine  Treatment concentration (\ud835\udf07M)  \u2217  600  500  400  300  200  100  0 Control 0 30 60 90 120  RM + insulin Svs + insulin 100nM insulin  \u2217\u2217\u2217 2  -d eo  xy -[ 1  -3 H  ]- gl  uc os  e up  ta ke  re la  tiv e   to  c  on tr  ol  (%  )  (a)  \u2217\u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217 \u2217  RM Svs  Treatment concentration (\ud835\udf07M)  600  500  400  300  200  100  0 Control 0 30 60 90 120  2 -d  eo xy  -[ 1  -3 H  ]- gl  uc os  e up  ta ke  re la  tiv e   to  c  on tr  ol  (%  )  (b)  \u2217\u2217\u2217  \u2217  \u2217  RM + insulin RM 100nM insulin  Treatment concentration (\ud835\udf07M)  600  500  400  300  200  100  0 Control 0 30 60 90 120  2 -d  eo xy  -[ 1  -3 H  ]- gl  uc os  e up  ta ke  re la  tiv e   to  c  on tr  ol  (%  )  (c)  \u2217\u2217\u2217  \u2217\u2217  Stevioside concentration (\ud835\udf07M)  Svs + insulin Svs 100nM insulin  600  500  400  300  200  100  0 Control 0 30 60 90 120  2 -d  eo xy  -[ 1  -3 H  ]- gl  uc os  e up  ta ke  re la  tiv e   to  c  on tr  ol  (%  )  (d)  Figure 5: Effect of stevioside and rosiglitazone maleate on glucose uptake in TNF-\ud835\udefc induced insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

TNF-\ud835\udefc is also implicated in a number of catabolic states linked to insulin resistance such as sepsis and cancer even though its exact mechanism of actions remains unclear [18].  TNF-\ud835\udefc caused a maximal decrease in glucose uptake at 1 ng/mL, beyond which glucose uptake was increased when compared to control. This observation contradicted initial expectation of a concentration-dependent decrease in glucose uptake by TNF-\ud835\udefc, as was previously reported [19].  Normally differentiated, mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes which were not exposed to TNF-\ud835\udefc were used to evaluate effect of stevioside on insulin sensitivity in normal, non-insulin- resistant state to ascertain effects of its usage in health. Our data showed that stevioside was better than the positive  control, rosiglitazone, at increasing glucose uptake in normal adipocytes. Glucose uptake was maximally increased by 30 \ud835\udf07Mof stevioside, both in presence or in absence of insulin stimulation, surpassing that of rosiglitazone at 120 \ud835\udf07M.  In TNF-\ud835\udefc induced insulin resistance, glucose uptake was maximally increased by rosiglitazone or insulin at 90 \ud835\udf07M either in presence or absence of insulin. Since effect of rosig- litazone on glucose uptake was not different from that of stevioside, it may be concluded that both treaments were equally effective at enhancing glucose uptake in insulin- resistant cells.  There appeared to be interaction between rosiglitazone and insulin in the insulin-resistant state with regards to glu- cose-uptake, which was lower in presence of 100 nM insulin compared to in its absence.

A similar trend of enhanced glucose uptake by stevioside and rosiglitazone was observed in normal adipocytes. It may be assumed that stevioside's interaction with insulin was unaffected by insulin resistance unlike that of rosiglitazone except higher concentration of stevioside was needed to elicit significant increase in glucose uptake during insulin-resistant state compared to normal state. The different behaviour of insulin-stimulated versus non-insulin stimulated cells to rosiglitazone has important bearing in hyperinsulinaemic states which often occur in insulin resistance, though not always. It is possible that stevioside is suitable for use in hyperinsulinaemic states, which, besides diabetes, often occur in certain cancers [20].  This study investigated two proteins\u2014the phosphory- lated insulin receptor substrate 1 (p-IRS1), and phospho- rylated tyrosine (pY20) that act upstream of the insulin- signalling pathway. Our data showed both proteins were poorly expressed or not expressed at all in insulin-resistant control group, which imply disruptions in the insulin- signalling pathway as previously reported by Solomon et al. [17]. Such disruptions were successfully counteracted by stevioside which restored expression of both proteins, while rosiglitazone was also seen to increased expression of pY20 in insulin-resistant cells. Expression of pY20 was elevated by treatment with rosiglitazone or stevioside (60\ud835\udf07M & 90\ud835\udf07M) which provided support for potential ability of stevioside at sensitising cells to insulin signalling. p-IRS1 expression was observed in normal cells and in those treated with stevioside, although the bands were of low resolutions and intensities. No p-IRS1 bands were observed in insulin-resistant cells, including those treated with rosiglitazone. This showed that stevioside was able to restore p-IRS1 expressions, similar to those observed in normal group. Stevioside possibly have an effect upstreamof the insulin-signalling pathway, by elevating levels of pY20 and probably p-IRS1 as well, which will result in GLUT4 translocation to increase uptake of extracellu- lar glucose. Antihyperglycemic effects of stevioside on cell metabolism as a whole has also been previously reported [21].  5. Conclusion  Stevioside proved to be as effective as the antidiabetic agent, rosiglitazone, at enhancing glucose uptake in normal 3T3-L1 adipocytes or in cells induced to insulin resistance via exposure to TNF-\ud835\udefc. In normal adipocytes, stevioside at a concentration that was a quarter that of rosiglitazone pro- duced greater increase in glucose uptake than the antidiabetic agent, both in absence or presence of insulin-stimulation. In insulin-resistant cells, stevioside was as effective as rosiglita- zone as similar concentrations of both produced comparable stimulation of glucose uptake in absence or presence of insulin. Enhancement of glucose uptake by stevioside was accompanied by increased expression of p-IRS1 and pY20, denoting involvement of GLUT-4 translocation. Further studies are needed to unravel mechanisms underlying use of stevioside in adjuvant management of diabetes mellitus and its associated complications.
