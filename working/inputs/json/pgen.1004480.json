    "summary": "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity is an essential enzymatic step in the formation of neutral lipid i.e., triacylglycerol in all living cells capable of accumulating storage lipid. Previously, we characterized an oleaginous yeast Candida tropicalis SY005 that yields storage lipid up to 58% under a specific nitrogen-stress condition, when the DGAT-specific transcript is drastically up-regulated. Here we report the identification, differential expression and function of two DGAT2 gene homologues--CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b of this C. tropicalis. Two protein isoforms are unique with respect to the presence of five additional stretches of amino acids, besides possessing three highly conserved motifs known in other reported DGAT2 enzymes. Moreover, the CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are characteristically different in amino acid sequences and predicted protein structures. The CtDGAT2b isozyme was found to be catalytically 12.5% more efficient than CtDGAT2a for triacylglycerol production in a heterologous yeast system i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant strain H1246 that is inherently defective in neutral lipid biosynthesis. The CtDGAT2b activity rescued the growth of transformed S. cerevisiae mutant cells, which are usually non-viable in the medium containing free fatty acids by incorporating them into triacylglycerol, and displayed preferential specificity towards saturated acyl species as substrate. Furthermore, we document that the efficiency of triacylglycerol production by CtDGAT2b is differentially affected by deletion, insertion or replacement of amino acids in five regions exclusively present in two CtDGAT2 isozymes. Taken together, our study characterizes two structurally novel DGAT2 isozymes, which are accountable for the enhanced production of storage lipid enriched with saturated fatty acids inherently in C. tropicalis SY005 strain as well as in transformed S. cerevisiae neutral lipid-deficient mutant cells. These two genes certainly will be useful for further investigation on the novel structure-function relationship of DGAT repertoire, and also in metabolic engineering for the enhanced production of lipid feedstock in other organisms.",

They play a fundamental role in light adaptation by coupling the rate of cGMP synthesis to the intracellular concentration of calcium. Mutations in GCAPs lead to blindness. The importance of functional EF-hands in GCAP1 for photoreceptor cell integrity has been well established. Mutations in GCAP1 that diminish its Ca2+ binding affinity lead to cell damage by causing unabated cGMP synthesis and accumulation of toxic levels of free cGMP and Ca2+. We here investigate the relevance of GCAP2 functional EF-hands for photoreceptor cell integrity. By characterizing transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of GCAP2 with all EF-hands inactivated (EF2GCAP2), we show that GCAP2 locked in its Ca2+-free conformation leads to a rapid retinal degeneration that is not due to unabated cGMP synthesis. We unveil that when locked in its Ca2+-free conformation in vivo, GCAP2 is phosphorylated at Ser201 and results in phospho-dependent binding to the chaperone 14-3-3 and retention at the inner segment and proximal cell compartments. Accumulation of phosphorylated EF  2 GCAP2 at the inner segment  results in severe toxicity. We show that in wildtype mice under physiological conditions, 50% of GCAP2 is phosphorylated correlating with the 50% of the protein being retained at the inner segment. Raising mice under constant light exposure, however, drastically increases the retention of GCAP2 in its Ca2+-free form at the inner segment. This study identifies a new mechanism governing GCAP2 subcellular distribution in vivo, closely related to disease. It also identifies a pathway by which a sustained reduction in intracellular free Ca2+ could result in photoreceptor damage, relevant for light damage and for those genetic disorders resulting in \u2018\u2018equivalent-light'' scenarios.

Introduction  Guanylate-cyclase activating proteins (GCAPs) belong to the  neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) family of proteins that display  limited similarity to calmodulin. They confer Ca 2+  -sensitivity to  guanylate-cyclase (Ret-GC) activity in retinal photoreceptor cells.  GCAP1 and GCAP2 constitute the major species in mammals [1-  3]. At rod and cone outer segments GCAPs form permanent  complexes with Ret-GCs allowing short response times of cyclase  modulation to fluctuations in intracellular Ca 2+  concentration.  GCAPs inhibit cyclase activity in their Ca 2+  -loaded form at the  high free [Ca 2+  ]i characteristic of the dark steady-state, and switch  to their activator state as they replace Ca 2+  by Mg 2+  when light  reduces Ca 2+  influx upon closing the cGMP-channels [4]. Light  exposure results in up to a 10-fold decline in the intracellular free  [Ca 2+  ], from ,250 nM in darkness to 23 nM in saturating light in mouse rod outer segments [5]. This Ca  2+ decrease is first sensed at  GC/GCAP complexes comprising GCAP1 and successively at  those comprising GCAP2 [Ca 2+  EC50 for GCAP1 ,130 nM; for GCAP2 ,50 nM, [6]], in a sequential mode of action referred to as a Ca  2+ -relay model [7-9]. Altogether, the rate of cGMP  synthesis upon light exposure is stimulated up to ,12-fold over its basal levels, serving to restore the cGMP levels and to reopen the  channels during the recovery of the light response and light  adaptation [10,11].  Despite the importance of GCAPs-mediated Ca 2+  -feedback on  cGMP synthesis in the control of sensitivity, deletion of GCAP1  and GCAP2 in mice does not lead to significant effects on retinal  morphology, indicating that GCAPs are not essential for the  development or maintenance of retinal organization [11].

Ten  heterozygous mutations in the GUCA1A gene encoding GCAP1  have been linked to autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (adCD),  cone rod dystrophy (adCRD) or macular degeneration (adMD)  [12-20]. One mutation in the GUCA1B gene, G157R, has been  associated to autosomal dominant retinal dystrophies ranging from  retinitis pigmentosa to macular degeneration [21].  Most of GCAP1 mutations map at EF-hand domains and affect  Ca 2+  coordination directly, such as D100E and N104K at EF-3 or  L151F and E155G at EF-4 [13-15,20], or map at the incoming or  outgoing a-helixes in EF-3 and EF-4, such as E89K, Y99C, T114I, I143NT and G159V, causing conformational distortions  that make Ca 2+  binding less favorable [15,17,18]. These mutations  shift the Ca 2+  IC50 of GC activation to higher free [Ca 2+  ], so that  in vitro the mutant proteins fail to switch to the inhibitory state and lead to persistent activation of RetGC in the whole  physiological range of [Ca 2+  ]i [15,20,22-24]. In vivo, as demon- strated for the Y99C and E155G GCAP1 mutations, the unabated  cGMP synthesis results in abnormally high levels of cGMP and  Ca 2+  in rods, and the ensuing retinal degeneration can be  significantly prevented by conditions that promote constitutive  stimulation of PDE6 such as constant light exposure [23,25,26].  There are aspects of GCAPs that remain less understood, such  as their Ca 2+  -dependent structural changes or the mechanisms  that determine their cellular distribution. GCAP1 and GCAP2 are  both myristoylated at the NH2-terminus. While myristoylation of  GCAP1 not only affects the affinity of GCAP1 for Ret-GC and  Ret-GC maximal activation, but also increases the Ca 2+  sensitivity  of Ret-GC inhibition at EF-4 [27], myristoylation of GCAP2  affects its overall structural stability without affecting Ret-GC  regulation [28]. Both GCAP1 and GCAP2 form homodimers  upon Ca 2+  dissociation, with the capacity to dimerize in GCAP2  correlating with the ability to activate Ret-GC [29]. However,  while in GCAP2 dimerization is reversed by Ca 2+  binding,  GCAP1 dimerization is resistant to the presence of Ca 2+  , implying  a difference in their Ca 2+  -dependent conformational changes [29].  Overall, the Ca 2+  -free form of GCAP2 shows a higher tendency to  aggregate than GCAP1. In addition, Ca 2+  -dependent conforma-  tional changes in GCAP2 have been shown to correlate with a site-  specific phosphorylation at Ser201, the significance of which is not  yet clear as it does not affect Ret-GC regulation in vitro [30]. Regarding their cellular localization, GCAP1 is more abundant  at cone than at rod outer segments [31]. GCAP2 localizes  primarily to rods and at lower levels in cones. In rods, GCAP2  localization is not restricted to rod outer segments. It is present at  rod inner segments at about the same level, and at lower levels in  more proximal compartments of the cell [32,33]. At the synaptic  terminal GCAP2 has been shown to interact with Ribeye, the  major structural component of synaptic ribbons, and to lead to  significant alterations of synaptic ribbon dynamics when overex-  pressed in vivo [34,35]. The mechanisms that determine GCAPs subcellular distribution are largely unknown, but it was proposed  that GCAPs are transported by vesicular trafficking guided by Ret-  GCs, in a process assisted by RD3 [36,37].  To study whether genetic mutations or light conditions that  would preclude Ca 2+  -binding to GCAP2 would compromise rod  cell viability by an analogous mechanism by which GCAP1 EF-  hand mutations do, we set to study the effect of expressing in rods  a mutant form of GCAP2 impaired to bind Ca 2+  : GCAP2 with all  functional EF hands inactivated (bEF 2  GCAP2) [38]. Whereas in vitro bEF2GCAP2 shows a similar biochemical behavior as Y99C-GCAP1 [24,38], we show that in vivo it leads to a rapid retinal degeneration by a mechanism independent of cGMP  metabolism. In vivo, the protein accumulates at the inner segment, in a form that is largely incompetent to activate the cyclase. It  binds to 14-3-3 protein isoforms due to enhanced phosphorylation  at Ser201. We show that the cause of the pathology in  bEF 2  GCAP2 mice is not constitutive activation of the cyclase,  but rather the accumulation of the phosphorylated protein at the  proximal compartments of the cell, likely in a conformationally  unstable form stabilized by 14-3-3 binding, that ultimately causes  extensive damage to the cell. We propose that this mechanism will  contribute to the pathology of those inherited retinal dystrophies  caused by mutations in different genes that share as an initial  consequence of the mutation the sustained reduction of the  intracellular concentration of Ca 2+  , the so-called \u2018\u2018light-equivalent  damage'' scenarios.  Results  Transgenic expression of bEF2GCAP2 in mouse rods leads to progressive retinal degeneration  To study the relevance of functional EF-hand domains in  GCAP2 for protein activity and photoreceptor cell integrity in vivo, we expressed a mutant form of GCAP2 with inactivated EF hands: GCAP2(E80Q/E116Q/D158N), hereafter referred to as  bEF 2  GCAP2, in the rod photoreceptors of transgenic mice  (Fig. 1A). It was previously shown that inactivation of the three  functional EF hands in bGCAP2 abolishes its capacity to bind  Ca 2+  [38]. To generate transgenic mice we expressed the cDNA of  the bovine GCAP2 isoform, so that the transgene product could be  distinguished from the endogenous murine form by SDS-PAGE  electrophoretic mobility. To discriminate the effect of the  mutations in GCAP2 from the effect that overexpression of  GCAP2 might have on the cell, we included in the study a control  transgenic line that expresses wildtype bovine GCAP2 (line E,  Fig. 1A,B). This line was reported to express wildtype bovine  GCAP2 at a ,2:1 ratio relative to endogenous GCAP2 [11]. We established two independent transgenic lines that expressed  different levels of bEF 2  GCAP2. Line A expressed bEF 2  GCAP2 at  a ratio of 2.76:1 relative to endogenous GCAP2, whereas line B  Author Summary  Visual perception is initiated at retinal photoreceptor cells, where light activates an enzymatic cascade that reduces free cGMP. As cGMP drops, cGMP-channels close and reduce the inward current -including Ca2+ influx- so that photoreceptors hyperpolarize and emit a signal. As the light extinguishes, cGMP levels are restored to reestablish sensitivity. cGMP synthesis relies on guanylate cyclase/ guanylate cyclase activating protein (RetGC/GCAP) com- plexes. GCAPs link the rate of cGMP synthesis to intracellular Ca  2+ levels, by switching between a Ca  2+ -free  state that activates cGMP synthesis during light exposure, and a Ca2+-bound state that arrests cGMP synthesis in the dark. It is established that GCAP1 mutations linked to adCORD disrupt this tight Ca2+ control of the cGMP levels. We here show that a GCAP2 functional transition from the Ca2+-free to the Ca2+-loaded form is essential for photo- receptor cell integrity, by a non-related mechanism. We show that GCAP2 locked in its Ca2+-free form is retained by phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to the proximal rod compartments, causing severe cell damage. This study identifies a pathway by which a sustained reduction in intracellular free Ca2+ could result in photoreceptor damage, relevant for light damage and for those genetic disorders resulting in \u2018\u2018equivalent-light'' scenarios.

To assess whether bEF 2  GCAP2 expression in rods causes  compensatory changes in the expression levels of other proteins  involved in cGMP metabolism, we compared the level of  expression of PDE6 and Ret-GCs in retinal homogenates from  wildtype and transgenic mice from lines A and B (Fig. 1C). Levels  of PDEa, b and c subunits, or GC1 and GC2 were mostly  Figure 1. Transgene expression of bEF2GCAP2 in rods leads to retinal degeneration. A. Design of transgene expression vector. The cDNA of bovine GCAP2 with the three functional EF hands disrupted [GCAP2 (E80Q, E116Q, D158N) or bEF2GCAP2] was expressed under the mouse opsin promoter (MOP), with the polyadenilation signal of the mouse protamine 1 (MP1) gene.

Equivalent fractions of a retina were resolved by SDS-PAGE from wt  (22 d of age), line E (40 d) and lines A (40 d) and B (22 d, showed from independent gel). An earlier time point was chosen for the strongest line (B) to reduce the effect that its rapid retinal degeneration has on total retinal protein content. Bovine and murine GCAP2 differ in size by three amino acids and can be distinguished by mobility. C. Compensatory changes in proteins involved in cGMP metabolism were not observed. The levels of PDEa,b and c subunits, or GC1 and GC2 were mostly unaffected in mice from line A, whereas a reduction in all proteins was observed in line B at 22 d of age, due to the shortened outer segments in this line.

Mice expressing bEF 2  GCAP2 showed a progressive retinal  degeneration whose severity correlated with the level of expression  of the transgene. Figure 1D shows normal retinal morphology in  the control transgenic line E at p40 and at 3 months of age. In  contrast, clear signs of retinal degeneration were observed in mice  expressing bEF 2  GCAP2 from lines A and B. Mice from line B,  which express the highest levels of bEF 2  GCAP2, presented a  substantial shortening of rod outer segments and a noticeable  reduction of outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness as early as p40,  with ONL thickness reduced to 6-7 rows of nuclei. Mice from line  A showed a slower progression of the disease, noticeable at 3  months, when the ONL thickness was reduced to 7-9 rows of  nuclei.  Because expression of wildtype bGCAP2 did not cause retinal  degeneration for up to one year of age in line E (results not shown),  the retinal degeneration observed in mice from lines A and B likely  results from distinctive properties of the mutant form of GCAP2  impaired to bind Ca 2+  . However, due to the different transgene  expression levels, we could not exclude that the observed  phenotype may result from overexpression of bGCAP2. To rule  out this possibility, we bred the control line E to homozygosity, to  obtain a line that expressed bGCAP2 to equivalent levels as  mutant line A. This line showed normal outer segment length and  organization, as well as normal outer nuclear layer thickness for up  to six months of age when raised in cyclic light [34]. From these  results we conclude that mutations that impair Ca 2+  binding in  GCAP2 lead to retinal degeneration in vivo.  Retinal degeneration by bEF2GCAP2 is reproduced in the GCAPs 2/2 background, and correlates with the loss of visual function  In order to study the effects of the mutant protein on cell  physiology, we bred the transgenic lines to GCAPs2/2 mice, to  obtain expression of bEF 2  GCAP2 or control bGCAP2 in the  absence of the endogenous protein.  The relative levels of expression of the transgene in the  independent transgenic lines were maintained in the GCAPs2/2  background (Fig. 2A). Expression of bEF 2  GCAP2 in the  GCAPs2/2 background slightly accelerated the rate of retinal  degeneration observed in the GCAPs+/+ background. Mice from the control lines GCAPs2/2 and GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 E  showed largely normal retinas with an outer nuclear layer (ONL)  thickness of 10 rows of nuclei for up to 5 months of age (Fig. 2B),  and preserved normal visual function when raised in cyclic light  conditions as assessed by electroretinogram (ERG) [34]. In  contrast, GCAPs2/2 expressing bEF 2  GCAP2 showed a pro-  gressive retinal degeneration that correlated with loss of visual  function (Fig. S2). In retinas from line B the ONL was reduced to  six rows of nuclei and outer segments were much shorter than  normal as early as p30 (Fig. 2B), when the A and B-wave  amplitudes of ERG responses were half the size of normal  responses from littermate controls (not shown). At 3 months of age  the ONL was reduced to 4 rows of nuclei, and by 5 months it was  limited to a single row. Mice were unresponsive to light (flat ERG  traces) by 7 months (Fig. S2). A slightly slower retinal degeneration  was observed in mice from line A that went from a normal outer  nuclear layer thickness of 12 rows of nuclei at p30 to about 5 rows  by 3 months of age. ERG responses of these mice resembled  normal responses at very early ages, but A- and B-wave amplitudes  were reduced by half by 4 months, correlating with a dramatic cell  loss in these mice between p20 and 5 months of age (Fig. 2B and  Fig. S2). Most of these mice are non responsive to light by ERG by  7-8 months (Fig. S2).  bEF2GCAP2 protein accumulates in inactive form at the inner segment of the cell  In vitro studies have shown that recombinant bEF2GCAP2 leads to maximal activation of Ret-GCs in reconstitution studies  Figure 3. Guanylate cyclase activity in retinal homogenates of transgenic mice at 0 mM [Ca2+] and 2 mM [Ca2+]. Guanylate cyclase activity (pmol cGMP/min.mg prot) was determined in WT, GCAPs2/2, GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line E and GCAPs2/2 bEF  2 GCAP2 line A retinal  extracts at 0 mM [Ca2+] or 2 mM [Ca2+] conditions, in the absence or presence of 3 mM recombinant GCAP2. In WT retinal homogenates at 0 mM [Ca2+] the endogenous GCAPs activate RetGC activity about 8-fold over the activity at 2 mM [Ca2+]. This stimulation of RetGC activity at 0 mM [Ca2+] is lost in GCAPs2/2 retinal homogenates, but restored in the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line E, which indicates that the control bGCAP2 protein expressed in vivo as a transgene is active in these assays. However, retinal homogenates from GCAPs2/2bEF2GCAP2 line A mice showed greatly reduced RetGC activity at 0 mM [Ca2+] and no activity at 2 mM [Ca2+] conditions. Addition of 3 mM recombinant GCAP2 elicited activation of RetGC at 0 mM [Ca2+] in all retinal homogenates, indicating the presence of functional RetGC in all samples. These results show that bEF  2 GCAP2 was present, but mostly inactive, in GCAPs2/2bEF  2 GCAP2  line A retinal homogenates. Results show the mean and standard deviation of at least four independent experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480.g003  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 5 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    using washed bovine rod outer segment membrane preparations  independently of free Ca 2+  in the whole physiological range of  [Ca 2+  ] [38]. To assay whether the transgenic bEF 2  GCAP2  protein has the capacity to activate Ret-GC activity in retinal  extracts from mice in a similar manner as in in vitro studies we performed guanylate cyclase activity assays in retinal extracts from  the mutant or control mice obtained prior to significant retinal  degeneration -between p20 and p30 - under conditions of 0 Ca 2+  or 2 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Ca2+-dependent modulation of Ret-GC activity was observed in retinal homogenates from wildtype mice  and control GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 E line. As expected, the Ca 2+  -  sensitive guanylate cyclase activity was undetectable in  GCAPs2/2 retinal extracts, indicating that the guanylate cyclase  activity that is measurable in whole mouse retinal extracts  originates essentially from photoreceptor cells in a GCAPs-  dependent manner. As a control for the presence of functional  Ret-GCs in retinal extracts, guanylate cyclase activity was also  measured after addition of 3 mM recombinant bGCAP2, which restored robust activity in a Ca  2+ dependent manner. Surprisingly,  retinal extracts from GCAPs2/2 bEF 2  GCAP2 B mice resem-  bled those of GCAPs2/2. They showed little detectable retGC  activity at either 0 Ca 2+  or high Ca 2+  . Even though the levels of  Ret-GCs and bEF 2  GCAP2 were reduced to some extent in these  retinal extracts due to the shortening of the rod outer segments in  this line, the addition of recombinant bGCAP2 showed that there  was functional Ret-GCs in these extracts at levels that were  sufficient to elicit a measurable activity. The results shown are the  average of four independent experiments. These results indicate  that while the transgenic bGCAP2 control protein expressed in the  GCAPs2/2 background reproduced normal activity, the trans-  genic mutant form of bGCAP2 impaired to bind Ca 2+  showed  very little detectable activity in vivo. To study whether the bEF  2 GCAP2 protein reproduced the  localization pattern of endogenous GCAP2 in transgenic mice, we  immunostained GCAP2 in retinal cryosections. Whereas trans-  genic bGCAP2 in the control line mimicked the localization of  endogenous GCAP2 in wildtype retinas (staining the outer  segment, inner segment, cytosol of outer nuclear layer and outer  plexiform layers of the retina, with the signal being most intense at  rod outer segments); this pattern was shifted in the case of  bEF 2  GCAP2, with the signal being most intense at the rod  proximal compartments, particularly at the inner segment layer  (Fig. 4). These results show that bEF 2  GCAP2, when expressed in  the GCAPs2/2 background, tend to accumulate at the metabolic  compartment of the cell.  These results indicate that bEF 2  GCAP2 in the retinas of  transgenic mice has a greatly reduced capacity to activate the  cyclase and accumulates at the inner segment of the cell, indicating  that the pathology in these mice does not result from unabated  cGMP synthesis. Furthermore, the retinal degeneration in  bEF 2  GCAP2 mice could not be prevented by raising the mice  in constant light exposure that would counteract the increase in  cGMP synthesis by continuous cGMP hydrolysis (Fig. S3), as was  the case in Y99C-GCAP1 mice [26].  Taken together, these results point to a mechanism independent  of cGMP metabolism as the molecular basis for the neurodegen-  eration in these mice.  bEF 2  GCAP2 protein is phosphorylated to high levels in vivo and binds to 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner  We reasoned that the accumulation of bEF 2  GCAP2 at the  proximal compartments of the cell rather than its absence at the  rod outer segment was the cause of the progressive retinal  degeneration in these mice, given that the absence of GCAP1 and  GCAP2 in GCAPs2/2 mice does not affect gross retinal  morphology [11]. To address why bEF 2  GCAP2 fails to be  distributed to the rod outer segment and how its retention and  accumulation at the inner segment leads to toxicity, we  investigated the protein-protein interactions that the mutant form  of the protein establishes in a specific manner. Immunoprecipi-  tation assays were conducted with an anti-GCAP2 monoclonal  antibody cross-linked to magnetic beads, using Triton X100-  solubilized whole retinal extracts from GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 E  and GCAPs2/2 bEF 2  GCAP2 B mice. Retinal extracts from  GCAPs2/2 mice were carried to define the background. The  pool of proteins immunoprecipitated in each case was identified by  directly subjecting the elution fractions to trypsin-digestion and  liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-  MS/MS). We searched for proteins identified in the GCAPs2/2  bEF 2  GCAP2 B sample with an spectral counting at least 1.5-fold  over the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 control lines).  We found that only the distinct isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins fulfilled  Figure 4. bEF 2  GCAP2 mislocalizes in transgenic retinas, accumulating at the inner segment compartment of the cell. Cryosections of central retina from WT, GCAPs2/2, GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line E and GCAPs2/2 bEF  2 GCAP2 line B, immunostained with an anti-GCAP2 polyclonal Ab.  Endogenous GCAP2 in WT retinas distributes to the cytosolic space of rod cells, at the rod outer segment, inner segment, outer nuclear and outer plexiform layers of the retina. This pattern of staining is lost in GCAPs2/2 retinas and restored in GCAPs2/2bGCAP2 line E retinas. However, in GCAPs2/2 bEF2GCAP2 line B the pattern of staining is shifted, with the GCAP2 signal being much stronger at the inner segment and proximal compartments of the cell than at the outer segment. os, outer segment; is, inner segment; onl, outer nuclear layer. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480.g004  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 6 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    these criteria, being identified with a considerably higher number  of peptides [1.33 to 3.2-fold higher] in the GCAPs2/2bEF 2  G-  CAP2 B than in control samples in at least two independent  experiments (Table 1). Spectral counting of 14-3-3 isoforms were  between 1.6-fold and 5-fold higher in the GCAPs2/2bEF 2  G-  CAP2 B samples than in control samples in the two experiments  (Table S1).  Because 14-3-3 proteins typically bind to their targets in  response to phosphorylation [39], and since phosphorylation of  GCAP2 has been reported to occur in vitro at a conserved Ser at position 201 in bGCAP2 [30], we next assayed whether the  binding of 14-3-3 to GCAP2 was phosphorylation dependent. We  first reproduced the observation that GCAP2 can be phosphor-  ylated in vitro by PKG, with Ca2+-free bGCAP2 being a better substrate for the kinase than Ca  2+ -loaded bGCAP2 (Fig. 5A).  Subsequently, we used recombinant bGCAP2 or bEF 2  GCAP2 in  in vitro phosphorylation reactions with PKG to generate phosphorylated-bGCAP2 or mock-treated bGCAP2 for pull-down  assays with bovine whole retinal homogenates (Fig. 5B). As seen in  Fig. 5C, 14-3-3 showed preferential binding to the phosphorylated  form of bGCAP2 or bEF 2  GCAP2 in two independent experi-  ments.  The observations that 14-3-3 binds more efficiently to bEF 2  G-  CAP2 than to bGCAP2 in vivo and that 14-3-3 binds to bGCAP2 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, together with the  reported higher efficiency of GCAP2 phosphorylation in its  Ca 2+  -free rather than its Ca 2+  -bound conformational state led us  to hypothesize that bEF 2  GCAP2 might be abnormally phosphor-  ylated in the living cell. To test this hypothesis we performed a 32  Pi -metabolic labeling of GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2  bEF 2  GCAP2 retinas in situ, followed by GCAP2 immunoprecip- itation and SDS-PAGE analysis. Following the incorporation of 32  Pi into the retinas of dark-adapted mice for 2 h, retinas were  either kept in darkness or exposed to 5 min of bright white light  and immediately subjected to Triton X100-solubilization and  GCAP2 immunoprecipitation. GCAPs2/2 retinas were carried  as a negative control.  Fig. 6A shows equal fractions of the Triton X100-solubilized  retinas after 32  Pi-incorporation and 5 min dark- or light-exposure.  The overall pattern of bands in this panel shows that incorporation  of 32  Pi into the ATP pool of the retina occurred at comparable levels  in all samples, allowing the detection of phosphorylated proteins  and changes in the overall phosphorylation pattern caused by light  (e.g. the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin is observed  at 35-37 kDa). GCAP2 phosphorylation could not be detected in  whole retinal extracts, so these samples were used as inputs for the  GCAP2 immunoprecipitation assay shown in Fig. 6B. GCAP2 was  phosphorylated to low levels in the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 sample  in the dark, and to a slightly higher extent when the retina was  exposed to light. No 24 kDa bands were observed in the  GCAPs2/2 samples. Strikingly high levels of bEF 2  GCAP2  phosphorylation were observed in GCAPs2/2 bEF 2  GCAP2  samples (lines A and B). A GCAP2 immunoblot of the 32  P-labeled  membrane confirmed that comparable levels of GCAP2 were  immunoprecipitated in GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2  bEF 2  GCAP2 samples (Fig. 6C). Fig. 6D shows the subsequent  immunostaining of the 14-3-3 pan and epsilon isoforms in the same  membrane, further confirming the selective binding of 14-3-3 to the  phosphorylated mutant form of GCAP2 impaired to bind Ca 2+  .  GCAP2 phosphorylation was further characterized by isoelec-  trofocusing gel analysis followed by immunoblotting with a  GCAP2 antibody (Fig. 7). Under room light conditions wildtype  C57/B6 mice showed two bands of roughly equal intensity  corresponding to the pI of the unphosphorylated (4.92) and singly  T a  b le  1 .

The intensity of the 4.85 band  was greatly diminished when NaF, a broad phosphatase inhibitor,  was omitted from the samples, thus confirming the identity of this  band as phosphorylated GCAP2 (Fig. 7A). We conclude that  about half of the total GCAP2 protein is phosphorylated in  wildtype mice under standard room light conditions. The extent to  which endogenous mGCAP2 was phosphorylated in wildtype mice  under room light conditions was higher than that of bGCAP2 in  GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 transgenic mice.  To address whether GCAP2 phosphorylation takes place  differentially in dark/light conditions, wildtype mice that were  adapted to room light for 1 h were dark-adapted for up to 14 h,  and GCAP2 phosphorylation was analyzed at 1, 2, 3, 5 and 14 h.  Fig. 7B shows that the ratio of unphosphorylated to phosphory-  Figure 5. The protein 14-3-3 binds to recombinant GCAP2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. A. In vitro, Ca 2+  -free bGCAP2 is phosphorylated more efficiently than Ca  2+ -bound bGCAP2. Upper panel shows an autoradiograph of  33 P phosphorylation products from an in vitro  phosphorylation reaction of recombinant wildtype bGCAP2 or bEF2GCAP2 with protein kinase G (PKG), in the presence or absence of free Ca2+. The 20 ml reaction mixture contained 8.5 mg of purified recombinant wildtype bGCAP2 or bEF2GCAP2, purified PKGIa (100 units, Calbiochem) and 3 mCi of 33P- cATP in phosphorylation reaction buffer, containing either CaCl2 or EGTA (see Methods). After incubation, reaction mixtures were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Lower panel shows immunostained GCAP2. Recombinant bGCAP2 or bEF  2 GCAP2  protein were present to similar amounts in all reaction tubes. B. In vitro phosphorylated or mock-treated bGCAP2 and bEF 2  GCAP2 were generated for pull-down assays. Phosphorylation reactions were performed as above, in the presence of EGTA, except that cGMP was added to 500 mM (+ lanes) or not added (2 lanes). Immunostaining of GCAP2 in the same nitrocellulose membrane shows the GCAP2 monomer at 25 kDa and upper bands corresponding to dimers and multimers of GCAP2, observed to a higher extent in the EF2GCAP2 lanes. Molecular mass (MW) markers (Precision Plus Protein Standards, BioRad) are 20, 25, 37, 50, 75, 100 and 150 kDa. Experiment shown in duplicate. C. The 14-3-3 protein isoforms bind more efficiently to phosphorylated bGCAP2 and bEF2GCAP2 than to unphosphorylated counterparts. Phosphorylated or mock- proteins were cross-liked to magnetic beads and pull-down assays were performed with whole bovine retinal extracts obtained in 1% Triton-X100. Panels show the input and bound fractions for the indicated phospho- or mock-proteins, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Membrane was sequentially incubated with a pAb to 14-3- 3pan (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany), a mAb to 14-3-3e (abcam, Cambridge, UK), an IRDye 800CW Goat Anti-rabbit IgG and a IRDye 680CW Goat Anti-mouse IgG (Tebu-Bio, Offenbach, Germany). Image was acquired at the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR). Therefore 14-3-3pan isoforms (30 kDa) are shown in green, while 14-3-3e (33 kDa) is shown in red.

A. In situ  phosphorylation assay. Retinas from dark-adapted mice from the indicated phenotypes were dissected under dim red light, incubated in bicarbonate buffered Locke's solution containing 1 mCi/mL of  32 P-H3PO4 for 90 min in a 5% CO2 incubator and exposed to white light for 5 min (L) or maintained  in darkness (D). Retinas were homogenized in Triton X100-solubilization buffer and pre-cleared by centrifugation. Aliquots corresponding to one tenth of a retina were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and blotted to a nitrocellulose membrane. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by autoradiography upon 4 h of exposure. B. GCAP2 immunoprecipitation in 32P-labeled samples.

If we presume that GCAP2 is preferentially  phosphorylated during periods of light exposure when in its Ca 2+  -  free conformation, these results may indicate that a few hours of  dark- or light-adaptation are not enough to have a noticeable  effect on the overall GCAP2 population. This would not be  surprising if only newly synthesized GCAP2 was subjected to the  kinase/phosphatase regulation (see Discussion).  Isoelectrofocusing of retinal samples from GCAPs2/2  bEF 2  GCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 were performed to  assay the steady-state relative levels of non-phosphorylated and  phosphorylated GCAP2 (Fig. 7C). Whereas endogenous GCAP2  in wildtype C57/B6 mice showed similar proportions of non-  phosphorylated and phosphorylated GCAP2, the GCAPs2/2  bEF 2  GCAP2 sample showed a larger fraction of phosphorylated  GCAP2 and the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 sample showed the  reverse: a larger fraction of non-phosphorylated GCAP2. These  results are consistent with the metabolic labeling results, namely,  low levels of phosphorylation in the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 control  line, and much higher phosphorylation levels in the GCAPs2/2  bEF 2  GCAP2 line (Fig. 7C and Fig. 6B).  To address whether 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated GCAP2  might be the cause of its retention at inner segments, we analyzed  the localization of the 14-3-3 proteins in retinal sections from  GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 bEF 2  GCAP2 samples.  Fig. 8 shows that 14-3-3 epsilon localizes to all cell layers of the  retina; the ganglion cell layer, the inner cell layer and the  photoreceptor cell layer of the retina. In photoreceptor cells it  appears to distribute to the inner segment, the perinuclear region  and the synaptic terminal, but it is excluded from the outer  segment. This isoform of 14-3-3 colocalized with GCAP2 mainly  at the inner segment of GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 samples, but also to  the perinuclear region and synaptic terminals in the GCAPs2/2  bEF 2  GCAP2 samples. From these results we infer that the  localization pattern of 14-3-3e in photoreceptor cells would be consistent with a role of GCAP2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3  binding at retaining the mutant form of GCAP2 impaired to bind  Ca 2+  at the proximal compartments of the cell.  Phosphorylation at Ser201 is required for the retention of bEF2GCAP2 at the proximal compartments of the photoreceptor cell in vivo  To address whether phosphorylation of GCAP2 is what causes  the retention of bEF 2  GCAP2 at the inner segment and proximal  compartments of the cell, we expressed a mutant form of  bEF 2  GCAP2 in which Ser201 was mutated to Gly as a transient  transgene in rod cells, given that Ser201 is the only residue that  was found to be phosphorylated in GCAP2 [30].  The bS201G/EF 2  GCAP2 cDNA was expressed under the rod  opsin promoter by subretinal injection and in vivo electroporation of the DNA in neonatal GCAPs2/2 mice as described [40]. Both  bGCAP2 and bEF 2  GCAP2 cDNAs were carried out in parallel in  order to compare the localization of the mutants under equivalent  experimental conditions. A plasmid expressing the green fluores-  cent protein (GFP) under the Ubiquitin C promoter was coinjected  to identify the region around the injection site in which DNA  transfection was efficient, and electroporated retinas were  analyzed at p28.  Figure 7. Analysis of GCAP2 phosphorylation by isoelectrofo- cusing. A. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) gel of light-adapted wildtype mouse retinal homogenates. Mice were light-adapted to room light. Retinas were obtained, solubilized in a saline buffer with 1% dodecyl maltoside, in the presence or absence of 50 mM NaF (phosphatase inhibitor). Samples were clarified, loaded onto an electrofocusing gel (pH range 3- 8) and focused for 2 h at 23W. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and incubated with an anti-GCAP2 Ab. Two prominent bands are observed at 4.92 and 4.85 isoelectric point, that correspond to unphosphorylated and monophosphorylated mGCAP2, respectively. B. The overall phosphorylation status of GCAP2 does not change significantly during a 12 h period of dark-adaptation. Mice were light-adapted to room light for 1 h, and subjected to dark-adaptation for a period of up to 14 h. Retinas were analyzed as above. C. Analysis of GCAP2 phosphorylation status in the indicated mouse lines. Transgenic bGCAP2 is phosphorylated to a lesser extent than the endogenous mGCAP2, whereas bEF2GCAP2 is phosphorylated to a much higher extent. Note that the isoelectric point of bGCAP2 differs  from that of mGCAP2, and that the isoelectric point of bEF2GCAP2 (E80Q,E116Q,D158N GCAP2) is shifted versus that of bGCAP2. Results from the isoelectrofocusing gels confirm that transgenic bEF2GCAP2 is phosphorylated to a much higher extent than the control transgenic bGCAP2. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480.g007  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 10 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    Fig. 9 shows that the localization of bGCAP2 and bEF 2  GCAP2  in the transient transgenic mice obtained by electroporation  reproduced the localization observed in stable transgenics:  specifically, bEF 2  GCAP2 was retained at the inner segment and  proximal compartments of transfected photoreceptors. bEF 2  G-  CAP2 was excluded from the outer segment, which is demarcated  by rhodopsin immunofluorescence (red) (Fig. 9 panels E, F and  profile from cell N.6, Fig. S4 for additional images and profiles). In  contrast, the mutant bS201G/EF 2  GCAP2 distributed to the  proximal compartments of the cell but also to rod outer segments.  As shown in panels H-I of Fig. 9 and in the profile from cell N. 10,  the GCAP2 signal -in green- co-labeled with rhodopsin (red) in all  transfected cells (thirteen cells analyzed, 57% of GCAP2 signal co-  labeled with rhodopsin on average, see Fig. S4), indicating its  redistribution to rod outer segments. On average, 50% of the  protein distributed to rod outer segments when bGCAP2 was  expressed, whereas virtually all bEF 2  GCAP2 was retained at the  inner segment and proximal compartments. Mutating S201 to Gly  in bEF 2  GCAP2 reverted this retention, resulting in 57% of the  protein distributing to rod outer segment (histogram in Fig. 9J).  These results indicate that phosphorylation at Ser201 in the  mutant form of GCAP2 impaired to bind Ca 2+  is what causes its  accumulation at the inner segment and proximal compartments of  the cell, ultimately leading to toxicity.  Light conditions expected to promote a sustained reduction in the concentration of Ca  2+ at the inner  segment compartment lead to GCAP2 retention at the inner segment in wildtype mice  The finding that GCAP2 locked in its Ca 2+  -free form (bEF 2  G-  CAP2) is retained at the inner segment compartment resulting in  Figure 8.

Mutations in several genes involved  in the light response result in the sustained hyperpolarization of  the cell and a steady reduction in [Ca 2+  ]i. Null mutations in  GUCY2D or RD3 causative of the Lebers Congenital Amaurosis  (LCA) form of blindness, for instance, would result in reduced  levels of cGMP at the rod outer segments, the closure of cGMP-  channels and hyperpolarization of the cell, with the ensuing  reduction in the influx of Ca 2+  to rod inner segment [36,37,41].  Also associated to LCA, null mutations in RPE65 result in retinal  Figure 9. Mutation of Ser201 in bEF2GCAP2 precludes protein retention at the inner segment. Wildtype bGCAP2, bEF2GCAP2 or bS201G/EF2GCAP2 were transiently expressed in the rod photoreceptor cells of GCAPs2/2 mice by in vivo DNA electroporation of neonates following subretinal injection. A plasmid expressing GFP driven by the Ubiquitin C promoter was coinjected in order to identify transfected areas in the eye at postnatal day 28 (p28). Cryosections were immunostained for GCAP2 with a polyclonal GCAP2 Ab and an Alexa Fluor 555 anti-rabbit IgG (signal converted to green); and for rhodopsin with monoclonal Ab 1D4 and an Alexa Fluor 647 anti-mouse IgG (red signal). Transient expression of wildtype bGCAP2 by electroporation reproduced the reported localization pattern in the stable transgenic line, namely, its almost equal distribution between the inner and outer segments (panels A-C, profile for cell N.3). bEF2GCAP2 was mostly retained at the inner segments, being excluded from outer segments (panels D-F, and profile for cell N.6), which also reproduced the observation from the stable bEF2GCAP2 transgenic lines. In contrast, bS201G/EF  2 GCAP2 localized to some extent at the inner segment but mostly distributed to rod outer segments, showing a clear colocalization with  rhodopsin (panels G-I, and profile from cell N.10). Panel J shows a histogram of the mean percentage of GCAP2 distribution to ROS for each phenotype and the standard error of the mean, as determined by calculating: (the intensity of GCAP2 that colocalizes with rhodopsin)/(intensity of GCAP2 that colocalizes with rhodopsin + intensity of GCAP2 at the inner segment), see Methods. (Five cells were analyzed for the WT sample, twelve cells for bEF2GCAP2 and thirteen cells for bS201G/GCAP2). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480.g009  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 12 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    degeneration due to the basal constitutive activity associated to  opsin, the apoprotein form of the visual pigment, leading to a  sustained hyperpolarization of the cell [42]. These genetic  disorders that ultimately cause an effect similar to continuous  light exposure, are collectively referred to as \u2018\u2018equivalent-light''  disorders [43]. Therefore, if GCAP2 was retained at the inner  segment under constant illumination conditions, it would be an  indication that this pathway could contribute to the pathology of  these disorders.  Wildtype mice were exposed to constant fluorescent light  (700 lux), or kept in dark cabinets for thirty days, and GCAP2  subcellular distribution was analyzed by immunofluorescence  (Fig. 10). The percentage of GCAP2 co-localizing with rhodopsin  was quantified in four mice per condition. After 30 days of light  exposure 84% of GCAP2 was retained at the inner segment, in  contrast to 45% of GCAP2 retained in mice kept for 30 d in  constant darkness, P#0,0001 (histogram Fig. 10).  These results show that a sustained drop in [Ca 2+  ]i in wildtype  rod photoreceptors causes GCAP2 retention at the inner segment.  This, together with the results obtained from bEF 2  GCAP2  transgenic mice showing that accumulation of bEF 2  GCAP2 at  the inner segment results in toxicity, points to the sustained  retention of Ca 2+  -free GCAP2 at the inner segment as a pathway  that could contribute to the pathology of \u2018\u2018light-equivalent''  disorders.  Discussion  Precluding Ca 2+  binding to GCAP2 in vivo leads to retinal degeneration  We here report that a form of GCAP2 with mutations that impair  Ca 2+  coordination at the three functional EF-loops (bEF 2  GCAP2)  led to retinal degeneration when expressed in rods in transgenic  mice. In vitro the bEF2GCAP2 mutant shows a similar shift in Ca2+  sensitivity of guanylate cyclase regulation as the Y99C, E155G and  other GCAP1 mutants that directly or indirectly affect Ca 2+  coordination [22,24,38]. These GCAP1 mutants have been  demonstrated to cause retinal degeneration in vivo by leading to persistent activation of the cyclase, causing elevated levels of cGMP  and Ca 2+  [23,25,26]. Intriguingly, we found that the retinal  degeneration caused by bEF 2  GCAP2 expression in rods was  independent of cGMP metabolism. When guanylate cyclase activity  was measured in retinal homogenates from bEF 2  GCAP2 trans-  genic mice, instead of constitutive activation of the cyclase we found  very diminished cyclase activity independently of the [Ca 2+  ]  conditions, which contrasts with the normal cyclase activity  observed in homogenates of wildtype and bGCAP2 control-  transgenic mice (Fig. 3). Furthermore, retinal degeneration in  bEF 2  GCAP2 transgenic mice could not be prevented or delayed by  raising the mice under constant light exposure (Fig. S3). These  results show for the first time that functional EF-hands in GCAP2  are required for photoreceptor cell integrity in vivo, by a mechanism independent of guanylate cyclase regulation.  Phosphorylation of GCAP2 and 14-3-3 binding as a new in vivo mechanism controlling GCAP2 subcellular distribution that causes toxicity when overly deregulated  In contrast to the bGCAP2 control-transgenic protein that  reproduced the endogenous mGCAP2 subcellular localization,  bEF 2  GCAP2 largely accumulated at inner segment and proximal  compartments of the rod when it was expressed in the  GCAPs2/2 background (Fig. 4). At this compartment, bEF 2  G-  CAP2 was phosphorylated to a much higher extent than the  control transgenic protein in in situ phosphorylation assays as well  as under steady state conditions in the intact rod as shown by IEF,  and it was found to bind 14-3-3 proteins (Table 1, Figs. 5-7). This  constitutes the first report that GCAP2 is phosphorylated in vivo, at much higher levels when locked in its Ca  2+ -free conformation,  and that phosphorylation of GCAP2 triggers 14-3-3 binding. We  show that 14-3-3 localization in rod photoreceptors is restricted to  proximal compartments and excluded from the outer segments  (Fig. 8). Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation is  required for bEF 2  GCAP2 retention at proximal compartments by  showing that replacing Ser201 by Gly in bEF 2  GCAP2 substan-  tially reverts this retention (Fig. 9). On average 57% of bS201G/  EF 2  GCAP2 localized to rod outer segments (Fig. 10 histogram  and Fig. S4, n = 13 cells). We believe that the reason that a 100%  reversion was not observed is that 14-3-3 shows some affinity for  unphosphorylated bEF 2  GCAP2 as well (Fig. 5). We therefore  infer that 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated GCAP2 retains the  protein at proximal compartments, in what clearly represents an  important step in the regulation of GCAP2 subcellular distribution  in vivo, somewhat analogous to 14-3-3 regulation of phosducin availability during dark and light adaptation.  14-3-3 proteins are a family of phosphobinding proteins of  about 30 kDa that comprises seven homologs in mammals. They  exist as homo- or hetero-dimers that are rigid in structure, with  each 14-3-3 dimer binding to two different phospho-binding sites  either in the same or in two independent target proteins. By  masking an epitope, clasping epitopes or promoting the scaffolding  of their clients, 14-3-3 proteins exert a diverse range of regulatory  roles in metabolism, trafficking or integration of cell survival versus  cell death pathways [39]. In the retina, 14-3-3 proteins interact  with phosducin at rod inner segments, regulating the amount of  free phosducin during dark- and light-adaptation [44,45].  Phosducin modulates the amount of Trabc heterotrimer through  competition with Gta subunit for binding to the Gtbc complex.  When light exposure activates Gt, releasing Gtbc from Gta at rod  outer segments, phosducin association to Gtbc facilitates Gta and  Pd-Gtbc independent translocation to the inner segment compart-  ment [46]. At the inner segment during dark-adaptation  phosducin is simultaneously phosphorylated at Ser-54 and Ser-  73 residues by PKA and CaMK, which causes a competing  interaction with the 14-3-3 protein that dramatically reduces  phosducin binding to Gtbc [47]. This allows the redistribution of  Gta and Gtbc to rod outer segments, the former assisted by  UNC119 and the latter by PrBP [48,49]. At rod outer segments Tr  subunits are discharged to membranes and a heterotrimer forms  again.  How 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated GCAP2 fits with  GCAP2 overall role in photoreceptor cell physiology and inherited  retinal dystrophies is only emerging. It is clear from this work that  GCAP2 is phosphorylated preferentially in its Ca 2+  -free form in vivo. Because it is well established that GCAP2 in its Ca2+-free form forms dimers [29], and that 14-3-3 exists as dimers that bind  to two consensus binding sites in client proteins [39], it seems  straightforward to propose that a dimer of 14-3-3 would bind to a  dimer of GCAP2, presumably to stabilize it (Fig. 11). Because  GCAP1 and GCAP2, unlike recoverin or phosducin, were shown  not to redistribute between subcellular compartments during dark-  or light-adaptation [50], we deduce that this mechanism would  mainly affect the cytosolic distribution of newly synthesized  protein.  We propose a model in which the GCAP2 molecules  synthesized during the dark period (predominantly in the Ca 2+  -  loaded state) would bind to RetGC and be transported to rod  outer segments, whereas the GCAP2 molecules synthesized in the  light period (GCAP2 in its Ca 2+  -free state) would be phosphor-  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 13 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    ylated and retained at proximal compartments by 14-3-3 binding  (Fig. 11). Such a scenario would result in the phosphorylation and  retention to proximal compartments of about 50% of GCAP2  molecules in a physiological situation (wildtype mice raised in  standard cyclic light). This is what we observe by IEF (Fig. 7) and  by immunolocalization analysis (Fig. 4). This model would also  explain why 12 h of dark-adaptation did not have a noticeable  effect on the steady-state phosphorylation levels of GCAP2 (Fig. 7).  The model would predict that wildtype mice reared under  constant light exposure for a period of time covering the complete  renewal of the rod outer segment would result in massive GCAP2  retention at the inner segment, given that GCAP2 would always  be synthesized in a context of low [Ca 2+  ]i, and that is precisely  what we have observed after exposing mice to constant light for  30 days (Fig. 10). In contrast, it would be predicted that wildtype  mice reared in constant darkness would result in GCAP2 major  localization to the rod outer segment layer. This, however, was  not observed. In mice reared in darkness for 30 days GCAP2  distributed about equally between inner and outer segment  layers (Fig. 10). We interpret this result as an indication that  some of the protein interactions required for GCAP2 transport  to the rod outer segment (e.g. RetGC, RD3) might be rate-  limiting.  We propose that GCAP2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding  constitute a major molecular determinant of GCAP2 subcellular  localization upon its synthesis. What is its physiological relevance?  A possibility is that 14-3-3 binding to GCAP2, by trapping  GCAP2 to proximal compartments, might work to secure a  reservoir of GCAP2 at these compartments, where GCAP2 may  be exerting other roles, e.g. at the synaptic terminal [34,35].  Alternatively, the 14-3-3 trapping of Ca 2+  -free GCAP2 upon its  phosphorylation might serve as a protein quality control mecha-  nism, to avoid that an excess of Ca 2+  -free, aggregation-prone  GCAP2 molecules would reach the rod outer segment. Irrespec-  tive of its physiological significance, this regulatory enzymatic step  is specific of GCAP2, given that GCAP1 is not phosphorylated,  and might have evolved because it is more relevant for rods than  cones. Conditions that substantially alter this regulatory mecha-  nism increasing the protein retention at the inner segment of the  Ca 2+  -free form would have toxic consequences for the cell. We  propose that toxicity in this scenario would arise from GCAP2  natural tendency to aggregate (see below).  Figure 10. Constant light exposure for 30 days retains endogenous GCAP2 at the inner segment in wildtype mice. A. Wildtype mice (C57Bl/6J) were exposed to white fluorescent light of 700 lux intensity for 30 days (upper panel row), or kept in constant darkness for 30 days (lower row).

In wildtype mice phosphorylated  GCAP2 at steady state constitutes about 50% of the total protein,  consistent with about 50% of the protein retention at rod proximal  compartments. This indicates that GCAP2 phosphorylation and  14-3-3 binding are not in itself toxic for the cell. It is therefore the  deregulation of this mechanism- when all GCAP2 molecules are  impaired to coordinate Ca 2+  and GCAP2 phosphorylation and 14-  3-3 binding are happening to a much larger extent- that correlates  with severe retinal degeneration in the bEF 2  GCAP2 line.  How does the accumulation of GCAP2-14-3-3 complexes at the  rod inner segment lead to cell death? We hypothesize that  accumulation of these complexes might result in pathology due to  the formation of misfolded GCAP2 oligomers, in much a similar  way to which synuclein, APP, Tau, Huntingtin or ataxin lead to  neuronal cell death in Parkinson's (PD), Alzheimer (AD),  Huntington's (HD) or spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) diseases.  GCAP2 shows a natural tendency to aggregate. Structural studies  have shown that the Ca 2+  -free form of GCAP proteins, and  particularly of GCAP2, are difficult to maintain in solution and are  prone to aggregation [51]. When expressed in bacteria,  recombinant GCAP2 accumulates in inclusion bodies, is only  solubilized at high concentrations of guanidinium or urea, and is  difficult to maintain in solution after refolding [1]. Dimers and  high molecular weight aggregates can typically be distinguished by  SDS-PAGE, more prominently for EF 2  GCAP2 than for the  wildtype form of the protein (e.g. this study, Fig. 5B). On the other  hand, previous studies have found a close association between 14-  3-3 and progressive neurodegenerative diseases. 14-3-3 proteins  have been shown to colocalize with AD neurofibrillary tangles that  are composed primarily of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins  [52,53]. In PD, 14-3-3 is detectable in Lewy bodies which  accumulate a-synuclein [54]; and 14-3-3 colocalization was also reported for mutant ataxin in SCA [55]. Furthermore, 14-3-3 zeta  and epsilon binding to phosphorylated ataxin-1 at S776 was  shown to aggravate neurodegeneration by stabilizing mutant  ataxin, retarding its degradation and enhancing its aggregation in  transfected cells and transgenic flies [55]. The requirement of 14-  3-3 zeta for Htt86Q aggregate formation has also been established  in cells [56].  We propose that the mutant form of GCAP2 locked in its Ca 2+  -  free conformation results in toxicity in vivo by the progressive formation of soluble high molecular weight oligomers of GCAP2-  14-3-3 that are toxic for the cell. Inclusion bodies were not  detected in our immunofluorescence assays with the polyclonal or  monoclonal anti-GCAP2 antibodies used, or the anti-14-3-3e monoclonal antibody. It may happen that these antibodies do not  Figure 11. Model depicting a mechanism regulating GCAP2 distribution in rods involving GCAP2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. Under high Ca  2+ conditions typical of the dark-steady state, the Ca  2+ -loaded form of GCAP2 would bind to Ret-GC and be transported to  rod outer segments (left sketch); whereas under low Ca2+ conditions (e.g. light periods), the Ca2+-free form of GCAP2 would be retained by 14-3-3 at proximal compartments (middle). These alternating scenarios would result in approximately half of GCAP2 distributing to the inner segment and proximal compartments of the cell, and half to the outer segment compartment in a physiological situation (e.g. in wildtype mice raised in standard cyclic light). However, a prolonged light exposure or genetic conditions that would result in an abnormal accumulation of GCAP2 in its Ca2+-free form (e.g. mutations in components of the phototransduction cascade causing unabated signaling, hyperpolarization of the cell and a sustained reduction in [Ca  2+ ]i at the inner segment) would lead to neurodegeneration likely by inducing GCAP2 aggregation, or by GCAP2-mediated toxicity some other  way (right sketch). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480.g011  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 15 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    recognize inclusion bodies, or that their absence would result from  a relatively efficient clearance of the mutant protein and therefore  slow formation of putative deposits. In this sense we have observed  that inhibition of the proteasome results in an increase of  EF 2  GCAP2 levels (Lo\u0301pez-del Hoyo and Me\u0301ndez, unpublished  observation).  This mechanism of toxicity caused by GCAP2 misfolding may  contribute to the pathology of genetic mutations causing  \u2018\u2018equivalent-light damage'' that result in a sustained reduction in  the level of intracellular Ca 2+  : e.g. mutations in the visual cycle  resulting in opsin basal constitutive activity (e.g. null mutations in  RPE65 [42]). Furthermore, this mechanism of toxicity is likely to  contribute to cell death and retinal degeneration in those cases of  Lebers Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) in which two conditions  converge: GCAPs accumulation at the inner segment and a  sustained reduction in the level of intracellular Ca 2+  . Those  conditions are met, for instance, in LCA1 caused by null mutations  in RetGC-E (GUCY2D) or LCA12 caused by mutations in RD3,  two severe and prevalent inherited retinal dystrophies.  In conclusion, we propose that GCAP2 may be a mediator of  \u2018\u2018equivalent-light'' genetic damage, by its natural tendency to  aggregate when in its Ca 2+  -free form, in a process regulated by  phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. Future studies will be  addressed at further characterizing the stoichiometry, solubility  and turn-over of GCAP2-14-3-3 complexes, as well as their effects  on the normal functions of the cell.  Materials and Methods  Transgenic expression of bEF2GCAP2 in mouse rods and determination of transgene expression levels by western blot  This study was conducted in accordance with the ARVO  statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision  Research and in compliance with Acts 5/1995 and 214/1997 for  the welfare of experimental animals of the Autonomous Commu-  nity (Generalitat) of Catalonia, and approved by the Ethics  Committee on Animal Experiments of the University of Barcelona  and the University of Southern California. The GCAP2 expres-  sion vectors used to generate transgenic mice were obtained by  assembling the 4.4 kb mouse opsin promoter with bovine wildtype  GCAP2 cDNA or mutant bEF 2  GCAP2 [GCAP2 E80Q/E116Q/  D158N, [38]] cDNA (0.7 kb), and a 0.6 kb fragment containing  the mouse protamine 1 polyadenylation sequence, into pBluescript  II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, California). The resulting fusion gene,  5.7 kb in size, was excised from the plasmid, gel purified and  microinjected at 1 mg/ml into the pronuclei of C57Bl6/J6DBA/ 2J F1 hybrid mouse embryos (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar  Harbor, Maine). Injected embryos were implanted into pseudo-  pregnant females, and progenie was screened for founders by PCR  amplification of tail genomic DNA with primers:  Rh1.1: 59GTGCCTGGAGTTGCGCTGTGGG39 (forward)  and p24: 59TGGCCTCCTCGTTGTCCGGGACCTT39 (re-  verse).  Founder mice were bred to C57Bl6 mice to maintain the  transgene in a pigmented wildtype genetic background, or to  GCAPs2/2 to generate GCAPs2/2 bEF 2  GCAP2 mice. To  detect transgenic GCAP2 expression by immunoblot, retinas from  mice of each genotype were obtained at either postnatal day 22  (p22) (for WT and mice from line B) or p40 (lines A and E), and  were homogenized in 100 ml of homogenization buffer [80 mM TrisHCl, pH 8.0, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc SC,  0.5 mg/ml Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel,  Switzerland)]. After addition of SDS Laemmli sample buffer,  samples were boiled for 5 min, and fractions corresponding to 1/  40 of a retina were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 12% tris-glycine  gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran,  Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Membranes were incubated  with polyclonal antibodies to bovine GCAP2 [p24DN [1], a gift from A. Dizhoor, Pennsylvania College of Optometry, Elkins  Park, Pennsylvania], [GC1 and GC2 [57], a gift from D. Garbers,  HHMI and UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas] and PDE  (abc2, Cytosignal, Irvine, CA). Immunopositive protein bands were detected with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG  with the ECL system (Amersham, UK).  For determination of the precise level of expression of the  transgene (expressed as a function of the endogenous), retinal  extracts from mice from bEF 2  GCAP2 line B and line A (2-fold  serial dilutions of retinal extracts obtained as described above)  were directly compared to retinal extracts from the bGCAP2  control line (2-fold dilutions). The expression level of bGCAP2 in  this line was previously established as 2-fold the endogenous levels  [11]. This same study established that the anti-GCAP2 antibody  used recognized bGCAP2 with a 1.5-fold higher affinity than  mGCAP2 [11]. That is the reason that we compared transgenic  bEF 2  GCAP2 to the transgenic bGCAP2 reference. The 2-fold  serial dilutions in each sample were used to obtain the integration  values of those bands present in the linear range in the same gel,  for a direct comparison. The expression of bEF 2  GCAP2 line A  was determined to be 2.7660.12 -fold the endogenous levels  (average 6 St Dev, n = 3). The expression of bEF 2  GCAP2 line B  was estimated to be 1.4-fold higher than line A, that is, 3.85-fold  the endogenous levels.  Histology and retinal morphometry For histological analysis of the retina by light microscopy,  eyecups were marked for orientation, fixed, embedded in epoxy  resin and sectioned at 1 mm thickness as described previously [58]. Retinal morphometry measurements were taken as previously  described [58].  Guanylate cyclase assays Guanylate cyclase activity was assayed in mouse retinal  homogenates. Six retinas from dark-adapted mice of each  genotype were dissected under infrared illumination, pooled and  homogenized in 112 ml of 26assay buffer (100 mM MOPS-KOH pH 7.5, 16 mM NaCl, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM IBMX, 20 mM  MgCl2, 14 mM 2-b-mercaptoethanol). From this, 12.5 ml aliquots were mixed with either 7.5 ml of 1.33 mM EGTA (for a final concentration of 0.4 mM EGTA per reaction, the \u2018\u2018low Ca  2+ ''  condition) or 7.5 ml of 6.6 mM CaCl2 (for a final concentration of 2 mM Ca2+, the \u2018\u2018high Ca2+'' condition) and preincubated at 30uC for 10 min. Reactions were initiated by addition of 5 ml of 56 substrate mix (1.0 mM GTP, 0.2 mCi/ml of [a-32P]GTP, 1.0 mM ATP), and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30uC. Reactions were terminated by addition of 500 ml of ice-cold 120 mM Zn(OAc)2, neutralized with 500 ml of Na2CO3, kept at 280uC for 15 min and centrifuged at 14,000 g, 4uC for 20 min. Radiolabeled cGMP in the supernatants was separated from radiolabeled GTP by  alumina column chromatography as described [59]. Protein  concentration in retinal homogenates was determined by Brad-  ford. Results are the average and standard deviation of four  independent experiments performed in duplicate, with mice that  were between p20 and p30. Guanylate cyclase activity was also  determined in all retinal homogenates after the addition of 3 mM recombinant GCAP2 as a control for the presence of active Ret-  GCs.

Sections  were incubated with blocking solution (3% normal goat serum, 1%  BSA, 0.3% Triton X100 in PBS pH 7.4, 1 h at room tempera-  ture); primary antibody (14 h at 4uC), secondary antibody (1 h at room temperature), and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde  prior to being mounted with Mowiol [Calbiochem, Billerica, MA].  An antigen retrieval treatment of retinal sections [incubation in  0.05 mg/ml proteinase K in PBS pH 7.4 for 2 min at room  temperature followed by a heat shock at 70uC for 10 sec] was needed for GCAP2 immunostaining. Antibodies used were: a  polyclonal anti-GCAP2 (35), monoclonal anti-GCAP2 [mAb2235,  Millipore, Billerica, MA], rabbit monoclonal anti-14-3-3e [EPR3918, abcam, Cambridge, UK]. Secondary antibodies for  immunofluorescence were Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and  Alexa 555 goat anti-mouse IgG [Molecular Probes, Eugene,  Oregon]. Images were acquired at a laser scanning confocal  microscope (Leica TCS-SL and TCS-SP2).  GCAP2 immunoprecipitation and protein identification by LC-MS/MS  For GCAP2 immunoprecipitation in order to identify protein  interacting partners in the different phenotypes [GCAPs2/2  bGCAP2, GCAPs2/2 bEF 2  GCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 control  mice] forty retinas per phenotype were pooled and homogenized  in HEPES buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 5 mM KCl, 135 mM  NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaF,  1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton-X100 and protease inhib- itor cocktail Complete Mini (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)], and  clarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with anti-  GCAP2 monoclonal antibody-covalently crosslinked to magnetic  beads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) for  45 minutes at room temperature (anti-GCAP2 mAb2235, Milli-  pore, Billerica, MA). Following extensive washing, elution was  performed with 0.2M Glycine-HCl pH 2.5. Elution fractions were  neutralized and concentrated by ethanol precipitation, reduced  and alkylated with 45 mM DTT at 60uC followed by 100 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature, dehydrated and rehydrated  with sequencing grade trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate  for 12 h. For LC-MS/MS samples were resuspended in 0.1%  formic acid and injected into a series Proxeon LC nanoEASY  system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, West Palm Beach, Florida)  coupled to a LTQ-Velos Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, West  Palm Beach, Florida). The resulting mass spectral peak lists were  searched with the Sequest search engine (v.2.1.04, Matrix  Sciences, London, UK) against the merged BOVIN-MOUSE  UP SP r 2011-1.fasta sequence library. Immunoprecipitation  assays and LC-MS/MS analysis with the indicated mouse  phenotypes were performed in three independent experiments,  with similar results.  In vitro phosphorylation of GCAP2 and pull-down assays with mock- or phosphorylated-GCAP2  For in vitro phosphorylation of GCAP2 in the presence of radioactivity, 20 ml reaction mixtures contained 8.5 mg of purified recombinant wildtype bGCAP2 or bEF  2 GCAP2, purified PKGIa  (100 units, Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) and 3 mCi of 33P-cATP (Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) in phosphorylation reaction  buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM sodium  phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 6 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA and  10 mM ATP). For reactions in Ca2+ or EGTA conditions, the  0.1 mM EGTA in the reaction buffer was substituted to 5 mM  CaCl2 or 2 mM EGTA, respectively. cGMP was added to  500 mM (to obtain phosphorylated GCAP2 or P-GCAP2) or not added (mock- controls). After incubation for 2 h at 30uC and overnight at 4uC, each reaction mixture was diluted with Laemmli buffer and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a  nitrocellulose membrane, an autoradiograph of the 33  P phosphor-  ylation products was obtained by 15 min of exposure to a Kodak  X-ray film. The nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently  incubated with a pAb anti-GCAP2 and IRDye 800CW Goat  Anti-rabbit IgG for GCAP2 immunodetection.  To obtain phosphorylated bGCAP2 or bEF 2  GCAP2 for pull-  down assays in the absence of radioactivity, the same procedure  was used except that 25 mg of bGCAP2 or bEF2GCAP2 protein and 230 units of purified PKGIa were used per reaction tube. The product of each reaction tube was cross-linked to 2.5 mg of  magnetic beads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) and used  in pull-down assays with solubilized bovine retina. Each sample  was incubated with material corresponding to 1/8 of a bovine  retina, previously homogenized in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES,  135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM b- mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mM EGTA, 2 mM  EDTA, Complete Mini protease inhibitors, pH 7.4) and pre-  cleared by centrifugation. After 1 h incubation at room temper-  ature, beads were washed and bound proteins were eluted under  acidic conditions, equilibrated and ethanol precipitated. Samples  were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a  nitrocellulose membrane. For Western detection of GCAP2 and  14-3-3 the following antibodies were used: a polyclonal anti-  GCAP2 (35), a pAb to 14-3-3pan (JP18649, IBL International,  Hamburg, Germany), a mAb to 14-3-3e (EPR3918, abcam, Cambridge, UK), a IRDye 800CW Goat anti-rabbit IgG and a  IRDye 680CW Goat anti-mouse IgG (Tebu Bio, Offenbach,  Germany). Image was acquired at the Odyssey Imaging System  (LI-COR, Lincol, Nebraska USA).  In situ phosphorylation assays All mice for in situ phosphorylation assays were 30-36 days old.  Mice were dark-adapted for a minimum of 14 h prior to use.  Retinas were dissected under infrared light (two retinas per  phenotype per light condition) and incubated for 90 min in  600 ml of bicarbonate-buffered Locke's solution (112.5 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 2.4 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES,  0.02 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM  sodium succinate, 0.5 mM sodium glutamate, 0.1% vitamin and  amino acids supplement) containing 1 mCi/ml [ 32  Pi]H3PO4 (10 mCi/ml, Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) in the dark in a  5% CO2 incubator to allow incorporation of 32  P in the endogenous  ATP pool. Following incubation, retinas were washed with Locke's  solution and immediately homogenized in 200 ml of solubilization buffer [10 mM HEPES, 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF,  2 mM NaF, 4 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 1%  Triton X100, complete mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied  Sciences, Basel, Switzerland), pH 7.4] in the dark, or exposed to  bright white light for 5 min prior to homogenization. Samples were  clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 20 min at 4uC and supernatants were transferred to new tubes. From these samples,  10 ml aliquots were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE to obtain an autoradiograph of the input samples. Visualization of inputs  required 4 h of exposure with a Kodak X-ray film. The remaining  volume of samples (180 ml) were used to immunoprecipitate GCAP2 with an anti-GCAP2 monoclonal antibody (anti-GCAP2  mAb2235, Millipore, Billerica, MA) coupled to magnetic beads  (Dynabeads, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) as described  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 17 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    above. After acidic elution of bound fractions, samples were  neutralized and proteins precipitated with ethanol. Protein pellets  were resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocel-  lulose membrane. Visualization of phosphorylated proteins in the  bound fractions by autoradiography required 4 days of exposure  with a Kodak X-ray film. The membrane was subsequently  incubated with a polyclonal antibody anti-GCAP2 and IRDye  800CW Goat Anti-rabbit IgG; and a polyclonal antibody to 14-3-  3pan (JP18649 IBL International, Hamburg, Germany) and IRDye  680CW Goat Anti-mouse IgG, and scanned at an Odyssey Image  Acquisition system (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska USA).  Analysis of steady-state GCAP2 phosphorylation by isoelectrofocusing (IEF) gels  Retinas from mice of the indicated phenotypes were dissected  under infrared light, and each retina was solubilized in 150 ml of buffer (10 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM NaCl,  0.1 mM EDTA, 1% dodecyl-maltoside, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM  NaF) overnight at 4uC. Samples were centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 5 min, 15 ml of the supernatant was loaded onto an isoelectrofocusing gel (pH range 3-8) on a Pharmacia FBE 300  flat bed apparatus, and focused for 2 h at 23W. Proteins were  transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by capillary action and  incubated with GCAP2 pAb. Bands were visualized with the ECL  system (Pharmacia).  Transient transgenic expression of bS201G/EF2GCAP2 mutant in the retina by in vivo electroporation of plasmid DNA following its injection in the subretinal space  The expression vector for the mutant bS201G/EF 2  GCAP2 was  obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the expression vector  described above for bEF 2  GCAP2 based on the 4.4 kb version of  the mouse opsin promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis was  performed with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit  (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using primers:  bGCAP2_S201G_Fw: CTCAGCAGAGGCGGAAAGGTGC-  CATGTTC; bGCAP2_S201G_Rv: GAACATGGCACCTTTC-  CGCCTCTGCTGAG;  Mutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. Mice were electro-  porated at p0 according to reference [40] and processed at p28-  30. Briefly, 0.5 ml at a concentration of 6 mg/ml of DNA mix in PBS was injected into the subretinal space, by making use of a  Nanojet microinjector and micromanipulator (Drummond Scien-  tific, Broomall, PA). The DNA mix consisted of the expression  vector for the specific GCAP2 mutant (bGCAP2, bEF 2  GCAP2 or  bS201G/EF 2  GCAP2) in circular form and a tracer plasmid  (pL_UG that expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven  by the Ubiquitin C promoter, [60]) also in circular form, at a mass  ratio of 2:1. Electroporation was performed with a square-wave  electroporator (CUI21, Nepagene, Japan) by triggering 5 pulses of  80 V with a 50 ms duration and an interval time of 950 ms.  Electroporated pups were raised under standard cyclic light  conditions and sacrificed at p28-30 for immunofluorescence  analysis. Briefly, eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in  PBS at pH 7.4, embedded in acrylamide mix and frozen as  described [34]. Retinal cryosections were obtained at 22 mm thickness. An antigen retrieval protocol was performed preceding  the immunofluorescence studies: glass slides were incubated with  proteinase K in PBS pH 7.4 (0.05 mg/ml) for 2 min and heated at  70uC for 8 sec. Sections were incubated in blocking solution (1% BSA, 3% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X100, PBS pH 7.4);  primary antibody solution (1% BSA, 3% normal goat serum, PBS  pH 7.4 containing 0.01 mg/ml polyclonal antibody to GCAP2  and 0.00025 mg/ml mAb 1D4 to rhodopsin); and secondary  antibody solution (1% BSA, 3% normal goat serum, PBS pH 7.4  containing Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit IgG (signal converted to  red in figures); and Alexa Fluor 555 anti-mouse IgG (signal  converted to blue in figures). Images were acquired in a Leica  confocal microscope. GCAP2 and rhodopsin signal profiles were  obtained for the individual cells shown by tracing a line along the  inner segment compartment, and another line along the outer  segment compartment, and plotting the summation of the red and  the green signal along both lines from the collection of planes in a  z-stack that covers the whole volume of the cell, by using the Leica  confocal software (Leica Microsystems).  Analysis of the effect of 30 days of constant light exposure versus 30 days of dark rearing on GCAP2 subcellular distribution in wildtype mice  Three-month old C57Bl/6J mice were kept in a ventilated dark  cabinet for 30 d, or kept under constant light exposure for the  same time (fluorescent light, 700 lux intensity inside the cage), and  their eyecups were processed for immunofluorescence analysis.  Retinal cryosections were stained with an anti-GCAP2 pAb and  anti-rhodopsin mAb 1D4, by indirect immunofluorescence stain-  ing with Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 555 goat anti-  mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Z-axis stacks  were obtained from four mice per condition at a Leica TCS-SL  confocal microscope, and the percentage of GCAP2 signal  colocalizing with the rhodopsin signal at the rod outer segment  was quantified by ImageJ in three representative planes from each  stack, one stack per mouse, four mice per condition. Precisely, for  a 636-objective frame of retina, an ROI was defined to include the inner and outer segment layers, while another ROI was  delimited to the outer segment layer based on rhodopsin staining.  GCAP2 signal was quantified in each ROI, and the percentage of  GCAP2 colocalizing with rhodopsin was expressed as a function of  GCAP2 at the inner and outer segment layers (ImageJ). Mean  values were obtained and statistical analysis performed with  GraphPad Prism 6.  Electroretinogram Electroretinogram responses to flash stimuli were recorded on a  Nicolet Electrovisual Diagnostic System. Mice were dark-adapted  for 12 h and then anesthetized under dim red light by  intraperitoneal administration of Ketamine HCl (100 mg/kg)  and Xylazine HCl (10 mg/kg). Phenylephrine HCl (2.5%) and  Tropicamide (0.5%) were applied to the cornea to dilate the  pupils, and mice were dark-adapted again for 10 min previous to  the recording. Following administration of Tetracaine HCl (0.5%)  eyedrops as a topical corneal anesthetic, the mice are placed on a  heated pad at 37uC in a Faraday cage. The corneal electrode consisted of a carbon-fiber moistened in saline. A 1 ms light flash  was delivered through a fiber optic centered vertically over a few  millimeter of the corneal surface. Mice from the different  genotypes were recorded over the course of eight months under  identical conditions.  Effect of constant light-rearing versus constant dark- rearing on retinal morphology of GCAPs2/2 bEF2GCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 control mice  Evaluation of the rate of retinal degeneration by retinal  morphometry analysis. The indicated mice were either  reared in constant darkness or under constant light exposure  (fluorescent light, 1500 lux intensity) and processed for analysis at  postnatal day 20 or 40. Eyecups were marked for orientation,  Toxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca 2+  -Free Form  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 18 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480    embedded in epoxy resin and section at 1 mm thickness as described previously [34].  Measurements of ONL thickness were taken by making use of a  camera lucida attached to a microscope, with the aid of a graphics  tablet (WACOM, Vancouver, WA) and the Axiovision LE Rel.4.1.  imaging software (Carl Zeiss Inc., Germany). A stage micrometer  (Klarmann Rulings, Litchfield, NH) was used for calibration. Each  retina half (superior and inferior) was divided into ten equal  segments from the optic nerve to the tip (excluding a radius of  100 mm from the optic nerve, due to the natural thinning of the ONL at this region). Three independent measurements were taken  per segment, and the average value was obtained. In this manner  60 independent measurements were obtained per section (20  segments63 measurements/segment). The mice analyzed per genotype were: GCAPs2/2 bEF  2 GCAP2 line A, n = 4 for each  dark and light conditions; GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line E, n = 3 for  each dark and light conditions; and GCAPs 2/2 control line,  n = 2 for each condition.  Supporting Information  Figure S1 Determination of bEF 2  GCAP2 transgenic expression  levels in lines A and B. A. The level of expression of bEF 2  GCAP2  in line A was determined by direct comparison with that of  bGCAP2 in line E, by loading in the same gel two-fold serial  dilutions of a retinal homogenate representing 1/40 of a retina.  Expression of bEF 2  GCAP2 was determined to be 1.38-fold higher  (60.06 St Dev) than that of bGCAP2 in control line E. Because  line E was previously established to express 2-fold the endogenous  levels of GCAP2 [11], line A is determined to express 2,76-fold the  endogenous levels of GCAP2. B. Likewise, by comparison to line A, line B was determined to express 1.4-fold more transgene, or  3.86-fold the endogenous GCAP2 levels.  (TIF)  Figure S2 Timecourse for the loss of visual function in  bEF 2  GCAP2 expressing mice as assessed by electroretinogram.  ERG B-wave amplitudes (mV) are plotted to postnatal age of mice (months). Representative ERG responses are shown for each  phenotype at 4 and 7.5 months of age.  (TIF)  Figure S3 Light-rearing does not prevent or delay retinal  degeneration in bEF 2  GCAP2 transgenic mice. Rationale. If  bEF 2  GCAP2 expression led to unabated cGMP synthesis in vivo and accumulation of cGMP was the basis of the pathology, then  conditions of constant light exposure would slow the retinal  degeneration by causing the sustained activation of PDE6 activity  and cGMP hydrolysis. Light induced sustained cGMP hydrolysis  would counteract unabated cGMP synthesis. A. Statistical compar- ison of ONL thickness at fixed regions along the central retina  between bEF 2  GCAP2 transgenic mice reared in complete darkness  or under constant light exposure (1,500 lux fluorescent light) at  postnatal day 40. Measurements of ONL thickness (mm) were taken at ten equal intervals along the superior and inferior hemispheres of  the retina, indicated in abscissas as positive values (superior retina)  and negative values (inferior retina) from the optic nerve (position 0).  The superimposition of the red and black lines indicate that retinal  degeneration (shortening of ONL thickness along the retina) was  observed to the same extent in dark-reared or constant light-reared  bEF 2  GCAP2 mice. ONL thickness in GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line  E control mice are shown as a reference of normal retina values. B.
