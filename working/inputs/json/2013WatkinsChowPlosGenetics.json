    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

Ribosome construction requires assembly of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four different species of rRNA. As RPs co-assemble into one multi-subunit complex, mutation of the genes that encode RPs might be expected to give rise to phenocopies, in which the same phenotype is associated with loss-of-function of each individual gene. However, a more complex picture is emerging in which, in addition to a group of shared phenotypes, diverse RP gene-specific phenotypes are observed. Here we report the first two mouse mutations (Rps7  Mtu and Rps7  Zma ) of ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7), a gene that has been  implicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Rps7 disruption results in decreased body size, abnormal skeletal morphology, mid- ventral white spotting, and eye malformations. These phenotypes are reported in other murine RP mutants and, as demonstrated for some other RP mutations, are ameliorated by Trp53 deficiency. Interestingly, Rps7 mutants have additional overt malformations of the developing central nervous system and deficits in working memory, phenotypes that are not reported in murine or human RP gene mutants. Conversely, Rps7 mouse mutants show no anemia or hyperpigmentation, phenotypes associated with mutation of human RPS7 and other murine RPs, respectively. We provide two novel RP mouse models and expand the repertoire of potential phenotypes that should be examined in RP mutants to further explore the concept of RP gene-specific phenotypes.

Introduction  Ribosomes are responsible for constructing the myriad proteins  required for the function of each individual cell. Ribosomes  themselves, which consist of small (40S) and large (60S) subunits,  are assembled from about 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs)  along with four species of rRNA synthesized in the nucleolus [1,2].  RPs fall broadly into two categories; the RPL proteins that make  up the large ribosomal subunit, and the RPS proteins that  constitute the small subunit. Mutations in both RPL and RPS  genes have been implicated in a set of shared phenotypic  characteristics in invertebrates. This is best illustrated by the  approximately 50 Drosophila melanogaster Minute mutants, a collec-  tion of ribosomal gene mutations that are characterized by  developmental delay, short thin bristles, growth retardation,  reduced fertility and recessive lethality [3].  In vertebrates, a phenotypic overlap among RP mutants occurs  similar to that seen in Drosophila Minute mutants, however  additional phenotypic complexity is emerging, in which mutation  or suppression of RPs results in some phenotypes that depend  upon which gene is mutated. This is highlighted by a recent study  in which 20 different RP genes were targeted using morpholino  antisense oligos in the zebrafish Danio rerio [4]. Whereas some  phenotypes were shared among knockdowns, such as hypoplasia of  the yolk sac, others were gene-specific. For instance, knockdown of  rps15 resulted in an enlarged 4 th  ventricle of the brain, whereas  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094    knockdown of rpl35a caused a sharply bent tail, and targeting of  rps29 produced an enlarged lens [4]. A similar picture of  phenotypic overlap paired with gene-specific phenotypes is  emerging in mice. For example, mutations in Rps19 and Rps20  result in increased epithelial pigmentation, a ventral belly spot,  small body size, and a reduction in red blood cell count [5]. Mice  with mutations in Rpl24 also have ventral belly spots and body size  reduction, but they present with additional retinal abnormalities  and skeletal defects [6]. Mice harboring the Rpl27a sooty foot allele  share an epidermal hyperpigmentation phenotype with Rps19 and  Rps20 mutants, but display the additional feature of cerebellar  ataxia [7]. These distinct features of individual RP mutant  phenotypes suggest that vertebrate RPs may have unique, tissue-  specific functions and/or tissue-specific expression levels. Indeed,  the broad spectrum of distinct phenotypes that have been  characterized in a relatively small number of mammalian RP  mutants also hints at possible extra-ribosomal functions of RPs.  In humans, mutations in RPs have been implicated in  hematopoetic disorders, most notably Diamond-Blackfan anemia  (DBA), which has been attributed to mutations in RPS19, RPS26,  RPS24, RPS17, RPS10, RPS7, RPL35a, RPL26, RPL11, and RPL5  [8-14]. While anemia is a shared phenotype among all patients  carrying these various gene mutations, some specific attributes are  associated with individual genes. For example, mutations in RPL5  are associated with cleft palate and anomalies of the thumb and  heart, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominant in  patients carrying mutations in RPL11 [11].  In this paper, we further examine the role of ribosomes in  mammalian development by investigating Rps7. Through analysis  of two new ENU-induced mouse mutants of Rps7, montu (Mtu)  and zuma (Zma), we show that mutation of Rps7 impairs ribosomal  biogenesis, resulting in variable lethality and reduced body size  accompanied by abnormal skeletal, melanocyte, eye, and central  nervous system (CNS) development. While many of these  phenotypes have previously been associated with mutation of  murine RP genes, the findings of overt brain malformations and  behavioral abnormalities are novel. Similar to mutation of other  RP genes in the mouse, the penetrance of the Rps7-associated  phenotypes is affected by genetic background and the overt  phenotypes are suppressed by TRP53 deficiency. These mutants  provide the first mouse models of Rps7 disruption and increase our  understanding of the phenotypic consequences of mammalian RP  mutations.  Results  Identification and genetic mapping of montu and zuma The montu (Mtu) mouse was identified in a large-scale ENU  mutagenesis program [15,16] exhibiting dominant inheritance of a  ventral belly spot, kinked tail, and reduced body weight (Figure 1A,  1B). Linkage analysis was performed using a cross of the Mtu  founder (BALB/c OlaHsd background) with C3H/HeH. Analysis  of genotypes of 104 offspring demonstrated linkage to a 74 Mb  region of proximal chromosome 12 that was further refined to a  3.43 Mb critical region (Figure S1A, S1C). DNA sequencing of  exons and flanking regions of 17 candidate genes using genomic  DNA from four affected animals and controls identified a single  heterozygous sequence variant occurring only in affected mice  within exon 6 of Rps7, which encodes a 194 amino acid ribosomal  protein, RPS7 (or S7e, the eukaryotic specific homolog of the yeast  S7A and S7B). The identified Rps7 variant, c.574T.G  (NM_011300), encodes a Gly substitution of a highly conserved  Val residue (p.V156G; NP_035430) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A).  Subsequent sequence analysis of 91 animals from a C3H/HeH  congenic Mtu colony showed 100% concordance between the  c.574T.G mutation and the affected phenotypes. Analysis of Mtu  animals demonstrated variable penetrance on a mixed back-  ground, however 100% penetrance of the tail kink, belly spot, and  small body size phenotypes when assessed in the C3H/HeH  congenic colony. We also observed a dominant lethality phenotype  with incomplete penetrance, 72% viability in F1 BALB/c:C3H  mice (N = 251) and 26% viability in the C3H/HeH congenic  colony (N = 260).  The zuma (Zma) mouse was independently identified as part of a  sensitized ENU screen designed to identify mutations that  increased the severity of neural crest defects observed in Sox10  haploinsufficient mice (Sox10 LacZ/+  ), a well characterized neural  crest mutant which presents with a high frequency of small, white  belly spots [17]. Affected backcross mice (BALB/cJ6C57BL/6J) from the Zma pedigree exhibited large white belly spots, tail kinks,  and reduced body size. Linkage analysis of twelve affected N1  mice initially detected linkage of Zma to a region of chromosome  12 overlapping where the Mtu mutation was localized (Figure S1B,  S1C). Subsequent sequencing of Rps7 in Zma mice revealed a  heterozygous A to C point mutation in exon 7 of Rps7, predicted  to cause substitution of a conserved amino acid (p.Y177S;  c.637A.C) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A). Genotyping analysis of  Zma mice outcrossed to C57BL/6J to establish a congenic colony  showed that the c.637A.C mutation was observed in 100% of  affected mice. We initially observed incompletely penetrant  phenotypes in N2 heterozygous Zma mice on a mixed BALB/cJ;  C57Bl/6J background, where Zma/+ mice showed 74% viability, 76% belly spots, and 90% tail kinks (N = 46). However,  heterozygosity for the Zma allele rapidly changed to a completely  penetrant, lethal phenotype during outcrossing onto C57BL/6J,  and no Zma/+ mice were observed at N4. This contrasted with the phenotype we observed during establishment of a congenic C3H/  HeJ Zma colony; on this genetic background, the N3 generation  exhibited a low frequency of belly spotting and tail kinks (4% and  0%, respectively; N = 41) yet no lethality, as Zma heterozygotes  Author Summary  Ribosomes are composed of two subunits that each consist of a large number of proteins, and their function of translating mRNA into protein is essential for cell viability. Naturally occurring or genetically engineered mutations within an individual ribosomal protein provide a valuable resource, since the resulting abnormal phenotypes reveal the function of each ribosomal protein. A number of mutations recently identified in mammalian ribosomal subunit genes have confirmed that homozygous loss of function consistently results in lethality; however, haploin- sufficiency causes a variety of tissue-specific phenotypes. In this paper, we describe the first mutant alleles of the gene encoding ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7) in mouse. Rps7 haploinsufficiency causes decreased size, abnormal skele- tal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eye malformations, phenotypes that also occur with haploin- sufficiency for other ribosomal subunits. Additionally, significant apoptosis occurs within the developing central nervous system (CNS) along with subtle behavioral phenotypes, suggesting RPS7 is required for CNS devel- opment. Mutation of human RPS7 has been implicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), yet the murine alleles do not present an analogous phenotype. The phenotypes we observe in the Rps7 mouse mutants indicate RPS7 should be considered as a candidate for a broader spectrum of human diseases.  Rps7 Mouse Mutants  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094    were observed at the expected frequency through N6. The  comparably mild phenotype we observed in the congenic C3H/  HeJ Zma colony suggests that the Mtu allele may exert more severe  phenotypic effects than the Zma allele. This hypothesis is  supported by the observations that Mtu/+ mice presented with reduced viability, fully penetrant belly spots, tail kinks, and small  body size on a predominantly C3H/He genetic background, while  Zma/+ mice on a similar background were observed at the expected frequency and were generally indistinguishable in  phenotype from their+/+littermates. Sequencing of exons 6 and 7 of Rps7 in 9 inbred strains (A/J,  AKR/J, BALB/c, C57BL6/J, C3H/HeJ, CBA, DBA, LP/J, and  101) confirmed that the point mutations detected in Mtu and Zma  are not natural variants. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of  the mutations in Rps7 transcripts using Mtu/+ and Zma/+ cDNA for sequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. We also demonstrated  a lack of complementation between the Mtu and Zma Rps7 alleles by  performing an intercross of heterozygous mice from the two lines.  Genotyping of newborn offspring revealed that no animals carried  both the Mtu and Zma mutations (N = 27) (Figure S1D). The lack of  viable double heterozygotes was consistent with homozygote  lethality observed in each line, thus showing non-complementation  of the two alleles. Collectively, the similar phenotypes, sequencing  data, and genetic analyses provide strong evidence that the  mutations identified in Rps7 are responsible for the observed Mtu  and Zma phenotypes, hereafter referred to as Rps7 Mtu  and Rps7 Zma  .  Figure 1. Heterozygous mutation of Rps7 results in visible white spotting, small body size, and tail kinking. (A) Montu (Mtu) heterozygous mice exhibiting a white belly spot and kinked tail were identified in an ENU mutagenesis screen. An independent ENU screen identified zuma (Zma) mice with similar phenotypes (data not shown). (B) Heterozygote Mtu/+ male (blue) and female (green) mice have a significantly reduced body weight compared to wild-type male (gray) and female (red) littermates.

The consequences of the RPS7 Mtu  and RPS7 Zma  mutant proteins were first assessed using the  computational analyses PANTHER and SIFT. Results from the  PANTHER coding SNP analysis tool [18] suggested that both  mutations are likely to be deleterious (PANTHER subPSEC score  of 25.00 and 25.06 for RPS7 Mtu  and RPS7 Zma  , respectively).  Similarly, the Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT) algorithm  [19] predicted both alleles to affect protein function, however, the  high degree of conservation in the 72 database sequences at each  position resulted in a low confidence level for the prediction (SIFT  prediction score 0.00, median conservation 3.59 for both RPS7 Mtu  and RPS7 Zma  ). Collectively, the computational analysis was  consistent with the Rps7 Mtu  and Rps7 Zma  alleles both having  functional consequences.  The potential effects of p.V156G and p.Y177S on RPS7  secondary structure (Figure 1D, Figure S2) were also examined.  There is no three-dimensional protein structure currently available  for metazoan RPS7, therefore we used the available structures  from Tetrahymena thermophila (PDB ID 2XZM) and Saccharomyces  cerevisiae (PDB ID 3U5C), whose RPS7 ortholog sequences share  37% and 55% residue identity with mouse RPS7, respectively  [20,21]. RPS7 structural elements appear to be highly conserved  across species: the S. cerevisiae and T. thermophila proteins themselves  share only 34% amino acid identity, yet their solved three-  dimensional structures superimpose well, and are consistent with  secondary structural predictions of mouse RPS7 generated using  PSSpred (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/PSSpred) and  PROFsec [22] (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the S. cerevisiae and T.  thermophila sequences each contain a Tyr residue homologous to  mouse p.Y177 (Figure S2A), and a Val residue homologous to  mouse p.V156 is present in S. cerevisiae and substituted conserva-  tively with Ile in T. thermophila. The introduction of either p.V156G  or p.Y177S into the mouse sequence did not alter predictions of  the beta strand and alpha helix at the respective locations of the  substitutions (Figure S2B), suggesting that grossly altered second-  ary structure may not be responsible for the functional  consequences of RPS7 Mtu  or RPS7 Zma  .  We next used biochemical analyses to examine the effects of  p.V156G and p.Y177S on stability and subcellular localization of  the 22 kiloDalton (kDa) protein as well as ribosome assembly and  biogenesis. Previous studies have shown that nonsense mutations  in RPS19 can result in decreased protein levels, and missense  mutations can alter the capacity of RPS19 to localize to the  nucleolus [23]. C- and N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type,  RPS7 Mtu  and RPS7 Zma  proteins were transiently expressed in  human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Western blot analysis  revealed no differences in protein levels for any of the RPS7  mutant proteins (Figure 2A, Figure S3A). The remaining in vitro  studies were focused on the potentially more severe RPS7 Mtu  mutant protein. Analysis of the FLAG-tagged proteins revealed no  notable differences in subcellular localization of the RPS7 Mtu  protein (Figure 2B). To verify the capacity of RPS7 Mtu  to be  incorporated into the ribosome, cytoplasmic extracts from  transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated to  separate ribosomes and ribosomal subunits (in the pellet) from  free cytoplasmic proteins (in the supernatant). A similar fraction of  all transfected RPS7 proteins was observed in the ribosomal pellet  (Figure S3B) indicating that the mutation does not alter RPS7  assembly into the ribosome. To confirm this finding, cytoplasmic  extracts from Rps7 Mtu  /+ liver were analyzed by ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradients, and the ratio between the peaks of the  ribosomal subunits in the absorbance profile was determined. This  ratio can reveal defects in the synthesis of one of the two subunits,  such as the net increase of the 60S/40S ratio seen in cultured  human cells following depletion of single RPs [24,25]. However,  the observed 60S/40S ratio in Rps7 Mtu  /+ liver was similar to control (Figure S3C), indicating that RPS7  Mtu does not drastically  alter assembly of the ribosomal subunits.  We further assessed whether RPS7 Mtu  affects ribosomal  biogenesis by analyzing the pre-rRNA maturation pattern.  Alterations are visualized by the accumulation of specific rRNA  precursors: a defect in large subunit RPs affects cleavage of 28S  precursors, whereas a defect in small subunit RPs alters that of 18S  precursors. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from wild-type  and Rps7 Mtu  /+ tissue, using a probe for the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 of pre-rRNA that anneals to 18S rRNA precursors  [26,27], indicated that 18S rRNA pre-rRNA processing was  altered both in liver and brain from Rps7 Mtu  /+ mutant mice (Figure 2C). Quantitative measurement of the hybridization  signals showed a significant accumulation of the 30S precursor  in Rps7 Mtu  /+ (indicated by an increased 30S/21S ratio; Figure 2D), confirming altered rRNA precursor processing and demonstrating  that the RPS7 Mtu  mutation has functional consequences on  ribosomal biogenesis.  Characterization of the Rps7 phenotype Skeletal and eye malformation. X-ray examination of  adult Rps7 Zma  /+ mice showed that vertebral fusion is responsible for the tail kinks (Figure 3A, 3B). Similar results were observed for  Rps7 Mtu  /+ adult mice, indicating that in both mutants, defective somitogenesis occurs as a result of RPS7 alterations. Decreased  vertebrae numbers were also observed in both mutants; a  reduction in total vertebrae number in Rps7 Mtu  /+ (52-55 versus 55-57 in wild-type) and in caudal vertebrae number in Rps7  Zma/+  (16-19 versus 20-22 in wild-type). The decreased vertebrae  numbers indicate defective tail bud function associated with  defects in RPS7. Alcian blue and alizarin red staining of late  gestation Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ embryos (N = 3 for each genotype) revealed further Rps7  Zma /+-associated skeletal abnor-  malities, including general disorganization of vertebral processes  and arches in the cervical vertebrae (Figure 3C, 3D). The anterior  tuberculum was appropriately located on C6, however a very  small partial rib was observed on C7 (in 2 Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos), indicating an incompletely penetrant transformation of C7 to T1.  Within the thoracic region, we observed a shortened first  sternebrae and asymmetric attachment of 8 ribs to the sternum  rather than the usual 7 (in all 3 Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos) (Figure 3E, 3F). Within the lumbar and sacral regions, a severe developmental  delay was observed, and disorganization of the ossification centers  was evident with some ossification centers being duplicated  (Figure 3G, 3H). Additionally, we observed a transformation of  L1 to T13 (in all 3 Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos) and also asymmetric fusion of the transverse processes of the first 5-6 sacral vertebrae (in 2  Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos) rather than the 3-4 observed in Rps7+/+ (Figure 3H). Collectively the skeletal phenotypes observed in Rps7  mutants are consistent with an anterior transformation of the axial  skeleton.  Frequent microphthalmia and uveal coloboma were also  observed as features of the Rps7 mutant phenotype (Figure 4).  Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos showed eye malformations ranging from minor delay in optic fissure closure to severe microphthalmia and  internalization of the entire eye structure. Whole mount micro-  scopic imaging of E12.5 embryos revealed that 100% of Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos exhibited a unilateral or bilateral delay in closure of the  optic fissure, as compared to Rps7+/+ embryos which all showed  Rps7 Mouse Mutants  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094    normal optic fissures (N = 5 Rps7 Zma  /+, N = 7 Rps7+/+) (Figure 4A-4C). By E14.5, a time when wild-type embryos have  complete fissure, 100% of Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos still displayed optic fissure closure defects either unilaterally (N = 2) or bilaterally  (N = 3) (Figure 4D-4F). Additionally, more severe microphthal-  mia and internalization of the eye was observed in 20% of  Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos (Figure 4F, 4I; 1 out of 5 at both E12.5 and E14.5).  Circulating blood chemistry and erythroid  differentiation. Because human RPS7 mutations are associated  with DBA [11], a disease characterized by red cell aplasia, we  undertook an initial characterization of circulating blood in adult  Rps7 Mtu  /+ mice (on a C3H/He background) and Rps7Zma/+ mice (on a mixed C57BL/6J; BALB/cJ background). Neither Rps7  mutant allele caused any significant differences from Rps7+/+ littermates in total hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) counts, white  blood cell (WBC) counts, or hematocrit (Figure 5A, 5B, Table S1).  Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was slightly elevated in Rps7 Mtu  /  + mice (elevated 1.026 fold over wild-type, p,0.05) (Figure 5A), however no significant difference in MCV was observed in  Rps7 Zma  /+ mice (Figure 5B). Additional analyses of plasma biochemistry revealed no significant differences between  Rps7 Mtu  /+ and Rps7+/+ animals in major electrolytes and metabolic indicators (Na  + , K  + , Cl  2 , urea, creatinine, ALP, AST,  ALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, amylase, and free fatty  acids) (Table S2).  To further assess erythroid development of Rps7 Zma  /+ mice, which exhibit perinatal lethality on a C57BL/6J background,  E13.5 Rps7 Zma  /+ fetal liver samples were characterized by flow cytometry. We simultaneously used monoclonal antibodies against  the erythroid cell lineage markers CD71, expressed at higher levels  during early stages of erythroid differentiation, and Ter119,  expressed at higher levels as erythrocytes mature, to profile 5  characteristic populations of erythroid precursors (R1 to R5)  [28,29] (Figure 5C). These cell populations correspond to  increasingly differentiated developmental stages, with R1 marking  erythroid progenitors and proerythroblasts, R2 marking proeryth-  roblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts, R3 marking all  basophilic erythroblasts, R4 marking chromatophilic and ortho-  chromatophilic erythroblasts, and R5 marking late orthochroma-  tophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Compared to their Rps7+/ + littermates, Rps7Zma/+ E13.5 embryos showed a significant increase in the percentage of R3 cells (p,0.001) suggesting that  erythroid precursors could be blocked in their maturation  (Figure 5D). However, analysis of erythroid cell populations of  E14.5 fetal livers showed that the percentages of cells in the R2-  R5 populations were indistinguishable between Rps7+/+ and Rps7  Zma /+ genotypes (Table S3). The presence of the more mature  R4 and R5 cells at E14.5 indicates erythroid differentiation  progresses, rather than being blocked at R3. Alternatively, the  increase in R3 cells at E13.5 may result from a general  developmental delay in Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos. This was confirmed by inspection of gross anatomical features of crown-rump length,  along with eye, limb, and craniofacial development at E11.5-13.5,  which showed that Rps7 Zma  /+ embryonic development is delayed by approximately one day relative to that of Rps7+/+ littermates (Figure S4). While we cannot rule out subtle alterations in  erythroid maturation that may cause the differences observed in  the precursor populations, these analyses collectively suggest that  these two mutant alleles of Rps7 do not significantly impair red  blood cell production or differentiation.  Early effect on melanoblast development. To assess the  effects of RPS7 mutation on melanocyte development, we  characterized Rps7 Zma  /+ mutant embryos from E10.5 to 14.5.  Figure 2.

In these Rps7  Zma /+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) embryos, Dct-positive  melanoblasts were notably reduced by E10.5 relative to Rps7+/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6A, 6B). At E14.5, a significant  reduction in melanoblast number was still observed in both the  head and trunk of Rps7 Zma  /+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice compared to Rps7+/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6C-6F). Mutation of Rps7 did not cause a complete loss of melanoblasts, however, as  Dct-positive cells could still be observed at E14.5 in regions where  melanoblast density is normally highest, particularly around the  developing pinna and eye (Figure 6C, 6D). This severe melano-  blast reduction in Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos was independently con- firmed by in situ hybridization with a probe targeting mRNA for  the melanoblast/melanosome-specific protein Pmel17 (Figure S5).  Qualitative observation of Pmel17-expressing melanoblasts showed  that E12.5 Rps7 Zma  /+ mutant embryos displayed a marked reduction in melanoblasts relative to E12.5 Rps7+/+ littermates. The reduction in melanoblasts is more severe than can be  attributed to the developmental delay observed in Rps7 Zma  /+ mutants, as E12.5 Rps7  Zma /+ embryos showed a reduced  melanoblast number even in comparison to E11.5 Rps7+/+ embryos (Figure S5). A combination of Rps7 and Sox10  haploinsufficiency (Rps7 Zma  /+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes) further reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (Figure S6),  consistent with the increased spotting observed in rare Rps7 Zma  /  +; Sox10LacZ/+ pups that survived postnatally (Figure S7A, S7B). Postnatally, we observed that melanocytes were present in the  tail skin of Rps7 Zma  /+ mice (Figure S7E, S7F), yet no dark skin phenotype occurred in the tails or footpads of adult Rps7  Zma /+ or  Rps7 Mtu  /+mice (Figure S7C-S7F). This indicates that these Rps7 mutations do not cause epidermal melanocytosis, as was previously  observed for mutation of Rps19 and Rps20 [5]. Collectively, these  data show that mutation of Rps7 causes a severe, early reduction in  melanoblasts that is sufficient to account for the white belly  spotting observed in viable heterozygotes.  Enlarged ventricles, cortical thinning, and deficits in  working memory. We examined the neuroanatomical features  of the Rps7 mutants, employing histological techniques and  magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM). Gross observations and  histological staining revealed marked cortical thinning accompa-  nied by enlarged ventricles in adult Rps7 Mtu  /+ (Figure 7A-7B) and perinatal Rps7  Zma /+ mice (Figure 7C, and data not shown). To  investigate this phenotype further, we undertook MRM imaging of  Rps7 Zma  /+ mice at E18.5 (N = 3) (Figure 7D-7I). Following manual segmentation of 10 major anatomic structures, the volume  of each brain region was calculated as a percentage of the total  brain volume (Figure 7J) and 3-dimensional (3D) rendering with  smoothing was performed to generate 3D representations (Video  S1 and Video S2). This quantitative analysis showed that the  Rps7 Zma  /+ CNS phenotypes originate during development and confirmed a significant reduction in cortical (P = 0.0002) and  hippocampal (P = 0.0044) size in Rps7 Zma  /+ mutants. Although lateral ventricle volume was not significantly different between  these small groups, qualitative observations of ventricle size at  dissection, in MRM images, and in histological sections consis-  tently indicated Rps7 Zma  /+ mutants had enlarged ventricles, leading us to conclude that enlarged ventricles are a consistent  feature of the Rps7 phenotype.  We investigated whether these gross neuroanatomical pheno-  types affected the behavior of the Rps7 Mtu  /+ mice, assessing locomotor activity, anxiety and working memory. The results  showed that while Rps7 Mtu  /+ mutants exhibited normal locomotor activity and anxiety-related phenotypes, they displayed deficits in  Figure 3. Skeletal abnormalities in Rps7 mutants.

Rps7 Mtu  /+ mutants displayed similar behavior to Rps7+/+ controls in an open-field test, with no significant differences in total distance travelled in the open field or time  spent in the center (Figure S8A). Similarly, there were no  significant differences between Rps7+/+ controls and Rps7Mtu/ +littermates when assessed on the elevated plus-maze (Figure S8B- S8E), nor did Rps7  Mtu /+ mutant animals display any ataxia that  would be indicative of motor dysfunction. We also investigated  whether Rps7 Mtu  /+ mice displayed any defects in working memory using a spontaneous alternation test, which can indicate hippo-  campal dysfunction [31]. The mouse is placed in the start arm of  an enclosed T-maze (the base of the \u2018\u2018T''), and allowed to enter a  goal arm (the two arms of the top of the \u2018\u2018T'') of its own choice.  Upon repeating this test, the mouse can demonstrate memory of  its previous choice by entering the arm not visited before, a  behavior called spontaneous alternation. Here we observed a  significant difference between Rps7+/+ controls, which exhibited an average alternation frequency of 83%, and Rps7  Mtu /+ mutants,  which exhibited an average alternation frequency of only 68%  (N = 9, P = 0.01) (Figure 7K). Collectively, the MRM and  behavioral data indicate that Rps7 is required for normal  development of the central nervous system, particularly the  telencephalon, and that mutations in this gene have the capacity  to affect hippocampal-dependent behavior.  Increased neuronal apoptosis in Rps7 mutants. Our  histological studies also revealed that late gestation Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos exhibited pyknotic nuclei in the white matter tracts of the  spinal cord (Figure S9), consistent with CNS degeneration. As  mutations in other RPs have been associated with increased  cellular apoptosis [32-37], we used immunohistochemistry to  detect cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) within the CNS. When compared  to normal littermates, Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos showed increased apoptosis in the cortex and neural tube at both E11.5  (Figure 8A, 8B, 8D, 8E) and E12.5 (data not shown). Although  mitotic, phospho-histone H3-positive (PH3+) cells surrounding the lumen of the neural tube appeared slightly disorganized in E11.5  and E12.5 Rps7 Zma  /+embryos (Figure 8G, 8H and data not shown), cell counting revealed no significant difference in PH3+ cell number per section compared to Rps7+/+ littermates (Figure 8J). In contrast, CC3 counts confirmed a significant  increase in apoptosis in the neural tube of E11.5 Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos compared to Rps7+/+ (N = 3, p,0.001) (Figure 8K). Consistent with the location of apoptosis and with a putative role  for RPS7 in CNS development, in situ hybridization studies on  Figure 4. Eye dysmorphology in Rps7 mutants.

In addition, H&E stained sagittal sections through the eye are shown for one Rps7+/+ and two different Rps7Zma/+ embryos at E18.5 (G-I). The eye dysmorphology of Rps7Zma/+mutants ranges in severity from minor unilateral or bilateral uveal coloboma (E, H) to severe microphthalmia resulting in disorganized eye structures (C, F, I).

As TRP53 levels are altered in other ribosomal mutants, we also  investigated the expression of TRP53 in the developing CNS of  Rps7 mutants. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed an  increase in TRP53 staining in the cortex (E11.5) and neural tube  (E11.5 and E12.5) of Rps7 mutants consistent with increased  TRP53-mediated apoptosis (Figure S11). Collectively, the histol-  ogy and immunohistochemistry data confirm that massive cell  death in the Rps7 mutant CNS occurs at the onset of neurogenesis.  Phenotypic suppression of Rps7 mutant phenotypes  byTrp53 haploinsufficiency. In an attempt to restore hetero-  zygote viability by suppressing apoptosis, we crossed the Rps7 Zma  mutation onto a Trp53 mutant background. Trp53 mutations have  been used to successfully suppress phenotypes in other RP mutants  [5,35]. Rps7 Zma  mice were originally identified on a mixed genetic  background, and heterozygote lethality in Rps7 Zma  /+ mice increased as the mutation was outcrossed onto a C57BL/6J  background. Thus we used early generation, mixed background  Rps7 Zma  /+ mice to establish a cross with Trp53 mutant mice on a C57Bl/6J background (B6.129S2-Trp53  tm1Tyj/J , hereafter  Trp53 KO  ). Within a few generations of outcrossing, no viable  Rps7 Zma  /+ mice were observed after birth, as expected. However, Rps7  Zma /+; Trp53 KO/+ double heterozygotes were recovered at  the expected 50% frequency, suggesting restoration of Rps7 Zma  /+ viability in the context of Trp53 haploinsufficiency (Table S4). In  Figure 5. Peripheral-blood parameters appear normal with slight developmental delay in Rps7Zma/+ fetal liver red cell precursors. (A) Rps7Mtu/+ mice displayed similar complete blood count (CBC) values to their wild-type littermates with the exception of a very slightly elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (* indicates p,0.05; N = 7).

In most cases Rps7Zma/+;  Trp53 KO  /+ double heterozygotes were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates after weaning, with the exception of a very  small belly spot observed in 47% of Rps7 Zma  /+; Trp53KO/+ mice. Trp53 haploinsufficiency also suppressed the phenotypes of gross  embryonic developmental delay (Figure S4), the subtle delay in  erythroid maturation (Table S3), and CNS apoptosis (Figure 8C, 8F,  8K). In summary, the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in Rps7 Zma  /+ mice all appeared to be suppressed by Trp53 haploinsufficiency.  Discussion  In this paper we present genetic, functional, and phenotypic  evidence that the montu (Mtu) and zuma (Zma) mouse lines isolated  from independent ENU screens harbor distinct point mutations in  Rps7. These first-reported alleles of Rps7 in mice cause similar  phenotypes including small body size, tail abnormalities, mid-  ventral white spotting, eye defects, and an underdeveloped  cerebral cortex.  We provide functional evidence that the Rps7 Mtu  mutation  (p.V156G) affects ribosome biogenesis. The altered Rps7 Mtu  30S/  21S ratio is consistent with the altered pre-rRNA maturation  reported for a DBA patient harboring an RPS7 donor splice-site  mutation (c.147+1G.A) that results in accumulation of 30S and 45S precursors [11]. A requirement for RPS7 during rRNA  maturation is supported by other studies showing a role for human  RPS7 in early stages of 45S rRNA processing [24] or the nuclear  stages of 40S maturation [38]. In yeast, depletion of the two RPS7  paralogs (S7a and S7b) results in a severe growth defect [39,40]  and S7 has been hypothesized to play an early role as a component  of the small subunit processome [41] as well as a later role in  ribosome biogenesis during assembly of polysomes [42]. However,  the mechanism underlying the altered rRNA maturation in these  murine Rps7 mutants is not clear, as neither the Rps7 Mtu  nor the  Rps7 Zma  mutation is predicted to grossly disrupt protein secondary  structure, and RPS7 Mtu  protein is correctly localized and  incorporated into ribosomes in cultured cells. Presumably, the  mutant RPS7 proteins could be altered in their interactions with  rRNA, other ribosomal proteins, or non-ribosomal proteins. The  possibility of interaction with non-ribosomal proteins is intriguing  given the position of RPS7 at the surface of the ribosome (Figure  S2C, S2D) in close proximity to the binding site for eIF4G [21], a  eukaryotic initiation factor important for assembling the pre-  initiation complex. Interestingly, most other known, viable mouse  RP mutations also occur in eukaryotic-specific RPs located at the  surface of the ribosome. Additional work is needed to determine  the precise role RPS7 plays in mammalian ribosome biogenesis  and how the Rps7 Mtu  and Rps7 Zma  mutations disrupt this function.  While modeling the pre-rRNA processing defect of an RPS7  DBA patient, these Rps7 mutant mice do not replicate the  characteristic DBA phenotype of severe anemia. This lack of an  anemia phenotype is not entirely unexpected, since the analysis of  many mouse mutants suggests that mice as a species are generally  less sensitive than humans to any gene haploinsufficiency [43,44].  This is exemplified by the fact that, despite frequent mutation of  Figure 6. Melanoblast numbers are reduced in Rps7Zma/+ mutants. (A, B) In transgenic embryos carrying the melanoblast reporter Tg(Dct- LacZ), whole mount staining showed that Dct-positive melanoblasts are significantly reduced at E10.5 in Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice (A) compared to Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (B). The reduction is noticeably apparent over the otic region (red circle). (C,D) Whole mount staining of E14.5 Rps7Zma/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) embryos showed that these embryos (D) also display a reduction in melanoblasts relative to Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (C). The microphthalmia observed in Rps7  Zma /+ mice is apparent in (D). (E, F) Consistent with the whole-mount observations, transverse vibratome  sections through the trunk of E14.5 embryos revealed very few melanoblasts in the developing skin of Rps7 Zma  /+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice (F) as compared to the numerous melanoblasts seen in Rps7+/+;Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (arrow, E). Blue punctate staining indicates positive signal in melanoblasts. In all pairs of images, Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ are at the same magnification.

It is possible that further studies of Rps7 alleles on different  genetic backgrounds or in mice with more severe alleles may  reveal additional red blood cell phenotypes. In the future,  comparison among mouse DBA models may provide insight into  why the murine and human hematological phenotypes do not fully  overlap, and may also reveal why mutation in RPS19 has a  uniquely high frequency in DBA compared to other RPs that  cause the disease.  Both Rps7 mutants display a variety of skeletal phenotypes that  collectively suggest that normal ribosome biogenesis is required for  three distinct stages of somite development, which governs  subsequent axial skeleton formation. First, the decreased number  of tail vertebrae indicates an insufficient production of somite  progenitors. Second, the mutant vertebral fusion leading to tail  kinks is indicative of incorrect somite border formation. Third, the  mutants exhibit an array of axial skeleton defects consistent with  Figure 8. Increased apoptosis occurs in the developing CNS of Rps7Zma/+ mutant embryos; however, this apoptosis is reduced in Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ embryos. (A-C) Increased apoptosis was observed in E11.5 Rps7Zma/+ (Z/+) coronal sections through the neocortex compared to Rps7+/+ (+/+) and Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ (Z/+;p53/+), as measured by cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) staining shown in green. (D-F) Apoptosis was also relatively increased in neural tube cross-sections of Rps7Zma/+ embryos at E11.5 (E). (G-I) Cellular disorganization was apparent in mitotic, phospho- histone H3-positive (PH3+) cells surrounding the lumen of the neural tube in E11.5 Rps7Zma/+ embryos (H).

Widespread disturbances of the skeletal system  encompassing each of these three defects are also found in Rpl38  (tail short, Ts) [46,47] and Rpl24 (belly spot and tail, Bst) mutants  [6,48]. Indeed, there are striking similarities in the defects  observed in Rpl38 and Rps7 mutants, including specific transfor-  mations within the cervical (C7 to T1), thoracic (T8 to T7), lumbar  (L1 to T13) and sacral (fusion of additional transverse processes)  regions. Mutations in Rpl38 and Rpl24 cause additional distur-  bances of the appendicular skeleton not observed in Rps7,  however, given the similarities of these mutants to Rps7 it will be  interesting to see if appendicular skeletal defects are observed with  different Rps7 alleles and/or genetic backgrounds. Interestingly,  severe skeletal malformations have not been reported for five other  murine RP mutants (Rps19, Rps20, Rpl22, Rpl27a, Rpl29)  [5,7,8,49,50]. This suggests that either mutation of RP proteins  do not universally affect skeletal development, or skeletal defects  remain to be identified in these other RP mutants. In the case of  Rps7, the severity of skeletal defects was modified by both genetic  background and by allele, suggesting that detailed characterization  in existing and additional RP mutants is necessary to further  explore the role of RP proteins in skeletal development.  We show that Rps7 Zma  -mediated white spotting results from a  severe developmental reduction in melanoblasts. A developmental  reduction in melanoblasts has also been reported in Rps19 and  Rps20 heterozygous mutants, however, these mutants subsequently  develop epidermal melanocytosis [5], a phenotype not seen in  either Rps7 mutant. This difference is unlikely to be due to genetic  background, as both Rps7 mutants and Rps19 and Rps20 mutants  were examined on a predominantly C3H background. Alterna-  tively, the difference could be a more severe developmental  reduction in melanoblast numbers in Rps7 mutants, resulting in  fewer melanoblasts available at later time points to generate  epidermal melanocytosis. Another possibility is that loss of Rps7  may not have the same effect in keratinocytes as loss of Rps6, Rps19  and Rps20, which are thought to act in keratinocytes to produce  TRP53-mediated dark skin [5]. Our in vitro experiments with Rps7  (Figure 2 and Figure S3) suggest that these mutations are  hypomorphic alleles, so a third possibility is that allele severity,  rather than gene-specific function, could account for pigmentation  phenotype differences among RP mutants.  The mouse Rps7 mutants display additional developmental  defects of reduced cortical and hippocampal size. We hypothesize  that cell death within the developing CNS is sufficient to account  for the neocortical thinning we observe in both Rps7 mutant lines.  We also hypothesize that apoptosis within the developing  telencephalon might account for the deficit in working memory  observed in Rps7 Mtu  /+ heterozygotes. To our knowledge, this is a novel developmental brain abnormality in mouse arising from RP  haploinsufficiency, differing substantially from the only other  report of neuronal defects in RP mutant mice, that of cerebellar  abnormalities and ataxia in Rpl27a sooty foot mutants [7].  Interestingly, the neuronal phenotypes in mouse Rps7 mutants  correlate with the report of microcephaly as one of 11 congenital  craniofacial anomalies that can be associated with DBA [51], and  are consistent with RP mutant phenotypes observed in different  model organisms. In zebrafish, gene-specific neuronal phenotypes  were seen in a subset of knocked-down RPs [4] and further studies  of RPL11 revealed brain deformities and reduced neuronal  progenitor cells along with apoptosis in the affected regions [32].  In the zebra finch, RPL17 and RPL37 both regulate the sexually  dimorphic formation of the song control regions of the brain  within the VZ [52]. Thus, the murine Rps7 mutant phenotypes  add to a growing body of literature linking individual RPs to  specific features of neural development and suggesting that other  RP mouse mutants may have previously uncharacterized defects in  brain development.  Important questions remain regarding what underlying cellular  mechanisms explain the similarities and differences among RP-  associated phenotypes. A growing body of literature suggests a  common mechanism where alterations in RP expression result in  activation of TRP53, suggesting ribosomal stress is one of the  many cellular anomalies detected by TRP53. For example, in their  study of RP-mediated dark skin, McGowan and colleagues show  that TRP53 acts as a sensor of ribosomal integrity, and that  mutations in Rps19 and Rps20 can be phenotypically suppressed by  Trp53 deficiency [5]. Trp53 haploinsufficiency also relieves the  abnormal phenotypes of mice heterozygous for the sooty foot  ataxia allele of Rpl27a [7] or the Bst allele of Rpl24 [6]. Similarly,  our results show that loss of Rps7 increases TRP53 levels and that  Trp53 haploinsufficiency suppresses all morphological aspects of  the Rps7 phenotype. Our in vivo studies are supported by recent  studies showing that Rps7 depletion in vitro as well as in vivo in  zebrafish induces TRP53 expression [53,54], and collectively  suggest the mechanism underlying the Rps7 phenotype is TRP53  activation followed by TRP53-mediated apoptosis.  While these data suggest that RP mutant phenotypes may all be  attributed to alterations in RP\u2014TRP53 interactions, the variabil-  ity among RP phenotypes suggests more complexity, potentially as  a result of RP gene-specific or cell-specific functions [55]. Tissue-  specific effects of mutations in different RPs have been observed in  zebrafish [4], mouse [5,6] and human [11]. These apparently  tissue-specific phenotypes could simply be due to incomplete  phenotypic characterization, differing severity of hypomorphic  alleles, and/or differing genetic backgrounds. However, if they  truly reflect tissue-specific RP functions, one explanation could be  differences in the relative expression levels of individual RPs, with  a consequent differential sensitivity to RP insufficiency that could  vary with tissue type, developmental stage or differentiation state.  Indeed, remarkable heterogeneity in RP mRNA levels has been  observed in a variety of tissues [56] including specifically during  mouse embryonic development [47] and human neuronal  differentiation [57].  A cell type-specific sensitivity to RP insufficiency is strongly  supported by the observation that keratinocyte-specific Rps6  hemizygosity causes hyperpigmentation while melanocyte-specific  Rps6 hemizygosity instead causes hypopigmentation [5]. Similarly,  the severe melanoblast reduction in Rps7 mutants could suggest a  melanocyte-specific sensitivity to RPS7 loss. Given that Sox10 and  Rps7 pathways interact in melanocytes in vivo (Figure S6, Figure  S7), it will be interesting to determine if a melanocyte-specific  transcriptional response to RPS7 deficiency is mediated by Sox10,  which is expressed in melanocytes but absent in keratinocytes.  TRP53 activation in melanocytes has already been associated with  downregulation of another white spotting gene, Kit, which is  proposed as a transcriptional target of TRP53 [7,58]. Further  work is needed in melanocytes and other cell types that display RP  gene-specific phenotypes, to clarify if direct transcriptional  regulation of lineage-specific genes plays a role in tissue-specific  sensitivity to individual RP deficiencies.  Another explanation of tissue-specific RP phenotypes could be a  function for individual RPs in the translation of specific mRNAs.  This is supported by studies of RPL13 [59] and by a recent study  reporting patterning defects in Rpl38 mutant mouse embryos due to  RPL38 translational regulation of a subset of Hox transcripts [47].  The tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7 mutants would be  consistent with a role for RPS7 in facilitating translational  regulation of transcripts critical for development of the affected  Rps7 Mouse Mutants  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094    tissues. Alternatively, tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7  mutants could be a consequence of a direct interaction between  RPS7 and tissue-specific developmental regulators at the protein  level. Interestingly, support for protein-protein interactions between  RPS7 and SOX10 comes from recent evidence that RPS7 interacts  directly with SRY, an HMG box protein related to SOX10 [60].  This mechanism of direct interaction between RPs and tissue-  specific, non-ribosomal proteins could explain tissue-specific phe-  notypes in RP mutants, and is supported by a number of studies  reporting extra-ribosomal functions of specific RPs in regulation of  ribosome biosynthesis and binding of transcription factor complexes  (reviewed in ref. [55]).  The relative contributions of these various mechanistic expla-  nations for tissue-specific and gene-specific RP mutant phenotypes  will be clarified with further detailed comparison of mutants on  consistent genetic backgrounds and with additional information  from tissue-specific conditional alleles. In summary, these novel  alleles of Rps7 add to the growing collection of mammalian  ribosomal mutants and provide two new mouse models of a DBA-  associated gene. Importantly, the unique CNS apoptosis and  behavioral phenotypes reported here suggest that RPs need to be  considered as candidate genes for not only DBA but also a broad  spectrum of neurodevelopmental human diseases.  Materials and Methods  Ethics statement All procedures performed in the UK were in accordance with  the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and those  performed in the United States were approved by the IACUC in  accordance with NIH guidelines.  Mice Montu mice were identified in a screen where BALB/c male mice  were mutagenized using ENU and crossed to C3H/He for  screening. Zuma mice were identified in an ENU screen sensitized  by Sox10 haploinsufficiency (Sox10 LacZ/+  ), where BALB/cJ mice  were mutagenized using ENU and crossed to C57Bl/6J mice for  further pedigree analysis. Trp53 null mice (B6.129S2-Trp53 tm1Tyj/J  ,  stock #002101) were purchased from JAX Mice. For behavioral studies, mice were housed in facilities with a 12:12 light:dark cycle at  a temperature of 2261uC with a 60-70% humidity. Upon weaning, mice were separated into single-sex littermate groups and food was  available ad libitum.  For body weight analysis, each gender/genotype group  represented in Figure 1B was weighed over 10 weeks (average  N = 9 for each Figure 1B data point, range N = 2-19). A Student's  t-test was used to compare wild-type to mutant within gender-  matched groups at each age. Significance was assessed using the  Bonferonni method to correct for multiple testing, with p,0.001  deemed significant. In females, all time points after 1 week were  significantly different and in males all time points after 2 weeks  were significantly different, with the exception of 8.5 weeks where  only 2 mutant mice were weighed (p,0.003).  Alizarin red and alcian blue staining of skeletons was conducted  using standard techniques. Briefly, embryos were skinned and  eviscerated, fixed 24 hours in ethanol, then fixed 24 hours in  acetone. Staining was performed for 3-4 hours at 37uC and then 3-4 days at room temperature. After staining, embryos were  rinsed in water and cleared in 1% KOH for 3 hours at room  temperature and moved to fresh 1% KOH overnight. After  clearing, embryos were serially transferred through 20%/1%  KOH, 50% glycerol/1% KOH, and 80% glycerol/1% KOH.  FACS analysis was completed using standard techniques.  Briefly, fetal liver samples were collected in ice cold PBS and  dispersed into a single cell suspension with passage through a 21  gauge needle. Samples were incubated for 20 minutes with the  addition of 10 ml of each antibody (BD Parmingen Ter119-APC and CD71-FITC), then washed once with PBS before FACS  analysis. At each age ANOVA analysis was performed with a post-  hoc test to compare selected pairs: (Rps7+/+ versus Rps7Zma/+) and (Rps7  Zma /+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+).  Genetic mapping and sequencing DNA was extracted from mice using standard techniques. For  Mtu, the mutation was mapped using 11 affected animals and 51  polymorphic MIT makers that were amplified by PCR and  visualized on a 4% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide.  Fine mapping was performed with 13 additional SNPs that  distinguished between BALB/c and 101. Seventeen known and  predicted genes were identified in the Mtu critical interval from the  Ensembl database (ENSMUSG00000020633, ENSMUSG00  000066544, ENSMUSG00000020636, ENSMUSG00000036655,  ENSMUSG00000061477, ENSMUSG00000020630, ENSMU-  SG00000020629, ENSMUSG00000020628, ENSMUSG0000  0036613, ENSMUSG00000061911, ENSMUSG00000020674,  ENSMUSG00000020673, ENSMUSG00000020672, ENSMU-  SG00000043061, ENSMUSG00000044573, ENSMUSG00000  020669, ENSMUSG00000036136). All exons and adjacent splice  sites for these 17 genes were sequenced using a BigDye dideoxy-  terminator system and analyzed on an ABI3700 sequencer  (Applied Biosystems). For Zma, DNA from 8 offspring was  analyzed using the Illumina GoldenGate assay medium density  linkage panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The addition of 24  microsatellite markers, from 4 regions with suggestive linkage (Chr  4, 6, 12, 17) in 8 additional affected mice, allowed localization to  chromosome 12 (D12Mit182 -D12Mit60). Rps7 was sequenced as  a candidate gene using the same methods as for Mtu.  Cellular studies and Western blots mRNA was extracted from wild-type and Rps7  Mtu /+ brains, and  cDNA was prepared using reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). A  high fidelity PCR polymerase (KOD, Novagen) was then  employed to amplify the Rps7 transcript encoding a fusion protein  tagged at either the C- or N-terminus with a FLAG epitope, prior  to cloning into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. Constructs were transfected into HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips, before  fixation and staining 48 hours later. The primary antibody  employed was a rabbit anti-FLAG (Abcam, ab21536, 1:1000),  followed by a fluorescent secondary (1:200, Molecular Probes).  Five independent transfections were performed. Images were  captured on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope.  For Western blot experiments, DNA constructs encoding wild-  type RPS7, RPS7 p.V156G, and RPS7 p.Y177S fused to the  FLAG epitope at the N- or C-terminus were used in transient  transfection experiments in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293  cells. Neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) expressed by the  cloning vector pcDNA3.1 was used as a control for transfection  efficiency. After transfection, proteins were separated on a 12%  SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose Protran membrane  (Schleicher and Schuell) and incubated with a rabbit anti-FLAG  or anti-neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT2) antibody for 1 hr.  Following three consecutive washes in PBS/Tween, the mem-  brane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat  anti-rabbit Ab (Jackson Immunoresearch) and visualized using a  chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) and a LAS3000 Image  Rps7 Mouse Mutants  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094    System (Fuji). Equal loading was checked by Ponceau-S red  staining of the membranes before Western blot analysis.  Ribosomal analysis For Northern blots for rRNA processing, RNA was extracted  from mouse tissues with Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the  manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was fractionated on formal-  dehyde-agarose gels and transferred to Gene Screen Plus  membrane (NEN). To detect rRNA precursor transcripts, ITS1  probe was prepared by 59 end-labeling of a 28-mer oligonucleotide  (GCTCCTCCACAGTCTCCCGTTAATGATC) with 25 mCi of c [32P]-ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase according to standard protocols. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42uC in 66 SSPE, 1% SDS, 0.25 mg/ml ssDNA and 56Denhardt's solution. After hybridization, the blot was washed twice with 1% SDS in 26 SSPE for 30 min at 37uC. Quantitation of signals was obtained by phosphor screen scanning with a STORM PhosphorImager and  ImageQuant software analysis (Molecular Dynamics). The exper-  iments were performed on tissues from Rps7+/+ and Rps7Mtu/+ littermate mice (2 Rps7+/+ and 2 Rps7Mtu/+ for liver, 3 Rps7+/+ and 3 Rps7  Mtu /+ for brain, each in triplicate). Quantitation is  reported as the ratio between 30S and 21S rRNA precursors and  was significantly different between genotypes in both brain  (p,0.01) and liver (p,0.01) (two-way ANOVA with post hoc t-  test).  For ribosome isolation, cytoplasmic extracts from RPS7  p.V156G transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated  through ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion. After 2 hours of  centrifugation at 100,000 g, ribosomes and ribosomal subunits  were recovered in the pellet and free cytoplasmic proteins were  recovered from the supernatant.  For sucrose gradients separating polysomes and ribosomal  subunits, cytoplasmic extracts from Mtu/+ liver were loaded onto a 10%-30% linear sucrose gradient containing 30 mM Tris-HCl  (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. Gradients were  centrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 5 hr at 37,000 rpm and  then the absorbance profile of the gradient was used to evaluate  the ratio between the peaks of ribosomal subunits (60S and 40S).  In situ hybridization For whole mount, Pmel17-containing plasmid (Riken cDNA  clone G370069C13; GenBank Acc: BB766987) was digested with  Kpn1 and transcribed with T3 polymerase to generate DIG-  labeled in situ probes. Hybridizations were performed using  published protocols [61] with the following modifications. After  probe hybridization, Ribonuclease A digestion was omitted, and  Tris-buffered saline was used in place of PBS. BM-purple substrate  (Roche, Molecular Biochemicals) was used in place of 5-bromo-4-  chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium. Embryos were  photographed using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V12 microscope  with a Zeiss AxioCam camera. Probes to detect Rps7 by in situ  hybridization were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCRII-  TOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the following primer pairs:  R7_IN_F AAGGAAATCGAAGTTGGTG and R7_IN_ R  AATTAACATCCTTGCCTGTG. Mouse embryos were fixed  in 2-4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 30% (w/v)  sucrose in phosphate buffer before sectioning (10-20 mm) on a cryostat. In situ hybridization was carried out as previously  described [62]. Briefly, hybridization of sections with 35  S-UTP-  labeled RNA probes was carried out in a 50% (v/v) formamide  solution at 60uC. Sections were washed in 50% (v/v) formamide, an RNAse A treatment was performed for 30 min at 37uC, and then successively stringent SSC solution washes were performed,  with a final wash at 0.16 SSC at 60uC.  Histology and immunohistochemistry For Nissl staining, adult mice were perfused with 0.9% NaCl  and 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde before the brain was dehydrated  in 30% sucrose, sectioned (40 mm) on a freezing microtome, and stained.. For embryonic histology, embryos were fixed in either  Bouin's fixative or 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, washed  extensively in PBS, and dehydrated in 70% ethanol before  sectioning (5-7 mm paraffin) and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining. For immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed in 4%  paraformaldehyde overnight, washed with PBS, dehydrated in  10% sucrose followed by 20% sucrose, then embedded in Neg-50  (Thermo Scientific) for cryosectioning (14 mm). Antibodies includ- ed anti-TRP53 (Leica NCL-p53-CM5p, 1:200), anti-CC3 (Cell  Signaling #9661, 1:200), and anti-PH3 (Millipore #06-570, 1:200) and resulting stains were imaged using a Zeiss Observer.D1  microscope. For apoptosis and proliferation experiments, trans-  verse cryo-sections collected at the level of the forelimb from 3  embryos of each genotype, 6 sections per embryo, were counted  for CC3+ and PH3+ cells. InStat software (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for one-way ANOVA statistical analysis. No  significant difference among the three genotypes was observed in  PH3+ cell counts (p = 0.902). CC3 counts were significantly different among genotypes (p = 0.0005) and a Tukey-Kramer  multiple comparison post test was used for pairwise comparison  among all genotypes with the following results: Rps7+/+ versus Rps7  Zma /+ (p,0.001), Rps7+/+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+  (P.0.05, no significant difference), Rps7 Zma  /+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53  KO /+ (p,0.01).  Behavioral phenotyping Behavioral phenotyping was performed on mutant and unaf-  fected sex-matched littermates between 8 and 12 weeks of age.  Open-field tests were conducted for 5 minutes in a brightly lit,  60 cm diameter, enclosed white arena (field), and monitored by an  automated tracking system to measure the total distance travelled  and the amount of time spent in the center versus the border of the  field. The elevated plus maze test was conducted with an elevated  platform consisting of two enclosed arms and two open arms. An  automated tracking system was employed to measure the number  of entries into each arm and distance traveled in open and closed  arms of the elevated plus maze over 5 minutes. Spontaneous  alternation was performed in an enclosed T-maze built from gray  plastic (arm dimensions 30 cm610 cm630 cm). Each mouse underwent 10 trials with an inter-trial interval of at least  20 minutes. For each trial the mouse was placed in the start  arm facing the end wall and allowed to enter a goal arm of its own  choice. The mouse was confined in the goal arm for 30 seconds  and then put back in the start arm and allowed a free choice of  either arm [31].  MRM imaging Late gestation (E18.5) embryos were collected, fixed in 4%  paraformaldehyde overnight, washed extensively in PBS, and  stored in 70% ethanol. Prior to imaging, embryos were rehydrated  in a solution of PBS and 0.5% (v/v) Magnevist (Bayer Healthcare  Pharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ), a contrast agent. MRM was  performed on specimens using a Bruker 14.1T MR imaging  spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) using a multi-echo  RARE technique [63] with TR/TE = 200/6.9 ms, 8-echoes, and  4 signal averages. The resulting 3D images were acquired in  53 min with an acquisition resolution of 50 microns isotropic.  Manual segmentation of the whole brain and 10 major anatomical  regions was performed using Amira visualization software (v5.2.2,  Visage Imaging Inc., Andover MA, USA) with guidance from an  Rps7 Mouse Mutants  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094    anatomical reference atlas [64]. The volume of these regions was  estimated and 3D rendering with smoothing was performed to  generate 3D representations. Student's t-tests were used to  compare volumes of each Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ brain region. Significance was assessed using the Bonferonni method to correct  for multiple testing, with p,0.005 deemed significant.

The slight variation in 80S peak relative height is not significant as it is  within the variability observed between samples, independent of  genotype.  (TIF)  Figure S4 Embryonic developmental delay in Rps7 Zma  /+ mice is suppressed by Trp53 deficiency. Chronologically age-matched  littermate embryos illustrate that Rps7 Zma  /+ mice exhibit devel- opmental delay at E11.5 and E12.5 relative to Rps7+/+ littermates (left 4 panels). This Rps7  Zma -associated developmental delay is  suppressed by Trp53 deficiency in Rps7 Zma  /+; Trp53KO/+ (right 4 panels). Images for each of the 4 genotypes are shown at the same  magnification within an age (row).  (TIF)  Figure S5 Pmel17 expression is reduced at E12.5 in Rps7 mutant  embryos. Comparison of Pmel17 in situ hybridizations of E12.5  Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos (middle 3 panels) with E12.5 Rps7+/+ embryos (left 3 panels) showed that Rps7  Zma /+ embryos exhibit a  severe reduction in melanoblasts. Furthermore, melanoblast  number in E12.5 Rps7 Zma  /+ embryos was reduced below that of E11.5 Rps7+/+ embryos (right 3 panels), thus showing that the melanoblast reduction in Rps7  Zma /+ embryos exceeds the gross  developmental delay observed in Rps7 Zma  /+ mutants. This reduction is especially evident from comparison of E12.5  Rps7 Zma  /+ and E11.5 Rps7+/+ melanoblast populations in the otic area (arrows), in the trunk posterior to the forelimb (*), and in  the tail region (arrowheads). Scale bars = 1 mm.  (TIF)  Figure S6 Mutation of Rps7 and Sox10 act synergistically to  reduce melanoblast number. Combined haploinsufficiency for  Rps7 and Sox10 (Rps7 Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes)  greatly reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (middle 3 panels)  as compared to E12.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+mice (left 3 panels). Furthermore, E12.5 Rps7  Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice showed a greater reduction in melanoblast number in comparison with  E11.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice, indicating that this reduction in melanoblasts exceeded the gross developmental delay observed  in Rps7 Zma  /+ mutants. Reduction is especially evident in melanoblast populations in the otic area (arrow), and in the tail  region posterior to the hindlimb (arrowhead and posterior). Scale  bars = 1 mm.  (TIF)  Figure S7 Rps7 mutation increases Sox10-dependent hypopig-  mentation and does not result in dark skin. (A, B) Rps7 Zma/+;  Sox10 LacZ/+ double mutants that survive postnatally exhibit  more extensive hypopigmentation than Rps7 Zma/+or Sox10-  LacZ/+ mutants. A representative Rps7Zma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mouse is shown (A) along with quantitative scoring (0 = no spotting;  4 = the largest ventral spots that extend to the dorsal surface)  comparing the white spotting in Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+ (blue, N = 27), Rps7  Zma/+; Sox10+/+ (red, N = 16), and Rps7Zma/+; Sox10  LacZ/+ (yellow, N = 8) (B). (C, D) Adult Rps7 mutants do not have dark skin in foot pads and tails. (E,F) H&E stained  sections through the tail skin of Rps7 Zma/+ mice reveal  epidermal (*) and dermal (arrowhead) pigmentation similar to  that of Rps7+/+ mice, confirming the presence of melanocytes in the tail.  (TIF)  Figure S8 Behavioral assessment of Rps7 Mtu  /+ mutants. (A) Total distance traveled in the open-field test by Rps7+/+ controls (WT) and Rps7  Mtu /+ (Mtu) (N = 11) was similar (p = 0.5). (B-E)  Likewise there were no significant differences between Rps7+/+ and Rps7  Mtu /+ on the elevated plus maze. Open arm distance (B,  P.0.5), open arm entries (C, P.0.5), closed arm distance (D,  P.0.5), and closed arm entries (E, P.0.1) were all comparable  (N = 11).

H&E stained sagittal sections through the spinal cord of E18.5  Rps7+/+ (A, B) and Rps7Zma/+ (C, D) embryos. Arrow in D indicates an example of a darkly stained, condensed nucleus characteristic of  pyknotic nuclei observed throughout the Rps7 Zma/+  spinal cord.  Anterior is oriented towards the top and posterior to the bottom of  all images. Boxed regions in A, C define the respective areas shown  at higher magnification in B, D. Abbreviations: vertebral column  (V), spinal cord (SC). Scale bars = 100 mm. (TIF)  Figure S10 Rps7 mRNA expression pattern. Mouse Rps7  transcript was detected by in situ hybridization at E13.5 (A, E),  E16.5 (B, F), E17.5 (D), and adulthood (C, G). Broad expression  was detected in the developing embryo, including a high level of  expression in the ganglionic eminences (arrowhead in D), the  proliferative ventricular zone (E), as well as in the dentate gyrus on  the hippocampus in adult animals (G). Abbreviations: ventricular  zone/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ), intermediate zone (IZ),  cortical plate (CP), CA3 region of hippocampus (CA3), dentate  gyrus (DG).  (TIF)  Figure S11 Rps7 mutants have increased TRP53 expression. (A-  C) Increased TRP53 expression was detected in E11.5 Rps7 Zma  /+ (Z/+) coronal sections through the neocortex compared to Rps7+/ + (+/+) and Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+ (Z/+;p53/+). (D-I) This increase was also detected in the neural tube of Rps7  Zma /+  embryos at E11.5 (D-F) and E12.5 (G-I). Scale bars = 100 mm.
