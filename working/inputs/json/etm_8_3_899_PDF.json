The aim of this study was to investigate the  effects of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and matrix  metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) on alveolar-capillary barrier  disruption and lung edema in rat models of severe acute  pancreatitis-associated lung injury (PALI). A total of 40 male  Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham  surgery group (n=10) and three PALI groups, in which acute  pancreatitis was induced by the retrograde infusion of 5%  sodium taurocholate (1 ml/kg). The PALI groups were as  follows: i) Untreated PALI group (n=10); ii) 2-methoxyestra- diol (2ME2) group (5 mg/kg body mass; n=10); and iii) 2ME2  group (15 mg/kg body mass; n=10). In the two 2ME2 groups,  the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor 2ME2 was administered intraperitoneally  1 h after the induction of AP. The severity of the pancreatitis  was evaluated by the serum amylase levels and pathology.  The severity of the lung injury was evaluated by the wet/dry  ratio, blood gas analysis and pathology. The alveolar-capillary  barrier disruption was assessed by Evans blue dye extravasa- tion. The protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1  and MMP-9 were studied using enzyme-linked immuno- sorbent assays (ELISAs), western blot analysis and reverse  transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The active tumor  necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels were measured using an ELISA. The  HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor 2ME2 attenuated the severity of the pancre- atitis and PALI, while the lung edema and alveolar-capillary   barrier disruption were significantly ameliorated compared  with those in the untreated PALI group. Administration of  the higher dose of 2ME2 significantly suppressed the protein  expression of MMP-9 in the lung tissues. The results indicate  that HIF-1\u03b1 has a major function in alveolar-capillary barrier  disruption and lung edema in PALI via a molecular pathway  cascade involving MMP-9. Inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 by 2ME2  attenuates alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and lung  edema. Pharmacological blockade of this pathway in patients  with PALI may provide a novel therapeutic strategy.  Introduction  Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder in which  a complex cascade of immunological events develops, which  affects the pathogenesis and clinical course of the disease,  varying from a mild, self-limiting, transient illness to a severe,  fatal outcome (1). Severe AP is characterized by pancreatic  tissue necrosis, as well as complications including systemic  inflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunc- tion syndrome. Of the total number of patient mortalities due  to severe AP, >50% are ascribed to acute lung injury in the  early stage (2), also known as pancreatitis-associated lung  injury (PALI).  Previous studies have demonstrated that pulmonary  edema following PALI causes pulmonary swelling, which  consequently produces secondary microvascular leakage,  alveolar-capillary barrier disruption, and even alveolar damage  and mortality (3-5). In severe PALI, pulmonary edema poses a  critical clinical problem due to its association with acute respi- ratory function failure (6). Despite the fact that there have been  significant advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis  of alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and lung edema of  PALI, as well as the availability of existing PALI treatments  that attenuate the aforementioned derangements, the molec- ular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly  understood. The lack of effective drugs to ameliorate the  initiation and progression of PALI-induced alveolar-capillary  barrier disruption and lung edema has led to increased interest   Effects of hypoxia\u2011inducible factor\u20111\u03b1 and matrix  metalloproteinase\u20119 on alveolar\u2011capillary barrier  disruption and lung edema in rat models of severe   acute pancreatitis\u2011associated lung injury BING QI1-2,  HAI-LONG CHEN2,  DONG SHANG2,  YING DONG3,  GUI-XIN ZHANG2  and  LEI YU1  1Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116044; 2Department of Acute Abdominal Surgery, First Affiliated  Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116011; 3Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,   The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116021, P.R.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have an important  function in the pathophysiology of alveolar-capillary barrier  disruption and lung edema following PALI, and have become  viable candidates for potential pharmacological targets (4,8,9).  The expression of MMPs is crucial in numerous pathological  events and has significant roles in a number of physiological  processes, including remodeling of the extracellular matrix,  degradation of type IV collagen in the basement membrane  and migration of leukocytes during the immune and inflam- matory responses (4,8,10,11).  Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a subgroup of  zinc-dependent endopeptidases, degrades components of the  basement membrane, including collagen type IV, fibronectin  and gelatin (12). Previous studies have demonstrated that the  expression levels of MMP-9 in lung tissues of PALI model  rats are markedly increased compared with those in healthy  rat lungs (13). The proteolytic cleavage function of MMP-9  results in disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier and  lung edema (8). When the integrity of the alveolar-capillary  barrier is compromised, vessel permeability increases and  the alveolar-capillary barrier is no longer able to regulate the  passage of molecules between the interstitial and lung paren- chyma. This type of alveolar-capillary barrier dysregulation  leads to an increase in the amount of water in the extracellular  spaces of the lung tissue, namely, edema. In numerous types  of lung pathologies, including PALI, the levels of MMP-9 are  markedly upregulated. Thus, MMP-9 is considered to partici- pate in the formation and progression of alveolar-capillary  barrier disruption and lung edema (7,8). However, the  molecular cascade leading to the upregulation of the levels  of MMP-9 following the development of PALI has not been  elucidated clearly.  Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a highly conserved  transcription factor that is present in almost all types of  cell; it is strictly regulated by O2 availability. HIF-1 exists  as a heterodimer consisting of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1  (HIF-1\u03b1) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b2 (HIF-1\u03b2) subunits.  HIF-1\u03b2 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas HIF-1\u03b1 is  observed at low levels under normoxic conditions (14).  HIF-1\u03b1, an upstream transcription factor induced by hypoxia,  regulates the subsequent expression of numerous types of  proteins in response to the various pathophysiological condi- tions induced by hypoxia (4,15). Although previous studies  have shown that the levels of HIF-1\u03b1 are upregulated in  AP (16,17), a study has also reported that HIF-1\u03b1 is associated  with augmented pulmonary vascular barrier disruption (18).  However, the potential role of HIF-1\u03b1 in lung tissue injury  or restoration following the development of PALI remains  unclear. Thus, whether HIF-1\u03b1 contributes to the formation  of alveolar-capillary disruption and lung edema by regulating  the expression of MMP\u20119 in PALI remains to be clarified.  The effects of HIF-1\u03b1 following PALI also require further  elucidation.  The purpose of the present study was to determine  whether a molecular cascade involving HIF-1\u03b1 and MMP-9  is causally associated with alveolar-capillary disruption and  lung edema formation in a rodent model of PALI. This study  further sought to provide novel data that may support potential   therapeutic targets within this cascade for the alleviation of  alveolar-capillary disruption and lung edema in PALI.  Materials and methods  Animals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 180-220 g in weight,  were supplied by the Experimental Animal Center of Dalian  Medical University (Dalian, China). The animals fasted over- night prior to the experiment, with water provided ad libitum.  This study was conducted in strict accordance with the recom- mendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory  Animals of the National Institutes of Health (1st edition,  published in 1996). The animal use protocol was reviewed and  approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee  of Dalian Medical University.  Experimental design. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats  were randomly divided into the sham surgery group (control  group, n=10), in which the rats only underwent sham surgery,  and three PALI groups (n=10 in each group), in which AP was  induced by retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate  (1 ml/kg). The PALI groups were as follows: i) Untreated  PALI group; ii) animals treated with the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor,  2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2; 5 mg/kg body mass; Selleck  Chemicals, Houston, TX, USA); and iii) animals treated  with 2ME2 (15 mg/kg body mass). 2ME2 was administered  intraperitoneally 1 h after the induction of AP. All rats were  sacrificed by femoral venous puncture 24 h after the induction  of AP. Blood was immediately extracted from the abdominal  aorta of the rats for blood gas analysis. Both lung tissues were  also immediately collected and put into a freezing tube, which  was then placed in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a refrig- erator at -80\u02daC. The frozen lung tissues were used for RT-PCR  and Western blot evaluation.  Induction of AP. AP was induced in 30 of the rats based on  a previously described method (5), with minor modifications.  Midline sterile laparotomy was performed under anesthesia  with 10% chloral hydrate (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent  Co., Ltd., Tianjin, China) at a dose of 3 ml/kg by intra- peritoneal injection. Sodium taurocholate (\u22645%; 1 ml/kg;  Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was retrogradely infused  into the distal end of the bile-pancreatic duct. The proximal  bile duct was temporarily occluded at the hepatic portal by a  vascular clamp for 5 min. Subsequently, the vascular clamp  was removed and the duodenal and abdominal wounds were  closed. The 10 rats in the sham surgery group only underwent  a laparotomy.   Serum amylase. In total, 10 rats were sacrificed to test the  serum amylase. Serum was harvested from the collected  blood by centrifugation using a high speed freezing centrifuge  at 1,006 x g for 10 min. The serum was stored at \u201180\u02daC prior  to evaluation of the serum amylase levels using an auto- matic chemistry analyzer (Vitros 3600; Johnson & Johnson,  Rochester, NY, USA).  Wet/dry ratio. In total, 10 rats were sacrificed to test the wet/dry  ratio. The magnitude of the pulmonary edema in the rats was  determined by calculating the wet/dry ratio according to the     EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE  8:  899-906,  2014 901  following formula (7): Wet/dry ratio (%) = [(wet weight - dry  weight)/dry weight] x 100, where the wet weight is the initial  left lung weight and the dry weight is the weight of the lung  following incubation at 72\u02daC for 24 h.  Evans blue dye extravasation. In total, 10 rats were sacrificed  to test the Evans blue dye extravasation. The pulmonary  microvascular permeability of the rats was measured  using a modification of the Evans blue dye (Sigma\u2011Aldrich)  extravasation technique as previously described (19). Briefly,  the rats were injected with 5% Evans blue dye through the  internal jugular vein at a dose of 2 mg/100 g 30 min prior  to sacrifice. Immediately after sacrifice, the lung tissues were  collected and washed with normal saline. The lung tissues  were then weighed after drying with filter paper. The Evans  blue dye was extracted following homogenization in 1 ml  deionized formamide and pulverization using an Ultrasonic  Liquid Processor. A further 3 ml deionized formamide and  1 ml deionized formamide was added, and the mixture was  incubated at 37\u02daC for 48 h. The supernatant was separated by  centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min.  The quantity of dye  extracted was determined spectrophotometrically at 620 nm  and calculated from a standard curve established with known  amounts of Evans blue dye. Results are expressed as mg of dye  per g of wet tissue.  ELISA. A total of 10 rats was sacrificed to test the ELISA.  The levels of HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1  (TNF-\u03b1) in the serum were measured using commercially  available ELISA kits (Shanghai Westang Bio-Tech Co., Ltd.,  Shanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Reverse transcription\u2011polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2011PCR).  Total RNA was extracted from the frozen tissue of the right  lower lung lobe with chloroform and RNAiso Plus reagent  [Takara Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd., Dalian, China]  according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lungs were  extracted from 8 rats. The total RNA was solubilized in  RNase-free water and quantified by NanoVue spectropho- tometric measurement of the nucleic acids and proteins (GE  Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The purity of the RNA was  assured by examining the optical density (OD)260/OD280  ratio. The RNA (2 \u00b5l) was reverse transcribed to complemen- tary DNA using an RNA PCR kit (AMV) Ver. 3.0 [Takara  Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd.] according to the manufac- turer's instructions. The PCR was performed using the primers  presented in Table I. The amplification steps were as follows:  Initial denaturation at 95\u02daC for 3 min, 94\u02daC denaturation for   30 sec, 51\u02daC annealing for 30 sec and 72\u02daC extension for  45 sec for 40 cycles, for HIF-1\u03b1; initial denaturation at 95\u02daC  for 3 min, 94\u02daC denaturation for 30 sec, 60\u02daC annealing for  30 sec and 72\u02daC extension for 45 sec for 40 cycles, for MMP-9;  and initial denaturation at 95\u02daC for 3 min, 94\u02daC denaturation  for 30 sec, 52\u02daC annealing for 30 sec and 72\u02daC extension for  45 sec for 40 cycles, for \u03b2-actin. The PCR products (~5 \u00b5l)  were electrophoresed using 1.7% agarose gel (Biowest,  Barcelona, Spain) containing ethidium bromide (0.5 \u00b5g/ml;  Biosharp Biotech Co., Hefei, China). The gels were visualized  under UV light, and images of the gels were captured. The  band intensities were determined by the ODs with individual  PCR product/\u03b2-actin ratios.  Western blot analysis. A total of 8 rats were used to extract the  lungs. The frozen lung tissues were mechanically processed  in lysis buffer (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing,  China) with protease inhibitors, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluo- ride and phosphatase inhibitor on ice using a protein extraction  kit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) according to the  manufacturer's instructions. The total protein concentration  was determined by NanoVue spectrophotometric measure- ment of the nucleic acids and proteins (GE Healthcare). Equal  volumes (20 \u00b5l) of tissue extracts normalized by protein  concentration were separated by electrophoresis through  10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad  Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to  polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were  blocked with 5% evaporated skimmed milk (BD Biosciences,  Sparks, MD, USA) and then separately incubated with rabbit  monoclonal antibody against HIF-1\u03b1 (1:1,000; Epitomics  Inc., Burlingame, CA, USA) and rabbit monoclonal antibody  against MMP-9 (1:1,000; Epitomics Inc.). Equal loading of  protein was confirmed and adjusted by \u03b2-actin monoclonal  antibody (1:1,000; Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Ltd.,  Wuhan, China). These antibodies were incubated with the  membrane at room temperature for 2 h. Following three wash  cycles in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, the membrane  was incubated with secondary antibody peroxidase-conjugated  AffiniPure goat anti\u2011rabbit IgG (1:5,000; ZSGB\u2011BIO, Beijing,  China). To quantify the relative expression levels of the target  protein, blot images were captured and analyzed using an  image analysis program (BioSpectrum AC 410; UVP, LCC,  Upland, CA, USA). The expression intensities of the proteins  from the different groups were statistically compared.  Histological examination. In total 8 rats were used to extract  the lungs.

QI et al:  EFFECT OF HIF-1\u03b1 AND MMP-9 ON PANCREATITIS-ASSOCIATED LUNG INJURY902  were examined in individual rats from each of the four groups.  The lungs and pancreas were fixed with 10% formalin and  embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (4 \u00b5m thick) were  stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for examination  by light microscopy (model TS100, Nikon, Japan). A scoring  system to grade the degree of lung and pancreatic injury was  employed (20,21). In this system, the lung injury was assessed  from the degree of edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and  bleeding, each of which was scored on a scale of 0-3, and the  pancreatic injury was assessed from the degree of edema,  inflammation, vacuolization and necrosis, each of which was  scored on a scale of 0-4. The grading was performed by a  blinded pathologist. The injury scores were calculated by  adding the individual scores for each category.  Statistical analysis. All data are presented as the mean \u00b1 stan- dard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS  software for Windows, version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL,  USA). The differences among multiple groups were assessed  using \u03c72 analysis with P<0.05 considered to indicate a statisti- cally significant difference.  Results  General information. Compared with those of the control  group, the levels of serum amylase, PaCO2 and the wet/dry  ratio increased and PaO2 decreased in the untreated PALI  group. Following the administration of the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor,  the levels of serum amylase, PaCO2 and the wet/dry ratio  decreased, whereas the PaO2 increased, compared with those  in the untreated PALI group. Furthermore, the effect of the  larger dose of the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor was stronger than that of  the smaller dose (Table II).  Lung permeability. The rats in the untreated PALI group  showed a significant increase in the microvascular capillary  permeability of the lung compared with that of the sham surgery  group. Following the administration of the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor  2ME2 (5 mg/kg), the capillary leakage was reduced significantly  compared with that of the untreated PALI group. Compared  with that of the PALI + 2ME2 (5 mg/kg) group, the blue dye  accumulation in the lung parenchyma of the PALI + 2ME2  (15 mg/kg) group was significantly reduced (Fig. 1A).  Levels of active HIF\u20111\u03b1, MMP\u20119 and TNF\u2011\u03b1. For the quan- titative determination of the active levels of HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9   and TNF-\u03b1 in the serum, a fluorescence ELISA designed  to measure the HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9 and TNF-\u03b1 activity levels  was used. The results showed that compared with those of  the control group, the levels of HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9 and TNF-\u03b1  increased in the untreated PALI group. Following the admin- istration of the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor, the levels of HIF-1\u03b1, MMP-9  and TNF-\u03b1 decreased compared with those of the untreated  PALI group. Furthermore, the effect of the larger dose of the  HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor was stronger than that of the smaller dose  (Fig. 1B-D).  HIF\u20111\u03b1 and MMP\u20119 mRNA expression levels. The RT-PCR  showed that the mRNA expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and  MMP\u20119 were upregulated significantly in the untreated PALI  group compared with those in the control group. However, the  HIF-1\u03b1 and MMP-9 mRNA levels in the lung tissues did not  exhibit significant differences between the untreated PALI  group and the two 2ME2 groups (Figs. 1E, 1F and 2A).  HIF\u20111\u03b1 and MMP\u20119 protein expression levels. HIF-1\u03b1 expres- sion levels are reportedly upregulated during AP (16,17).  HIF-1\u03b1 was almost undetectable in the lung tissues of the  rats in the sham surgery group. The HIF-1\u03b1 and MMP-9  protein expression levels showed significant increases in the  untreated PALI group compared with those in the control  group. Compared with those in the untreated PALI group,  the HIF-1\u03b1 protein expression levels were significantly  reduced in the PALI + 2ME2 (5 mg/kg) and PALI + 2ME2  (15 mg/kg) groups. However, the difference in the MMP-9  protein levels between the untreated PALI and PALI + 2ME2  (5 mg/kg) groups was weakly distinguishable, whereas in the  PALI + 2ME2 (15 mg/kg) group, the MMP-9 protein expres- sion levels were significantly reduced compared with those in  the untreated PALI group (Figs. 1G, 1H and 2B).  Histological examination. The lung and pancreatic tissues  were sectioned, stained with H&E and scored for edema,  acinar necrosis, hemorrhage and fat necrosis, inflammation  and perivascular infiltration (Table III).  The rats in the untreated PALI group showed significant  increases in pathological scores of lung and pancreatic tissues  compared with those in the sham surgery group. Compared with  those in the PALI + 2ME2 (5 mg/kg) group, the pathological  scores of the lung and pancreatic tissues in the PALI + 2ME2  (15 mg/kg) group were significantly reduced (Figs. 1I and 3A\u2011D,  and Figs. 1J and 3E-H for lung and pancreas, respectively).

Bai et al (16) observed that HIF-1\u03b1 has an important function  in the pathogenesis of AP. Keck et al (13) found that MMP-9  also participates in the pathogenesis of PALI. Thus, whether  HIF-1\u03b1 contributes to the formation of lung edema by regu- lating MMP\u20119 requires clarification.  The major finding of the present study is that the concur- rently elevated expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and MMP-9 in the  lung tissues of rat models of PALI temporally coincided with  lung edema formation and alveolar-barrier disruption. In the  PALI model used in the present study, the edema, determined  by the wet/dry ratio, was reduced by the HIF-1\u03b1-selective  inhibitor, 2ME2, compared with that in the untreated PALI  group. In addition, the alveolar-barrier disruption determined  by Evans blue dye extravasation was also ameliorated by the  inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 by 2ME2. At the same time, the inhibition   Figure 3.

EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE  8:  899-906,  2014 905  of HIF-1\u03b1 caused reduced levels of serum amylase, PaCO2 and  pathological scores of the tissues of the lung and pancreas, as  well as increased PaO2 compared with those in the untreated  PALI group.  The data in the present study further support the hypoth- esis that HIF-1\u03b1 affects the pathogenesis of PALI, which is  consistent with the findings of previous studies (14,16,18).  Blocking HIF-1\u03b1 expression may prevent the formation of  lung edema and alveolar-capillary barrier disruption, alle- viate PALI and provide a novel approach for the treatment  of AP.  Furthermore, the larger dose of the HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitor down- regulated the protein expression levels of MMP-9 in the PALI  model compared with those in the untreated PALI group. The  findings of the present study suggest a functional interaction  linking MMP-9 and HIF-1\u03b1, which is possibly dysregulated in  PALI. The data also suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 regulates the expres- sion levels of MMP-9, which are crucial in edema formation  and alveolar-capillary barrier disruption in PALI.  The large quantities of inflammatory factors that enter the  lung tissues in PALI cause damage and necrosis of lung epithe- lial cells, microvascular endothelial cells and tight junctions.  Furthermore, pancreatic proteinase activates the complemen- tary systems, indirectly leading to increased tissue damage  effects and pulmonary transudate, which cause a reduction in  the pulmonary functions of ventilation. Thus, hypoxia may be  a severe consequence of PALI, leading to aberrations in lung  function and repair (15). Hypoxia also results in damage of  the alveolar lining layer, apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells,  lung edema, increased vascular permeability and augmented  barrier disruption (14,18).  Previous studies have demonstrated that hypoxia elicits  tissue inflammation (23,24). For example, Hartmann et al (24)  demonstrated that exposure to a high altitude is associated with  elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in humans. Similarly,  mice that are exposed to acute hypoxia (e.g., 8% oxygen over  8 h) develop elevated plasma levels of cytokines, in conjunction  with pulmonary edema and inflammatory cell accumulation in  the lungs and other organs (9,25). In the inflammatory response,  a large dose of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8) and serine  proteases derived from the pancreas may activate polymorpho- nuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which secrete significant amounts  of MMP-9. Subsequently, MMP-9 promotes PMN migration,  alveolar capillary leakage and lung edema (13,26) (Fig. 4).  2ME2 is a naturally endogenous-occurring metabolite  of estradiol, which post-transcriptionally downregulates the  expression levels of HIF-1\u03b1 and is an anti-angiogenic and anti- tumor agent (27,28). Studies have provided in vitro and in vivo  evidence that 2ME2 has a direct effect on the inhibition  of  HIF-1\u03b1 and the inhibition is not the result of a \u2018side-effect'  of mitotic arrest (29,30). Furthermore, 2ME2 treatment  reduces the levels of nuclear and total HIF-1\u03b1 proteins in a  dose-dependent manner. The downregulated expression levels  of HIF-1\u03b1 post-transcription may be the reason for the absence  of statistical significance between the HIF-1 and MMP-9  mRNA expression levels following the administration of  2ME2 and in the untreated PALI group in the present study.  2ME2 inhibits HIF-1\u03b1 translation and nuclear translocation,  thereby suppressing the inflammatory response, PMN activa- tion and MMP-9 expression (27).  The aforementioned results suggest that HIF-1\u03b1 may be  an upstream protein that causes the alveolar-capillary barrier  disruption and lung edema formation in PALI through its  regulatory expression of catalytic enzymes, including MMP-9.  In conclusion, the present study demonstrated in a PALI  model that an HIF-1\u03b1-MMP-9 signaling cascade exists,  wherein PALI first triggers induction of HIF\u20111\u03b1, which in turn  upregulates MMP-9 expression levels and leads to pathophysi- ological alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and lung edema.  Inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 may provide novel insights into PALI.  These findings enhance our knowledge of the prevention of  acute lung injury secondary to severe AP.
