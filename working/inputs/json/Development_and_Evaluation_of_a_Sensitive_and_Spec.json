    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

Development and Evaluation of a Sensitive and Specific Assay for Diagnosis of Human Toxocariasis by Use of Three Recombinant  Antigens (TES-26, TES-30USM, and TES-120)-  Suharni Mohamad, Norhaida Che Azmi, and Rahmah Noordin* Institute for Research in Molecular Medicine (INFORMM), Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800 Penang, Malaysia  Received 1 January 2009/Returned for modification 16 March 2009/Accepted 7 April 2009  Diagnosis of human toxocariasis currently relies on serologic tests that use Toxocara excretory-secretory (TES) antigen to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the larvae. In general, however, these assays do not have adequate specificity for use in countries in which other soil-transmitted helminths are endemic. The use of recombinant antigens in these assays, however, is promising for improving the specificity of the diagnosis of toxocariasis. Toward this goal, we developed an IgG4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) involv- ing three recombinant antigens: rTES-30USM (previously produced), rTES-26, and rTES-120. The latter two antigens were produced by reverse transcription-PCR cloning; subcloned into glutathione S-transferase (GST)- tagged and His-tagged prokaryotic expression vectors, respectively; and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were subsequently purified by affinity chromatography using GST and His-Trap resins. The diagnostic potential of each purified recombinant antigen was tested with various immunoglobulin classes (IgG, IgM, and IgE) and IgG subclasses. The IgG4 ELISA was determined to have the highest specificity and was further evaluated using a panel of serum samples. The rTES-26 IgG4 ELISA showed 80.0% (24/30 samples positive) sensitivity, and both the rTES-30USM IgG4 ELISA and rTES-120 IgG4 ELISA had 93.0% (28/30) sensitivity. Combined use of rTES-120 and rTES-30 IgG4 ELISA for the diagnosis of toxocariasis provided 100% sensitivity. The specificities of rTES-26, rTES-30USM, and rTES-120 antigens were 96.2%, 93.9%, and 92.0%, respectively. These results indicate that the development of a diagnostic test using the three recombi- nant antigens will allow for more-accurate detection of toxocariasis.  Human toxocariasis is a worldwide parasitic zoonosis, caused most commonly by the intestinal parasites the dog roundworm (Toxocara canis) and also the cat roundworm (Toxocara cati) (2). It commonly manifests as visceral larva migrans, ocular larva migrans, and covert toxocariasis. Toxocariasis is probably one of the most common zoonotic helminthiases in temperate climates and developed countries (20). In Malaysia, the sero- prevalence rate is approximately 20% (6).  Definitive diagnosis of toxocariasis is based on the detection of Toxocara larvae from biopsy tissues, but this test is time- consuming and difficult to perform. Therefore, diagnosis is commonly based on clinical and serologic diagnosis. Currently, common routine serology tests are applied for detection, such as commercial immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immu- nosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in which Toxocara excretory- secretory (TES) antigens obtained from culture of T. canis second-stage (L2) larvae are used (22). The use of the native TES antigen for serodiagnosis of human toxocariasis is a labo- rious and time-consuming technique, and the production ca- pacity is limited by the culture volume (22). Further, the spec- ificity is often low, especially in developing countries, where infections with helminths that cause cross-reactions, particu- larly soil-transmitted helminths, are prevalent (10, 15).  The use of recombinant antigens offers significant benefits  for detection because their production is basically limitless, and assays using recombinant antigens have increased sensitiv- ity and specificity compared to those of assays using native TES antigens. Several investigators have reported recombinant an- tigens that are potentially useful for the serodiagnosis of toxo- cariasis, namely, TES-30 (16, 27, 28) and TES-120 (3, 4), but more validation studies are needed to establish their specificity and sensitivity for use as diagnostic reagents.  Accurate diagnosis is important for patient management, understanding the epidemiology of toxocariasis, and establish- ing preventive measures. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop a robust diagnostic test for human toxocariasis based on three recombinant antigens, rTES-30USM (previously pro- duced), rTES-26, and rTES-120.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Isolation and cultivation of T. canis eggs. Live adult female T. canis worms were obtained postmortem from the small intestinal tracts of naturally in- fected puppies and dogs. The adult worms were washed in normal saline solution, the uteri of gravid female worms were dissected, and fertile eggs were collected.  The in vitro cultivation of the L2 larvae was performed according to the method described previously (1, 13) with some modifications. Briefly, eggs were digested in acid-pepsin solution for 30 min and then incubated in 2% neutral formalin in a sterile 250-ml flask for 14 days at 30\u00b0C with occasional inspection. To the 10% egg suspension, an equal volume of -4% sodium hypochlorite solution (Sigma-Aldrich; ready solution) was added for 30 min until the eggs lost their outer pitted shells. A hand tissue homogenizer (B. Braun) was used to disrupt the decoated eggs. The egg suspension was then placed in RPMI 1640 medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 -g/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 -g/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone). The suspension was then incubated in a 37\u00b0C CO2 incubator with a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 bubbled through the suspen- sion. After 1 h, the mixture was transferred onto two layers of gauze in a modified  * Corresponding author.

The larvae were then homogenized in lysis buffer. The mRNA was extracted from T. canis L2 larvae using the Straight A's mRNA isolation system in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (No- vagen, Germany). The yield/concentration and purity of the mRNA sample were then quantified by spectrophotometry (Eppendorf) at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm.  Human serum samples. A total of 242 serum samples, collected after obtain- ing informed consent from the subjects and approval from the institutional ethics review board, were used in this study. Thirty serum samples were obtained from patients with clinical and hematologic evidence of toxocariasis and were sero- positive by a commercial IgG ELISA kit (Cypress Toxocara IgG; Cypress, Bel- gium); 28 samples came from patients with soil-transmitted helminth infections, namely, Ascaris worms, Trichuris worms, and/or hookworm (STH); 30 samples came from patients with serologic diagnosis of extraintestinal amoebiasis; 20 samples came from patients with a serologic diagnosis of toxoplasmosis; 28 samples came from patients with Brugia malayi microfilaremia; five samples came from patients with Strongyloides stercoralis in their stool; one sample came from a patient with Gnathostoma spinigerum in the eye; and 100 serum samples came from healthy individuals.  Oligonucleotide design. The complete coding sequences (open reading frames) of the TES-26 and TES-120 genes were obtained from GenBank (ac- cession numbers U29761 and U39815, respectively). Primers were designed and analyzed for high-efficiency amplification with OligoPerfect Primer Designer and Vector NTi version 6.0 software (Informac Inc., Invitrogen).  RT-PCR. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed by using the commercial StrataScript One-Tube RT-PCR System with the Easy-A high-fidel- ity PCR cloning enzyme kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer's instruc- tions. The specific primers for each DNA sequence were as follows: TES26F, 5--CACCATGTCAGTTGTACACAAAGCTTGC-3-; TES26R, 5--TTAGGCC TGCGATCGATAGA-3-; TES120F, 5--ATGCACGTCCTTACCGTCGCT-3-; TES120R, 5--ACAGAAGCCGCACGTCAGTGG-3-. The PCR mixture com- prised 39.5 -l RNase-free water, 5 -l of 10- RT-PCR buffer, 1 -l of forward and reverse primers (20 pmol/-l each), 1 -l of 40 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 1 -l of mRNA sample, 1 -l of diluted StrataScript reverse transcriptase (2.5 U/-l), and 0.5 -l of Easy-A HiFi PCR cloning enzyme. These were added sequentially to an 0.2-ml PCR tube in a total reaction volume of 50 -l. The amplification process was then performed as follows: first-strand synthesis at 42\u00b0C for 15 min; StrataScript reverse transcriptase inactivation at 95\u00b0C for 1 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, template-primer annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s, and extension at 68\u00b0C for 2 min; and final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 min.  Cloning of genes encoding TES-26 and TES-120. The A-tailed freshly purified RT-PCR products were cloned into a TOPO TA cloning vector (PCR2.1 TOPO TA; Invitrogen), followed by transformation into the TOP10 Escherichia coli host (Invitrogen). The orientation of the recombinant plasmids was confirmed by PCR screening using both gene-specific primers (TES26F and TES26R or TES120F and TES120R) in tandem with a vector-specific primer (M13R) and a gene-specific primer (TES26R or TES120R), followed by DNA sequencing. Sequences of the engineered genes were then compared with the appropriate published sequences using Vector NTi software version 6.0.  Repair of base mutations. Four DNA base errors were detected in TES-26/ TOPO, and no base errors were detected in TES-120/TOPO. Thus, in vitro PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed to correct the four base errors (124, 502, 613, and 768 bp) in TES-26/TOPO by using a commercially available kit (QuikChange XL; Stratagene). Four specific forward and reverse primers (Table 1) at the particular regions were designed according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. Plasmid DNA template (4 -l) was added to a PCR mixture consisting of 5 -l of 10- mutagenesis buffer, 2 -l each of 1 -M forward  and reverse mutagenic primers, 1 -l of 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1 -l of Pfu DNA polymerase (2.5 U/-l), and water (DNase and RNase free; Sigma) to a final volume of 50 -l. PCR was performed using the following parameters: one cycle at 95\u00b0C (5 min); 12 cycles at 95\u00b0C (30 s), 60\u00b0C (1 min), and 72\u00b0C (5 min); and finally one cycle at 4\u00b0C (5 min). The PCR product was then digested with 1 -l of 10 U/-l DpnI enzyme (Fermentas) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by transformation into the TOP10 E. coli host (Invitrogen). The corrected DNA sequences of the recombinant plasmids were then verified by sequencing.  Subcloning into bacterial expression vectors. All recombinant plasmids and expression vectors were digested with EcoRI enzyme (Fermentas). After diges- tion, TES-26 and TES-120 recombinant plasmids were subcloned into pET42 version b (Novagen, Germany) and pPROExHT version a (Life Technologies), respectively, using a T4 rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Diagnostics). After the construct was verified by sequencing, the recombinant plasmids were trans- formed into an expression host, BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Germany).  Expression and purification of TES-26 and TES-120 recombinant proteins. Each of the recombinant bacteria was cultured in Terrific broth containing 30 -g/ml kanamycin (for rTES-26) or 50 -g/ml ampicillin (for rTES-120) and incubated at 37\u00b0C until the optical density (OD) at 600 nm reached mid-log phase (OD at 600 nm of 0.5). The expression was then induced with isopropyl- --D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM at 30\u00b0C in an incu- bator shaker. The culture was harvested after 3 h (for rTES-26) or 5 h (for rTES-120). The affinity purification of TES-26 glutathione S-transferase (GST)- tagged and TES-120 histidine-tagged recombinant proteins was performed under native conditions, as described by the manufacturer, because both recombinant proteins were present in sufficient amounts in soluble form. The cells of rTES-26 were lysed in buffer (pH 7.3) containing 43 mM NaH2PO4, 14.7 mM KH2PO4, 1.37 M NaCl, and 27 mM KCl by using a French press (Thermo Spectronic) and purified using GST resin (Novagen, Germany). The cells of rTES-120 were lysed in buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole using the same method as that described above. rTES-120 was then purified with a His-Trap column (GE Healthcare) using an AKTAprime machine (GE Healthcare). A restriction-grade site-specific protease, factor Xa enzyme, was used for specific cleavage/removal of the GST tag in TES-26 GST-tagged recombinant protein by using a commercial kit (factor Xa cleavage capture kit; Novagen, Germany). After cleavage of the target protein, factor Xa was removed by affinity chromatography using Xarrest agarose (Novagen, Germany). The sizes of the expressed target proteins were determined by sodium dodecyl sul- fate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, and the immuno- reactivities of these recombinant proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using serum samples and IgG4 antibody detection.  Western blotting. The rTES-26 and rTES-120 antigens (20 -g/ml) were sep- arated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Osmonic) by using a semidry transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane was cut into strips and blocked with 1% casein blocking solution (Roche Diag- nostics) for 1 h. The strips were then incubated with serum samples (diluted 1:100 in 0.5% blocking solution) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by monoclonal anti-human IgG4-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed) at 1:2,000 (in 0.5% blocking solution) for 30 min. BM chemiluminescence blotting reagent (Roche Diagnos- tics) and X-ray films (Kodak) were used to develop the blots.  ELISA. ELISAs based on rTES-26 and rTES-120 and the previously produced rTES-30USM recombinant antigens were developed, and the diagnostic value of the assays was evaluated using monoclonal anti-human IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), IgE, and IgM. The final assay was then evaluated using a panel of sera from patients with positive Toxocara serology results or other helminth-related infections and from healthy individuals to determine its sensi- tivity and specificity. Each well of the 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plate (Nunc Immuno Maxisorp) was coated with 100 -l of each recombinant antigen at the optimum concentration for each antigen in 0.02 M bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 (Table 2). The plate was then covered and incubated in a humid chamber at 4\u00b0C overnight followed by 2 h at 37\u00b0C. The plate was washed in phosphate- buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, containing 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20, pH 7.2, to remove unadsorbed antigen. After a washing step of five washes for 5 min each with PBS with Tween 20, each well was blocked with 1.0% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The plate was again washed as previously described, followed by the addition of serum samples (100 -l, 1:50 in PBS, duplicate wells), and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. After the excess serum samples were washed off, mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG1- to IgG4-, IgE-, and IgM-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed) were added at an optimized dilution in PBS (Table 2) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Following a final washing step, 2,2--azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid-diammonium salt) substrate (Roche Diagnostics) was added and the ODs were measured after 30 min as absorbance at 405 nm (reference, 490 nm) using an ELISA spectrophotometer  TABLE 1.

The OD readings were blanked with the PBS, and an OD reading of 0.200 was used as the cutoff value to discriminate between the positive and negative results. This cutoff value was based on the mean OD reading plus three standard deviations of 30 serum samples from healthy individuals.  Statistical analysis. Analyses of the differences in sensitivity and specificity be- tween ELISAs with the different recombinant antigens were performed using Pear- son's chi-square test. One-way analysis of variance was used to compare the ODs obtained among the IgG4 ELISAs using rTES-26, rTES-30USM, and rTES-120. Unless otherwise indicated, a P value of 0.05 or less was considered to be significant.  RESULTS  Gel electrophoresis of the amplified RT-PCR products of the DNA sequence encoding TES-26 and TES-120 proteins produced bands at the expected sizes of 793 and 528 bp, re- spectively (Fig. 1). All four mutations that occurred at 124, 502, 613, and 789 bp in TES-26/TOPO were successfully corrected (data not shown).  The SDS-PAGE profiles of the purified TES-26 GST fusion and TES-120 His-tagged proteins showed distinctive and thick bands at molecular masses of approximately 72 kDa and 26  kDa, respectively (Fig. 2). The histidine tag is a very small peptide (approximately 0.8 kDa), is not immunogenic, and is rarely disruptive to the properties of the proteins on which it is attached. Therefore, the His tag was not removed. The TES- 120 His-tagged protein was thus used directly for developing the immunoassay to detect Toxocara infection. The GST tag, on the other hand, is a large molecule (approximately 26 kDa) that affects the immunogenicity of the protein; thus, the GST tag was removed prior to developing the immunoassay. After removal of the GST tag, the molecular mass of the TES-26 recombinant protein was approximately 31 kDa.  The antigenicity study by Western blot analysis of the cleaved TES-26 and TES-120 recombinant proteins showed reactivity with serum samples from only toxocariasis patients, as indicated by the presence of bands with molecular masses of approximately 31 and 26 kDa, respectively. Sera from healthy individuals and patients with other helminthic infections showed no reactivity (Fig. 3a and b).  The sensitivity and cross-reactions of sera from patients with other helminthic infections in rTES-ELISA with IgG sub- classes (IgG1 to IgG4), IgE, and IgM are shown in Table 3. The IgG4 ELISA demonstrated the least cross-reactivity, and hence the highest specificity, whereas the IgG1 ELISA dem- onstrated the lowest specificity. The decreasing order of the assay specificities was as follows: IgG4 - IgG3 - IgG2 - IgG1. The greatest assay sensitivity was also demonstrated by IgG4, and the decreasing order of the assay sensitivities was as follows: IgG4 - IgG2 - IgG1 - IgG3.  The sensitivity evaluation results of the final developed IgG4 ELISA are shown in Table 4. Of 30 positive human serum samples examined, 28 (93.3%) were reactive for anti-Toxocara IgG4 antibodies with rTES-30USM and rTES-120; the IgG4 ELISA using rTES-26 antigen gave 80.0% (24/30) sensitivity. The increased level of sensitivity of rTES-30USM and rTES- 120 IgG4 ELISA was significant in comparison with the rTES-26 IgG4 ELISA (P - 0.001, as determined by Pearson chi-square test). However, there was no significant difference in mean ODs obtained with 30 Toxocara-infected serum sam- ples among the three tests (P   0.76; determined by one-way analysis of variance).  The specificity evaluation of each of the assays is shown in Table 5. The specificity values obtained were as follows: 96.2% by rTES-26, 93.9% by rTES-30USM, and 92.0% by rTES-120. At an alpha level of 0.05, there was no significant difference  TABLE 2.

Minimal cross-reactivities were observed with serum samples from patients with ascariasis, trichuriasis, amoebiasis, filariasis, toxoplasmosis, and strongyloidiasis; none of the sera from healthy individuals were reactive. Meanwhile, when 30 in- dividuals were used as healthy controls, the specificities (number of positive samples/total number of samples) were as follows: 94.4% (134/142), 88.0% (125/142), and 90.8% (129/142) for rTES-26, rTES-120 and rTES-30USM, respectively. These data show high values for all parameters and show also that the spec- ificity values of the tests were still high even when a much-reduced number of healthy individuals was considered.

TES antigen derived from T. canis L2 maintained in defined medium in vitro has been extensively used for the immunodiagnosis of human toxocariasis. Serum samples from patients with filariasis and with STH infections such as ascar- iasis and strongyloidiasis, however, cross-react with the native TES antigen in immunoassays (10, 12, 15, 16, 27, 28). This may not be a major problem in developed countries where STH in- fections are not prevalent, but it is a significant problem in trop- ical countries where STH infections are endemic (7, 10). Thus, native TES antigen is useful only for differential diagnosis, and test interpretation is problematic when the result is positive (15).  The diagnosis of human toxocariasis is currently performed by detecting IgG in an ELISA format. The IgG assay, however, provides false-positive reactions with other parasitic helminths, whereas the IgG4 antibody greatly increased the specificity of the assay for toxocariasis (15, 16, 26). Similarly, in the diagnosis of lymphatic filariasis, antifilarial IgG4 is often used as a marker of active infection (8, 9, 19, 25), but to date, there is no commercially available IgG4 test for the detection of Toxocara infection.  Previously rTES-30USM has been successfully cloned by assembly PCR and expressed in the prokaryotic expression vector by our group (16). rTES-120 has been cloned and ex- pressed as insoluble protein in the pTrcHis2 prokaryotic vector and yeast expression vectors (3, 4). Both of these recombinant antigens have potential in the diagnosis of toxocariasis in an IgG ELISA (3, 4, 28). Evaluation of the diagnostic values of both recombinant antigens, however, requires further validation. In addition, previous studies indicate that TES-30 recombinant antigens demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the de- tection of anti-Toxocara IgG4 subclass antibodies (16).  A 26-kDa antigen is being used as one of six serodiagnostic markers for confirmation of toxocariasis in a commercial West- ern blot IgG kit that uses native TES antigen (Testline, France). Furthermore previous studies have shown that low- molecular-mass bands (24 to 35 kDa) of native TES antigen were more specific for toxocariasis, while the high-molecular- weight TES antigen bands showed reactivity with sera from various helminth infections (11, 17). Therefore, we hypothe-  sized that rTES-26 might be useful as a serodiagnostic marker for toxocariasis. However, it is interesting that previously rTES-26 was reported to be of poor diagnostic value when tested with serum from toxocariasis patients (18/118; 11.5%) (5). The investigators themselves thought the low reactivity was unexpected since the gene selection was based on reactivity to antisera from TES antigen-immunized mice. Their results are in apparent contradiction to the results of the present study; the reasons could be due to differences in expression vectors, purification methods, and the secondary antibodies employed.  In this study, the genes encoding TES-26 and TES-120 were successfully cloned via RT-PCR and expressed in the appro- priate prokaryotic expression vectors for the expression of the recombinant proteins. The target proteins proved to be immu- nologically reactive. Because both recombinant proteins were well expressed in soluble form, the proteins were purified un- der native conditions. The predicted molecular masses of rTES-26 and rTES-120 recombinant proteins were 70 and 26 kDa, respectively. These values corresponded with the sizes of the proteins observed using SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. The purified recombinant proteins were then used to develop an ELISA for the detection of specific antibody in sera from patients infected with T. canis by using various antibody classes and subclasses.  Increased levels of total IgE in many cases of toxocariasis indicated that IgE specific for TES antigen was present. High levels of IgE specific for TES antigen are also observed in the serum of patients with clinical signs suggestive of Toxocara infection (22, 23). Not all patients with elevated total IgE levels, however, demonstrated specific anti-Toxocara IgE. Pawlowski (18) reported that Toxocara-specific IgE was present in half of the patients in that study, a finding consistent with the results in the present study, where only half of the patients with toxocariasis had increased IgE levels.  The demonstration of increased Toxocara-specific IgM has been considered indicative of acute infection (21). In our study, however, IgM was not a good marker for Toxocara infection because only 1 of 30 samples was positive by the assay. This result is not surprising, because toxocariasis is often not an acute dis- ease.  When the three recombinant antigens were tested in ELISAs using all the IgG subclasses (IgG1 to IgG4), the results clearly indicated that only the IgG4 assay displayed good specificity. Thus, IgG4 ELISA was employed in the final development of the diagnostic assay for toxocariasis. The use of rTES-26 IgG4 ELISA alone gave a sensitivity of 80.0%, and rTES-30USM and rTES-120 IgG4 ELISA gave similar sensitivities of 93.3%. When both rTES-30USM and rTES-120 were used in separate wells, 100% sensitivity was obtained. The three recombinant antigens were found not to be different in terms of the mean ODs of 30 samples from patients with toxocariasis.  The results obtained differed from those obtained in a study by Watthanakulpanich et al. (24). They reported that with native TES antigen, anti-Toxocara IgG2 gave the greatest sen- sitivity (98%) (IgG2 - IgG3 - IgG4 - IgG1 - IgG) whereas anti-Toxocara IgG3 gave the greatest specificity (81%) (IgG3 - IgG1 - IgG - IgG2 and IgG4). These differences may be due to the fact that native antigen was employed in their study whereas recombinant antigens were used in our study. The result of the present study, however, is in agreement with other  TABLE 5.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.    previous studies that reported a significant increase in the specificity for detection of toxocariasis when an IgG4 assay (instead of an IgG assay) was used (15, 16, 26).  In terms of specificity, all three recombinant antigens dis- played high specificities. Some of the false-positive cases re- corded in the present study may have been due to coinfections with Toxocara. The high specificities obtained can be explained by the fact that the recombinant antigens (unlike native TES antigen) are single or homogenous molecules. In addition, the recombinant antigens are not glycosylated because they are expressed by bacteria, which reduces the cross-reactivities with antibodies that recognize sugar moieties (14).  Previous reports showed that the low-molecular-mass bands (24 to 35 kDa) were more specific for toxocariasis, while higher-molecular-mass bands showed reactivity with sera from patients with various helminth infections (11, 17). These findings are thus consistent with the pattern of spec- ificities obtained in the present study, namely, rTES-26 - rTES-30USM - rTES-120.  Although the sensitivity of rTES-26 was lower than that of rTES-30USM/rTES-120, it is still important to include it in the panel of recombinant antigens in the final assay because TES-26 displayed a very high specificity of 96.2%. Further- more, the additional infection marker will increase the robust- ness of the assay, as the final assay remains to be tested with a larger number of samples and in different settings where the organism is endemic.  When a patient's sample is tested using the final assay de- veloped in this study, the results can be interpreted as follows. When all three recombinant antigen IgG4 ELISAs are positive and the clinical symptoms are consistent with Toxocara infec- tion, there is high likelihood that it is a true-positive case. The same applies for when rTES-26 and rTES-120 or rTES-26 and rTES-30USM ELISAs are positive. When only the rTES- 30USM or rTES-120 IgG4 ELISA is positive, there is good evidence that the patient is infected.  Conclusion. A sensitive and specific IgG4 ELISA for detect- ing toxocariasis was successfully developed using three recom- binant antigens: rTES-26, rTES-30USM, and rTES-120 IgG4 ELISA antigens. The assay enabled serodiagnosis of human toxocariasis with high sensitivity and specificity. The use of three recombinant antigens instead of a single recombinant antigen will provide a more robust assay for use in different parts of the world.
