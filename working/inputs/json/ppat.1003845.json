In tissue arrays of RMS tumor cores from 71 patients, 80% of RMS patients expressed high levels of Sp1 protein, whereas low expression of Sp1 was detected in normal muscle tissue. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) tolfenamic acid (TA) inhibited growth and migration of RD and RH30 RMS cell lines and also inhibited tumor growth in vivo using a mouse xenograft (RH30 cells) model. The effects of TA were accompanied by downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes in RMS cells and tumors, and the role of Sp protein downregulation in mediating inhibition of RD and RH30 cell growth and migration was confirmed by individual and combined knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins by RNA interference. TA treatment and Sp knockdown in RD and RH30 cells also showed that four genes that are emerging as individual drug targets for treating RMS, namely c-MET, insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), PDGFR\u03b1 and CXCR4, are also Sp-regulated genes. These results suggest that NSAIDs such as TA may have potential clinical efficacy in drug combinations for treating RMS patients.",

However, excessive production of cytokines appears to be critical in the pathogenesis of influenza virus. Interferon lambdas (IFN-l) have been shown to be overproduced during influenza virus infection, but the precise pathogenic processes of IFN-l production have yet to be characterized. In this report, we observed that influenza virus induced robust expression of IFN-l in alveolar epithelial cells (A549) mainly through a RIG-I-dependent pathway, but IFN-l-induced phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) was dramatically inhibited in the infected cells. Remarkably, influenza virus infection induced robust expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (SOCS-1), leading to inhibition of STAT1 activation. Interestingly, the virus-induced SOCS-1 expression was cytokine-independent at early stage of infection both in vitro and in vivo. Using transgenic mouse model and distinct approaches altering the expression of SOCS-1 or activation of STAT signaling, we demonstrated that disruption of the SOCS-1 expression or expression of constitutively active STAT1 significantly reduced the production of IFN-l during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, we revealed that disruption of IFN-l signaling pathway by increased SOCS-1 protein resulted in the activation of NF-kB and thereby enhanced the IFN-l expression. Together, these data imply that suppression of IFN-l signaling by virus-induced SOCS-1 causes an adaptive increase in IFN-l expression by host to protect cells against the viral infection, as a consequence, leading to excessive production of IFN-l with impaired antiviral response.

Therefore, IAV has continued to be a top global  public health threat. The host cytokine immune response provides  the first line of defense against IAV infection. A variety of cell types  in the host, including activated alveolar macrophages (AM),  lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DC), lung alveolar epithelial cells and  endothelial cells within lung tissue, produce cytokines and  chemokines following IAV infection, thus playing key roles in  innate and adaptive immunity [1-3]. However, an aberrant innate  response, with early recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes to the  lung, was believed to contribute to the morbidity of the 1918  influenza virus infection [4]. Studies have also shown that highly  virulent influenza virus infection induces excessive cytokine  production (cytokine storm) and robust recruitment of leukocytes  which are hypothesized to be major contributors to severe disease  in humans from influenza virus infection [5]. These data reveal  that dysregulation of cytokine signaling of the host during  influenza virus infection caused by inappropriate activation of  the innate immune response triggers massive pulmonary injury  and immune-mediated organ dysfunction. However, the mecha-  nisms underlying the increased induction of innate immune  cytokines during influenza virus infection have to date been largely  unclear.  Innate immune responses triggered by the intracellular detec-  tion of viral infections include the production of interferons (IFNs)  that are classified within the class II cytokine family based on the  similarity of their receptors. IFNs consist of three types of  cytokines: type I IFNs include IFN-a and IFN-b; type II IFN is IFN-c and type III IFNs consist of three members in humans, IFN lambda1 (IFN-l1), IFN-l2, and IFN-l3 which are also named IL- 29, IL-28A, and IL-28B, respectively, whereas mice only express  IFN-l2 and IFN-l3 [6]. Virus-infected cells secrete a complex mixture of IFNs that represent a major element of the innate  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845    immune response against diverse viral infections [7]. In 2003, IFN-  ls were first discovered as novel antiviral cytokines by two independent groups [8,9]. It is now recognized that IFN-ls are virus-induced cytokines with type I IFN-like biological functions,  including antiviral activity, but have evolved independently of type  I IFNs [10]. Although both type I IFNs and IFN-l are expressed by a host in response to viral infections, IFN-ls, not type I IFNs, are the predominant IFNs induced by respiratory viruses in nasal  epithelial cells and mainly contribute to the first line defense  against respiratory virus infection [11]. Type I IFNs were first  recognized for their ability to interfere with IAV replication, but  IFN-ls have recently been shown to be present at much higher levels than type I IFNs in the lungs of infected mice and play an  important role in host defense against IAV infection [2]. However,  currently there is limited information available about the biology  of IFN-l. In particular, the mechanisms that regulate the robust expression of IFN-l during IAV infection are not fully understood.  IFN-ls share a common cellular receptor consisting of the cytokine receptor family class II members IL-28R1 and IL-10R2.  The short chain IL-10R2 is ubiquitously expressed and is a  receptor component of other type II-related cytokines, whereas the  long chain IL-28R1 is unique to IFN-l and is preferentially expressed on epithelial cells [12]. IFN-ls are induced by most, if not all, classes of viruses as well as some bacterial products [10].  Once secreted, IFN-ls act in an autocrine or paracrine manner by binding the cell-surface receptors. The receptor binding results in  a conformational change in the receptor and activation of the  receptor-associated Janus tyrosine kinases (JAKs). Activated JAK1  and Tyk2 transphosphorylate the receptor chains that assist in the  recruitment of STAT proteins. STAT proteins are then phos-  phorylated, dimerized, and translocated to the nucleus to initiate  transcription of the IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that mediate the  biological effects of IFN-l. Therefore, IFN-l-mediated activation of JAK/STAT signaling is required for efficiently triggering the  synthesis of antiviral factors.  An important mechanism for negative regulation of the JAK/  STAT signaling pathway is mediated through members of the  SOCS family. Of the eight family members, SOCS-1 has been  most extensively studied and is the most potent inhibitor of  cytokine-induced signaling [13]. SOCS-1 can directly interact with  JAKs by its kinase inhibitory region (KIR), which inhibits JAKs  activity. In addition, SOCS-1 can target JAKs to proteasomal  degradation through interaction of SOCS box with the Elongin  BC complex, which becomes part of an E3 ubiquitin ligase [14-  16]. When overexpressed in cells, SOCS-1 can inhibit STAT  activation induced by multiple cytokine stimulations. Interestingly,  several recent studies have revealed that influenza virus has  developed mechanisms to subvert host antiviral defense mediated  by type I and type II IFNs through inhibition of the JAK/STAT  signaling by upregulated SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 proteins [17-20].  Consistent with these observations, it has been shown that IFN-l- induced mRNA expression of the antiviral proteins 29,59-OAS and  Mx1 was abolished by overexpression of SOCS-1 [21]. However,  the relationship between suppression of cytokine signaling by  SOCS-1 and overproduction of IFN-l during influenza virus infection remains to be determined.  In this study, we examined the effects of influenza virus-  provoked negative regulation of cytokine signaling on the IFN-l production by altering expression of SOCS-1 and activation of  STAT signaling. We found that disrupting SOCS-1 expression or  constitutive activation of STAT1 significantly inhibits production  of IFN-l in vitro and in vivo. The results reveal that suppression of innate immune cytokine signaling by virus-induced SOCS-1  contributes to formation of IFN-l storm during influenza virus infection.  Results  Intracellular detection of IAV infection induces robust expression of IFN-l in alveolar epithelial cells mainly through a RIG-I-dependent pathway  To investigate the mechanisms by which the host cells interact  with influenza A virus (IAV), we have recently used cDNA  microarray to profile the cellular transcriptional response to A/  WSN/33 influenza virus (H1N1) infection in A549 human  alveolar epithelial cells [22]. Surprisingly, we found that IL-28A,  IL-28B and IL-29, three recently discovered IFN-l family members, were most significantly up-regulated (Figure S1A). This  finding was confirmed by independent experiments measuring the  mRNA levels by quantitative real time PCR of IAV infected A549  cells and mouse lungs (Figure 1A and B) and RT-PCR (Figure  S1B), and evaluating the IL-29 protein level by ELISA (Figure  S1C). Treatment of IAV at 56uC for 30 minutes, which prevents viral replication without affecting viral entry into host cells [23],  significantly reduced the virus-induced production of IFN-ls (Figure 1C). To further determine whether production of IFN-l was affected by viral entry into host cells, IAV was inactivated at  65uC for 30 minutes, which denatures hemagglutinin (HA) and prevents host cell attachment [24]. We found that expression of  IFN-l induced by 65uC-inactivated virus recapitulated that of the non-infected control (Figure 1C). These experiments demonstrated  that robust expression of IFN-ls was the response to live virus entry into host cells and viral replication.  To further determine the inducer of IFN-ls, A549 cells were transfected with either different amounts of total RNA isolated  from IAV infected cells (Figure 1D and Figure S1D) or genomic  RNA directly isolated from the viruses (Figure S1E). The results  revealed that both viral genome RNA and viral RNA generated  during IAV infection contributed to IFN-l production. Unlike cellular RNA, influenza viral RNA contains a 59-triphosphate  group which is thought to be the critical trigger for production of  Author Summary  Influenza virus infection triggers innate immune responses. However, aberrant host immune responses such as excessive production of cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of influenza virus. Type III interferons (IFN- l) constitute the major innate immune response to influenza virus infection, but the precise pathogenic processes of IFN-l production and mechanistic underpin- nings are not well understood. In this study, we report that influenza virus induces robust IFN-l expression mainly through a RIG-I-dependent pathway, but signaling acti- vated by IFN-l was dramatically inhibited by virus-induced SOCS-1. Importantly, we found that disruption of the SOCS-1 expression or forced activation of STAT1 signifi- cantly reduced the expression of IFN-l in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that suppression of IFN-l signaling by SOCS-1 results in their excessive production during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, our experiments revealed that disruption of IFN-l signaling pathway resulted in the activation of NF-kB that governs the IFN-l expression. Together these findings, we propose that impaired antiviral response of IFN-l due to the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1 causes an adaptive increase in IFN-l expression by host to protect cells against the viral infection. This is a novel mechanism that may be critical in the pathogenesis of the influenza virus strains that induce hypercytokinemia.

Using calf  intestine alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) to remove the 59-triphosphate  terminus of viral RNA, we tested whether it was involved in IFN-l induction. Interestingly, treatment with CIAP greatly inhibited  expression of IFN-ls (Figure 1E and Figure S1F). To determine whether IAV-induced expression of IFN-l was completely depen- dent on RIG-I, A549 cell lines stably expressing shRNAs targeting  either RIG-I, TLR3 or MDA5 were generated (Figure 1F and  Figure S1G). We observed that silencing RIG-I resulted in a marked  decrease in the production of IFN-l and silencing TLR3 slightly decreased the IFN-l levels, whereas disruption of MDA5 expression had no overt effects on the IFN-l production (Figure 1G-H and Figure S1G-H). These data suggest that IFN-l induced by the IAV RNA was mainly through a pathway involving RIG-I.  IAV inhibits IFN-l-stimulated STAT1 phosphorylation in host  In normal cells, the strength and duration of cytokine signaling  are tightly regulated. However, little is known about why a huge  amount of IFN-l is induced during IAV infection. To address this issue, we sought to investigate whether regulation of IFN-l- mediated signaling was altered during the viral infection. IFN-l, like type I IFN, primarily activates the JAK-STAT signal pathway  to achieve its antiviral function. Unlike type I IFN receptor, IFN-l receptor is expressed in a cell-specific fashion [28]. Here we  observed that IFN-l was able to activate JAK-STAT signal pathway in A549 cells (Figure 2A, B). Furthermore, the level of  IFN-l-induced STAT1 phosphorylation was markedly reduced in IAV infected cells, as compared with that in control cells  (Figure 2B-D). To substantiate this finding, a time course  experiment was performed. We found that phosphorylation of  STAT1 in infected cells was dramatically inhibited at later stages  of infection (after 15 h p.i.) (Figure 2E), while no significant  decrease in STAT1 phosphorylation was observed in the cells  treated with corresponding culture supernatants (SN) from the  infected cells (Figure 2F). These data indicate that activation of  JAK-STAT signaling by IFN-l was suppressed in the presence of IAV.  Figure 2. IAV inhibits IL-29-induced STAT1 phosphorylation in A549 cells.

Of the eight  members of SOCS family, SOCS-1 is the most potent inhibitor of  cytokine-induced signaling. In addition, it has recently emerged  that SOCS-1 is an important regulator of innate immune response  triggered by IAV [18]. Therefore, we hypothesized that SOCS-1 is  involved in inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation during IAV  infection. To test this, SOCS-1 mRNA levels in A549 cells during  IAV infection were examined by quantitative RT-PCR  (Figure 3A). The mRNA level of SOCS-1 was significantly up-  regulated at early stages and began to reduce at late stages of  infection, but its protein level was consistently increased  (Figure 3B). Immunofluorescence study showed that increased  expression of SOCS-1 and inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation  occurred specifically in IAV infected cells (Figure S2A, S2B). This  implies that there might be a certain relationship between  expression of SOCS-1 protein and inhibition of STAT1  phosphorylation. Surprisingly, although SOCS-1 expression in  A549 cells was induced by supernatants derived from infected cell  culture at later stages (Figure 3C, D and Figure S2C), the SOCS-1  Figure 3.

(A) Quantitative real- time RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of SOCS-1 in A549 infected with WSN for indicated time. (B) Lysates from cells in (A) were analyzed for the protein levels of SOCS-1, as detected by Western blotting with indicated antibodies. (C) A549 cells were infected by WSN for indicated time. Supernatants (SN) derived from these cells were used to stimulate the native A549 for 2 h. Both infected cells and supernatants- stimulated cells were lysed and analyzed for SOCS-1 expression by RT-PCR.

Thus, SOCS-1-shRNA#2 was used in this study. (F) SOCS-1-ablated or control A549 cells were infected with WSN for the indicated time. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot probed with the antibodies as indicated.

The results strongly suggest that during IAV infection,  there was a cytokine-independent mechanism to induce  SOCS-1 expression.  To further verify the functional involvement of SOCS-1 in the suppression of STAT1 activation, SOCS-1 expression in A549 cells was knocked down by shRNA (Figure 3E). In SOCS-1 knockdown A549 cells, but not the control cells, the level of STAT1 phosphorylation was notably increased during the infection (Figure 3F, G), indicating that SOCS-1 was a direct inhibitor of STAT1 phosphorylation during IAV infection.  SOCS-1-mediated inhibition of cytokine signaling contributes to excessive production of IFN-l during IAV infection  Since JAK-STAT signaling was inhibited by IAV-induced SOCS-  1, we asked whether the activated JAK-STAT pathway by IFN-l is also disrupted by SOCS-1. To address this issue, we examined the  effect of SOCS-1 protein on activation of STAT1 by IL-29. As  shown in Figure 4A, down-regulation of SOCS-1 enhanced IL-29-  induced activation of STAT1, whereas overexpression of SOCS-1  inhibited IL-29-induced activation of STAT1 in A549 cells,  revealing that SOCS-1 negatively regulates IL-29-mediated STAT1  signaling. Moreover, in IAV-infected SOCS-1-ablated A549 cells,  Figure 4. Inhibition of cytokine-mediated STAT1 activation by SOCS-1 contributes to overproduction of IFN-l during IAV infection. (A) A549 cells expressing SOCS-1, empty vector (EV) or shRNAs targeting SOCS-1 or luciferase (Luc) were treated with or without IL-29 (50 ng/ml) for 45 min. Cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using indicated antibodies.

Statistical significance of change was determined by Student's t-test (*P,0.05). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003845.g004  SOCS-1 Causes Interferon Lambda Overproduction  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845    STAT1 phosphorylation was markedly elevated by IL-29 stimula-  tion, and this effect was prolonged in both infected and uninfected  cells when compared to the control cells (Figure 4B, C). These  findings suggest that SOCS-1 inhibits IL-29 signal pathway during  IAV infection.  Since IAV-induced expression of SOCS-1 appeared earlier than  expression of IFN-l (see above description), it was interesting to investigate whether the induced SOCS-1 influenced IFN-l production. Surprisingly, the protein level of IL-29 was signif-  icantly reduced in the SOCS-1-ablated cells, comparing with that  in the control cells infected with IAV (Figure 4D). Furthermore,  the mRNA levels of IL-29 and IL-28A/B were also significantly  reduced in SOCS-1-ablated A549 cells (Figure 4E, F), while the  mRNA levels of ISGs (MX1 and OAS-2) did not change  significantly at this time point (Figure 4E, F). The results suggest  that the antiviral response is not affected despite less production of  IFN-l in SOCS-1-ablated cells.  Forced activation of STAT1 causes a significant decrease in type III IFN expression during IAV infection  Because the results presented above revealed that IFN-l- mediated activation of STAT1 was abrogated during IAV  infection, next we asked whether forced activation of STAT1  had any effect on expression of IFN-ls. To test this possibility, we generated A549 cell lines stably expressing either empty vector  (EV), STAT1 wild type (WT), or constitutively activated form  STAT1-2C (2C) [29,30]. The enhancement of STAT1 phosphor-  ylation during IAV infection or stimulated by IFN-l was confirmed in STAT1-2C-expressing cells (Figure 5A, B). STAT1  phosphorylation was also increased in infected cells overexpressing  STAT1-WT as compared to the control cells (Figure 5B).  Interestingly, production of IL-29 protein was remarkably  decreased in the STAT1-2C-expressing cells as compared to the  control after IAV infection (Figure 5C). Consistent with this  observation, the mRNA levels of IL-29 and IL-28A/B were  significantly reduced in IAV infected STAT1-2C-expressing cells  (Figure 5D, E). Furthermore, we tested whether alteration of IFN  signaling had any effect on IFN-a and IFN-b production. We found that silencing SOCS-1 or overexpression of STAT1 slightly  reduced the type I IFN production during IAV infection (Figure  S3A-C). On the other hand, no significant change in the induction  of OAS-2 and Mx1 was observed in these cells at late time points  post infection (Figure 5D, E). Interestingly, at early time point post  infection, activation of STAT1 signaling promoted expression of  OAS-2 and Mx1 (Figure S3D-F).  Disruption of IFN-l signaling pathway results in robust activation of NF-kB during IAV infection  In an attempt to provide insights into the mechanism of how  inhibition of cytokine signaling causes excessive expression of IFN-  l during IAV infection, we evaluated the pathway governing IFN- l expression. We found that level of viral RNA, the inducer of IFN-l expression was unchanged by silencing SOCS-1 expression or forcing STAT1 activation (Figure S3G, S3H). Furthermore,  forced activation of cytokine signaling did not alter expression of  Pattern-Recognition Receptors (PRRs) including RIG-I and  TLR3 (Figure S3H). Expression of TLR-7/8 was also examined  but they were undetectable in A549 cells.  Since alteration of cytokine signaling did not affect the levels of  PRRs and viral RNA and given that IRF3 is a known regulator of  IFN expression at the early stage of infection, we determined  whether there was a functional link between IFN-l signaling and activation of nuclear factor of kB (NF-kB), a key transcriptional  factor downstream of RIG-I pathway [31]. To this end, cells were  infected with IAV using increasing MOI. Interestingly, experiment  using luciferase reporter gene revealed a positive correlation  between increased NF-kB activity and increased expression of SOCS-1 and IFN-l in infected cells (Figure 6A, B). By contrast, STAT1 phosphorylation and IkB protein levels were consistently reduced (Figure 6C). To further confirm this finding, we employed  the A549 cell lines stably expressing SOCS-1 shRNA or active  form of STAT1. We observed that in infected cells, depletion of  SOCS-1 increased IkB protein level (Figure 6D) and significantly decreased NF-kB activation (Figure 6E). Similarly, forced activa- tion of STAT1 inhibited the degradation of IkB (Figure 6F), and as a result, activation of NF-kB was significantly suppressed in the infected cells (Figure 6G). In contrast, low IkB level and high level of NF-kB activation were detected in SOCS-1-overexpressing cells after IAV infection even using low MOI (Figure S4A, S4B).  Consistent with these observations, immunofluorescence micros-  copy study showed that nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 was significantly abrogated in SOCS-1-ablated or STAT1-activated  cells infected with IAV (Figure 6H, I and Figure S4C, S4D).  Together, these results suggest that disruption of cytokine signaling  pathway results in robust activation of NF-kB, which causes excessive production of IFN-l during IAV infection.  Suppression of cytokine signaling by IAV-induced SOCS-1 contributes to overproduction of IFN-l in vivo  To confirm the correlation of type III IFN expression with the  activation of STAT-1 and NF-kB signaling, a time course study was performed in more detail in infected cell culture (Figure 7A).  The results indicated that disruption of IFN-l signal by SOCS-1 increased their expression likely through activating NF-kB in IAV infected cells. Next, we sought to determine the expression levels of  SOCS-1 in mouse lung at different stages of IAV infection. We  found that MLD50 of the WSN virus was approximately  36103 pfu under our conditions, consistent with the previous observation [32]. Therefore, mice were inoculated intranasally  with 16105 pfu of the virus (about 33 MLD50) as previously described [33,34]. As shown in Figure 7B, expression of SOCS-1  protein was consistently increased during 3 days of infection. As a  consequence, STAT1 phosphorylation was inhibited (Figure 7B).  Moreover, activity of NF-kB was elevated during the infection as indicated by the gradually diminished IkBa levels, suggesting that the expression kinetics of IFN-l correlated with NF-kB activation. Of interest, expression of SOCS-1 was earlier and faster than that  of IFN-l (Figure S5A, B), suggesting that SOCS-1 expression is cytokine-independent at least at the early stage of infection and  SOCS-1 might regulate IFN-l expression beyond negative feedback regulation to respond the cytokines in vivo. This finding  is consistent with our in vitro results presented above (Figure 3C,  D).  To further address the relationship between the expression of  SOCS-1 and the induction of IFN-l, membrane-permeable peptides of SOCS-1-KIR and pJAK2 were used to mimic  SOCS-1 overexpression and counteract SOCS-1 function,  respectively. The functions of these peptides in IFN-l response were confirmed in vitro, as the phosphorylation of STAT1  stimulated by IL-29 was dramatically inhibited in the presence  of SOCS-1-KIR but not the control peptide SOCS-1-KIR2A  (Figure 7C), and the inhibitory effect of SOCS-1-KIR on STAT1  phosphorylation was markedly diminished when SOCS-1-KIR  was added together with pJAK2 peptide (Figure 7F). When mice  were treated with these peptides and then inoculated with IAV,  IFN-l level was significantly increased in mice treated by SOCS- 1-KIR (Figure 7D and Figure S5C). By contrast, the expression of  SOCS-1 Causes Interferon Lambda Overproduction  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845    IFN-l in mice treated with pJAK2 peptide was significantly reduced as compared to control group (Figure 7G and Figure  S5D). Furthermore, low levels of STAT1 phosphorylation and  IkBa protein were found in SOCS-1-KIR treated mice after IAV infection (Figure 7E), whereas high levels of STAT1 phosphory-  lation and IkBa protein were present in pJAK2 treated group (Figure 7H). In addition, our experiments showed that treatment  with SOCS-1-KIR increased mouse body weight loss, whereas  pJAK2 treatment reduced the body weight loss during IAV  infection (Figure S5E-F). Together, these data suggest that  JAK-STAT signaling pathway is disrupted by increased SOCS-1  in infected mice, which results in an increase in IFN-l expression likely through activating NF-kB.  Silencing SOCS-1 significantly reduces IFN-l expression in transgenic mice during IAV infection  To further define the role of SOCS-1 in IFN-l production induced by IAV, we wished to establish a more physiological  model system for analysis of SOCS-1 involvement in this process.

The  transgenic founders with high interference efficiency were selected  (Figure 8C, D). We found that the level of STAT1 phosphory-  lation was greatly increased in TG compared to wild type (WT)  mice after IAV infection (Figure 8E). In contrast, the activity of  NF-kB was reduced as indicated by increased IkBa level. Consistent with this, expression of IFN-l was significantly decreased in IAV infected TG mice (Figure 8F, G). Furthermore,  by haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, we found that on Day 3  p.i., the lung in mice showed obvious inflammation, but the  inflammation in the lung of SOCS-1 knockdown TG mice was  minor compared to WT control (Figure S6A). Less body weight  loss was observed and Less viral load was detected in the lung of  TG mice than that in WT group (Figure 8H and Figure S6B-C),  suggesting that although IFN-l expression is reduced in SOCS-1 knockdown TG mice, the innate antiviral immune response is  enhanced.  Discussion  The clearance of IAV during infection depends on the  activation of effective innate and adaptive immune responses.  Cytokines activate innate immune responses and initiate the  development of adaptive, virus-specific immune responses [37,38].  Thus, cytokines play critical roles in defense against the virus  infection. Various types of cells in host secrete cytokines and  chemokines following IAV infection. Among these cell types,  epithelial cells are thought to be one of the most important  cytokine-producing cells during IAV infection, and believed to be  vital for the virus-induced cytokine storm [39]. We have previously  profiled the cellular transcriptional response to IAV infection in  human type II alveolar epithelial cell line A549 and found that this  type of cell expresses many different cytokines and chemokines  after the virus infection [22]. In this study, we show that IAV  infection induces excessive expression of IFN-l that is mainly dependent on RIG-I signaling and partially on TLR3 signaling,  indicating that they are involved in the innate antiviral response to  the infection. This observation is consistent with previous studies  showing that IFN-l are the predominant IFNs induced by respiratory viruses and have a wide range of antiviral functions  in response to respiratory viruses [11], hepatitis C virus [40],  rotavirus [12], herpes simplex virus [41] and influenza virus [42].  IFN-l receptor complex is composed of the ubiquitously expressed short chain IL-10R2 and the long chain IL-28R1  expressed preferentially on epithelial cells [12]. IFN-ls bind the receptors to activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway which  initiates transcription of the ISGs. Thus, IFN-ls, like other types of IFNs, play important roles in the control of IAV propagation in  epithelial cells [42,43]. Since IFNs are important in a variety of  cellular processes, their production and response are delicately  regulated by multiple mechanisms. Viruses have evolved different  ways to counteract these mechanisms, leading to dysregulation of  IFN expression and function, and then successfully evaded the host  antiviral response. IAV also exerts its effects through some  mechanisms. For example, the viral non-structural protein 1  (NS1) has been shown to inhibit type I IFN response and block  IFN-b production. On the other hand, it has also been shown that  the capacity of NS1 to confer resistance to host immune response  by decreasing sensitivity to particular cytokines causes their  overproduction [39]. It remains an ongoing task to determine  whether overproduction of IFN-ls is regulated by the NS1. Recently, it has been shown that IAV induces expression of  SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 to negatively regulate JAK-STAT pathway  and thereby down-regulates the innate immune response  including abrogation of the type I IFN signaling [17]. In the  present study, we found that SOCS-1 was greatly induced before  the abundant secretion of cytokines in both IAV-infected A549  cells and IAV-infected mice, strongly indicating that during IAV  infection, there is a cytokine-independent mechanism to provoke  SOCS-1 expression at least at the early stage. Similarly, it has  been reported that early induction of SOCS-3 transcription is  IFN-b-independent [17]. However, Julien and coworkers have observed that up-regulation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 in IAV-  infected cells is IFNAR1-dependent [18], which does not  contradict with our observation, because we found that the  culture supernatants at the later stages of infection indeed  stimulated SOCS-1 expression. Therefore, we conclude that IAV  might induce cytokines-independent SOCS-1 expression through  other mechanisms, and at least this is true at the early stage of  IAV infection.  Our experiments demonstrated that IAV-provoked STAT1  phosphorylation at the early stage of infection was inhibited by the  virus-induced SOCS-1. Furthermore, we provided evidence that  JAK-STAT signaling activated by IFN-l was also inhibited by SOCS-1. It has been previously shown that IAV abrogates the  innate immune response mediated by type I IFNs and IFN-c by disruption of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway [17,20]. However,  little is known about how suppression of cytokine signaling by  SOCS proteins affects the production of IFNs during IAV  infection. Interestingly, here we found that the IFN-l levels were significantly decreased in IAV infected SOCS-1-depleted A549  cells and transgenic mice as compared to infected controls.  Importantly, forced activation of STAT1 also significantly inhibits  the production of IFN-l in vitro and in vivo. Despite decreased expression of IFN-l, the antiviral response was not impaired in SOCS-1-depleted cell and animal. These results suggest that  suppression of IFN-l signaling by SOCS-1 results in their excessive production during IAV infection. Our hypothesis is that  suppression of cytokine signaling by virus-induced SOCS-1 leads  to an adaptive increase in IFN-l production by host to protect cells against viral infection. However, increased IFN-l further induces the expression of SOCS-1 at late stage of infection, which  in turn, inhibits the activation of JAK-STAT signaling. Finally,  this vicious cycle results in the excessive production of IFN-l with an impaired antiviral activity due to increased SOCS-1 protein  during IAV infection. Although we observed that forced activation  of IFN signal also slightly decreased the levels of type I IFNs,  whether this hypothesis applies to other cytokine storm provoked  by highly virulent influenza virus infection is unclear. In addition,  we found that after IAV infection, the SOCS-1 knockdown  transgenic mice did not display a remarkable phenotype as  compared to wild type mice. However, it is possible that SOCS-1-  mediated upregulation of IFN-l levels has a more prominent role in pathogenesis of highly pathogenic strains of IAV that elicit  indicated antibodies.

These remain to be  further determined.  Our study has also begun to address the mechanism by which  inhibition of cytokine signaling causes the excessive expression of  IFN-l during IAV infection. We presume that the repression of STAT1 might activate other transcriptional factors to elevate  cytokine levels. Previous studies have shown that aryl hydrocarbon  receptor couples with STAT1 to regulate lipopolysaccharide-  induced inflammatory responses [44]. It has also been revealed  that progressive dysregulation of NF-kB and STAT1 leads to pro- angiogenic production of CXC chemokines [45]. It is thought that  NF-kB and STAT1 might have a crosstalk [46-48]. Although it is unclear how the phosphorylation of STAT1 can be associated with  NF-kB activation [49], our data showed that IAV inhibited  Figure 7.

Moreover, our results revealed that IkBa was degraded and thereby the activity of NF-kB was increased when SOCS-1 was  up-regulated by IAV. In fact, this finding is consistent not only  with the enhancement of NF-kB activity in SOCS-1 overex- pressed-keratinocytes after stimulation by the poly-(I:C), but also  with the increased NF-kB activation in SOCS-1-transfected cells  Figure 8.

Together, these data suggest that suppression of cytokine  signaling by SOCS-1 may influence the NF-kB activation. Further research is required to address how inhibition of JAK-STAT  signaling is involved in regulation of NF-kB activation.  Materials and Methods  Ethics statement The mouse experimental design and protocols used in this study  were approved by \u2018\u2018the regulation of the Institute of Microbiology,  Chinese Academy of Sciences of Research Ethics Committee''  (Permit Number: PZIMCAS2012001). All mouse experimental  procedures were performed in accordance with the Regulations  for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental  Animals approved by the State Council of People's Republic of  China.  Influenza virus and infection Influenza virus strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was prepared as  previously described [22,51]. For infection, cells were washed with  phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with the multiplicity  of infection (MOI) as indicated in the figure legends. After  adsorption with a-MEM medium containing 2 mg/ml TPCK (L- 1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone)-treated trypsin,  100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin for 45 minutes at 37uC, the supernatant was aspirated and cells were cultured with the a-MEM medium for indicated time. To inactivate the viruses, equal amounts of viruses were incubated at 56uC or 65uC for 30 minutes as described previously [24].  Plasmids and luciferase assay Plasmids pRC-CMV-STAT1-WT and pRC-CMV-STAT1-2C  in which N658 and A656 of STAT1 were substituted by cysteine  residues were kindly provided by Dr. David A. Frank (Dana-  Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The cDNA coding STAT1-  WT or STAT1-2C was subcloned into the Not I/Sal I sites of  retroviral vector pMSCV-IRES-GFP (pMIG) to generate pMIG-  STAT1-WT and pMIG-STAT1-2C. The vector pMIG-SOCS-1  was previously described [13]. NF-kB-luciferase reporter named pNF-kB-Luc and Renilla luciferase reporter named pRL-TK were gifts from Dr. Shijuan Gao (Institute of Microbiology, Chinese  Academy of Sciences). For luciferase assay, cells were co-  transfected with pNF-kB-Luc, pRL-TK and indicated plasmids, and luciferase activity was measured using the dual-luciferase  reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's instruction  (Promega, U.S.).  Antibodies and peptides The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-STAT1  (E23), anti-phospho-STAT1 (Tyr701), anti-RIG-I, anti-NF-kB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); and anti-b-actin (Abcam). All other antibodies were obtained as previously described  [13,51]. Peptides of SOCS-1-KIR ( (53)  DTHFRTFRSHSDYRRI),  SOCS-1-KIR2A ( (53)  DTHFATFASHSDYRRI) and pJAK2 ( (1001)  LPQDKEYYKVKEP) were synthesized by ChinaPeptides (Shanghai, China). All peptides were synthesized with an attached  lipophilic group, palmitic acid, to facilitate entry into cells as  previously described [16,52]. Peptides were purified by preparative  RP-HPLC, and were characterized by LC-MS and HPLC analysis.  Cytokines, cell stimulation, and ELISA Recombinant human IL-28A and IL-29 were purchased from  PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Cells were incubated with the  recombinant IL-29 (50 ng/ml) for 45 minutes for stimulation,  unless otherwise indicated. Supernatant culture medium from the  A549 cells infected with IAV strain A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was also  used as a source of virus-induced cytokines for cell stimulation. To  quantify IL-29 production by host cells, supernatant culture  medium from virus infected cells was harvested and examined by  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the ready-  SET-Go of human IL-29 analysis kit (eBioscience, San Diego, CA)  according to manufacturer's instruction.  Stimulation of cells with RNA Total RNA was prepared from A549 cells infected with the IAV  for 8 hours (viral RNA) or from uninfected cells (cellular RNA)  using Trizol (TIANGEN BIOTECH BEIJING CO., LTD.)  according to manufacturer's instructions. The calf intestine  alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) (TaKaRa) was used to dephosphor-  ylate viral 59-triphosphate RNA as previously described [17].  A549 cells were transfected with the isolated RNA using  Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Supernatant medium from  transfected cells was harvested and examined by ELISA for IL-  29 production. The transfected cells were lysed and examined by  real-time PCR for expression of indicated genes.  Western blotting and immunofluorescence For Western blotting analysis, cell lysates were separated by  SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a  nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with indicated antibodies  as described previously [53]. To detect nuclear translocation of  NF-kB p65, immunofluorescence was performed as described previously [22]. Images were acquired using a confocal micro-  scope (Model LSCMFV500) and a 606 oil immersion objective lens (both from Olympus Optical, Japan) with an NA of 1.40.  RNA interference and generation of stable cell lines Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based knockdown cell lines were  generated by infection of A549 with lentiviruses expressing specific  shRNA in pSIH-H1-GFP vector as described previously [22]. The  sequences used in the shRNAs targeting specific genes were as  follows: human SOCS-1 shRNA#1 59-GCATCCGCGTGCAC- TTTCA-39 [54] and shRNA#2 59-CTACCTGAGCTCCTTCC- CCTT-39 [55], mouse SOCS-1 shRNA#1 59-GGACGCCTGC- GGCTTCTAT-39 and shRNA#2 59-CTACCTGAGTTCCTT- CCCCTT-39 [56], human RIG-I shRNA#1 59-TGCAATCT- TGTCATCCTTTAT-39 and shRNA#2 59-AAATTCATCAGA- GATAGTCAA-39 [57], and human TLR3 shRNA#1 59-GGTA- TAGCCAGCTAACTAG-39 and shRNA#2 59-ACTTAAATGT- GGTTGGTAA-39 and human MDA5 shRNA#1 59-CCAA- CAAAGAAGCAGTGTATA-39 [58] and luciferase (Luc) control  shRNA 59-CTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA-39. A549 cell lines  stably expressing STAT1-WT, STAT1-2C, SOCS-1 or empty  vector (EV) were generated by infecting the cells with retroviruses  encoding these genes in pMIG vector as previously described [13].  Mouse experiments Female BALB/c mice (5-6 weeks old, 18-20 g) were provided  by Vital River Laboratory Animal Center (Beijing, China). To  determine the 50% mouse lethal dose (MLD50) of the virus, six  groups of five mice were inoculated intranasally with 10-fold serial  dilutions of virus. MLD50 titres were calculated by the method of  Reed and Muench [59]. For infection, mice were inoculated  intranasally with 16105 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the A/ WSN/33 virus. For the peptide treatment, 2 days before viral  infection, mice were pre-administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) once  a day with peptide using 5 mg/kg body weight. On the indicated  SOCS-1 Causes Interferon Lambda Overproduction  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003845    day of post-infection (p.i.), the mice were then euthanized and  their lungs were removed for further analysis by Western blotting  and RT-PCR.  Generation of SOCS-1-knockdown transgenic mice SOCS-1-knockdown transgenic mice were generated by the  microinjection method as previously described [35,36]. Briefly,  shRNA-expressing vector targeting mouse SOCS-1 was linearized  by Sca I. The transgenic mice were generated by the microinjec-  tion and genotyped by PCR using specific primers of up-stream:  59-AAATCCTGGTTGCTGTCTCTTTATGG-39 and down-  stream: 59-GGAAGGTCCGCTGGATTGA-39. A 350 bp frag-  ment of the shRNA cassette was amplified, which represented  integration of the transgenic DNA. Transgenic mice were  analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-SOCS-1 antibody.  The transgenic founders with high interference efficiency were  selected and maintained on a BALB/c genetic background.  Statistical analysis Comparison between groups was made using Student's t-test.  Data represent the mean 6 SD. Differences were considered  statistically significant with P,0.05.  Supporting Information  Figure S1 IAV infection induces robust expression of IFN-ls in A549 cells mainly through a RIG-I-dependent pathway. (A) The differentially expressed genes in A549 cells infected with or without A/WSN/33 influenza virus were  analyzed by cDNA microarray in our previous study (ncbi.nlm.-  nih.gov; access number GSE32878). Shown are representative  genes whose expressions were most significantly changed. (B, C) A549 cells were infected with or without WSN virus (MOI = 1) for  15 h, the expression of IL-28A/B and IL-29 was examined by RT-  PCR (B) and IL-29 in supernatants was measured by ELISA (C).  (D) A549 cells were transfected with indicated amount of \u2018\u2018Viral RNA'' using Lipofectamine 2000 (L2000). After 4 h post  transfection, ELISA was performed to examine the expression of  IL-29. (E) A549 cells were transfected with indicated amount of WSN genomic RNA (VG-RNA) as described in D. The expression  of IL-29 and Mx1 was examined by RT-PCR. (F) ELISA was performed to examine the expression of IL-29 in supernatants  from cells treated as described in Figure 1E. (G) A549 cells expressing shRNAs targeting MDA5 or luciferase (Luc) were  infected with or without the WSN, and then the expression of IL-  28A/B and IL-29 was examined by RT-PCR. (H) IL-29 levels and RIG-I/TLR3/MDA5 levels of infected cells in (G) and Figure 1G-  H were quantitated by densitometry, and normalized to control  GAPDH levels as described in Figure 2D. Genes expression levels  in luciferase A549 cells were set to 100%. Plotted are the average  levels from three independent experiments. The error bars  represent the S.E. Statistical significance of change was deter-  mined by Student's t-test (*P,0.05, **P,0.01).  (TIF)  Figure S2 IAV-induced-SOCS-1 mainly regulates the autocrine cytokine signaling. (A, B) A549 cells were infected with WSN (MOI = 1 in (A); MOI = 0.5 in (B)) for 15 hrs or  uninfected. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using  anti-SOCS1 (mouse antibody) and NP (rabbit antibody) (A) or  anti-pSTAT1 (rabbit antibody) and NS1 (mouse antibody) (B) to  detect the expression of these proteins in cells. More than 70% of  A549 cells were infected when an MOI of 1 pfu per cell was used  to infect the cells for 15 hours and increased expression of SOCS-  1 occurred specifically in infected cells (A). In addition, levels of  phosphor-STAT1 were markedly lower in infected cells than those  in non-infected cells (B). The nuclei were stained with DAPI. Bar,  10 mm. (C) Supernatants derived from IAV-infected A549 cells (15 h p.i.) were collected and used to stimulate the native A549  cells for indicated time. Cells were lysed and the expression of  SOCS-1 was detected by RT-PCR. (D) ELISA was performed to examine the expression of IL-29 in A549 cells infected with or  without WSN (MOI = 1) for indicated time.  (TIF)  Figure S3 Forced activation of cytokine signaling slight- ly reduced expression of type I IFN but increased expression of OAS-2 and Mx1 at early time point post infection. (A, B) A549 cells stably expressing shRNAs targeting luciferase or SOCS-1 (A) and A549 cells stably expressing empty  vector (EV), STAT1-WT (WT), or active form of STAT1  (STAT1-2C) (B) were infected with or without WSN (MOI = 1)  for 15 h. The mRNA levels of IFN-a and IFN-b were examined by RT-PCR. (C) IFN-a and IFN-b levels of infected cells in (A) and (B) were quantitated by densitometry, and normalized to  control GAPDH levels as described. Plotted are the average levels  from three independent experiments. The error bars represent the  S.E. (D, E) A549 cell lines described in (A) and (B) were infected with or without WSN (MOI = 1) for 6 h. Then mRNA levels of  OAS-2 and Mx1 were examined by RT-PCR. (F) Mx1 and OAS- 2 levels of infected cells in (D) and (E) were quantitated by  densitometry, and normalized to control GAPDH levels as  described. Plotted are the average levels from three independent  experiments. The error bars represent the S.E. (G, H) Forced activation of cytokine signaling had no effects on levels of viral  RNA and PRRs. Experiments were carried out as described in (A)  and (B). mRNA levels of viral NS1 (G, H) and Pattern-Recognition  Receptors (PRRs) including TLR3, RIG-I (H) were examined by  RT-PCR.  (TIF)  Figure S4 Disruption of IFN-l signaling pathway results in activation of NF-kB during IAV infection. (A) A549 cells over-expressing SOCS-1 (S1) or empty vector (EV) were infected  with WSN for 15 h or uninfected. Cell lysates were analyzed by  Western blotting using indicated antibodies. (B) 293T cells were co-transfected with pNFkB-Luc, pRL-TK and pMIG-SOCS-1 or control empty vector (EV) for 10 hrs. Then cells were uninfected  or infected with IAV for 15 h and relative luciferase activity was  measured.
