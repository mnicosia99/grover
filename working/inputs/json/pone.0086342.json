    "summary": "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity is an essential enzymatic step in the formation of neutral lipid i.e., triacylglycerol in all living cells capable of accumulating storage lipid. Previously, we characterized an oleaginous yeast Candida tropicalis SY005 that yields storage lipid up to 58% under a specific nitrogen-stress condition, when the DGAT-specific transcript is drastically up-regulated. Here we report the identification, differential expression and function of two DGAT2 gene homologues--CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b of this C. tropicalis. Two protein isoforms are unique with respect to the presence of five additional stretches of amino acids, besides possessing three highly conserved motifs known in other reported DGAT2 enzymes. Moreover, the CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are characteristically different in amino acid sequences and predicted protein structures. The CtDGAT2b isozyme was found to be catalytically 12.5% more efficient than CtDGAT2a for triacylglycerol production in a heterologous yeast system i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant strain H1246 that is inherently defective in neutral lipid biosynthesis. The CtDGAT2b activity rescued the growth of transformed S. cerevisiae mutant cells, which are usually non-viable in the medium containing free fatty acids by incorporating them into triacylglycerol, and displayed preferential specificity towards saturated acyl species as substrate. Furthermore, we document that the efficiency of triacylglycerol production by CtDGAT2b is differentially affected by deletion, insertion or replacement of amino acids in five regions exclusively present in two CtDGAT2 isozymes. Taken together, our study characterizes two structurally novel DGAT2 isozymes, which are accountable for the enhanced production of storage lipid enriched with saturated fatty acids inherently in C. tropicalis SY005 strain as well as in transformed S. cerevisiae neutral lipid-deficient mutant cells. These two genes certainly will be useful for further investigation on the novel structure-function relationship of DGAT repertoire, and also in metabolic engineering for the enhanced production of lipid feedstock in other organisms.",

Medical Sciences, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Chonnam National University Medical School, Gwangju, Republic of Korea  Abstract  The orphan nuclear receptor estrogen-related receptor-c (ERRc) is a constitutively active transcription factor regulating genes involved in several important cellular processes, including hepatic glucose metabolism, alcohol metabolism, and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. cAMP responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH) is an ER-bound bZIP family transcription factor that is activated upon ER stress and regulates genes encoding acute-phase proteins whose expression is increased in response to inflammation. Here, we report that ERRc directly regulates CREBH gene expression in response to ER stress. ERRc bound to the ERRc response element (ERRE) in the CREBH promoter. Overexpression of ERRc by adenovirus significantly increased expression of CREBH as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas either knockdown of ERRc or inhibition of ERRc by ERRc specific inverse agonist, GSK5182, substantially inhibited ER stress-mediated induction of CREBH and CRP. The transcriptional coactivator PGC1a was required for ERRc mediated induction of the CREBH gene as demonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showing binding of both ERRc and PGC1a on the CREBH promoter. The ChIP assay also revealed that histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurred at the ERRc and PGC1a binding site. Moreover, chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis, as well as the diabetic obese condition significantly increased CRP gene expression, and this increase was significantly attenuated by GSK5182 treatment. We suggest that orphan nuclear receptor ERRc directly regulates the ER-bound transcription factor CREBH in response to ER stress and other metabolic conditions.

These orphan nuclear receptors regulate transcription via ERREs but do not bind endogenous estrogen [1]. The ERRs are  named due to the conservation in the structure of their DNA-  binding domains/DBDs with the highly homologous Estrogen  Receptor [2]. Crystallographic studies indicate that the ERRs  along with ERRc are constitutively active without a natural ligand, while several synthetic ligands either stimulate or repress  the activity of ERRc by promoting or disrupting ERR-coactivator interactions [3]. Among them GSK5182, a 4-hydroxy tamoxifen  analogue, is a selective inverse agonist of ERRc and directly binds to the ligand binding domain and inhibits transactivation by  ERRc [4-8]. ERRc is primarily expressed in heart, brain, kidney, pancreas and liver tissues [3]. We previously reported that hepatic  ERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by directly binding to the Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose 6-  phosphatase (G6Pase) promoters along with coactivator PGC-1a  [5]. Previous results from our laboratory also demonstrated that  ERRc directly binds to the LIPIN1 promoter along with coactivator PGC-1a to regulate LIPIN1 gene expression, and inhibits hepatic insulin signaling [6]. ERRc also controls hepatic CB1 receptor-mediated CYP2E1 expression at the transcriptional  level and thus contributes to the oxidative liver injury by alcohol  [7]. Finally, hypoxia induces PDK4 gene expression through  induction of ERRc [8]. The transcriptional activity of the ERR family is dependent on interactions with coactivators, in particular  PGC-1a and PGC-1b [9]. ERRa and ERRc regulate mitochon- drial programs involved in oxidative phosphorylation and a  nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinates  the postnatal metabolic transition in the heart [9]. Though all  these reports clearly suggest a key role of ERRc in different cellular processes, its role in ER stress is yet to be determined.  ER stress is a state associated with perturbation of ER  homeostasis and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins  in the ER [10]. CREBH, an ER-stress-activated liver enriched  transcription factor, has been previously reported to transcrip-  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342    tionally activate acute phase response genes in the liver in response  to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines  interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) [11]. Recently, CREBH has been demonstrated to play a critical role in  ER-stress-mediated regulation of iron metabolism via induction of  hepcidin (Hamp) gene expression, in triglyceride metabolism and  hepatic lipogenesis, and in the mediation of the hormonal  regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis under fasting or insulin-  resistant conditions [12-15], thereby underlining the importance  of CREBH in various hepatic metabolic pathways. Recent studies  from our group have demonstrated that activation of Cb1r leads to  phosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling  pathway which in turn activates CREBH. This Cb1r-JNK-  CREBH pathway was further demonstrated to regulate hepatic  gluconeogenesis by regulating key gluconeogenic genes (PEPCK,  and G6Pase) and lipid metabolism by regulating Lipin1 [16-17].  Our group has also reported that hepatic cannabinoid receptor  type 1 mediates alcohol-induced regulation of bile acid enzyme  genes (CYP7A1, and CYP27A1) expression via CREBH [18].  PGC-1a, a member of a small family of coactivators, was identified using yeast two hybrid assays for PPARc-interacting proteins [19] and is implicated in mitochondrial metabolism,  thermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, adipocyte differentia-  tion, gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake [20-21]. PGC-1a targets promoters by interacting directly with numerous DNA binding  transcription factors and then coordinating several biochemical  events, including recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes  such as p300/CBP and SRC-1, interaction with the basal  transcription machinery and linking of transcription to RNA  splicing [22].  C-reactive protein (CRP) in comparison to other inflammation  markers is a relatively stable, robust and an exquisitely sensitive  serum protein. In some studies, CRP level in plasma predicts  cardiovascular events even better than low-density lipoprotein  cholesterol level [23]. Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic  studies have shown that CRP is not just a marker but rather an  active mediator for endothelial dysfunction, arterial thrombosis  and atherogenesis [24-25]. CRP, as an inflammatory cytokine, is  primarily synthesized in liver and regulated in response to  interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b) [26-28]. Hepato- cytes are believed to be the major contributor of circulating CRP  in plasma. Therefore, hepatic CRP is able to cause liver per se  damage and inflammation, and plays a key role in the  development of atherosclerosis when entering into the blood  circulation. In hepatoma cell lines, the endogenous CRP gene is  either dysregulated or weakly active [29]. However, plasma levels  of CRP may rise rapidly and markedly (.1000 fold) after an acute  inflammation in human [30].  Here, we examined the mechanism of how nuclear receptor,  ERRc regulates ER bound bZIP transcription factor, CREBH under the conditions of ER stress. Upon ER stress, expression of  both transcription factors increases significantly. ERRc directly binds to the CREBH promoter. Of interest, PGC1a acts as a coactivator for ERRc. We observed a significant increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation in CREBH promoters upon  induction of ER stress by tunicamycin (Tm) treatment. Knock-  down of ERRc significantly decreases the expression of CREBH  Figure 1. ERRc induces CREBH gene. (A,B), AML12 cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-ERRc for 24 hr.

Animal Experiments Male 7-12-week-old C57BL/6J mice or db/db mice (Charles  River Laboratories) were acclimatized to a 12 hr light-dark cycle  at 2262uC with free access to food and water in a specific pathogen-free facility. Tunicamycin (Tm) (1 mg/kg, i.p. in 1%  DMSO/DW) was administered by intraperitoneal injection into  C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 per group) or Ad-GFP or Ad-ERRc were injected via tail-vein into male C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 per group).  Where indicated, GSK5182 was administered first (40 mg/kg, p.o.  in 30% PEG400/DW) by intraperitoneal injection and after 30  minutes Tm (1 mg/kg, i.p. in 1% DMSO/DW) was administered  by intraperitoneal injection into C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 per group).  For the chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis model, four groups of  five mice each were treated with alcohol-containing Lieber-  DeCarli formulation based liquid (Dyets, Bethlehem, Pennsylva-  nia, USA) diet (27.5% of total calories) for 4 weeks. For  alcohol+GSK5182 treatment, during the 4 weeks of feeding with alcohol (27.5% of total calories) liquid diet, GSK5182 (40 mg/kg,  oral, once-daily) was injected for the last 2 weeks into mice. For  diabetic mouse study, GSK5182 (40 mg/kg/day as a final dose)  and corn oil emulsion were sonicated again immediately before  injection of db/db mice. After 14 hr. of fasting, intraperitoneal  injections were performed for 5 days. All experiments were  conducted as previously described [7].  Chemicals and Antibodies Tm was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich and, GSK5182 was  synthesized as described previously [6].

Results  ERRc Induces CREBH Gene Expression Previous reports suggest various nuclear receptors and tran-  scription factors cross talk to regulate the mammalian ER stress  response [35-36]. In addition, the nuclear receptors GR, PPARa, and HNF4a regulate transcription of the ER bound transcription factor CREBH [15,36-37]. We demonstrated previously that  ERRc regulates ATF6a in response to ER stress [38]. To investigate whether ERRc regulates CREBH, which belongs to the same CREB3 family as ATF6 and is structurally related to it,  ERRc was overexpressed by Ad-ERRc in AML12 cells. Interest- ingly, CREBH mRNA level, as determined by qPCR, increased  more than six-fold after ERRc overexpression (Fig. 1A). CREBH protein level, as determined by Western blot, also increased under  the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). Next, to check  whether CREBH gene induction was ERRc specific, ERRa was overexpressed in AML12 cells by adenovirus. No significant  change in CREBH protein level was observed after ERRa overexpression, suggesting that CREBH gene induction is ERRc specific (Fig. 1C). To verify these in vitro results, mice were infected  with Ad-ERRc by tail vein injection. Consistent with the in vitro results, an almost fivefold increase in CREBH mRNA level was  observed. A significant increase in CREBH-N (active form) protein  level was also observed in vivo (Fig. 1D and 1E). As observed in the  mouse cell lines, we noticed a similar effect of ERRc overexpres- sion in HepG2 cells. ERRc overexpression significantly increased CREBH mRNA, and protein levels (Fig. 1F and G), indicating  Figure 4. ERRc regulates CREBH target gene.

Collectively these  results demonstrate that ERRc positively regulates CREBH gene expression.  ER Stress Induces CREBH Gene Expression via ERRc Next, we ascertained the molecular mechanism of ERRc-  mediated CREBH gene induction. A transient transfection assay  was performed with the ERRc expression vector and the mouse and human CREBH promoter- driven luciferase reporter gene  (Fig. 2A, and B). ERRc significantly enhanced both mouse and human CREBH promoter activity. It was reported previously that  tunicamycin (Tm) induces CREBH and ERRc gene expression [11,38]. To investigate whether Tm mediated activation of the  CREBH promoter depends on ERRc, a transient transfection assay was performed with the mouse CREBH promoter-driven  luciferase reporter gene. Tm treatment significantly increased  CREBH promoter activity but activation was severely compro-  mised when endogenous ERRc was knocked down (Fig. 2C). Next, AML12 cells were treated with Tm or infected with Ad-  shERRc to knockdown endogenous ERRc to observe the effect of ERRc knockdown on CREBH gene expression. As expected,  knockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly suppressed the Tm- mediated increase in CREBH mRNA level (Fig. 2D). Next, we  performed Western blot analyses to check the CREBH-N protein  level under the same experimental conditions. In agreement with  the mRNA level, CREBH-N protein level also decreased  significantly in response to Ad-shERRc infection (Fig. 2E) in AML12 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that  ERRc mediates the induction of CREBH gene expression by ER stress.  ERRc Activates CREBH Gene Promoter via an ERRE PGC1a acts as an ERRc coactivator [6]. To test whether  PGC1a and ERRc together play any role in the induction of CREBH, transient transfection assays were performed with the  mouse CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene and  ERRc and PGC1a expression vectors. ERRc significantly increased CREBH promoter activity, and this activity was further  augmented in the presence of PGC1a (Fig. 3A). A series of deletion constructs was analyzed to identify the DNA sequence  conferring the ERRc-mediated ER stress effect on the CREBH promoter. Deletion of the CREBH promoter sequence from  0.2 kb to 0.1 kb drastically decreased the promoter activity  conferred by ERRc, suggesting that the region from 0.2 kb to 0.1 kb confers activation of the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3B). It was  reported previously that ERRc binds to a consensus sequence AGGTCA [38]. We aligned this sequence with the CREBH  promoter region from 0.2 kb to 0.1 kb and found a perfect match  to the consensus sequence, AGGTCA, spanning the 0.2 kb to  0.1 kb region. Transient transfection assays were performed using  wild-type and AGGTCA mutant CREBH promoters with the  ERRc expression vector to test whether AGGTCA is critical for ERRc binding. This mutant reporter did not show any significant response to ERRc cotransfection (Fig. 3C). Next, the ChIP assay was performed to monitor the effect of Tm on ERRc and PGC1a recruitment to the endogenous CREBH gene promoter. Under  basal conditions, both ERRc and PGC1a occupied the CREBH promoter. However, Tm treatment significantly augmented ERRc and PGC1a occupancy on the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3D). The ChIP assay results provide critical in vivo evidence that the ER-  stress-ERRc-PGC1a signaling pathway increases CREBH gene transcription. Gene activation is often associated with increased  histone acetylation [39], and the ChIP assay was performed to  determine whether Tm treatment results in increased template-  associated histone (H3 and/or H4) acetylation of the CREBH  gene promoter in AML12 cells (Fig. 3E). Tm treatment and  adenoviral overexpression of ERRc and/or PGC1a increased acetylation of H3 (Ac-H3) and H4 (Ac-H4) on the ERRc- responsive region of the CREBH promoter, whereas knockdown  of endogenous ERRc or PGC1a significantly reduced histone (H3 and/or H4) acetylation. We observed a synergistic effect of ERRc and PGC1a overexpression on acetylation of H3 (Ac-H3) and H4 (Ac-H4) (Fig. 3E) which was in accordance with our previous  results (Fig. 3A) where, synergistic effect on CREBH promoter  activation was clearly observed by cotransfection of ERRc and PGC1a with CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene. Overall, these results demonstrate that ER stress augments the  binding of ERRc and PGC1a to the CREBH promoter and increases template-associated histone (H3 and H4) acetylation to  facilitate CREBH gene transcription.  Effect of ERRc Knockdown on CREBH-mediated Regulation of CRP Gene Expression Next, we examined regulation of CREBH target genes. Our  results (Figs. 1-3) demonstrate that ERRc regulates CREBH gene  Figure 5. ERRc inverse agonist inhibits CREBH and CRP in vivo. (A), GSK5182 was administered prior to (40 mg/kg, p.o. in 30% PEG400/ DW) and at 30 minutes after Tm (1 mg/kg, i.p. in 1% DMSO/DW) was administered into C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 per group). Following comple- tion of the experiments, mice were sacrificed, and liver tissues were obtained for western blot analyses of CRP, CREBH-N, and ERRc. (B), GSK5182 was administered (40 mg/kg, p.o. in 30% PEG400/DW) into C57BL/6J mice (n = 5 per group) or EtOH was administered into C57BL/ 6J mice (n = 5 per group) or first GSK5182 was administered and then EtOH was administered (n = 5 per group). After completion of the treatment, mice were sacrificed. Western blot analyses shows CRP, CREBH-N and ERRc expression in liver tissue. (C), GSK5182 was administered (40 mg/kg, p.o. in 30% PEG400/DW) into db/db mice (n = 5 per group) for 30 days. After completion of the treatment, mice were sacrificed.

CRP is a well-known marker  of various human diseases and is regulated by CREBH in response  to ER stress [11]. We examined the effect of ERRc knockdown on Tm mediated CRP promoter activation by transient transfection  assay in 293T cells to verify the effect of ERRc on CREBH target gene (Fig. 4A). Both Tm treatment and ERRc overexpression significantly increased CRP promoter activation. However,  knockdown of endogenous ERRc or CREBH significantly blunted the increase in CRP promoter activation by Tm. These results  demonstrate that Tm-induced CRP promoter activation is  mediated through ERRc. Next, ERRc was overexpressed in AML12 cells to confirm the effect of ERRc on CRP gene expression (Fig. 4B). As expected, ERRc overexpression signifi- cantly increased both CRP mRNA and protein levels, and this  increase was significantly attenuated upon endogenous CREBH  knockdown. This result indicates that ERRc regulates CRP gene expression through CREBH. Endogenous ERRc was knocked down in AML12 cells for further verification. In agreement with  the previous results, we observed that the Tm-mediated increase in  CRP mRNA and protein was substantially reduced after ERRc knockdown (Fig. 4C). Taken together, we demonstrated that  ERRc induces CREBH target genes by regulating CREBH itself.  Alcohol Feeding and Diabetic Obesity Induce Hepatic CREBH and CRP Gene Expression via Hepatic ERRc Our results (Figs. 1-4) demonstrate that ER stress induces  CREBH and CRP gene expression through ERRc in vitro. GSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERRc [4-8] that specifically binds to ERRc and inhibits ERRc transcriptional activity, was used to verify this effect in vivo. As expected from previous results,  we noticed that GSK5182 treatment substantially reduced Tm-  induced CREBH-N and CRP protein levels in mouse liver  (Fig. 5A). Moreover, ERRc protein levels were decreased upon Tm+GSK treatment as compared to Tm alone. This might be due to the mechanism of autoregulatory feed forward loop that  regulates ERRc gene expression [38]. Previous reports from our laboratory demonstrated that acute alcohol consumption induces  hepatic ERRc gene expression [8]. Mice were treated with EtOH to investigate whether ERRc induces CREBH-N and CRP gene expression. The EtOH treatment significantly increased CREBH-  N and CRP gene expression, along with ERRc. However, GSK5182 strongly inhibited both basal and alcohol-induced  hepatic CREBH-N, and CRP protein expression in mice liver  (Fig. 5B). Our laboratory reported previously that the diabetic  obese condition (db/db mice), induces ERRc gene expression [6]. A significant induction in CREBH-N and CRP protein levels were  observed under the same conditions. However, we observed that  GSK5182 treatment substantially suppressed both CREBHN, and  CRP protein levels in db/db mice liver in accordance with previous  results (Fig. 5C). Overall, we demonstrated that ERRc regulates CREBH gene expression in vitro and in vivo.  Discussion  ER stress activates the unfolded protein response to generate  multiple transcription factors that function in different cellular  phenomena including chromatin remodeling [40-44]. Our results  provide direct evidence for a newly recognized function of ERRc during transcriptional regulation of CREBH in response to ER  stress, as well as in diabetic obese condition [38,11]. The  coactivator PGC1a plays a crucial role in this regulation. Moreover, chromatin remodeling during subsequent transcription  events was observed and provided a mechanistic basis for the  ERRc-mediated induction of CREBH under different physiolog- ical conditions.  We reported previously that ERRc directly regulates ATF6a, an ER membrane-bound bZIP transcription factor, in response to  ER stress [38]. CREBH is also an ER membrane-bound bZIP  transcription factor that belongs to the same CREB3 family as  ATF6a [11]. Moreover, we reported an increase in CREBH mRNA level following ERRc overexpression, although not as much as that of ATF6a [38]. Hence, we investigated the role of ERRc in the regulation of ER-bound transcription factor CREBH under different physiological conditions including ER stress. We  observed significant enhancement of CREBH gene expression by  overexpressing ERRc in vitro and in vivo. A six-fold increase in CREBH mRNA level was noticed along with a significant increase  in the CREBH-N form in response to ERRc overexpression (Fig. 1). CREBH is regulated by nuclear receptor PPARa, HNF4a, and GR [36-37,15]; hence, our current findings further establish the interconnection between nuclear receptors and ER  membrane-bound transcription factors.  According to previous reports, ER stress activates both CREBH  and ERRc gene expression [11,38]. As we observed CREBH gene induction by ERRc (Fig. 1), we speculated that ERRc might be involved in ER stressmediated induction of CREBH. In fact,  knockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly reduced ER stress- induced CREBH mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2), further  supporting the ER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. It has been reported that ERRc activates target genes by directly binding to the ERRE on the promoter of the target gene [38]. This led us to  speculate the presence of ERRE on the CREBH promoter, and  we identified a potential site (AGGTCA) on the CREBH promoter  for ERRc binding. The ChIP assay provided further crucial evidence and confirmed ERRc binding on the CREBH promoter under ER stress. PGC1a is closely associated with ERRc transcriptional activity [3]. Several lines of evidence have shown  that the transcriptional regulation of PDK4 expression by PGC1a is mediated by ERRa or ERRc [45]. In accordance with these previous reports, occupancy of PGC1a on ERRE of the CREBH promoter was observed during ER stress, providing critical in vivo  evidence indicating that PGC1a is a coactivator for ERRc. Gene repression is often associated with decreased histone acetylation  [39]. Chromatin remodeling also occurs during coactivator gene  transcription [46]. In agreement with previous reports, a  significant increase in template-associated histone, H3, and H4  acetylation was noticed (H3 and H4) at the ERRE on CREBH  promoter following Tm treatment or ERRc overexpression, showing the importance of chromatin remodeling during gene  transcription (Fig. 3). Overall, our findings reveal a novel  molecular mechanism employed by ERRc linking transactivation of ERRc [38] to CREBH gene expression. Along with past indications of a probable nuclear receptor/ER membrane-bound  transcription factor interconnection, these data raise the possibility  (discussed further below) that ERRc may serve as a key mediator in ER stress-induced CREBH gene expression.  CRP, a known marker for several pathological conditions  including ER stress, is regulated by CREBH [11]. Besides being a  marker, CRP is an active mediator of endothelial dysfunction,  arterial thrombosis, and atherogenesis [24-25]. Numerous groups  have shown pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of CRP  in vitro [25,47-48]. Transgenic expression of human CRP  suppresses endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and  bioactivity following vascular injury [49]. Several lines of evidence  suggest that CRP is a modulator that drives direct biological effects  on vascular cells. CRP, at concentrations known to predict adverse  vascular events, directly quenches the production of the NO, in  Regulation of CREBH by ERRc  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342    part, through a post-transcriptional effect on endothelial NO  synthase mRNA stability. Diminished NO bioactivity, in turn,  inhibits angiogenesis, an important compensatory mechanism  during chronic ischemia [50]. CRP has also been implicated in  glucose metabolism. CRP infusion induces an inflammatory  response followed by increased norepinephrine and cortisol levels,  which result in increased gluconeogenesis [51]. Our initial results  (Figs. 1-3) linking ER stress to ERRc-mediated induction of CREBH, raise the possibility that ERRc might regulate CREBH target genes by regulating CREBH itself. ERRc significantly induced CRP gene expression (Fig. 4), which further verifies the  ER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. Alcohol consumption induces hepatic ERRc expression [8]. ERRc gene expression increases in the liver of db/db mice [6]. Moreover, ERRc along with CREBH are positive regulators of gluconeogenesis [6,15]. In agreement  with these previous reports, alcohol treatment significantly induced  both CREBH and CRP gene expression, and this augmentation  was substantially compromised upon ERRc inhibition in vivo (Fig. 5B). Regulation of CREBH by ERRc was further established when GSK5182 treatment significantly reduced CREBH and its  target gene, CRP, expression in db/db mice liver tissue (Fig. 5C).  ERRc, CREBH, and CRP are implicated in numerous biological events. ERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis [6] and hepatic lipid metabolism [7]. CREBH positively regulates  hepatic gluconeogenesis [15]. In addition, CREBH is a master  regulator of the lipin 1 gene, a key regulator of lipid metabolism  [17]. Both CREBH and ERRc gene expression is enhanced in a  diabetic mouse model to increase blood glucose level [15,6].  Regulation of both factors is important to regulate gluconeogenesis  in response to ER stress, and diabetes. Because the regulation of  CRP is also very critical to maintain glucose homeostasis as well as  other cellular phenomena including angiogenesis, inhibiting  CREBH transactivity and CRP gene expression by inhibiting  ERRc through GSK5182 could be important to relieve disease symptoms. As depicted in Fig. 5D, we hypothesize that ERRc directly binds to the CREBH promoter along with coactivator  PGC1a to regulate CREBH at the transcriptional level in response to ER stress and other physiological conditions, and that CREBH,  in turn, regulates its target genes. Overall, our current findings  provide insight into a novel chromatin remodeling strategy utilized  by ERRc, and it may be helpful to understand the complex link between nuclear receptors, ER membrane-bound transcription  factors, and glucose homeostasis.
