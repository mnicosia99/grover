JQ1, a chemical compound that inhibits MYC expression is therapeutically effective in preclinical animal models in midline carcinoma, and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Here we show that JQ1 does not inhibit MYC expression to a similar extent in all tumor cells. The BL cells showed a ,90% decrease in MYC transcription upon treatment with JQ1, however, no corresponding reduction was seen in several non-BL cells. Molecularly, these differences appear due to requirements of Brd4, the most active version of the Positive Transcription Elongation Factor B (P-TEFb) within the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), and transcription factors such as Gdown1, and MED26 and also other unknown cell specific factors. Our study demonstrates that the regulation of high levels of MYC expression in different cancer cells is driven by unique regulatory mechanisms and that such exclusive regulatory signatures in each cancer cells could be employed for targeted therapeutics.

The two most  common forms of aggressive NHL are diffuse large B cell  lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) [1,2,3].  Translocation of the proto-oncogene MYC into one of the  immunoglobulin gene loci [IG-MYC translocation; mostly of the  t(8;14)q24;q32 type] resulting in aberrant MYC expression is  regarded as the dominant genetic event in the genesis of BL and  about 10% of DLBCL [4]. Besides translocation, MYC can  undergo oncogenic deregulation via high-level gene amplification  as well as mutations in cis-regulatory elements in several cancer  types (e.g., myeloma, colon carcinoma and neuroblastoma) [5,6].  Moreover, while most BLs have deregulated c-MYC (henceforth  referred to as MYC) expression as a consequence of an IG-MYC  translocation, the majority of non-BLs do not carry IG-MYC  translocations, but other genetic abnormalities leading to dereg-  ulated MYC expression. Though high expression is restricted to  BLs, MYC target expression varies on a lower level across non-BL  and intermediate lymphomas and constitutes a negative prognostic  marker in these lymphomas.  MYC dimerizes with MAX to bind its target sequence (E-box)  and regulate gene expression. MYC not only activates transcrip-  tion but also represses target gene expression either via direct  biding (with Miz-1 transcription factor) or via regulation of micro-  RNAs (miRs) [7]. However, the function of MYC is complicated  as two recent studies show that MYC does not have a specific  transcriptional signature but serves to amplify the output of  existing transcriptional programs in a given cell rather than  executing its own transcriptional program [8,9].  MYC belongs to a class of genes called Primary Response Genes  (PRGs) many of which harbor paused Pol II at the proximal  promoter area that upon activation can quickly switch to an  elongating Pol II and functional transcription [10]. Signal  dependent stimulation results in enhanced acetylation at histone  3 lysine 14 (H3K14Ac) and either of two H4 lysine pairs, H4K5/  12 or H4K8/16, an event which appears crucial for the binding of  bromodomain (BRD) proteins that recruit transcription factors  necessary for transcription [11,12]. Recruitment of positive  transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), and possibly the  general initiation cofactor Mediator, plays an important role in  Brd4-regulated transcription of many genes including MYC.  Indeed, after recruitment by Brd4, P-TEFb phosphorylates the  elongation factors DSIF (Spt4 and Spt5), negative elongation  factor (NELF), and Pol II resulting in release of paused Pol II and  subsequent elongation of transcription [10,13] and recently  reviewed in [14]. Collectively, these and other results suggest that  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87003    elongation of transcription is a critical regulatory point in  orchestrating MYC regulation [10].  As many MYC-driven processes are required for homeostasis  and growth, therapeutic strategies geared towards modulation of  MYC expression rather than outright suppression seem attractive.  The Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation first described  thienodiazepine analogs that potently inhibit chromatin binding  of bromodomains related to the BET family [15]. Subsequently, a  closely related small molecule inhibitor, JQ1, has been found to be  therapeutically effective in pre-clinical animal models [16,17,18].  These and related small molecules competitively occupy the  acetyl-binding pockets of BET bromodomains, resulting in release  of BET proteins (in particular Brd4) from chromatin [19]. Despite  these promising demonstrations, JQ1 does not inhibit MYC  expression to a similar extent in all tumor cells [19]. Thus, it is  important to understand why JQ1 is effective in only certain MYC-  dependent cancers, which may ultimately determine clinical  efficacy of this compound in patients.  We observed that although JQ1 treatment decreased Brd4  occupancy to a similar degree in the cell types tested, the ability of  JQ1 to reduce MYC transcription between cells differed. In JQ1-  sensitive cells, inhibition occurred at the level of nascent  transcription affecting Pol II, \u2018\u2018paused'' Pol II-Ser5-P, \u2018\u2018elongat-  ing'' Pol II-Ser2-P, and P-TEFb occupancy. Furthermore, there is  a difference in the occupancy of members of the Super Elongation  Complex (SEC), and factors associated with RNA Polymerase II,  at MYC promoter regions in the two cell types. Collectively, our  data indicate high levels of MYC are maintained in different cancer  cells via distinct mechanisms at the level of transcription  elongation with different compliments of transcription factors  and are therefore subjected to different JQ1 sensitivity.  Materials and Methods  Cell Culture The mature mouse B cell lymphoma BAL17 [20], human BL  lines Akata [21], Raji [22], and Ramos [23], and human epithelial  line HeLa-S3 [24] were cultured in RPMI media with HEPES  (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 mg/ml Streptomycin, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 0.5 mM 2-Mercaptoeth-  anol solution (Invitrogen) and 10% Fetal Calf Sera (Atlanta  Biologicals). RNA based assays used 1-26106 cells and 26107 cells were used for Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JQ1,  solubilized in DMSO, was diluted into media at 1 mM and incubated with cells for 2 hours at 37uC. No effects on transcription were observed with DMSO controls (data not  shown). Experiments shown in Figure S1 (File S1) involving  BCR stimulation consisted of a 2 hr pre-treatment with 1 mM JQ1 followed by 30 minutes of exposure to antibody fragments specific  for either human or mouse BCR (Jackson Immunoresearch).

Results  Differential JQ1 Sensitivity We performed dose- and time-dependent testing of Brd4  inhibition with JQ1 and noted the effect on MYC transcription  in a variety of cells including HeLa-S3 cells, whose MYC  expression was reported [19] to be resistant to JQ1 treatment.  Shown in Fig. 1A, tested cell lines express MYC at high levels,  comparable to levels detected at the peak of primary na\u0131\u0308ve resting  B cell induction (data not shown). Steady state mRNA levels of  MYC in a non-BL murine B cell lymphoma line (BAL17) that over  expresses MYC at levels similar to the BL cells and HeLa cells  showed no significant sensitivity to JQ1 (Fig. 1A). Both HeLa and  BAL17 cells continued this resistance at concentrations up to  5 mM (data not shown), while MYC RNA in BL cells was uniformly decreased by ,90% when treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for a period of two hours (Fig. 1A). BL cells are reported to express 2- to 5-fold  more MYC-specific RNA than B-cell lines without a translocation  [30]. Although Western blotting d indicate the Raji BL line  expresses more MYC protein, consistent with the mRNA data  (Fig. 1A), JQ1 treatment decreased MYC protein expression in  Raji but not HeLa and BAL17 (data not shown). Together these  results demonstrated that JQ1 resistance occurred in both non-  lymphoma and lymphoma cell lines representing both murine and  human species.  Because mRNA production may not necessarily correlate with  primary transcript production [25,31], we tested the effect of JQ1  on primary transcription. Analysis of primary transcript, per-  formed with primers against the exon/intron borders of MYC  (schematically represented in Supplemental Fig. 3 and/or listed in  Materials and Methods), showed that primary transcription  sensitivity to JQ1 was parallel to that of mRNA (Fig. 1B). Thus,  long, and presumably full-length, primary transcripts were either  resistant (BAL17 or HeLa) or sensitive (Raji) to JQ1. Therefore,  the difference in JQ1 responses correlated with primary transcrip-  tion and did not occur at the level of post-transcriptional  modification, such as splicing and mRNA or protein stability.  Divergent transcription is common of many promoters in  organisms and plays an important role in gene regulation [32].  Indeed, antisense transcription from the MYC locus has been  observed in several cell lines [33]. Because we only measured total  steady state RNA (Fig. 1A), whether differential JQ1 sensitivity  reflects differences in possible transcription originating from the 39  end was tested. Although antisense transcription in both BAL17  Figure 3. Effects of JQ1 on P-TEFb occupancy. BAL17 and Raji cells were either untreated or treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for 2 hours. Recruitment of P-TEFb was detected by ChIP assays. Each experiment was analyzed in triplicate via real-time PCR, performed twice, and is reported as the mean and standard deviation of the two experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0087003.g003  Myc Regulation  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87003    and HeLa cells was small in comparison to sense transcription, it  was largely unaffected by JQ1 (Fig. 1C, left and middle panels).  The wide difference in levels of sense and antisense transcripts  observed amongst different cell lines is currently unexplained but  might reflect a combination of transcriptional and post-transcrip-  tional effects. Regardless, like sense transcription, antisense  transcription originating from the MYC locus in Raji cells was  inhibited by JQ1 (Fig. 1C, right panel). Therefore, although more  antisense transcription was noted in Raji cells, the difference in  JQ1 sensitivity was not likely due to differences in antisense  transcripts.  JQ1 Leads to Decreased Brd4 Occupancy in Resistant and Sensitive Cells  We observed that Brd4 recruitment was reduced by JQ1 in both  cell types-therefore, the difference in JQ1 sensitivity between  different cells was not due to permeability. We also observed that  Brd4 recruitment to the transcription start site (TSS) was roughly  2.5 fold more in Raji (+11) cells compared to BAL17 (+17) (Fig. 2A). HeLa exhibited Brd4 recruitment and JQ1 sensitivity  similar to BAL17 (data not shown). Moreover, a significant  amount of Brd4 occupancy was noted across the body of MYC in  all the cells tested, though there was a higher level of coding region  occupancy in BAL17 cells. Though commonly associated with 59-  end enhancers and promoters, Brd4 has been shown to occupy the  coding region of PRGs such as c-fos and MYC [26].  Promoter recruitment of Brd4 requires phosphorylation at S484  and S488 and deletion of this region results in decreased CycT and  Pol II occupancy and transcription [26]. Consistent with the ChIP  assay, Western blotting showed a higher level of total Brd4 in Raji  nuclear extracts compared to HeLa and BAL17, although Brd4-  S484P/S488P in Raji cells was slightly less compared to BAL17  and HeLa (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the P-BRD4 band in HeLa cells  migrated faster than either the Raji or BAL17 P-Brd4 band,  perhaps reflecting a slight difference in the extent or site of  phosphorylation. However, the difference in phosphorylated Brd4  (the active form) between different cells might not explain the  differences in JQ1 sensitivity.  Brd4 interacts with factors that either recruit Pol II to the site of  transcription or drive the transcriptional complex from pausing to  Figure 4.

Additionally, a reduction  of functional Brd4 resulting in greatly reduced Pol II occupancy  was shown to involve a loss of P-TEFb [26]. Although the level  and pattern of P-TEFb occupancy in both untreated JQ1 sensitive  and resistant cell types were similar, JQ1 treatment/Brd4  inhibition decreased P-TEFb occupancy only in Raji cells  (Fig. 3). These results indicated levels of BRD4 dependence for  maintaining P-TEFb occupancy vary in different cell lines (Fig. 3).  RNA Pol II Recruitment We next determined if the difference in JQ1 selectivity was due  to a difference in general transcription apparatus recruitment,  represented by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). While total Pol II was  greatly decreased across the body of MYC in Raji cells upon JQ1  treatment, it was not altered in the JQ1 resistant BAL17 line  (Fig. 4A). Both cell types showed Pol II occupancy at the P0 promoter, which has been shown to correlate with a very high  level of transcription [34]. Many actively transcribed genes  (including MYC) exhibit paused Pol II at their proximal promoters  [35]. Consistent with this notion, we observed a high level of  promoter-associated Pol II in both cell types, although two-fold  more Pol II was noted at the proximal promoter (roughly  corresponding to the P0 promoter region) in BAL17 (2354)  compared to Raji (2279). Interestingly, as noted with Brd4 and P-  TEFb (Figs. 3 and 4), total Pol II was reduced at a site immediately  downstream (+0.6 kb) of the TSS and sharply increased afterward (Fig. 4A).  Because phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain  (CTD) of RNA Pol II is associated with regulation of transcription  initiation and elongation at many promoters [36,37], we analyzed  these events in the two cell types in the absence and presence of  JQ1. While RNA Pol II phospho-Ser5 (Pol II S5P) levels in BAL17  cells remained stable after JQ1 treatment, Pol II S5P levels in Raji  cells were sensitive to JQ1 (Fig. 4B). However, surprisingly, Pol II  S5P levels were refractory at P0 and TSS sites (Fig. 4B, right panel)  but sensitive in the latter half of the gene with a small change  starting downstream of the MYC P3 promoter (+2244) and becoming increasingly sensitive further down the body of the gene.  Whether the substantial amount of Pol II-Ser5P 39 occupancy  shown here is directly due to 39 Brd4 occupancy or an  overabundance of transcription complexes \u2018\u2018backing up'' resulting  in reduced elongation and subsequent pausing at the 39 terminus is  unknown.  While Ser5 phosphorylation is associated with a competent but  paused Pol II, Ser2 phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD (Pol II S2P)  represents elongating Pol II [37]. In the absence of JQ1, Pol II S2P  occupancy in both cell types occurred across the body of the gene  with peaks at the promoter regions, and the 39 end. Surprisingly,  while promoter- and TSS-associated Pol II S2P levels in Raji cells  were sensitive to JQ1, downstream regions past P3 exhibited no  JQ1 sensitivity until past the 39 UTR (+5472) (Fig. 4C), suggesting that the majority of fully elongating RNA polymerase II in these  JQ1 sensitive cells was refractory to JQ1. We also observed a JQ1-  dependent increase in Pol II-Ser2P in the BAL17 line and while  this increase was slight at the promoter and TSS regions, it was  very clear at the 39 terminus.  Differences in H3K36me3 One possible way to delineate between upstream and down-  stream effects on Pol II-Ser2 occupancy is to determine the pattern  of tri-methylation of the histone 3 residue lysine 36, H3K36me3,  which is indicative of a recently passing elongating transcription  complex [37]. In BAL17 cells, JQ1 treatment enhanced the  H3K36me3 signals across the gene (Fig. 5). But in Raji cells, JQ1  treatment decreased H3K36me3 from P0 through TSS until the  P3 region. However, beyond P3, the H3K36me3 became  refractory to JQ1 (Fig. 5) as observed with Pol II S2P (Fig. 4C),  suggesting that once RNA Pol II was in elongation mode, it was  Figure 5.

Together, our data showed that MYC harbored  transcription complexes with variable Brd4 dependency in  different cell types and that Brd4 inhibition resulted in a  differential response at the level of transition from pausing to  elongation.  Accessory Transcription Elongation Factors P-TEFb frequently functions as a subunit of Super Elongation  Complexes (SEC), consisting of P-TEFb and a mixture of one of  three ELL family members, one of two EAF family members, one  of two AF4 family members (AFF1 and AFF4), and either ENL or  AF9 [29,38]. As the SEC family of Pol II elongation factors are  reported to contain the most catalytically active versions of P-  TEFb active in high-level transcription and to regulate a  checkpoint stage of transcription associated with elongation  [29,39,40], we looked at SEC recruitment at MYC in different  cell types. AFF4 is reported to serve as a central binding platform  for elongation factors in many SEC formations and to target MYC  and regulate its expression in cancer cells [39]. The level of AFF4  occupancy in BAL17 cells was low and refractory to JQ1 (Fig. 6A,  top panel) but increased in the presence of JQ1. In contrast, AFF4  recruitment in Raji cells was much greater and sensitive to JQ1.  Although the AFF4 promoter occupancy in Raji cells, particularly  around 2244 site, was variable in the absence of JQ1, it was  significantly decreased in the presence of JQ1. Moreover,  consistent with the Pol II S2P and H3K36me3 results, JQ1  sensitivity was lost past the P3 promoter region (+2244), once again suggesting that the elongating transcription complex was refrac-  tory to JQ1 (Fig. 6A, bottom panel).  We subsequently looked at occupancy of another SEC  component, ELL2, which has been reported to play a role in  the transition from paused Pol II to elongation [40]. We also tested  occupancy of the Mediator component (MED26) as well as  Gdown1. Though first linked to initiation, a role for Mediator in  recruiting Pol II transcription elongation factors and phosphory-  lation of the Pol II CTD regulating Pol II pausing and elongation  has emerged [41]. The Mediator complex most strongly associated  with Pol II includes MED26, which has been shown to increase  activation of transcription in vitro to a greater degree than other  forms of the Mediator complex and play a key role in SEC  recruitment and MYC transcription [41]. Gdown1 is a Pol II  binding protein shown to be necessary for a Mediator-dependent  response to activation of transcription [42]. More appropriate to  Figure 6.

Because the available antibodies against ELL2, Med26 and  Gdown1 were species (human) specific, we employed HeLa and  Raji cells for these experiments. Given the differences focused  around the P3 region, we focused on the general promoter region  (P0, TSS, and P3) to test the differences between these cell lines. As  observed for BAL17 cells, HeLa cells exhibited low AFF4  recruitment at this region in comparison to Raji cells (Fig. 6B).  Consistent with AFF4 recruitment results, increased ELL2  occupancy near P3 was seen in Raji cells compared to HeLa  cells. MED26 occupancy showed a pattern similar to that of other  SEC components with an increase, though more modest, near the  P3 promoter in Raji cells (Fig. 6B). Finally, we observed that  Gdown1 followed a pattern similar to that of SEC and Mediator  with an increase around the P3 promoter in Raji cells (Fig. 6B).  Discussion  Due to the importance of MYC in the genesis of hematopoietic  malignancies, intense efforts have been directed for the past two  decades toward understanding its regulation. Yet, given that MYC  overexpression is caused by a plethora of genetic lesions, a uniform  set of rules governing its transcriptional regulation is still missing.  Recent advances in this area include the discovery of a small  molecule inhibitor, JQ1 that decreases MYC expression and is  therapeutically effective in pre-clinical animal models of midline  carcinoma and in BL cells. However, JQ1 does not inhibit MYC  expression to a similar extent in all cancer cells, further  underscoring that MYC transcription is perhaps under different  controls in various cancer cell types. Consistent with this notion,  we discovered that JQ1 inhibits MYC expression in all BL-derived  cells tested but does not inhibit MYC expression in some other  cancer cell lines, as observed earlier (19). Because MYC  deregulation can occur via different modes, we hypothesized that  in distinct lymphoma phenotypes, high-level MYC expression may  come under the controls of different transcriptional and epigenetic  regulatory mechanisms, which may be sensitive or resistant to  JQ1/Brd4 inhibition. In this study, we explored these mechanisms  to establish MYC transcriptional and epigenetic signatures  associated with particular cell types with the hope that these  signatures will better define lymphoma subtypes and provide new  therapeutic avenues to explore for clinically aggressive B cell  lymphomas.  Although BL cells are a heterogeneous lot with differences in the  length of Ig/MYC translocation that reportedly translate to  variable levels of MYC overexpression [43], BL cells in our hands  (Fig. 1 and Figure S1, in File S1), and others [19], are uniformly  susceptible to inhibition of MYC expression via Brd4 inhibition by  JQ1. This inhibition appears to be regardless of whether these are  Figure 7. Proposed Model.

Brd4 is  primarily associated with 59-end promoters and enhancers  [44,45,46], and while we do see a more prominent level of Brd4  at the TSS in Raji cells (Fig. 2), we also observe Brd4 occupancy  across the body of the MYC gene in JQ1 resistant cells (Fig. 2). One  function of Brd4 is P-TEFb recruitment and P-TEFb occupancy  does parallel Brd4-inhibitor sensitive MYC transcription, despite  the fact that there is little difference in P-TEFb occupancy in  untreated cells of either resistant or sensitive cells. Therefore, it  appears that in cells resistant to JQ1, a Brd4-independent  mechanism operates to recruit or retain P-TEFb and produce  high levels of MYC transcription.  Because the SEC components AFF4 and ELL2 play a role in  MYC regulation and transcriptional elongation, we hypothesized  that an increase in these co-factors might relax Brd4 requirements.  Surprisingly, their increased presence actually correlated with  increased requirements for Brd4 (Fig. 6). The position of increased  SEC components together with MED26 and Gdown1 around the  P3 promoter suggests high transcriptional activity or a regulatory  checkpoint in this region that is not present in cells that are  resistant to JQ1 (summarized in Figure 7). It has been noted that in  BL cells, due to MYC-IG translocation, the otherwise minor P3  promoter often becomes active and correlates with higher MYC  expression [43]. Coupled with the recent demonstration that the  translocated MYC locus harbors super enhancers that are sensitive  to JQ1 [45], this raises the possibility that the mechanism of  transcriptional regulation of MYC involving its native/non-  translocated enhancer is different (Fig. 7B, Figure S2, in File S1).  Regulation of transcription at the MYC minor promoters,  including P3, has been shown to involve the P-TEFb regulator  7SK snRNA, which participates in transformation-dependent  MYC deregulation [47]. 7SK snRNA is a complex of RNA and  proteins such as LARP7 and HEXIM1 that are known to stabilize  P-TEFb in an inactive form [13,14,47]. JQ1 also leads to the  release of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP and to HIV gene  expression that involves an increase in AFF4 and ELL2 [48,49].  Moreover, while JQ1 inhibited MYC expression in BL lines tested,  it enhanced BCR stimulated induced transcription of c-fos in these  cells (Figure S1, in File S1). Thus, the effects of Brd4 inhibition by  JQ1 appear more complicated than has been previously antici-  pated.  Much is known about the different MYC promoters and their  possible functions in oncogenesis. BAL17 and HeLa cells may  behave like GLC4 cells, where MYC is transcribed at a high rate  but not grossly rearranged [50]. That MYC transcription in GLC4  is reported to initiate mainly from P1 instead of the P2 promoter  and that this promoter shift seems to overcome transcript  termination at a transcriptional pause site described for Burkitt's  lymphoma [50]. In the future, it will be interesting to conclusively  determine if any difference in cell-specific primary transcription  and MYC promoter usage is driving, or being driven by, the  differences in transcriptional elongation regulation we report here.  Point mutations could also play a role in differential JQ1 sensitivity  though a search of available UCSC Genome Browser tracks only  finds one SNP reported in the general vicinity of the P1/P2  promoter (data not shown).  Altered regulation at the elongation stage of transcription has  been proposed to contribute to leukemic pathogenesis [29,51].  While many PRGs such as MYC have a well-recognized  checkpoint at +40 to the TSS that is associated with paused transcription [52,53], our data indicate that an additional potential  checkpoint near the region around P3 may be utilized differently  depending upon the mode of MYC overexpression. In the near  future, we hope to employ different MYC-driven lymphoma  samples to test whether the transcriptional signatures that we  observe here correlate with the particular MYC genetic lesion  (translocated versus non-translocated).
