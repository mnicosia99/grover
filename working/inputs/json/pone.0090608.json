    "summary": "The POU5F1 gene codes for the OCT4 transcription factor, which is one of the key regulators of pluripotency. Its transcription, alternative splicing, and alternative translation leading to the synthesis of the active, nuclear localized OCT4A has been described in detail. Much less, however, is known about actively transcribed OCT4 pseudogenes, several of which display high homology to OCT4A and can be expressed and translated into proteins. Using RT-PCR followed by pseudogene-specific restriction digestion, cloning, and sequencing we discriminate between OCT4A and transcripts for pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4. We show that expression of OCT4 and its pseudogenes follows a developmentally-regulated pattern in differentiating hESCs, indicating a tight regulatory relationship between them. We further demonstrate that differentiated human cells from a variety of tissues express exclusively pseudogenes. Expression of OCT4A can, however be triggered in adult differentiated cells by oxygen and FGF2-dependent mechanisms.",

little is known about direct pathogenic effects of HBV surface proteins. Here, we have investigated pathological cellular effects of HBV surface protein expression in the liver of transgenic mice with different genetic background.  Methods: The impact of HBV surface protein expression on the liver was studied in two mouse strains, BALB/c and C57BL/6. Histology and hydroxyproline assays were performed to investigate liver morphology and fibrosis. Gene expression and signaling were analyzed by microarray, qPCR and Western blotting.  Results: Expression of HBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice induced activation of protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF2a resulted in activation of the ER stress markers glucose regulated protein (GRP) 78 and pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic background leading to stronger liver injury and fibrosis in comparison with transgenic mice on C57BL/6 background. Hepatic stellate cells represented the main collagen-producing liver cells in HBV transgenic mice. The key regulators of hepatocyte proliferation, transcription factors c-Jun and STAT3 were activated in HBV transgenic mice. Tumour incidence in transgenic mice was strain- and sex-dependent.  Conclusions: Extent of liver injury, fibrosis, and tumour development induced by hepatic HBV surface protein expression considerably depends on host genetic background.

Although  much is known about HBV structure and replicative cycle [2] the  pathogenic mechanisms responsible for liver injury, cirrhosis  development and malignant transformation during chronic HBV  infection are not well understood. It is believed that these events  originate from persistent immune pathogenesis [3], but observa-  tions in transgenic mouse models of HBV infection suggest that in  absence of an adaptive immune responses cellular mechanisms  induced by HBV proteins may also lead to the development of  these liver diseases [4,5].  The HBV transgenic mice used in the current study contain a  sub-genomic HBV DNA fragment (genotype D, subtype ayw)  encoding the three co-carboxyterminal HBV surface (HBs)  proteins under the control of the liver-specific murine albumin  promoter [6]. Although these transgenic mice have been shown to  develop chronic liver injury, regenerative hyperplasia, as well as  adenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) [7,8] the  mechanisms of HBs proteins pathogenicity are poorly understood.  The HBs protein expression pattern in this mouse model mimics  the situation in the liver of patients with enhanced intracellular  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/   expression and retention of Hepatitis B virus surface proteins, e. g.  patients with Hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treated  by transplantation. The liver damage in these patients was  attributable to a direct hepatocytotoxic effect of HBV, since they  were on a similar immunosuppresion regime [9,10].  Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates the  unfolded protein response (UPR) that is sensed by the binding  immunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78  (GRP78) [11-13]. Distinct branches of UPR are mediated by  three different classes of ER-membrane transducers: inositol-  requiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6  (ATF6) or protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase  (PERK). PERK activation causes the phosphorylation of the  alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 (eIF2a) [11]. Phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to a reduction in the initiation of mRNA translation thus reducing the load of new  proteins that require folding in the ER. However, the expression of  some proteins is enhanced. One of them is the C/EBP  homologous protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest and  DNA damage-inducible gene (GADD) 153 that mediates pro-  apoptotic pathways emanating from the stressed ER [11,14].  Previously it was shown that GRP78 expression was increased in a  human hepatoma cell line that overproduced HBs proteins [15]  and in the liver of transgenic mice that expressed deletion mutant  of large HBs [16].  Hepatic fibrosis constitutes the wound healing response to liver  injury. During fibrosis, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation  represents a critical event, because these cells become the primary  source of extracellular matrix in the liver upon damage [17].  Development of hepatic fibrosis after chemical liver injury is  enhanced in BALB/c mice exhibiting a Th2 response compared to  C57BL/6 mice, which demonstrated a primary Th1 response  [18]. Transgenic mice on fibrosis-resistant C57BL/6 genetic  background, which over-produce HBs proteins, develop modest  spontaneous liver fibrosis [19,20].  Transcription factor c-Jun and signal transducer and activator  of transcription (STAT) 3 are implicated in several cellular  processes including proliferation, survival, and cell transformation  [21,22]. They are activated in chemically induced murine liver  tumours and in HCCs of humans [23,24], suggesting an important  function for these proteins in the development of liver tumours.  Here we report that the production of HBV surface proteins  stimulates the expression of CHOP in hepatocytes and could cause  stronger liver damage in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic  background compared to C57BL/6. Furthermore, HBV trans-  genic mice develop hepatic fibrosis and the level of fibrosis  depends on the genetic background. Although c-Jun transcription  factor up-regulation and activation of STAT3 and PERK in the  liver of transgenic mice might contribute to tumour development,  CHOP expression might reduce tumorigenesis in transgenic mice  on BALB/c genetic background.  Materials and Methods  Animal Model Transgenic mice were maintained at the Central Animal  Laboratory of the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen under specified  pathogen-free conditions. This study was carried out in strict  accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care  and Use of Laboratory Animals of the German law of animal  welfare. The mice received humane care, and all experiments  were approved by the Committee on the ethics of Animal  Experiments of the Regierungspraesidium Giessen, Giessen,  Germany (permit number: V54-19c 20 15 h 01 GI20/10 Nr.  52/2011 and Nr. A5/2012).  Generation and characteristics of transgenic lineages Tg(Alb-  1HBV), internal designation (HBVTg/6) have been described  previously [8]. The HBVTg/6 strain had an inbred C57BL/6  genetic background and was propagated by crossing hemizygous  transgenic males to C57BL/6 females. These mice were  backcrossed to fibrosis susceptible BALB/c genetic background  [18] for at least 6 generations. The obtained transgenic mouse line  was internally designed HBVTg/c. At age of 12, 26, and 52 weeks  mice were killed by CO2-inhalation. Liver samples were collected  and preserved for analyses in accordance with application. Serum  samples were stored at 280uC until analysis of alanine amino- transferase (ALT) by routine clinical chemistry on a Reflotron Plus  Analyzer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).  Histology and Hydroxyproline Assay Immediately after necropsy, liver samples for histology were  fixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde at 4uC for 16 hours and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 mm) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or 0.1% Sirius Red  F3B in saturated picric acid (Chroma, Mu\u0308nster, Germany) for the  detection of collagen fibers [25]. The entire content of collagen  was determined by hydroxyproline (HYP) quantification [26].  Immunohistochemistry Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using ImmPRESS  Peroxidase Detection Reagents (Vector Laboratories) and anti-  bodies specific for HBsAg (20-HR20), GADD153 (F-168, Santa  Cruz), Desmin and GFAP (Lab Vision), c-Jun (60A8, Cell  Signaling), BiP (C50B12, Cell Signaling). Colour reaction was  developed with VECTOR VIP Peroxidase Substrate Kit or DAB  Peroxidase Substrate Kit, (Vector Laboratories). The percentage  of BiP, Desmin, and GFAP-positive area was determined using  ImageJ image analysis system (National Institutes of Health,  Bethesda, MD, USA).  Western Blot Analysis Total liver lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using  antibodies against HBsAg (20-HR20, Fitzgerald), GADD153 (F-  168, Santa Cruz), phospho-PERK (16F8, Cell Signaling), PERK  (H-300, Santa Cruz), phospho-eIF2a (119A11, Cell Signaling), eIF2a (L57A5, Cell Signaling), b-actin (13E5, Cell Signaling), JNK2 (N-18, Santa Cruz), c-Jun (60A8, Cell Signaling), phospho-  c-Jun (D47G9, Cell Signaling), phospho-SAPK/JNK (81E11, Cell  Signaling), STAT3 (79D7, Cell Signaling), phospho-STAT3  (D3A7, Cell Signaling).  Assay for HBV-specific proteins HBsAg was measured in serum and in liver lysates by an in-  house sandwich ELISA as described [27]. HBsAg amount per  hepatocyte was calculated based on the hepatocellularity number  for mouse 135 million cells per gram of liver [28].  Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR and quality control of all  steps were performed as described previously [29]. Primers were  purchased from QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany). qPCR data were  analysed using DDCt method [30].  Microarray analysis Microarray experiments were performed with total RNA from  the liver of 12-week-old mice as described previously [31].

Results  Liver damage induced by HBs proteins expression depends on host genetic background  Transgenic mice were sacrificed at week 12, 26, and 52. To  estimate the level of liver cell damage we have measured alanine  transaminase (ALT) in serum. Activities of serum ALT were  markedly increased already in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice  compared to the wild-type and remained at that level during the  observation period. In HBVTg/6 mice the ALT elevation was  moderate at week 12 but increased later to levels almost as high as  in HBVTg/c mice (Figure 1A). Histological analysis revealed no  significant lymphocyte infiltration of the liver from 12-week-old  transgenic mice (Figure S1A). Furthermore, amounts of HBsAg  per hepatocyte in 12-week-old mice were similar: 0.42 pg/cell  (range, 0.18-0.71 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and 0.31 pg/cell  (range, 0.15-0.64 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/6. Immunohisto-  chemical and Western blot analyses of livers from transgenic mice  also showed that distributions and expression levels of HBs  proteins were similar in mice on both C57BL/6 and BALB/c  genetic backgrounds (Figure S1B and S2). Moreover, amounts of  HBsAg in serum of transgenic mice did not differ significantly:  2.02 ng/ml (range, 0.68-3.19 ng/ml; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and  1.34 ng/ml (range, 0.68-2.55 ng/ml; n = 4) for HBVTg/6. Thus,  the elevated serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice could be a  consequence of a specific host response to the presence of HBs  proteins.  To identify the pathways which are activated in the HBs-  expressing liver tissue we carried out transcriptional profiling using  microarray analysis. As illustrated in Table 1 a set of genes that is  known to be induced by UPR is up-regulated in the liver of 12-  week-old transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression of gene  ddit3 that encodes CHOP protein is stronger up-regulated in the  liver of HBVTg/c mice compared to HBVTg/6. To confirm this  finding we studied the expression of CHOP by qRT-PCR and  Western blot analysis. Transcription of the ddit3 gene was strongly  activated in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice and declined thereafter  with age, whereas in HBVTg/6 mice ddit3 transcription was rather  weakly enhanced in 12-week-old mice and increased with age  (Figure S3). Western blot analysis of liver proteins revealed that  CHOP was up-regulated much stronger in HBVTg/c mice  compared to HBVTg/6 (Fig. 1B). Selective CHOP translation  depends on eIF2a phosphorylation by PERK after induction of UPR [11]. However, we detected similar level of PERK activation  and eIF2a phosphorylation in the liver from both mouse strains irrespective of gender and age (Fig. 1C and D). Interestingly, other  UPR sensors ATF6 and IRE1 as well as eIF2a kinases PKR (protein kinase R) and GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2)  [32] were not activated in the liver of transgenic mice (data not  shown). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of  transgenic mice leads to the specific activation of the PERK  branch of UPR in hepatocytes from both mouse strains, but  expression of CHOP was much stronger in HBVTg/c mice.  Enhanced translation of CHOP results in liver damage and could  explain higher serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice.  To examine the location of CHOP expressing hepatocytes  immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. According to our  previous finding a significant part of hepatocytes from 12-week-old  HBVTg/c mice accumulated CHOP in the nucleus and the  amount of CHOP-positive hepatocytes declined with age, whereas  we could detect only a few hepatocytes in HBVTg/6 liver  positively stained for CHOP independent of age (Figure 2A).  Interesting, CHOP-positive hepatocytes were located in centri-  lobular areas which surround a hepatic central vein (Figure 2A).  Furthermore, induction of UPR leads to activation of the major  sensor of unfolded protein accumulation BiP/GRP78 [12]. IHC  demonstrated strong expression of BiP in selected hepatocytes in  centrilobular areas (Figure 2B and Figure S4), although Western  blot analysis did not reveal any differences between wild-type and  transgenic mice in expression of BiP/GRP78 (data not shown).  Thus, expression of HBs proteins activated the UPR downstream  pathway (CHOP and BiP) much stronger in the liver of transgenic  mice on BALB/c genetic background compared to C57BL/6.  This activation is located in centrilobular zones of the liver.  Liver fibrosis Measurement of liver hydroxyproline content demonstrated the  development of hepatic fibrosis in transgenic mice (Figure 3A).  Enhanced hepatic fibrosis was confirmed by Sirius red staining as  well. We observed minimal fibrosis in the liver of 12-week-old  mice. But fibrosis constantly increased with age. However,  HBVTg/c mice accumulated more collagen (Figure S5). Hepatic  stellate cells (HSC) are the primary effector cells responsible for the  deposition of ECM in normal and fibrotic liver [33]. Therefore,  we tested the expression of HSC activation markers. We detected  increased amounts of GFAP- and desmin- positive cells in the liver  of transgenic mice, thus demonstrating HSC proliferation in the  liver of transgenic mice (Figure 3B and Figure S6). Moreover,  double staining of desmin with specific antibodies and collagen  with Sirius red has shown co-localization of HSCs with collagen  fibres (Figure S7). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in  mouse liver induces development of hepatic fibrosis, which  correlated with liver injury. HSCs might be the main collagen-  producing cells in this mouse model.  HBs protein-induced tumour development depends on host genetic background  Microarray analysis showed an up-regulation of c-jun gene  expression in transgenic mice independent of genetic background  (Table 1). These results were confirmed using qPCR. Maximal  expression was detected in the liver of 52-week-old mice (Figure  S8). Expression of c-Jun protein was increased in the liver of 12-,  26-, and 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4A). Major parts of  hepatocytes of 52-week-old mice accumulated c-Jun in the nucleus  (Figure S9). Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinase  (JNK) stimulates its ability to activate transcription [34,35].  Western blot analyses demonstrated that JNKs were activated  (Figure 4B) and the level of c-Jun phosphorylation was indeed  increased in the liver of 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4C).  Thus, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of transgenic mice  leads to activation of c-Jun expression.  STAT3 activation was observed in mouse models of liver injury  and in human liver diseases in the context of inflammation and  cancer [22]. Therefore, we examined the status of STAT3  activation in the liver of HBV transgenic mice. Western blot  analysis of liver protein extracts revealed STAT3 activation in the  Pathological Impact of HBV Surface Proteins  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608    liver of male but not female mice (Figure 4D). Thus, expression of  HBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice results in  STAT3 activation in a gender-dependent manner.  Up-regulation of c-Jun expression and STAT3 activation could  promote hepatic tumour growth [21,22]. We checked transgenic  mice for occurrence of liver tumour. In young mice (12- and 26-  week-old) mice we could detect no tumours. However, they were  detected in 100% (6/6) of 52-week-old male and 20% (1/5) of  female HBVTg/6 mice, whereas only 58% (7/12; X 2  = 3.46;  p = 0.06) of 52-week-old male and 0% (0/6) of female HBVTg/c  mice develop tumours. Hence, development of tumours in HBV  transgenic mice was age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.  Discussion  In this study we investigated the effects of HBVs proteins  expression in the liver of transgenic mice BALB/c and C57BL/6  genetic background. Since we observed only weak strain-  independent immune cell infiltration of transgenic mice liver  (Figure S1) this model could be considered as one with impaired  immune reaction. One important negative impact of immune  deficiency on chronic HBV infection in human is related to the  direct cytotoxicity of high levels of HBs and other HBV proteins  [9,10,36]. Low serum HBsAG titers were associated with strong  intracellular accumulation of HBs in HBV transgenic mice on  both genetic backgrounds. This condition was also seen in some  patients with late phases of chronic HBV infection [37,38]. Thus,  transgenic mice expressing HBs proteins reflect the situation in the  liver of HBV-infected patients demonstrated strong retention of  HBsAg in hepatocytes.  Higher serum ALT activities in HBVTg/c mice suggest  stronger liver injury compared to HBVTg/6 (Figure 1A). Since  the level of cellular infiltration was low in the liver of transgenic  mice on both genetic backgrounds we searched for other reasons  of hepatocyte death. Increased CHOP expression as a result of  prolonged ER stress promotes cell death, whereas CHOP deletion  protects against the death of ER-stressed cells [14]. Strongly  increased transcription and protein accumulation of CHOP in  HBVTg/c mice (Figure 1B and 2A; Figure S3) inducing  hepatocyte death could explain increased serum ALT level in  these mice. Expression of CHOP is mediated by phosphorylation  of eIF2a [32] that in turn is phosphorylated by PERK [11]. Interestingly, levels of PERK activation and eIF2a phosphoryla- tion were similar in the liver of both HBV transgenic mouse strains  (Figure 1C and 1D). Two other branches of UPR IRE1a and ATF6 were not activated in the liver of HBV transgenic mice (data  not shown). PERK branch activation is largely sustained with  unmitigated ER stress, whereas persistent ER stress attenuates  IRE1a and ATF6 signaling [39]. Therefore, permanent expres- sion of HBs proteins leads to the activation of persistent ER stress  in hepatocytes that induces PERK and impairs another branches  Figure 1.

It is possible that this situation is common for chronic  liver disease comprising ER stress induction.  It was previously shown that despite PERK activation and  eIF2a phosphorylation in the liver of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis  (NASH), downstream effectors such as CHOP remain inactive  [40]. A similar situation was observed in the liver of HBV  transgenic mice on C57BL/6 genetic background. However,  stimulation of CHOP and BiP expression in HBVTg/c mice  demonstrated that the outcome of UPR induction depends on the  genetic background of subjects. Furthermore, several studies have  demonstrated that PERK function is critical for maintaining  cellular redox homeostasis, promotes cancer cell proliferation and  tumour growth [41]. Thus, sustained activation of PERK could  also promote cancer development in the liver of HBV transgenic  mice.  Global reduction of translation initiation due to PERK-  mediated eIF2a phosphorylation [32] should also affect the expression of HBs proteins in the liver. This suggests the following  feed-back mechanism: PERK activation results in the reduction of  HBs translation and that leads to a balance between PERK  activation and HBs protein synthesis in hepatocytes.  Development of tumours in HBV transgenic mice as it was  shown by us and others [8] is age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.  In this study we observed a strong up-regulation of c-Jun hepatic  expression and an activation of STAT3, whose role in tumori-  genesis is well established [22,23,42]. Jun controls liver cancer  initiation and is required for development of chemically induced  HCC [23]. Interestingly, transgenic mice comprising the whole or  partial HBV genome are also more susceptible to chemically  induced hepatocarcinogenesis [43,44]. Likewise, hepatitis C virus  core protein potentiates chemically induced HCC through c-Jun  and STAT3 activation [45]. Thus, stimulation of c-Jun expression  and STAT3 activation by HBs proteins could promote the  development of liver cancer induced by different causes, such as  sustained inflammation, activation of oncogenes etc. Furthermore,  the finding that STAT3 was activated in male mice only correlated  with our observation that tumour development in HBV transgenic  mice is gender-dependent. There is accumulating evidence that  tumour-specific ER stress can be exploited for cancer therapy by  treatment with ER stress-aggravating compounds [46]. Moderate,  transient ER stress response represents an adaptive mechanism to  support cellular survival. However, severe and excessive stress  conditions could turn this response system to its pro-apoptotic  mode. Stimulation of CHOP expression in HBVTg/c mice  indicated an activation of pro-apoptotic cellular stress responses in  the liver and resulted in reduced tumour incidence in 52-week-old  HBVTg/c mice.  Taken together, the outcome of HBV surface proteins  expression in the liver of transgenic mice depends on the host  genetic background. Liver injury and fibrosis were increased in  transgenic mice on BALB/c background compared to C57BL/6  correlating with strong expression of PERK downstream pro-  apoptotic effector CHOP. More interesting finding is genetic  background-independent stimulation of c-Jun expression together  with STAT3 and PERK activation promoting cancer cell  proliferation and tumour growth. However, activation of pro-  apoptotic cellular stress response could result in reduced tumour  incidence in the liver.
