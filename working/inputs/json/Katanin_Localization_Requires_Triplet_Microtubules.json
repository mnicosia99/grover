    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

  Katanin Localization Requires Triplet Microtubules in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Jessica M. Esparza, Eileen O'Toole, Linya Li, Thomas H. Giddings, Jr., Benjamin Kozak, Alison J. Albee,  Susan K. Dutcher*  Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America  Abstract  Centrioles and basal bodies are essential for a variety of cellular processes that include the recruitment of proteins to these structures for both centrosomal and ciliary function. This recruitment is compromised when centriole/basal body assembly is defective. Mutations that cause basal body assembly defects confer supersensitivity to Taxol. These include bld2, bld10, bld12, uni3, vfl1, vfl2, and vfl3. Flagellar motility mutants do not confer sensitivity with the exception of mutations in the p60 (pf19) and p80 (pf15) subunits of the microtubule severing protein katanin. We have identified additional pf15 and bld2 (e- tubulin) alleles in screens for Taxol sensitivity. Null pf15 and bld2 alleles are viable and are not essential genes in Chlamydomonas. Analysis of double mutant strains with the pf15-3 and bld2-6 null alleles suggests that basal bodies in Chlamydomonas may recruit additional proteins beyond katanin that affect spindle microtubule stability. The bld2-5 allele is a hypomorphic allele and its phenotype is modulated by nutritional cues. Basal bodies in bld2-5 cells are missing proximal ends. The basal body mutants show aberrant localization of an epitope-tagged p80 subunit of katanin. Unlike IFT proteins, katanin p80 does not localize to the transition fibers of the basal bodies based on an analysis of the uni1 mutant as well as the lack of colocalization of katanin p80 with IFT74. We suggest that the triplet microtubules are likely to play a key role in katanin p80 recruitment to the basal body of Chlamydomonas rather than the transition fibers that are needed for IFT localization.

Taxol is used for treatment of a  variety of cancers as it blocks mitosis [1]. In the unicellular green  alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Schibler and Huang showed that a  mutation in b-tubulin (tub2-1) confers resistance to colchicine and supersensitivity to Taxol. They concluded that the microtubules in  tub2-1 cells are hyperstabilized, which causes the Taxol supersen-  sitive phenotype [2]. Katanin is a microtubule severing protein  [3,4]. It is composed of two subunits; the p60 subunit is a catalytic  AAA ATPase and the p80 subunit targets the heterodimer to the  centrosome in metazoans. Katanin influences microtubule dy-  namics through its ability to sever microtubules. This property is  observed in Drosophila S2 mitotic spindles [5] and C. elegans meiotic  spindles [6]. Sharma and colleagues [7] showed that loss of either  the catalytic (p60) or the targeting (p80) subunit of katanin in  Tetrahymena results in short cilia and a knockout allele of p60  confers Taxol supersensitivity. Thus, there appear to be several  pathways in cells that when mutated confer Taxol sensitivity.  Because katanin localizes to the centrosome, this localization  seems likely to require intact centrioles/basal bodies. Centrioles  are a component of the metazoan centrosome and help to recruit  pericentriolar material (PCM) that nucleates both cytoplasmic and  spindle microtubules [8,9]. Functional centrioles and intact  subdistal appendages are required for the recruitment of PCM  proteins in animals. SPD-2, SPD-5 and SAS-4, which were first  identified in C. elegans and localize to centrioles by immuno-  electron microscopy, play essential roles in centriole biogenesis and  they are needed to recruit c-tubulin and aurora kinase to the PCM [9-11]. Sas-4 is thought to play a key role as it shows binding to  ab-tubulin dimers [12] as well as with Sas-5 and Cep152/Asl. Recruitment in Drosophila requires Asl (Cep152) and D-Spd2  (Cep192) [13]. The SPD-2/Cep192 homolog and centrosomin  (Cnn), localizes to the centrioles and spd2 mutants show  significantly reduced concentrations of several centrosomal pro-  teins that include Cnn, c-tubulin, Dd4/Dgrip91, and D-TACC [8,14]. Subdistal appendages on mature centrioles contain ninein  [15]. Tissue culture cells depleted of ninein by siRNA show a  significant reduction in c-tubulin and the complete absence of the protein, astrin, at the centrosome [16]. Thus, defective centrioles  or depletion of centriolar proteins prevent recruitment of some or  all pericentriolar proteins.  When a centriole matures and converts to a basal body, it  recruits intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins and motors [17,18].  Just as centriolar proteins are required to recruit PCM compo-  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940    nents for cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules, defective basal  bodies disrupt localization of IFT proteins. In wild-type Chlamy-  domonas cells, IFT proteins accumulate around the basal body in a  horseshoe-shaped structure [19,20]. The bld2-1 mutant has an  incompletely assembled basal body [21], and although the IFT  proteins are present, their localization is diffuse rather than in the  horseshoe-shaped pattern.  We reasoned that Chlamydomonas mutants with basal body  defects that lack the ability to dock intraflagellar transport proteins  correctly could also fail to localize PCM components properly. We  report a new phenotype that is associated with basal body  biogenesis defects; these mutant strains show increased sensitivity  to the microtubule-stabilizing drug, Taxol. We hypothesize that  lack of localization or mislocalization of PCM-targeted proteins  contributes to the Taxol supersensitivity phenotype.  Strains with basal body integrity defects fall into several classes.  The first class shows defects in the assembly of the microtubule  blades and includes bld2, bld10, bld12, uni2 and uni3. The bld2,  bld10, and bld12 mutants lack complete microtubule blades, and  uni3 mutants lack triplet microtubules [22-25]. The uni1 and uni2  mutant shows a defect in the transition zone [26,27] and the uni1;  uni2 double mutant affects the change from triplet to doublet  microtubules [28]. The second class of mutants shows defects in  the fibers that are required to maintain proper basal body  orientation and segregation and include vfl1, vfl2, and vfl3 [29-31].  We screened existing basal body and flagellar mutants for  increased sensitivity to the microtubule-stabilizing drug, Taxol, as  well as performed several screens for additional mutants that  confer Taxol sensitivity. We find that katanin mutants in  Chlamydomonas confer Taxol sensitivity and that mutants with  basal body defects confer Taxol sensitivity, and have abnormal  recruitment of the p80 katanin subunit to the basal bodies.  Materials and Methods  Cell Culture, Genetic and Phenotypic Analyses Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth conditions [32], matings [33],  and revertant isolation using ultraviolet irradiation [34] were  performed as previously described. Aflagellate strains were mated  with 100 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,  MO) and 30 mM isobutyl 1-methylxanthine (Aldrich, Milwaukee,  WI) [33]. For each sample, 200 cells were counted after fixation  with 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Taxol  (paciltaxel, Sigma-Aldrich) was tested at concentrations varying  from 2 mM to 18 mM in DMSO. Media with Taxol were kept in the dark for storage and in yellow Lucite boxes during growth to  prevent its break down [35]. To determine if cells recovered from  exposure to Taxol, cells were stained with 0.01% Trypan blue  (Sigma-Aldrich). Oryzalin was a gift of Eli Lilly and Company.  Oryzalin and colchicine (Sigma-Aldrich) were tested at 0.5-1 mM and 1-5 mM, respectively. The drugs, canavanine, cycloheximide, glyphosate, tunicamycin, methionine sulfoximine, anisomycin,  erthyromycin, spectinomycin, 0.1% NP-40, 5-methyl anthranilic  acid, and 3-aminopyridine were tested at a 2, 3, and 4 fold higher  and lower than in [36]. Cleavage furrow placement measurements  were performed as previously described [34], except ImageJ (NIH)  was used to measure the area of the cells. Permutation tests were  performed using 1000 permutations to determine significance  [37].  The tub2-1 (b2-tubulin mutant that was first published as colR4, pf15-1, pf19-1, uni2-2, vfl1-1, vfl2-1 and vfl3-1 strains were obtained  from the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center. The PF15 vector (pPF15)  was obtained from E. Smith (Dartmouth University). The bld10-1  and bld12-1 strains were obtained from M. Hirono (University of  Tokyo).  For synchrony, cells were grown in high salt medium [38] with a  14:10 light: dark cycle as described previously [39] at 21uC and were maintained at a density of 1-36105 cells/ml. Samples were taken at 15 and 30 min time points beginning at 15 min into the  dark phase.  Mutagenesis and Isolation of new bld2 Alleles To isolate new alleles by noncomplementation, bld2-2 NIT2  ac17/BLD2 nit2-1 AC17 diploid cells were used as previously  described [34]. Diploid cells were grown on rich (R) solid medium  and subjected to 75,000 mJoules/cm2 of ultraviolet irradiation and allowed to recover in the dark for 24 hours. Each plate was divided  into 12 sections and each section was placed individually into  20 ml R liquid medium in 256150 mm culture tubes. Cells at the bottom of the tube were transferred to new tubes containing 20 ml  R medium every 2-3 days for a total of 12 times and 10 ml from the bottom of the last tube was plated onto solid R medium.  Individual colonies were picked into 2.5 ml R liquid medium and  assayed for their ability to oppose gravity.  To differentiate between mutations resulting from chromosome  loss or mitotic recombination, dominant enhancers, and new  alleles we took advantage of the absence of a FokI restriction  enzyme site in the bld2-2 allele. PCR amplification of the region  around the mutation and digestion with the FokI restriction  enzyme produces both the digested wild-type product and uncut  bld2-2 product in the heterozygous parental diploid. If mitotic  recombination or chromosome loss occurs, only the bld2-2  fragment would be amplified by PCR [34].  To isolate new alleles in haploid strains, an insertional mutant  collection with 3000 independent strains, which was a kind gift  from Dr. Lauren Mets (University of Chicago), was used. It was  constructed in the CC-125 strain by transformation with the ble  gene [40]. The collection was screened by replica plating using  RepliPlate pads (FMC, Rockland, ME) onto solid R medium with  8 mM Taxol at 25uC. Plates containing Taxol were maintained in yellow Lucite boxes [35].  PCR and Sequencing Genomic DNA from bld2-5 and bld2-6 cells was isolated using a  modified protocol of the Genisol Maxi-Prep Kit (Abgene, Rock-  ford, IL). Between 10 5 -10  6 cells were suspended in 50 ml of 1X  Tris-EDTA buffer with a 100-fold reduction in the suggested  volumes. Primers for sequencing were described previously and  are available upon request. REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma-  Aldrich) was used with the following conditions: 31 cycles of 1 min  at 95uC, 1 min at 57uC and 1 min at 72uC followed by a 10 min extension at 72uC. PCR products were column purified (QIA- GEN, Valencia, CA) and then cycle sequenced using the following  conditions: 2 min at 96uC and 32 cycles of 96uC for 10 sec, 50uC for 5 sec and 60uC for 4 min. Sequencing reactions were precipitated with the addition of 125 mM EDTA and 100%  ethanol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT).  Reactions were centrifuged, washed with 70% ethanol and dried  before the addition of Hi-Di formamide (Applied Biosystems,  Foster City, CA). After 2 min incubation at 95uC, the reactions were loaded onto a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).  Sequenced data were aligned and analyzed with Sequencher  (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Genomic DNA from the eight  intragenic revertants was isolated and sequenced as described  above with primers that produce a 367 bp fragment (tns-28-1f;  (GTGACAACGGGGAACTAAGC and tns-28-1r:GA-  CAGCTGCTGCATTGTGAT).

Construction of PF15 Transgene by Knitting PCR The pPF15 vector, provided by Elizabeth Smith (Dartmouth  University), was used to amplify two fragments of 304 and 195 bp  for knitting PCR [43] using the primers PF15 FRAG F/PF15  NOT R (CCCTCCTCGCCCAGGTGATG,  CTAGCGGCCGCGCTGCGCCAGCTG) and PF15 NOT F/  PF15 FRAG R (CAGCTGGCGCAGCGCGGCCGCTAG,  CATTCGTCCTGCAGGGCCAC). The PF15 NOT primers  contain the NotI restriction enzyme site and it changes the last  amino acid of PF15 from a leucine to an asparagine. These  fragments were amplified using Klentaq Long and Accurate  polymerase using the following conditions: 30 cycles of 1 min at  95uC, 1 min at 56uC and 1 min at 68uC, followed by a 30 min extension at 68uC. The fragments were purified from a 2% agarose gel (Gel Purification Kit; MO BIO Laboratories Inc.,  Carlsbad, CA). The above PCR was repeated using equal  quantities of each PCR product and the PF15 FRAG primers to  incorporate a NotI restriction site that was used to clone the HA tag  into the gene (Figure S1). The resulting approximately 500 bp  fragment was gel purified and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO  vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transformed colonies were  verified by colony PCR and used to isolate plasmid DNA with the  Figure 1. Basal body mutant strains show supersensitivity to Taxol.

The PF15 fragment with the incorporated NotI site  (pPF15-N) was digested with EcoRI, gel purified as described  above, and ligated to the LITMUS 28i vector (New England  Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Transformed colonies were verified by  colony PCR using the PF15 FRAG primers. The HA tag was  ligated separately into pPF15-N plasmids. Positive colonies were  assayed for number of tags and orientation by PCR and digestion.  Multiple tagged PF15 genes were transformed into the pf15  mutant strain by electroporation [44,45] and transformants were  screened by their ability to oppose gravity.  Preparation of Cells for Electron Microscopy Cells were prepared for electron microscopy using methods  described in O'Toole et al. [46,47]. Briefly, aliquots of cells grown  in suspension were spun at 5006g and then resuspended in 150 mM mannitol. The samples were spun again at 5006g and the resulting loose cell pellet was then transferred to aluminum  sample holders and rapidly frozen in a Balzers HPM010 high  pressure freezer (BAL-TEC, Technotrade International, Manche-  ster, NH). The frozen cells were freeze-substituted for three days at  290uC in 1% OsO4 and 0.1% uranyl acetate in acetone, warmed to room temperature and embedded in epon/araldite resin.  Serial thin (50-70 nm) or thick (250-400 nm) sections were cut  using an Ultracut-E microtome (Leica, Germany) and the section  ribbons were collected onto Formvar-coated copper slot grids.

Electron tomography was carried out essentially as described  [47,48]. The specimens were placed in a tilt-rotate specimen  holder (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) and tomographic data sets  recorded using a TECNAI F30 intermediate-voltage electron  microscope (FEI, The Netherlands) operated at 300 kV. Images  were captured every 1u over a 660u range using a Gatan 2 K62 K CCD camera at a pixel size of 1 nm. The grid was rotated 90u, and a second tilt series was acquired. Dual-axis tomographic reconstruction was carried out using the IMOD  software package as previously described [46,49,50]. Briefly, the  tilted views were aligned using the positions of the colloidal gold  particles, and tomograms were calculated using an R-weighted  back projection algorithm. The two tomograms were then aligned  to each other and combined. Finally, dual-axis tomograms from  serial sections were aligned and combined using the methods  described by O'Toole et al. [46]. A total of 7 dual-axis tomograms  were reconstructed to examine the 3-D fine structure of the bld2-5  basal bodies.  Indirect Immunofluorescence Interphase cells were treated with autolysin to remove cell walls  [51,52] and resuspended in MT buffer [53] and 12% hexylene  glycol [32] and applied to slides pretreated with poly-L-lysine  (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at RT and dried. Slides were incubated  in methanol prechilled to 220uC for 10 min. Slides were rehydrated in 16 PBS and incubated in blocking solution (12.5% BSA, 0.01% cold water fish gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich)) in  16 PBS for 30 min. Slides were transferred to blocking solution with 10% newborn goat serum (Accurate Chemical, Westbury,  NY) and incubated for 30 min at RT without agitation. Primary  antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated  overnight at 4uC with the following dilutions; anti-acetylated a- tubulin (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-centrin (1:1000; kindly  provided by Dr. Jeff Salisbury, Mayo Clinic), anti-HA (500 ng/  ml; Roche, Indianapolis, In), anti-IFT74 (1:600; kindly provided by Dr. Carlo Iomini), and anti-c-tubulin (1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich). Slides were washed in 10% blocking solution three times with  agitation, 10 min each, at RT and incubated in secondary  antibody for 1 hr at RT. Alexa 594 and Alexa 488 mouse and  rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) were used at 1:1000  dilution in blocking solution. Slides were washed three times with  agitation, 10 min each, at RT and mounted with Vectashield  (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Images were collected on  an Axiophot microscope modified with a Lambda DG-4 light  source (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA) equipped with a  Photometrics Cascade 512B camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson,  AZ) and a Physick Instrument piezoelectric stage (Karlsruhe,  Germany). Slidebook Digital Software was used for deconvolution  of the images (Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Denver, CO) on a  Dell dual processor computer (Round Rock, TX). Images were  exported to Adobe Photoshop CS2 (Adobe Systems, Mountain  View, CA).  Images with synchronized cells were obtained with a PerkinEl-  mer UltraVIEW VoX laser scanning disk confocal system  equipped with a Zeiss AxioObserver Z1 microscope, a-Plan-  Apochromat 1006/1.46 oil DIC M27 objective, and EMCCD camera. Images were acquired with Volocity software and are  displayed as maximum projections assembled from a z-stack.  Pictures were assembled in Adobe Illustrator.

The ratio of the areas of wild-type sister cells is approximately equal to one (black bars), whereas the ratio of the areas of bld2-5 (gray bars) and bld2-6 (white bars) sister cells is equal to or greater than one, which suggests a defect in proper placement of the cleavage furrow [34]. These results are statistically significant compared by a permutation test [37]. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053940.g004  Basal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin Function  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940    samples were boiled for 5 min and centrifuged for 1 min to pellet  cell debris before loading supernatant onto the gel. Proteins from  intact cells were size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE minigels  (1.0 mM thick, 10% acrylamide; 29:1 with Bis-acrylamide) and  transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore; Billerica, MA)  in 20% methanol at 50 V for 1 hour. The rat anti-HA high-affinity  antibody (200 ng/ml) and chicken anti-PbsA (1:10,000, Agrisera;  Sweden) were diluted in 5% milk in PBS. Secondary antibodies,  donkey anti-rat HRP (1:10,000, Jackson Labs) and rabbit anti-  chicken IgY, HRP (1;10,000, Promega) were diluted in 5% milk in  PBS. Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Roche) was used for  detection and exposure to Super RX x-ray film (Fujifilm,  Stamford, CT). Using Image J, the expression of katanin p80  was normalized to the PbsA control by measuring the pixels within  a constant area and calculating a ratio for each to be compared to  pf15; PF15HA.

Similar to the  loss of the p60 katanin subunit in Tetrahymena [7], these mutants  confer sensitivity to Taxol (Figure 1). Wild-type cells arrest as  swollen cells on 18 mM Taxol medium, while pf15-1 and pf19-1 mutant cells become swollen and do not divide on 8 to 18 mM Taxol media (Figure 1C, G). We screened other mutants with  defects in axonemal substructures needed for motility (pf2, pf9,  pf14, pf16, pf17, pf18, oda2, ida3) [55,57,58]and only the two  katanin mutants confer Taxol supersensitivity.  We next examined the role of basal bodies in this phenotype.  The bld2-1 [34], uni3-1 [22], bld10-1 [23], bld12-1 [25], vfl1 [30],  vfl2-1 [31], and vfl3 [29] mutations confer Taxol supersensitivity  (Figure 1A, B), while the uni1-2 [26] and the uni2-2 [27] mutants  do not confer supersensitivity. Since a majority of these strains  have a high proportion of aflagellate cells, we asked if the Taxol  phenotype was related to the aflagellate phenotype or the basal  body phenotype. Mutants that lack flagella due to defects in IFT  proteins and motors (bld1, ift80 at 21uC and fla8, fla10, fla11, fla15, fla17 at 32uC) [20,59-65] do not show Taxol supersensitivity (Figure 1A, B). To ask if the Taxol supersensitivity reflects a  general defect in drug uptake or export, we examined the bld2-1  and pf15-1 strains for resistance or sensitivity to other inhibitors  (see Materials and Methods for a list). No resistance or  supersensitivity was observed, which suggests that the Taxol  supersensitivity of the bld2 and pf15 alleles does not result from  defective import or export. In summary, multiple basal body  mutants and the katanin mutants confer Taxol sensitivity. The  wild-type strains show similar swelling but require increased  concentrations of Taxol (Figure 1 C-J).  It is likely that multiple proteins may require intact basal bodies  for localization and some of these may influence microtubule  dynamics. Thus, the Taxol phenotype of the basal body mutants  could arise from a failure to recruit katanin or a failure to recruit  katanin and other proteins. This can be tested in double mutants  of null mutants of katanin and basal body proteins. Therefore, we  sought to identify null alleles of pf15 and bld2.  Isolation of pf15-3 as a Taxol Supersensitive Mutant Wild-type cells were mutagenized with ultraviolet light and 100  independent, nonmotile strains were isolated and 12 of these  confer Taxol supersensitivity. One of these strains had immotile  flagella. Three lines of evidence show that it carries a new pf15  allele. The strain was mapped and is tightly linked to the PF15  locus in 36 tetrads. The gene was sequenced and a C to T change  was observed that generates a nonsense codon at amino acid Q59.  The immotile cilia defect and the Taxol supersensitivity is rescued  by the PF15::HA transgene (described below) in 17 independent  transformants. The rescued strains have flagella with normal  length and motility. The new allele is likely to be a null allele and  the phenotype of the new pf15-3 strain has similar phenotypes to  the original pf15-1 allele, although the presence of central pair  microtubules has not been determined in the pf15-3 mutant.  Isolation of a Taxol Supersensitive bld2-6 Allele A collection of 3000 mutant strains made by insertional  mutagenesis with the ble gene, which confers Zeocin resistance,  [40] was screened for the failure to form colonies on 8 mM Taxol medium. Thirty-five strains showed Taxol supersensitivity and  were crossed with a wild-type strain (CC-124) to determine if the  insertional ble marker cosegregates with the Taxol phenotype.  Cosegregation of Zeocin resistance and Taxol supersensitivity was  observed in only one strain (strain ble12), which suggests that the  selection on Zeocin medium was highly mutagenic as this high  frequency of a lack of cosegregation is not observed in other  insertional collections. In the ble12 strain, the Taxol phenotype  (Figure 1A, B) and resistance to Zeocin cosegregates in 370 tetrads.  This strain has a third phenotype; it completely lacks flagella  (Table 1) and this phenotype cosegregates as well. The three  phenotypes map to linkage group III near the NIT2 locus based on  crosses to CC-1952. The ble12 strain fails to complement the bld2-  2 and bld2-5 mutations (see below) for the Taxol and flagellar  phenotypes in 8 independent diploid strains for each allele. It also  fails to complement the bld2-2 mutation for the meiotic phenotype;  no viable progeny were recovered from 104 tetrads of this cross.  PCR with 21 primer pairs in this region revealed that ble12 carries  a 12.6 kb deletion that removes the e-tubulin gene and the coding region of the PRMT1 gene, which encodes a protein methyltrans-  ferase protein (Table S2). The ble12 mutant allele is named bld2-6.  bld2; pf15 Double Mutants have an Additive Phenotype The Taxol phenotype of the bld2 alleles and the pf15 strains is  similar and both are unable to grow on 8 mM Taxol containing medium. Double mutants were constructed to ask if the phenotype  of double mutants is more severe than either mutant alone. If there  are other proteins that must be recruited, then an additive or  synthetic phenotype should be observed using the two null alleles.  Wild-type, pf15-3, bld2-6, pf15-3; bld2-6, bld2-6; pf15-1, and bld2-6;  pf15-3 were grown on 0, 4, 6, 10 mM Taxol containing medium. All strains grow on 4 mM and only the bld2-6, pf15-1 and the bld2- 6; pf15-3 double mutant strains fail to grow on 6 mM Taxol containing medium while the single mutant strains form colonies  on this concentration (Figure 1K). This additive phenotype  suggests that the recruitment of other proteins besides katanin  p80 may affect microtubule dynamics. This is not surprising in  that over 100 proteins have postulated to reside at the centrosome  [66].  Characterization of the bld2-4 allele We had previously reported that e-tubulin is an essential gene  based on the bld2-4 allele [34]. The bld2-4 allele is an insertional  Figure 6.

Genetic  analysis showed that the bld2-4 allele could only be recovered in a  disomic background, which suggested that e-tubulin was an essential gene in Chlamydomonas. The isolation of the bld2-6 brought  into question if e-tubulin is an essential gene. To ask if the BLD2 transgene is sufficient to rescue the lethal phenotype [34], we used  the disomic bld2-1; bld2-4 in a series of crosses (Figure S2). We  found that two copies of the BLD2 gene are necessary to rescue the  meiotic lethal phenotype and that the BLD2 transgene fails to  rescue the mitotic lethality. To ask if the insertion is associated  with a deletion and to determine the extent of the deletion,  progeny obtained from a cross with the polymorphic strain, CC-  1952, were used. Progeny were scored by the presence of the NIT2  allele from the CC-1952 parent, the absence of the bld2-1 allele,  the presence of the BLD2 transgene. The extent of the deletion was  estimated by the presence/absence of heterozygosity of physical  markers surrounding the BLD2 gene (Table S1). The deletion  extends from position 4125635 on chromosome 3 to between  4026909 and 4021900, which removes 28 predicted genes. The  dominant meiotic lethality is likely to be due to the loss of multiple  genes given that the transgene rescues the meiotic phenotype of  bld2-6 (see below). Rescue of the mitotic lethality of bld2-4 is likely  to require additional flanking DNA and thus e-tubulin is not an essential gene as reported previously [34].  Isolation and Identification of the bld2-5 Allele Concurrently, we identified an additional bld2 allele using a  noncomplementation screen. A screen of phenotypically wild-type  heterozygous BLD2/bld2 diploid strains produced six strains that  failed to swim. Non-complementation screens produce several  outcomes in addition to new alleles, which include mitotic  recombination, chromosome loss and unlinked dominant enhanc-  ers [34]. Two of the mutant strains resulted from mitotic  recombination or chromosome loss based on the loss of the FokI  restriction site (see Material and Methods). The remaining four  strains remained heterozygous at the BLD2 locus and were mated  to a bld2 strain to determine if the new mutations were new alleles  or unlinked dominant enhancers. Two of the mutants produced  swimming progeny that suggest an unlinked dominant enhancer.  The other two strains did not produce swimming progeny, which  suggests new alleles. One of these strains (4-1) was characterized.  The 4-1 mutant strain was backcrossed twice to wild-type cells  to remove unlinked mutations and to restore euploidy as judged by  greater than 86% meiotic viability. The backcrossed 4-1 strain  failed to oppose to gravity and lacked flagella and the aflagellate  phenotype was used for mapping. The mutation failed to  recombine with the bld2-1 allele in 210 complete tetrads. We  analyzed 1571 progeny from the cross of 4-1 to the polymorphic  strain, CC-1952 [67] using dCAPs markers (Table S2). The 4-1  mutation maps to a 54.1 kb region that includes the BLD2 gene  [68] and gives a value of 102 kb per map unit for this region.  We sequenced e-tubulin from the 4-1 strain and found a T to A transition that changes an isoleucine to an asparagine at amino  acid 163 (I163N).

The FokI restriction  enzyme digest assay (see Materials and Methods) differentiates  between swimming progeny with the BLD2 transgene and the  bld2-1 allele (heterozygous) or the 4-1 allele (homozygous).  Approximately one-half of the swimming progeny show the  homozygous digestion pattern predicted for the 4-1 strain and the  remainder shows the heterozygous pattern of wild-type and bld2-1  (n = 6; data not shown). Thus, the transgene rescues the flagellar  phenotype of the 4-1 allele to the same extent as it rescues the bld2-  1 allele (see Table 1). Unlike the other bld2 alleles, the 4-1 allele  does not display a meiotic phenotype in four homoallelic or 16  heteroallelic meiotic crosses of independent meiotic progeny.  The isoleucine is not highly conserved in e-tubulin from a diverse range of organisms (7 of 28), therefore we screened for  reversion of the aflagellate phenotype to provide further evidence  that this change was responsible for the phenotypes. Cells were  mutagenized with ultraviolet light and 25 independent strains that  swim were isolated. In crosses of these swimming strains to wild-  type cells, the aflagellate phenotype was not recovered in 8 of the  25 strains in at least 10 tetrads; these are likely to be intragenic  revertants or tightly linked suppressors. The other 17 strains  segregated the aflagellate phenotype, which indicates that they  contain extragenic suppressor mutations. The characterization of  these extragenic suppressors will be reported elsewhere. To  determine if the mutation in the 4-1 strain is changed in the  revertants, a 367 bp fragment containing the I163N mutation was  sequenced. Four of the strains convert the asparagine back to  isoleucine; these are true revertants. The remaining four strains  are pseudorevertants. Two strains (T42 and T16) change the  asparagine to serine (N163S) and the other two strains (T33 and  T29) convert the serine at position 144 to a glycine (S144G, I163N),  but retain the asparagine. The amino acids from e-tubulin are compared to the corresponding amino acids of the b-tubulin crystal structure using Modeller [69]. The isoleucine of e-tubulin lies in a hydrophobic region and the S144 lies in loop between a b- strand (B4) and a a-helix (H3), which is a part of the nucleotide binding region [70]. The change of a hydrophobic isoleucine to a  hydrophilic asparagine should greatly change the properties of this  region. In the T42 and T16 strains, asparagine is mutated to the  smaller and more neutral amino acid serine. The identification of  a mutation in the coding region of e-tubulin, the rescue of the phenotype with a wild-type e-tubulin transgene and the identifi- cation of both true and pseudorevertants suggest that the 4-1 strain  is a new e-tubulin allele that we call bld2-5. Furthermore, the pseudorevertants identify new bld2 alleles: the T42 and T16  pseudorevertants are named bld2-7 and bld2-8 and the T33 and  T29 pseudorevertants are named bld2-9 and bld2-10. The bld2-5  strain with an extra copy of BLD2 (e-tubulin) as well the bld2-7 and bld2-9 intragenic revertants do not show the Taxol supersensitivity  phenotype (Figure 1A, B).  Phenotypic Analysis of the bld2-5 and Pseudorevertant Strains  The bld2-5 strain exhibits a less severe flagellar assembly defect  than observed in previously described bld2 alleles. Ninety-five  percent of the bld2-5 cells are aflagellate, but 4% of the cells have  one flagellum and 1% has two flagella in logarithmically grown  cells (n = 200) (Table 1). Surprisingly, when bld2-5 cells are  deprived of nitrogen and arrested in G1 of the cell cycle as gametic  cells, 20.5% of the cells assemble at least one flagellum. Changing  the cell cycle time by growing cells at 14uC or 32uC does not change the number of flagellated cells (Table 1), which suggests the  bld2-5 allele is not temperature-sensitive, but may be modulated by  nutritional cues. This is the only bld2 allele that shows this  phenotype.  In wild-type strains, centrin is a component of the distal striated  fiber that connects the distal ends of the basal bodies, the stellate  fibers of the transition zone, and extends as fibers from the basal  body to the nucleus (the nucleo-basal body connector) [71]  (Figure 2A, B). In bld2-1 strains, centrin collapses on or around the  nucleus [34,72]. Collapsed centrin occurs in 41% of bld2-5 cells  (n = 50, Figure 2C) while the remainder has a wild-type  localization pattern (Figure 2D). It appears that the presence of  an extended nucleo-basal body connector does not guarantee  flagellar assembly.  In wild-type strains, acetylated a-tubulin labeling of rootlet microtubules forms a cruicate pattern [32,73] Figure 3A, B). The  bld2-5 strain, like other bld2 strains, shows disorganized rootlet  microtubules in 95% of the cells (Figure 3C, D). The 5% of cells  with wild-type rootlet microtubules are likely to have intact  microtubule blades at the proximal end of the basal bodies [74].  Proper placement of the cleavage furrow depends on both centrin  and rootlet microtubules [75]. Defects in these cytoskeletal  structures cause aberrant cleavage furrow placement [76]. The  area of newly divided daughter cells was measured to determine if  the cleavage furrows were properly placed, since wild-type cells  produce daughters with equal sizes [34]. Based on measurements  of 100 pairs of cells, the bld2-5 strain produces daughters with  significantly different areas (p = 0.001), which indicates a defect in  cleavage furrow placement (Figure 4A). The sum of bld2-5 sister  cells' areas is significantly smaller than wild-type (p = 5610214, Figure 4B), which may suggest that the cells divide earlier than in  wild-type cells. Both rescued transformants (bld2-5; BLD2TG) and  intragenic revertants (bld2-7 and bld2-9) assemble comparable  numbers of flagella as wild-type cells (Table 1). They display wild-  type centrin localization (Figure 2E-J). The transgene containing  strain has wild-type rootlet microtubules (Figure 3E-J), but  approximately 50% of rootlet microtubule bundles (n = 15) in  the intragenic revertants appear to be slightly splayed at their ends  (Figure 3H).  The bld2-6 allele also shows centrin collapsed on the nucleus  (Figure 2K, L) and disorganized rootlet microtubules (Figure 3M,  N). bld2-6 cells are 100% aflagellate as vegetative or gametic cells  (Table 1). A single copy of the e-tubulin gene rescues the flagellar, Taxol, and meiotic defects as well as centrin localization (n = 20)  and the rootlet microtubules phenotypes of the bld2-6 allele (n = 15).  bld2-5 Cells have Staggered Microtubule Blades Lengths in Mature Basal Bodies  Each mature basal body is associated with a probasal body that  will elongate during the next mitotic cycle [77,78]. In wild-type  Figure 8. IFT74 localization is aberrant in the bld2 alleles. (A-C) IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize.

In bld2-5 cells, the  proximal ends of the probasal bodies maintain a ring of  amorphous material and a cartwheel, however microtubule blades  may be incomplete (Figure 5; Movie S1). Unlike the probasal  bodies, the amorphous material in the mature bld2-5 basal body is  not present as a thin ring rather it can extend to over 200 nm,  which is variable from cell to cell. Most tomographic reconstruc-  tions have both amorphous material and microtubule blades  (Figure 5A-E; arrowheads; Figure S3; arrowheads). The assembly  of microtubule blades is also incomplete with singlet, doublet and  sometimes triplet microtubules present as one moves from the  proximal base of the basal body to the distal end (Figure 5; right;  Figure S3). Incomplete basal bodies were also observed with only 7  or 8 blades are present at the distal tip (Figure S3A). In some cells  the cartwheel structure assembles farther from the proximal base  than in wild-type basal bodies (Figure 5 C, D; arrow; Figure S3C;  arrow). Basal bodies competent to template flagella assemble  ectopic transition zone material in the basal body proper (Figure  S3B, D; arrow), which resembles the ectopic transition zone  present in the uni3-1 strain [47]. Probasal bodies in the bld2-5  strain assemble with minor defects; however, as the basal body  matures, it loses its integrity, which indicates that Bld2p is needed  to maintain basal body structure. The collapsed centrin fibers and  aberrant rootlet microtubules observed by immunofluorescence  are confirmed by the tomography in which the fibers are  misplaced in many of the cells.  Taxol Supersensitive Strains Recover from Taxol Treatment  Mutant and wild-type cells were treated with 8 mM Taxol for 48 hours, washed twice in rich medium and stained with Trypan blue  to determine the number of dead cells in each replicate sample  (n = 3). There was no significant difference between the average  number of live cells in treated and untreated cultures of bld2-5,  bld2-6, tub2-1, pf15-1 and pf15-3 strains (Table 2). These data  suggest that the Taxol supersensitivity of these mutants does not  arise from a basal body integrity checkpoint but rather from an  arrest.  Katanin is Mislocalized in the bld2 Mutants Katanin influences microtubule dynamics by severing microtu-  bules. The PF15 gene encodes p80 katanin [56] and pf15 strains  show Taxol supersensitive (Figure 1A, B). We constructed a PF15-  HA epitope tagged vector that places the HA tag at the terminal  amino acid, which was changed from a leucine to an asparagine,  transformed the plasmid into the pf15-1 strain, and screened for  rescue of the paralyzed flagellar phenotype. Twenty-one indepen-  dent swimming strains were isolated and each transgenic strain  also rescues the Taxol supersensitive phenotype. Immunoblots  were used to determine which transgenic lines have the highest  level of PF15-HA protein. Seven of the twenty-0ne strains showed  a band detected by antibodies to HA antibody with the correct  molecular weight (,100 kDa). Based on immunoblot and immunofluorescence data, one of the lines was used for further  analysis (Figure 6).  By immunofluorescence, katanin localizes as two dots in  interphase (n = 57, (Figure 6A-D) and to the spindle poles during  mitosis (n = 4, Figure 6Y-A'; Figure 7) in wild-type cells. Sixty-six  percent of bld2-6 cells (n = 70) lack katanin p80 staining and the  remainder have diffuse, lower intensity staining (Figure 6E-H).  The bld2-5 cells (n = 30) show two centrin localization patterns  (Figure 2C, D), which are correlated to the katanin localization  pattern. Of the cells with collapsed centrin, the majority (n = 12/  14) has no katanin p80 localization while the remaining two have  diffuse katanin p80 at the basal bodies (Figure 6I, J). Of the cells  with wild-type centrin fibers (n = 16), 4 lack katanin p80 staining  and 8 show diffuse katanin p80 localization (Figure 6K, L). The  remaining 4 cells show wild-type katanin p80 localization.  Intragenic revertants display wild-type katanin p80 localization  (n = 40) (Figure 6P-S). Immunoblots show that the amount of  katanin p80 protein in the bld2 cells is similar to the expression in  wild-type cells. Therefore, the lack of localization is not due to a  decrease in katanin p80 expression (Figure 6B'). Intact basal bodies  appear to be important for katanin p80 localization.  Katanin Localization Requires Triplet Microtubules, but not the Transition Zone  To further determine which structures in the basal body  apparatus are needed for katanin p80 localization, we examined  p80 localization in uni1-2 cells, which lack a transition zone on the  daughter basal body [26] in uni3-1 cells, which assemble doublet  but not triplet microtubules [22,80]; and in bld10 cells, which lack  any microtubule blades [23]. Katanin p80 localization in uni1-2  cells appears as two dots (n = 6), which suggests it does not require  the transition zone for proper localization (Figure 6Q, R). In bld10-  1 cells, there is no localization of katanin p80 (n = 30), which  further supports the need for the basal body for localization of  katanin. Localization of katanin p80 in the uni3 cells shows a  variety of phenotypes that include the complete absence (40/50),  diffuse staining (5/50) or increased signal (5/50) (Figure 6S-V).  Because uni3-1 cells lack triplet microtubule blades except at the  distal tip of the basal body [22], it seems likely that triplet  microtubules are important for katanin p80 localization but are  not sufficient.  IFT52 localizes to transition fibers and localizes aberrantly in  the bld2-1 allele [20], we examined localization of another  component of the IFT B complex, IFT74. As shown previously  [61], IFT74 localizes to the flagellar base as a punctate dot and in  the proximal region of the flagella in wild-type cells (Figure 8D-F).  IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize in wild-type cells  (Figure 8A-C). This result supports the uni1-2 result that katanin  p80 is not present on the transition fibers.  Like the katanin p80 localization, the IFT74 pattern in bld2-5 is  more diffuse than in wild-type cells (n = 40, Figure 8G-I). In bld2-6  cells, there is increased staining throughout the cytoplasm of all  cells with dots that are not at the basal body region (n = 40)  (Figure 8J-L). Sixteen cells show IFT74 localization near the basal  bodies. The increased cytoplasmic staining in bld2-6 cells may  reflect an increased level of IFT74 in the cytoplasm that would  normally be present in the flagella.  Discussion  Loss of Basal Body Integrity Perturbs Katanin Localization The pf15 and pf19 alleles are unique among the flagellar motility  mutants tested in Chlamydomonas; they confer supersensitivity to  Taxol (Figure 1). The mutants with basal body integrity defects  (bld2, bld10, bld12, uni3) or basal body fiber defects (vfl1, vfl2, vfl3)  also confer Taxol supersensitivity and suggest a simple hypothesis  that we tested. These organelles help to recruit proteins for spindle  assembly and function. Specifically, we showed that a loss of basal  body integrity results in a failure to recruit and localize katanin  and this failure mimics the loss of function phenotype of the pf15  and pf19 strains. Acetylation, a post-translational modification of  K40 in a-tubulin, is associated with more stable microtubules [81], and the Taxol supersensitivity phenotype of a b-tubulin mutant [2]  Basal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin Function  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940    or in the katanin mutants in Tetrahymena [7] is associated with  increased levels of acetylated a-tubulin. The bld2 alleles do not have increased acetylation of interphase microtubules (Figure 3).  We identified viable null alleles in the PF15 and BLD2 genes,  which suggest that these two genes are not essential in  Chlamydomonas. The bld2-6; pf15 double mutant confers a more  severe defect than in either single mutant on Taxol medium. This  more severe phenotype indicates that recruitment of additional  proteins at basal bodies affects microtubule dynamics. None of the  mutants block spindle function in mitosis in the absence of Taxol.  Given that the bld2-1 and bld2-6 alleles have a recessive meiotic  defect, there may be a stronger requirement for the recruitment of  proteins to the meiotic spindle than to the mitotic spindle in  Chlamydomonas. Although mutants with basal body integrity defects  can still build spindles and progress through the cell cycle,  microtubules in these cells may be inherently unstable as judged by  Taxol sensitivity.  Electron tomography of the bld2-5 allele suggests that e-tubulin is necessary for basal body assembly/elongation. This staggered  phenotype of bld2-5 is also observed in the bld2-1; rgn1-1 strain,  where rgn1-1 is a partial suppressor of the bld2-1 allele [34], and it  is similar to the knockdown phenotype observed in Paramecium  [82]. Since the probasal body structure is not affected to a large  degree, this allele suggests that this mutant e-tubulin is able to participate in the initiation events needed to build the probasal  body, but not in the elongation of the probasal body to the  daughter basal body. Based on tomographic reconstruction of  duplicating basal bodies, these two events are separated in time.  The existing probasal body elongates to become the daughter  basal body at prophase and the new probasal body forms in  metaphase (O'Toole and Dutcher, in preparation).  Rasi and colleagues reported that katanin p60 is an essential  gene, is required for release of the basal bodies from the flagella  using an RNA interference strategy to the p60 gene, and that  katanin localizes to the basal bodies [83]. However, Dymek and  Smith suggest that katanin p60 is encoded by the PF19 gene [84].  Based on two pf19 alleles, this gene does not play a role in release  of flagella, and the anti-p60 serum reported by Rasi does not  recognize the tagged p60-GFP protein in whole cell extracts [84],  which makes our tagged gene the only means to examine  localization of the katanin heterodimer. Our phenotypes for pf15  and pf19 are similar and suggest that katanin p60 and p80 behave  similarly in Chlamydomonas as in other organisms.  Localization of Katanin Requires Intact Basal Bodies The transition fibers are required for IFT localization, and  subdistal appendages are required for PCM localization in animal  cells, several of our observations were unexpected. In uni1-2 cells,  which lack the transition zone and transition fibers on the younger  of the two basal bodies, two dots of katanin are observed rather  than one. Additionally, IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize.  Thus, we suggest that the transition fibers are not required for  katanin p80 localization and that the requirements at the basal  bodies for IFT and katanin p80 recruitment and localization are  different.  We suggest that the recruitment requires triplet microtubules as  the uni3 mutant shows defects in p80 localization but has normal  transition fibers. The uni3 mutant fails to assemble triplet  microtubules, but 25% of the cells assemble two flagella, 25%  assemble one flagellum, and 50% have no flagella. We have  hypothesized that the age of the basal bodies influences this  distribution [22,47]. As the basal bodies age, they may acquire  additional proteins or post-translational modifications that allows  for recruitment. Thus, the katanin localization phenotype is  intriguing in that there are three localization phenotypes in uni3  mutants. These may correspond to the age of the older basal body.  The triplet microtubules are known to be important for the  localization of centrin and rootlet microtubules via specific  microtubule blades [47]. We cannot rule out the model that the  triplet microtubules do not directly recruit p80, but may play an  indirect role via intermediary proteins. Basal bodies in C. elegans  and Drosophila lack triplet microtubules, but still recruit PCM. Like  Chlamydomonas, basal body mutants in these organisms also fail to  recruit PCM and suggest the mechanism of PCM recruitment may  depend on the basal body structure of an organism.  Other Proteins that Moderate Taxol Sensitivity Besides basal body defects, work in other systems has shown  multiple modes to confer Taxol sensitivity. Interestingly, two  smoothened antagonists sensitize cells to Taxol in ovarian cancer  cell lines [85]. It is interesting to consider that localization of the  hedgehog pathway in the cilia could modulate recruitment of  other proteins to the basal bodies. Increased expression of Nek4, a  NimA-like kinase is associated with Taxol sensitivity [86]. Its  targets remain unknown. Finally, changes in expression of  Septin10 and Bub3 alter Taxol sensitivity. Increased Sept10  expression is associated with sensitivity while decreased expression  is associated with resistance to Taxol [87,88]. Modifiers that  confer Taxol sensitivity have been identified in HapMap  lymphoblastoid cell lines; the predominant class of genes with  variants encodes solute carriers (SLC) [89]. Resistance to Taxol  has been observed in a large number of clinical samples following  treatment with this drug. Mutations in over 20 amino acids in b- tubulin have been observed in Taxol resistant cell lines [90]. There  may be many targets and mechanisms by which Taxol sensitivity is  modulated. Further screens for the Taxol supersensitivity pheno-  type may provide a new class of variants that will be useful for  cancer therapeutics.

The  3X hemmaglutinin (HA) tag was introduced into the engineered  site.  (TIF)  Figure S2 Rescue of the meiotic phenotype requires two wild-type copies of the BLD2 gene and the BLD2 transgene does not rescue the mitotic lethality. Cross I is a repeat of the results obtained previously [34] showing that the  disomic strain (red and black chromosomes) produces no viable  progeny when crossed by wild-type strain (CC-124, blue) (n = 120  tetrads). Cross II involves a wild-type CC-1952 parent (green  chromosome) carrying the BLD2 transgene (purple) that is  unlinked to the BLD2 locus. The presence of the transgene is  sufficient to rescue the meiotic phenotype (75% of the progeny  from 40 tetrads survive). This result is reinforced by results in  Cross III that uses progeny from Cross II that lack the bld2-1  chromosome, which were eliminated from consideration using  PCR and digestion with FokI (Materials and Methods). This leaves  six possible genotypes. No aflagellate progeny were recovered,  which strongly suggests that the bld2-4 allele is lethal (indicated by  0 under viable progeny for strains iiii and iiiiii). dCAPS markers  described in Tables S1 and S2 were used to determined which  strains carried CC-1952, bld2-4 chromosomes, and the BLD2  transgene. Ten strains were used for Cross III. Three of them had  the CC-1952 chromosome with the transgene gave greater than  Basal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin Function  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940    92% viable progeny in 25 tetrads. Two of them had the CC-1952  chromosome and no transgene and gave 89% viability in 25  tetrads. Three progeny had the bld2-4 chromosome, the CC-1952  chromosome, and the transgene and gave 60% viability in 125  tetrads, but no aflagellate progeny were recovered, which suggests  that the bld2-4 allele is lethal. Two progeny had the bld2-4  chromosome and the CC-1952 chromosome and gave 24%  viability in 100 tetrads. Again no aflagellate progeny were  recovered.
