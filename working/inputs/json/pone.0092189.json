The ability to colonize plants endophytically makes it particularly  difficult to control, leading to significant crop yield losses. The  influence of abiotic and biotic factors, in addition to the  morphological and genetic characteristics of maize, enables the  conversion from an endophyte to a pathogen [2,3]. This fungus  also has the potential to produce several mycotoxins, primarily  fumonisins, which are known to cause equine leukoencephaloma-  lacia, pulmonary edema in swine, and cancer in rodents [4]. The  consumption of fumonisin-contaminated grains is also associated  with human esophageal cancer and neural tube defects in some  regions of the world [5,6].  Due to economic losses regarding F. verticillioides (Fv) contam-  ination and the risks of fumonisin ingestion, many efforts have  been made to control this fungus [7]. Resistant crop varieties,  biological methods, and principally fungicides have been em-  ployed to manage Fv contamination; nevertheless, Fusarium strains  exhibit a remarkable capacity to adapt and to become resistant to  these strategies [8].  Pesticides have increased crop resistance for over four decades;  nonetheless, the emerging, re-emerging, and endemic plant  pathogens are still challenging crop safety worldwide [9,10].  Moreover, chemicals may leave residues in grains, fruits,  vegetables, and soil that may be harmful to the ecosystems and  human health. The development of environmentally friendly crop-  management practices for combating diseases represents a difficult  task. The use of bacterial antagonists such as Bacillus [11-14],  Pseudomonas, and Streptomyces [15,16] as biocontrol agents (BCAs) is  considered one of the most rational practices as part of an  integrated management program to reduce pesticides in the  environment [14,17].  Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a ubiquitous gram-positive spore-  forming bacterium that produces parasporal crystals containing  insecticidal proteins called crystal (Cry) or cytolytic (Cyt) toxins.  This bacterium is found in a wide variety of habitats such as soils,  dead and living insects, the plant phylloplane, and as an  endophyte. The high abundance of Bt strains is attributed to its  long-lasting spore viability [18,19], ability to assimilate nutrients  from diverse macromolecules [20], and its quorum sensing-  regulated existence that can lead the bacterium from a virulent  to a necrotrophic state [21]. Bt strains are classified according to  the serological response differences in their flagellar antigens, and  there are at least 71 serotypes and 84 subspecies [22,23]. B.  thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk), which produces lepidopteran-  insecticidal Cry 1A proteins, including Cry 1Ab, is the most  commonly employed strain used as a bioinsecticide against  lepidopteran pest larvae [24].  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189  \u02dcSao    \u02dc Sao    \u02dc  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092189&domain=pdf   Although many studies have focused on the activity of B.  thuringiensis insecticidal proteins, the bacterium may also act as a  potential BCA against a variety of plant pathogens due to its  production of antimicrobial molecules, including zwittermicin A,  chitinases, chitin-binding proteins, and quorum sensing-quenching  enzymes [14,20,25,26]. Together with chitinases, chitin-binding  protein facilitates microbial attachment to fungal cell walls, which  disrupts the cell polarity and leads to inhibition of cell growth.  Previous studies have also demonstrated that Bt spore germination  and vegetative cell growth were associated with the development  of fungal hyphae in the soil. Furthermore, vegetative cells have  been observed growing with the fungal mycelia, likely due to the  ability of Bacillus species to cause the death of the fungus and thus  survive the hyphal lysis products [27].  The aim of this study was to characterize the in vitro interaction  of F. verticillioides and B. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki based on a  multi-method approach. To our knowledge, this is the first report  of the use of flow cytometry to quantify living and necrotic fungal  cells and the Cry 1Ab toxin during the time-course of interaction  between Btk and Fv.  Materials and Methods  Bacterial and fungal strains and their growth conditions F. verticillioides MRC 826 [Programme on Mycotoxins and  Experimental Carcinogenesis (PROMEC), Tygerberg, Republic of  South Africa] was obtained from a culture growing on Spezieller  Na\u0308hrstoffarmer agar by monosporic isolation and was used in all  experiments. This isolate is capable of producing high levels of  fumonisins [28]. The fungal strain was inoculated onto V8 agar in  Petri dishes and incubated under continuous fluorescent white  light for 7 days at 25uC in a BOD incubator (Thermo Scientific, Wilmington, DE), after which the colony surface was gently  scraped off and transferred to a tube containing 50 mL of sterile  distilled water. The spores were counted with a hemocytometer,  and the concentration was adjusted to 16106 spores/mL [29]. Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257,  which produces the Cry 1A toxin group, was provided by Dr.  Leon Rabinovitch from the Culture Collection of Bacillus and  Related Genera (CCGB; Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro,  Brazil). This Btk strain was isolated from moist soil from the  Morretes Village, Paranagua\u0301, Parana\u0301 State, Brazil prior to 1995. It  was identified and characterized by Dr. Leon Rabinovitch and Dr.  Tania V. Guaycurus at the Bacterial Physiology Laboratory in the  Oswaldo Cruz Institute in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute,  Paris, France. The LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain exhibits  proteolytic and amylolytic properties, is mesophilic, and produces  a bi-pyramidal crystal. The serovar kurstaki (H3a, 3b, 3c), which  produces flagellar antigens of serotype \u2018\u2018H3'', was characterized by  the Pasteur Institute.  The cultures were stored lyophilized; bacterial spores and  crystal biomass were obtained by inoculating Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ  (CCGB) 257 into Erlenmeyer flasks containing 250 mL of  Nutrient Broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) and incubat-  ing at 30uC on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) for 72 h. The cultures were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4uC, and the cell pellets were stored at 220uC [30] until use. The protein concentration was determined with Bradford reagent (Sigma-  Aldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO), and measurements were  made with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo  Scientific, Wilmington, DE), using bovine serum albumin (BSA)  as the standard [31]. A working solution of the Btk spore and  crystal biomass was made by diluting to 10 mg/mL, which was the  minimum inhibitory concentration for Fv growth under our  laboratory conditions (data not shown).  About 50 mL of Btk biomass (10 mg/mL) was centrally inoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) using a micropipette.  After inoculum adsorption, 50 mL of Fv (16106 spores/mL) was centrally inoculated onto each PDA Petri plate. PDA medium was  chosen since it can provide for Fusarium species' growth, in  addition to bacterial growth. The microscopy, immunofluores-  cence, and cytometry experiments were conducted with five  replicates after 3, 5, and 7 days of incubation under continuous  white-light illumination at 25uC. The radius measurements of the pure and mixed (Fv+Btk) cultures were recorded for 20 days for five replicates each, after which the presence of the fumonisins B1 and  B2 was determined.  Flow cytometry analysis for the quantification of fungal cells  Five replicates were analyzed after 3, 5, and 7 days of  incubation. The cultures were removed from the agar by scraping,  transferred into a 50-mL tube containing sterile distilled water and  Tween 80 (2 drops/100 mL water), and centrifuged at 7000 rpm  for 20 min. The cells were rinsed with the Tween 80/water  solution twice and resuspended in 20 mL phosphate buffered  saline (PBS), after which a 4 mL aliquot was filtered through a 70-  mm mesh-sized cell strainer [Becton Dickinson and Company (BD), San Jose, CA] to obtain a uniform cell suspension. The cell  solution was stained with 10 mL of 1 mg/mL Calcofluor White (CFW; Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) at a final concentration  of 0.05 mg/mL CFW and stained with 5 mL of 7-aminoactino- mycin (7-AAD), utilizing the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection  Kit (BD, San Jose, CA) per the manufacturer instructions. The  cells were incubated with CFW and 7-AAD in the dark for 15 min  and stored on ice until the analysis.  The living and necrotic fungal cells were quantified by flow  cytometry performed using a FACS Canto II system (BD, San  Jose, CA) equipped for CFW (lex, 365 nm; lem, 430 nm), using violet laser excitation (405 nm) with detection in the Pacific Blue  channel (405-450/50 nm), and 7-AAD (lex, 546 nm; lem, 647 nm), using blue laser excitation (488 nm) with detection in  the PerCP (peridinin chlorophyll A protein) channel (650 nm). A  minimum of 30,000 events per sample were acquired; the data  were collected using a linear representation for the side scatter  (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) and a logarithmic representation  for the fluorescent signals. The analyses were performed using  FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). The necrotic  fungal cell population was gated to separate it from the dead  bacterial cell population. For verifying Fv autofluorescence and  cross reaction between the Btk and CFW, bacterial cells stained  with CFW and fungal cells not labeled with the fluorochrome were  used as negative controls. For the 7-AAD negative controls, pure  cultures of living bacterial and fungal cells were stained with 7-  AAD. The negative controls were utilized to determine the  background of each fluorescent marker. For the 7-AAD positive  controls, the bacterial and fungal cells were incubated at 100uC for 30 min in a water bath [32,33].  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) After the incubation periods on PDA, 1-cm  2 portions of agar  containing interaction regions of both microorganisms and  samples from pure fungal and bacterial cultures were fixed with  2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for  2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4uC. The samples were rinsed with cacodylate buffer and fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium  Interaction between Fusarium and Bacillus  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189    tetroxide before dehydration in a graded series of ethanol  concentrations and embedment in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin  sections were collected on 200-mesh nickel grids coated with  Formvar and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The  grids were examined with a JEOL 1010 transmission electron  microscope (JEOL, Tokyo). For each replicate, three ultrathin  sections were examined [11].  Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) The pure cultures and treatments were placed in a 40%  glutaraldehyde solution for 24 h, dried at 42uC for at least 48 h, and fixed to appropriate aluminum bases. The material was then  sputtered with gold and examined with a Leo-440i-SEM scanning  electron microscope (Leo electron microscopy, Cambridge, UK)  [29].  Indirect immunofluorescence assay Pure and treated cultures of Fv and Btk were analyzed during  the incubation period. The cells were removed by scraping,  washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated for 30 min in PBS/BSA  (1%) at room temperature before adding rabbit polyclonal  antibody against Bt Cry 1Ab toxin (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge,  MA); the incubation was for 30 min in the dark under gentle  rotation (60 rpm). The cells were washed three times with PBS/  BSA and incubated with a goat polyclonal secondary antibody to  rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000; Abcam, Cam-  bridge, MA) under the same conditions. The cells were washed  three times with PBS/BSA and 10 mL of CFW (1 mg/mL) was added. The cells were resuspended in 40 mL of a solution composed of glycerol (500 mL), PBS (400 mL) and n-propyl gallate (0.022 g) (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Slides were pre-  pared and analyzed with an EVOS FL Cell Imaging System  (Advanced Microscopy Group, Life Technologies, Foster City,  CA) using the DAPI (diamidino-2-phenylindole) channel for CFW  and the GFP (green fluorescence protein) channel for Alexa Fluor  488 (lex, 495 nm; lem, 519 nm). The background of each fluorescent marker was determined with negative controls of the  Btk, Fv, and Btk+Fv treatments incubated with the secondary antibody, but not with the primary antibody. For the CFW  controls, the bacterial cells were stained with the fluorochrome,  while the fungal cells were not [34,35].  Flow cytometry for quantification of the Cry 1Ab toxins The cells were treated as described above, but omitting the  CFW staining. Quantification of the Cry 1Ab toxin was performed  with the FACS Canto II (BD, San Jose, CA) equipped for Alexa  Fluor 488 (lex, 495 nm; lem, 519 nm) using blue laser excitation (488 nm) with detection in the FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)  channel (530/30 nm). The collection and analysis were as  previously described for the flow cytometry analysis of the fungal  cells. For negative controls, the cells from all treatments were  incubated only with the secondary antibody [33].  Fumonisin analysis Fv (16106 spores/mL) and Fv plus Btk biomass (10 mg/mL) were  inoculated onto PDA (five replicates/treatment) and incubated at  25uC for 20 days [12]. Fumonisins were extracted from the PDA culture with 100 mL of methanol and water (3:1, v/v) followed by  shaking for 45 min. The samples were filtered through Whatman  grade 4 (12 cm) filter paper and the pH was corrected to pH 5.8-  6.5 with 1 N NaOH, if necessary. The fumonisins were purified by  transferring 10 mL of the filtrate to a minicolumn containing  500 mg of ion-exchange silica (BondElut SAX-Varian, Palo Alto,  CA, USA) previously conditioned with 5 mL methanol and 5 mL  methanol/water (3:1, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The  fumonisins were eluted with 15 mL methanol/acetic acid (99:1, v/  v), maintaining the same flow rate. The product was evaporated  and the residue was separated by high performance liquid  chromatography (HPLC) and resuspended in 1 mL acetonitrile/  water (50:50, v/v). A 50-mL aliquot of the sample extract was diluted with 50 mL OPA reagent (40 mg ortho-phthalaldehyde dissolved in 1 mL methanol, diluted with 5 mL 0.1 M sodium  tetraborate solution, and supplemented with 50 mL b-mercapto- ethanol) and shaken for 30 seconds. Two minutes after the  addition of the OPA reagent, the solution was injected into a  Shimadzu LC-10AD liquid chromatograph equipped with a  20 mL fixed loop injector (Rheodyne, Rhonert Park, CA) [36,37]. After separation on a C-18 reverse phase column  (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, 5 ODS-20, 15064.6 mm), the fumonisins were detected with an RF-10AXL fluorescence  detector (lex, 335 nm; lem, 335 nm). An acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (96:104:1, v/v/v) solution was used for the mobile phase.  Chromatography was conducted with column temperature of  30uC, maintained in an oven, and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min,at room temperature (22-23uC). The retention times of the FB1 and FB2 under these conditions were 9 and 20 min, respectively.  Calibration curves were utilized for quantifying the fumonisin with  correlation coefficients of 0.9927 (FB1) and 0.9950 (FB2). The  quantification limit was 0.015 mg/g for FB1 and FB2, and the mean recoveries from five replicates for each were 92.38% (SD,  13.68%) and 85.39% (SD, 6.87%) for FB1, and FB2, respectively.  Statistical analyses Statistical comparisons were performed using ANOVA and  Tukey tests, as the data were normally distributed. The differences  were considered significant when p-values were ,0.05. The  statistical tests were conducted using Assistat software [38].  Results  Accuracy of flow cytometry analysis for quantification of living and dead Fv cells and Btk Cry 1Ab toxin during the time course of interaction  To determine whether Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 could  be a potential BCA against Fv, flow cytometry tests were used to  identify either apoptotic or living fungal cells. During the culture  growth for the analyses, it was observed that Fv increased its  biomass faster than did Btk on PDA medium, as demonstrated by  the average of three radius measurements of the colonies alone  versus those of interactions between Fv and Btk (five replicates)  during the period of analysis (Figure 1). The use of CFW and 7-  AAD fluorochromes was based on the ability of CFW to bind to  the cell wall chitin of both the living and dead fungus. The 7-AAD  permeates the membrane of late-apoptotic and dead cells, and  binds to the DNA. Thus, it was possible to verify if the interaction  led to fungal death or growth inhibition. Furthermore, through a  gating strategy, it was possible to distinguish between the bacterial  and fungal populations undergoing apoptosis (Figure 2).  Positive and negative controls were used to validate the flow  cytometry conditions and to analyze the Fv and Btk interaction.  This technique allowed for the quantification of live and dead  fungal cells and the Cry 1Ab bacterial toxin in terms of  percentages (Figure 2). Btk cells were stained with CFW with  negligible background detected (Figure 2a.1). Fv cells were also  stained with CFW, and almost 100% of the cells were counted  (Figure 2a.3). Quadrants were defined based on positive and  negative fungal populations and a negative bacterial population for  Interaction between Fusarium and Bacillus  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189    CFW (Figure 2A). For the 7-AAD, living bacterial, fungal, and  bacterial plus fungal cells were used as negative controls  (Figure 2b.1 and b.2). Quadrants were established after analyzing  both microorganisms and their interaction. Dead Fv and Btk cells  were observed as distinct populations since it was possible to select  the Fv population by gating (Figure 2b.3 and b.4). Not all of the  bacterial cells were in an apoptotic stage after 30 min at 100uC, which can be explained by the presence of spores and crystals that  are resistant to high temperatures and therefore not labeled by the  7-AAD (Figure 2b.3 and b.4).  Cry 1Ab was treated with an antitoxin antibody and stained  with Alexa Fluor 488 in order to determine the crystal production,  and consequently, the bacterial spore production during the  analysis period. The quadrants were delimited based on the dot  plot graphic of the negative control for the Cry 1 Ab toxin  (Figure 3A).  In vitro suppressive effect of Btk against Fv The Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain was found to show  significant antagonistic activity against Fv from the second to the  twentieth day, based on the radius measurements of the five  replicates (Figure 1). After 3, 5, and 7 days of interaction, the  colonies were viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)  and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in addition to the  indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses. After 3  days of incubation, no marked changes were observed by TEM or  SEM in the Fusarium cells (data not shown). On the fifth and  seventh days, the Fusarium cells appeared damaged, as evidenced  by cell-wall irregularities and by disorganization of the cytoplasm.  In contrast, the Fv pure cultures showed intact hyphae and  abundant microconidia formation when the colonies were  analyzed by TEM (Figure 4A). In the SEM analysis, strong fungal  cell wall thickening was seen in response to the interaction after 5  and 7 days of incubation; sparse fungal growth and numerous Btk  cells and spores were also discernible. As a result of the interaction,  high numbers of Btk spores and cells were visualized between the  hyphae and microconidia; the Btk pure culture produced  vegetative cells in profusion (Figure 4B).  Flow cytometry dot plot graphs demonstrated a significant  reduction of the fungal cells from the third (10.93%) to the fifth  day (4.19%; p,0.05), although the percentage of cells remained  virtually the same from the fifth to the seventh day (3.48%).  Interestingly, fungal cell death was observed on the seventh day of  incubation (5.23%), in agreement with the TEM and SEM  observations (Figure 2C). The fungal cultures alone showed  irrelevant changes in the percentage of cells for the three periods  analyzed.  The immunofluorescence assay using CFW to stain the fungal  cell walls allowed for the identification of many sectors of hyphal  thickening on the fifth day, a characteristic that was remarkably  noted on the seventh day (Figure 5B). On the third day, a few  crystals were observed and the fungal cells were basically intact  (data not shown), but by the fifth and seventh days, crystals  containing Cry 1Ab toxin were mostly free and in abundance  throughout the cultures (Figure 5B).  By the end of the experiment, the treated cultures were  primarily colonized by the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257  strain, demonstrating its relevance as a BCA. The morphological  alterations observed by TEM, SEM, and the immunofluorescence  assays subsequently confirmed the flow cytometry results. No such  changes were noted in the control cultures.  Effects of Btk Cry 1Ab production The production of the Cry 1Ab toxin by the Btk LFB-  FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain was analyzed after 3, 5, and 7  days of incubation by utilizing specific antibodies followed by  Figure 1. Effect of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) on the mycelial growth of Fusarium verticillioides (Fv). (A) Each bar is the average of three radius measurements (cm) of pure fungal colonies and the interaction of Fv and Btk (five replicates) during 20 days of growth on potato dextrose agar. The differences were considered significant when P values were ,0.05, according to ANOVA and Tukey tests. Although there were no significant differences between Fv+Btk and Btk, the average of the radius measurements were significantly reduced with Fv+Btk when compared to Fv culture, from the second to the 20th day of incubation.; (B) aspect of the colonies after 3, 5, 7 and 20 days: Btk (b.1); Btk+Fv (b.2); and Fv (b.3). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0092189.g001  Interaction between Fusarium and Bacillus  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189    analysis with flow cytometry. This experiment was conducted  based on the observations of the indirect immunofluorescence  assay, which was possible to visualize high quantity of the toxin  and Btk spores all over the treated culture (Figure 5B). In Btk  control cultures was observed 10.02%, 11.67% and 17.31% of Cry  1Ab toxins in 3, 5 and 7 days, respectively (Figure 3, B). A  significant increase of Cry 1Ab toxins was verified in cultures with  Fv added to the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain in  comparison to the control group (p,0.05). We observed 15.54%,  20.86%, and 41.61% positivity rates on the third, fifth, and  seventh days of incubation, respectively (Figure 3B).  Impact of Btk on fumonisin B1 and B2 production by Fv The Fv strain produced lower levels of the fumonisins FB1 and  FB2 during interactions with Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 for  20 days. In the control group, the average production of FB1 and  FB2 was 18.97 mg/g [relative standard deviation (RSD), 2.2%] and 0.86 mg/g (RSD, 1.2%), respectively. In the treated group, the average production of FB1 was 13.81 mg/g (RSD, 5.9%), while FB2 was not detected in any replicate. The five replicates of the  control and treated groups were significantly different from one  another (p,0.05).  Discussion  The aim of this study was to characterize the interaction  between Fv and Btk based on the combined use of microscopy,  flow cytometry, and HPLC techniques. We also presented a  practical and effective approach to identify these interactions using  flow cytometry, which could be extended to other plant pathogens  and antagonistic bacteria, thereby contributing to the ability to  determine the potential of microorganisms as possible BCAs.  Flow cytometry has emerged as a high-resolution technology  that supports the characterization of individual cell types within  mixed populations. Cellular patterns can be identified by assessing  the protein expression using fluorescent probes and antibodies  coupled with fluorochromes [39]. This method provides an  analysis of a large number of cells and can identify changes  within a population and between different populations [33].  Consequently, it was possible to characterize Fv in terms of living  and dead cell percentages and identify the Cry 1Ab protein  produced by Btk during the experimental period.  Interaction studies of two or more microorganisms are  challenging because the populations are always changing over  time. In general, fungal and bacterial cells can grow and divide,  Figure 2.

B. thuringiensis forms a  parasporal crystal during the stationary phase of its growth cycle;  nevertheless, the co-culture can change the kinetics of both  microorganisms, imposing the need to mark each population to  monitor their outcome during the interaction.  The fungal cells were labeled with the fluorochrome CFW that  binds to chitin, a cell-wall polysaccharide that maintains the fungal  cell integrity and confers structural rigidity during growth and  morphogenesis [40]. The concentration of CFW was determined  based on the background fluorescence, as high concentration  levels could be misinterpreted as a positive signal. The optimal  concentration was 0.05 mg/mL in 400 mL of the cell solution. We also evaluated the fungal cell autofluorescence by fluorescence  microscopy and flow cytometry. The fungal cells showed negligible  autofluorescence emission, and therefore, no data normalization  was required. Thus, the variation of CFW during the incubation  period was interpreted as an increase or decrease of the number of  Fv cells. Because CFW has the ability to stain both living and dead  cells, the use of the 7-AAD fluorochrome was crucial to  determining whether the fungal cells were alive or in an apoptotic  stage [39], as the 7-AAD binds only to late apoptotic and necrotic  cell DNA. The flow cytometry analysis was not conducted with  both markers in the same solution, however, as the CFW could be  partially detected in the PerCP channel, which would lead to an  overestimation of the 7-AAD positive reactions.  The Btk cells were treated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to the  Bt Cry 1Ab toxin, and a goat polyclonal secondary antibody to  rabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488, to quantify the Cry 1Ab  toxin and determine the bacterial sporulation during the analysis  period. Due to the parasporal characteristic of the crystals, which  are produced during the stationary phase of Bt growth [41], it is  possible to make an analogy between the crystal and spore  production. The flow cytometry analysis allowed for the charac-  terization of the Cry 1Ab toxin in the Btk and Btk+Fv groups. For both groups, background fluorescence was absent when control  cells were treated only with the secondary antibody. This  Figure 3.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of flow  cytometry use for characterizing Cry 1Ab production.  A strong in vitro antagonistic effect of the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ  (CCGB) 257 strain on Fv MRC 826 was shown. Previous studies  have reported Bacillus spp. as potential biological controls of plant  pathogenic fungi such as F. oxysporum, F. sambucinum, and F.  graminearum [14,42-44]. In addition, other studies have shown that  the activity of Bacillus spp. reduced Fv colonization and the  accumulation of fumonisin in corn [12,13,45,46].  The microscopic examination by SEM and TEM revealed no  marked changes on the third day of incubation; however, the  antagonistic effect was evident on the fifth and seventh days,  showing fungal cell wall and cytoplasm damage in comparison to  the control Fv culture. Sectors of intumescent hyphae were  observed in response to the bacterial effects, with a paucity of  fungal growth and numerous Bt cells seen in the SEM and indirect  immunofluorescence assays. In fact, swollen hyphae can be  associated with a decrease in fungal growth and higher levels of  non-viable cells due to hyphal transformations and death resulting  from Fusarium growth kinetics [47]. Another hypothesis is the  chitin apposition in the fungal cell wall, due to the stress caused by  the effect of antagonistic bacteria. The extensive accumulation of  chitin is part of an intricate defense strategy by fungi for  restraining the penetration of pathogens and fungitoxic molecules  [48,49]. Nonetheless, it has been reported that Bacillus spp. are  able to overcome such barriers and cause severe fungal cell injuries  [11]. The cell wall and cytoplasm damage visualized by TEM and  the profile of dead fungal cells observed by flow cytometry after  incubating Fv MRC 826 and Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257  together for 7 days demonstrated that Bt strains can be very  aggressive towards fungi and are able to circumvent this fungal  defense strategy.  Fungal endophytes such as Fusarium can reside in the internal  tissues of living plants without causing any immediate or negative  effect, but may turn pathogenic during host senescence. The  interactions between host plants and endophytes in natural  populations are poorly understood; however, they can actively  compete against other microorganisms for niche or infection sites  [50]. Fv is an endophyte and one of the most commonly reported  soil-borne fungal pathogens infecting maize worldwide [12,51]. In  general, soil-borne pathogens that infect through mycelial contact  are more susceptible to competition from other soil microorgan-  isms associated with plants than from pathogens that germinate  directly on the plant surface [14,50]. Our in vitro results  corroborate this theory, as Fv MRC 826 growth was restricted  by Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 for over 20 days. A reduction  in the cell numbers in the treated cultures was also observed on the  third (10.93%), fifth (4.19%), and seventh (3.48%) days through  the flow cytometry analysis.  Figure 4. Microscopic observations of Fusarium verticillioides (Fv) in contact with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk). Fv and Btk were co-cultured on potato dextrose agar and microscopically examined after 5 (5D) and 7 (7D) days of growth. Figure 4(A).

A number of antifungal compounds,  including polypeptides that interact with the fungal membrane,  are produced by Bacillus species [52]. Bt can secrete chitinases and  chitin-binding proteins; together these proteins control fungi by  binding to cell wall chitin and disrupting the cell polarity, leading  to fungal growth inhibition, and thus conferring an advantage as a  competitor in its niche. Degraded chitin can also serve as a  nutrient and further contribute to Bt growth and proliferation  [20,53,54]. Interestingly, it has been shown that a chitin-binding  protein is expressed in spore mother cells that interact with Cry  1Ac, potentiating the toxin activity [20].  Our results showed increased levels of the Cry 1Ab toxin when  Btk was interacting with Fv. The accumulation of Cry 1ab was  enhanced during the interaction, particularly after 7 days of  incubation. This response probably occurred as a consequence of  the stressful conditions during the Fv and Btk co-cultivation, which  may promote more aggressiveness in this Btk isolate. Given that Bt  crystals are produced concurrently with the spores, there was also  an increase in spore production during the experimental period.  Despite the controversial hypotheses about Bt spore longevity,  some reports have demonstrated the environmental persistence of  Bt spores, which confer resistance and a competitive advantage  against other microorganisms [19,27].  During the Fv and Btk interactions, less accumulation of  fumonisin was observed. Reduced FB1 levels have been reported  previously, when Fv was treated with Bacillus spp. in maize [12,13].  In fact, reduced fumonisin levels were reported when the fungal  biomass was decreased [13,55,56]. Mycotoxin production has  been viewed as an adaptation of the fungus to stressful  environmental conditions and as providing an advantage in  competition with other microorganisms in its natural habitat [57].  Some stressful conditions such as oxidative stress and nitrogen  starvation may enhance fumonisin production. However, the  benefit to the fungus from producing higher levels of fumonisin  remains unclear [58,59].  Figure 5. Interaction between Fusarium verticillioides (Fv) and Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) monitored by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were treated as described in the Materials and Methods. Fungal cells were stained with Calcofluor White (CFW; blue fluorescence) and crystals containing Cry 1Ab toxin were labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 (green fluorescence) after 3 (3D), 5 (5D) and 7 (7D) days of interaction.

Moreover, flow cytometry  was demonstrated to be sensitive enough to characterize fungal  cell oscillations and death during its interaction with Btk. Future  studies regarding the antagonistic effect of this bacterium against  other fungi and in vivo tests are necessary to determine the efficacy  of Btk in controlling plant pathogens.
