Despite the standard therapy for advanced disease including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, the mortality rate remains high for these patients. Hence, novel therapeutic agents are desperately needed. Here we examined the anticancer activity of a novel plant-derived compound, sparstolonin B (SsnB; 8,59-dihydroxy-4-phenyl-5,29-oxidoisocou- marin) using neuroblastoma cell lines of different genetics. SsnB was recently isolated from an aquatic Chinese herb, Sparganium stoloniferum, and tubers of this herb have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of several inflammatory diseases and cancers. Our cell viability and morphological analysis indicated that SsnB at 10 mM concentration significantly inhibited the growth of both N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2), NGP, and IMR-32 cells) and N-myc nonamplified (SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells) neuroblastoma cells. The flow cytometric analyses suggested that SsnB arrests the cell cycle progression at G2-M phase in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Exposure of SsnB inhibited the compact spheroid formation and reduced the tumorigenicity of SH-SY5Y cells and SK-N-BE(2) cells in in vitro 3-D cell culture assays (anchorage-independent colony formation assay and hanging drop assay). SsnB lowers the cellular level of glutathione (GSH), increases generation of reactive oxygen species and activates the cleavage of caspase-3 whereas co-incubation of a GSH precursor, N-acetylcysteine, along with SsnB attenuates the inhibitory effects of SsnB and increases the neuroblastoma cell viability. Our results for the first time demonstrate that SsnB possesses anticancer activity indicating that SsnB-induced reactive oxygen species generation promotes apoptotic cell death in neuroblastoma cells of different genetic background. Thus these data suggest that SsnB can be a promising drug candidate in neuroblastoma therapy.

In vivo and in vitro studies revealed its anti-  inflammatory [1,2] and anti-angiogenic [3] properties. SsnB acts  as an antagonist to Toll-like Receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4),  and exhibits anti-inflammatory property by selectively inhibiting  TLR2 and TLR4-triggered inflammatory response in mouse and  human macrophages [1,2]. In traditional Chinese medicine  (TCM), the tubers of this herb have been used for the treatment  of several inflammatory diseases, and the crude extract prepared  form this herb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4-  6]. As revealed by NMR and X-ray crystallography, SsnB (8,59-  dyhydroxy-4-phenyl-5,29-oxidoisocoumarin) is a polyphenol with  structural similarities to isocoumarins and xanthone. Isocoumarins  and xanthone family of compounds are well known for their anti-  inflammatory and anti-tumor properties [7-10]. Due to the  structural similarities of SsnB with isocoumarins and xanthone, we  decided to examine the anticancerous properties of SsnB.  Neuroblastoma is a malignant pediatric cancer of the postgan-  glionic sympathetic nervous system and derived from the neural  crest cells during embryonic development. Initially it develops in  the adrenal gland and metastasizes to liver, bone, bone marrow,  lymph nodes, neck and chest. It is the most common cancer in  babies younger than one and second most common tumor in  children [11,12]. It accounts for 7% of all childhood cancers  (Cancer Facts & Figures 2013. Atlanta, GA: American Cancer  Society, 2013), and is responsible for 15% of all cancer deaths in  children younger than 15 years. About 30%-50% of children with  high-risk neuroblastoma experience long-term survival.  Neuroblastoma tumor comprises of various heterogeneous  population of cells which differ at morphological, biochemical  and genetic levels [13-15]. Genomic amplification of N-myc gene,  rearrangement or deletion of distal region of the chromosome 1  (1p31-arm) [16,17] or alterations in chromosomes 11, 14 and 17  [18,19] are most common cytogenetic features identified in low to  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0096343&domain=pdf   advance stages of neuroblastomas. Mutations in tumor suppresser  genes, i.e., p53, retinoblastoma, RET, p16, p18 or p27 have been  reported to promote tumorigenesis [20-22]. These karyotype and  cytogenetic alterations render tumors resistant to available  chemotherapies [23]. For example, retinoic acid induces neuronal  differentiation in neuroblastoma cells [24,25] and commonly used  as in residual therapy. However, neuroblastoma cells with N-myc  amplified oncogene do not respond to retinoic acid [26,27].  Therefore, it is crucial to find new therapeutic agents that can  exhibit anti-proliferative effects on neuroblastoma cells irrespective  of their genetic abnormalities.  In the present study, for the first time we have reported the  anticancer activity of SsnB and have demonstrated that SsnB  inhibits the growth of human neuroblastoma cells of different  genetic background by arresting cell cycle progression and by  inducing apoptotic cell death through generation of reactive  oxygen species.  Materials and Methods  Human Neuroblastoma Cell Culture and SsnB Treatments Human neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, SK-N-  BE(2) and SKNF-1 cells) were obtained from The American Type  Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA), and NGP cells were  kind gift from Garrett M. Brodeur (The Children's Hospital of  Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) [28]. All cell lines were  maintained in complete Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium  (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;  Atlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 16 antibiotic- antimycotic solution (containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B), and grown at 37uC in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Stock solution of SsnB  was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cells treated with  different concentrations of SsnB in DMEM with 10% FBS were  grown for subsequent days. Cells treated with equal volume of  DMSO were used as control.  Cell Viability Assay The viability of SsnB-treated cells was determined by MTT  assay following manufacturer's instructions (Roche diagnostics  corporation, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, cells (16104 cells/well) grown in 96-well cell culture plate were incubated with SsnB in  100 ml of complete culture medium with 10% FBS. After treatments, cells were incubated with 10 ml of MTT reagent for 4 h and then incubated overnight in solubilization buffer (100 ml) at 37uC. Absorbance of the formazan product was read at 575 nm in spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,  CA). A reference wavelength of 690 nm was used to detect  background. The measured absorption directly correlates with the  number of viable cells in culture. The experiments were performed  in triplicates and repeated at least three times.  Cell Cycle Analyses by Flow Cytometry The cell cycle progression was determined by flow cytometer  analysis [29]. Neuroblastoma cells were treated with SsnB or  DMSO in DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells were collected after  trypsinization with trypsin-EDTA solution (Atlanta Biologicals)  and washed with 16 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Approxi- mately 16106 cells were suspended in 300 ml of ice-cold 16PBS, fixed by adding 700 ml of chilled absolute ethanol (to make final ethanol concentration 70%) drop wise and incubated for overnight  at 220uC. Cells were pelleted at 10006 rpm for 5 min at 4uC, washed with 16 PBS for 3 times and stained with propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by adding 1 ml of  propidium iodide staining solution (containing 20 mg/ml propi- dium iodide and 10 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS) for 1 h on ice in dark. Samples were subjected to  fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses utilizing Beckman  Coulter flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). A  minimum of 10,000 events were analyzed in each experiment.  Immunofluorescence Microscopy For immunofluorescence staining, cells grown in Lab-TekII  chamber slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were treated with  SsnB compound in complete culture medium. After treatments,  cells were washed with 16PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/ PBS for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS  for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 16PBS for 3 times and blocked with 5% immunoglobulin (IgG) free-  bovine serum albumin (BSA; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora-  tories, West Grove, PA) in 16 PBS for overnight at 4uC. Cells were incubated with antibody raised against active form of  caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) diluted in  2.5% BSA/PBS for overnight at 4uC. Primary antibodies were detected with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein  isothiocyanate (FITC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for  2 h at room temperature. After washing with 16 PBS, cells were mounted with antifade Vectashield mounting media (Vector  Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and signals were visualized under  Nikon-E600 fluorescence microscope. Nuclei were counterstained  with 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma).  Total Cell Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analyses After treatment with SsnB, cells were collected, washed with 16  PBS, and lysed with 16 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl  fluoride (PMSF) and protease inhibitors (aprotinin and leupeptin)  for 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 120006 rpm for 10 min at 4uC. Supernatant (total cell protein) was collected and stored at 2 80uC. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid method using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce/ThermoScientific,  Waltham, MA). Equal amount of proteins were diluted with 5 x  Laemmli samples loading buffer and boiled for five minutes. The  proteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blots  [30]. Briefly, after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred on  polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 100 volt for 3 h in  cold room. Membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk/  TBST (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl with 0.1% Tween-  20) for 4 h at room temperature followed by incubation in primary  antibodies diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk/TBST for overnight  at 4uC. After washing with TBST, membrane was incubated with secondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat  anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,  Dallas, TX) diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk/TBST for 3 h at  room temperature. Signals were detected by chemiluminiscence  detection kit (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL).  Primary antibodies used were cleaved caspase-3 and b-actin (Cell Signaling Technology), N-myc and p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-  ogy).  Detection of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SsnB-  treated neuroblastoma cells was detected by a cell-permeable  fluorescence probe H2DCFDA (carboxy-29,79-dichlorodihydro-  fluorescein diacetate) according to the manufacturer's instructions  (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [31]. Briefly, neuroblastoma cells were  cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS in Lab-TekII chamber slides  Sparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer Activity  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343    (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) and treated with SsnB for 2 days  (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cell) or 4 days (SKNF-  1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells). After treatments, cells were washed with  Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS; Thermo Scientific, Waltham,  MA) and incubated with 25 mM of carboxy-H2DCFDA dye for 30 min at 37uC in dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI. Cells were washed three times with HBSS, mounted with  Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and imme-  diately examined under Nikon-E600 fluorescence microscopy  equipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter [32].  Oxidation of H2DCFDA probe occurs almost exclusively in the  cytosol, and generates a fluorescence that is proportional to ROS  generation in that cell. As a negative control, cells without  H2DCFDA dye were used to detect autofluorescence. The  fluorometric analysis to detect generation of ROS was performed  as described previously [33]. Briefly, after treatments with SsnB as  mentioned above, cells were labelled with carboxy-H2DCFDA dye  (25 mM) for 30 min at 37uC. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and re-suspended in PBS and fluorescence intensity was monitored at  excitation wavelength 485 nm and emission wavelength 530 nm  with a spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sun-  nyvale, CA).  Colony Formation Assay A two layer soft agarose assay system was used in these studies  with some modifications [34]. Approximately 16104 cells were suspended in 0.35% agarose in DMEM with 10% FBS, and were  gently laid on the bottom agarose layer containing 0.8% agarose  with DMEM+10% FBS in 35 mm2 cell culture dishes. Once solidified, the dishes were incubated at 37uC in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. Next day, 500 ml of complete cell culture medium with respective concentrations of SsnB was added, and  cells were allowed to grow for 45 days in an incubator chamber.  Fresh medium with respective concentrations of SsnB was added  to the dishes in every 5 days. Cells treated with equal volume of  DMSO were used as control. At the end of experiments, cells were  stained with 0.1% crystal violet and cell colonies (more than 15  cells per colony) were counted under the light microscope.  Hanging-drop Assay for Spheroid Formation 3-D in vitro hanging drop assay was carried out to detect the  SsnB effect in neuroblastoma spheroid formation [35]. Neuro-  blastoma cells were prepared as single cell suspension in complete  culture medium (DMEM+10% FBS) without or with SsnB (1 and 10 mM). Twenty microliter drop of each prepared cell suspension containing 20,000 cells/drop were pipetted into the inner side of  the lid of a 60 mm diameter tissue culture dish. The lid was gently  inverted and placed on top of the culture dish filled with 5 ml of  sterile 16PBS to humidify the culture chamber. The drops were incubated under tissue culture conditions (at 37uC and 5% CO2) allowing the cells to form aggregate at the base of the droplet. The  cells in each droplet were photographed using Olympus SZX2  stereo microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA).  Measurement of Glutathione (GSH) Level Cells treated with SsnB or DMSO were washed and re-  suspended in PBS and the intracellular GSH level was measured  by luminescence based GSH-Glo glutathione assay kit (Promega,  Madison, WI) following manufacturer's protocol. The lumines-  cence was monitored in a luminometer (Promega Biosystems,  Sunnyvale, CA).  Data Analysis Data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (S.D.) of  at least three independent experiments. Comparisons were made  among the groups using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-  Kramer ad hoc test (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA). A p-  value,0.05 was considered significant.  Results  SsnB Inhibits the Survival of Neuroblastoma Cells To test the inhibitory effects of SsnB on neuroblastoma cell  survival, we treated human neuroblastoma cell lines of different  genetic background (SH-SY5Y, SKNF-1, NGP, IMR-32 and SK-  N-BE(2) cells) with 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM or 20 mM concentration of SsnB under in vitro conditions. Following SsnB treatments,  neuroblastoma cell were grown for subsequent days and were  photographed under light microscope to evaluate the cell  morphology. The phase contrast images as shown in Figure 1A  demonstrated that SsnB alters the cellular appearance and  promotes cell death (as evaluated by cell morphology; round and  clumping of cells is indication of cell death) in all these  neuroblastoma cell lines. SsnB at 10 mM and above concentrations changed the morphology (as evaluated by rounded cells and  indication of cell death) of SH-SY5Y cells and IMR-32 cells (after  2 days treatment), NGP (after 3 days treatment), SKNF-1 and SK-  N-BE(2) cells (after 4 days treatment) compared to control DMSO-  treated cells. However, such morphological changes were not  significant at 1 or 5 mM conc. of SsnB in any cell line tested. We further carried out MTT assay to examine the effects of  SsnB on viability of all the above listed neuroblastoma cells. After  2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days  (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) treatment with SsnB (1, 5, 10 and  20 mM), MTT cell viability assays were performed. The bar diagram in Figure 1B showed that SsnB inhibited, effectively and  dose-dependently, the viability of all neuroblastoma cell lines  tested. Compared to DMSO, SsnB at and above 10 mM concentration significantly reduced the viability of these cell lines  (*p,0.05 vs DMSO) and the IC20 and IC50 were found to be in the  range of 6-8 mM and 10-12 mM, respectively. We did not observe significant difference in cell survival at SsnB at 1 mM or 5 mM concentrations compared to control DMSO-treated neuroblasto-  ma cells (p.0.05 vs DMSO). No cytotoxic response of SsnB at  these concentrations (and up to ,100 mM) was observed in various normal human cells e.g. human monocytic THP-1 cells,  phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophag-  es, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human aortic  smooth muscle cells as reported in reference [1]. These data  demonstrate the anti-proliferative activity of SsnB on human  neuroblastoma cells, and suggest that SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells  were most sensitive, NGP cell was moderately sensitive, SKNF-1  and SK-N-BE(2) cell lines were least sensitive towards SsnB  treatment. Since 50% cell viability was observed in range of 10-  12 mM SsnB conc., we used 10 mM as higher conc. and 1 mM lower conc. in our further experiments.  SsnB Regulates Cell Cycle Progression in Neuroblastoma Cells  To test whether SsnB-induced cell growth inhibition occurs  through cell cycle arrest, we analyzed cell cycle distribution by  flow cytometry after DNA staining with propidium iodide.  Representative histogram in Figure 1C showed that 2 days (SH-  SY5Y, IMR-32) or 3 days (NGP cells) exposure of SsnB (10 mM) resulted in increase of G2-M phase cells when compared with  DMSO-treated controls (G2/M for SH-SY5Y, SsnB  Sparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer Activity  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343    10 mM = 23.98% vs control = 14.33%; for IMR-32, SsnB 10 mM = 23.45% vs control = 19.25%; and for NGP, SsnB 10 mM = 26.98% vs control = 17.87%). Similarly, SsnB treatment for 4 days increases the number of SK-N-BE(2) cells and SKNF-1  cells in G2/M phase, compared to control (G2/M for SKNF-1,  SsnB 10 mM = 14.53% vs control = 20.91%; for SK-N-BE(2) cells, SsnB 10 mM = 27.15% vs control = 22.26%). The SsnB (10 mM) induced increase in G2/M fraction was accompanied by a  decrease in G0/G1 phase cells. SsnB at 1 mM concentration did not affect cell cycle progression compared to DMSO-treated  controls. These results indicated that the exhibited anti-prolifer-  ative effect of SsnB (10 mM) may be exerted by cell cycle arrest at G2-M transition in these neuroblastoma cell lines.  SsnB Generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in Neuroblastoma Cells  Isocoumarin and coumarin derivative compounds are well  known to exhibit their anti-tumor effects by reactive oxygen  species-induced cell death [36,37]. To test whether SsnB-induced  cell death is resulted from increased level of reactive oxygen  species (ROS), we performed H2DCFDA staining [31,32].  H2DCFDA is a cell-permeable non-fluorescent indicator for  ROS that is oxidized in presence of reactive oxygen species to  fluorescent molecule carboxy-DCF. Neuroblastoma cells treated  with SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells)  or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) were labelled with  H2DCFDA dye for 30 min and cells were immediately examined  under fluorescence microscopy. The carboxy-DCF positive cells  were quantitated by ImageJ software and plotted. The represen-  tative fluorescence images of SH-SY5Y cells in Figure 2A  indicated that the number of carboxy-DCF positive cells (green)  was significantly increased at 10 mM concentration of SsnB compared to DMSO-treated samples (*p,0.05 vs DMSO;  Figure 2B). The ROS generation was observed exclusively in  those SsnB treated cells which contain fragmented nuclei (blue).  Similar to SH-SY5Y cells, SsnB (10 mM) significantly increased  Figure 1. SsnB inhibits cell growth and viability of neuroblastoma cells. (A) Phase contrast images showing the morphology of neuroblastoma cells after treatments with SsnB. Neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, NGP, SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) were grown in presence of DMSO or SsnB (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) in complete culture medium and were photographed on indicated times. (B) Bar diagrams showing the cell viability after SsnB treatment as evaluated by MTT assays. Neuroblastoma cells were treated with SsnB (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) and cell viability was measured by MTT assay at 575 nm.

In negative  control, no such green staining was observed in cells processed  without H2DCFDA dye ruling out the autofluorescence (data not  shown). These results suggest that SsnB compound promotes  intracellular ROS production in neuroblastoma cell lines. We  further evaluated SsnB-induced generation of ROS by fluorom-  etry assay. Neuroblastoma cells as treated above were incubated  with H2DCFDA dye for 30 min and the fluorescence intensity was  measured at 485 nm (excitation wavelength) and 530 nm (emis-  sion wavelength). The H2DCFDA fluorescence intensity (as  measure of generation of ROS) was significantly increased in cells  treated with SsnB (10 mM) compared to DMSO control (*p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM vs DMSO; Figure 2C) whereas the H2DCFDA fluorescence intensity levels were almost similar in SsnB (1 mM) and DMSO-treated cells (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vs DMSO; Figure 2C).  In a reaction system, after the removal of acetate group by  cellular esterases and oxidation by reactive oxygen species, the  non-fluorescent carboxy-H2DCFDA dye is oxidized to fluores-  cent molecule carboxy-DCF. To measure the ROS-generating  activity of SsnB, we also monitored the oxidation of carboxy-  H2DCFDA dye in a cell-free system containing carboxy-  H2DCFDA dye, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and SsnB at  540 nm [38]. HRP was used to supply esterase since without  esterase carboxy-H2DCFDA is not sensitive to oxidant. As shown  in Figure 2D, the optical density (OD) value of reaction  containing SsnB (10 mM) + H2DCFDA dye (25 mM) remained constant throughout the experiment suggesting that SsnB  (10 mM) alone was not able to oxidize H2DCFDA to the fluorescent compound carboxy-DCF. After addition of HRP  (5 units/ml) in the reaction mixture containing SsnB (10 mM) + H2DCFDA dye (25 mM), the OD value increased by 2% in the first 240 sec and further increased by 8% after 15 min compared  to H2DCFDA + HRP reaction, indicating the increased oxidation of H2DCFDA to the fluorescent compound. These  results suggest that SsnB in presence of cellular peroxidases  oxidizes non-fluorescent H2DCFDA dye into the fluorescent  compound. Addition of GSH (0.25 mM or 2.5 mM) in a reaction containing SsnB (10 mM) + H2DCFDA dye (25 mM) + HRP (5 units/ml) lowers the OD value in a dose dependent manner  indicating that GSH as an antioxidant removes the free radicals  generated by SsnB in reaction mixture which in turn inhibits the  oxidation H2DCFDA dye (Figure 2E).  At cellular level, reduced glutathione (GSH) protects cells from  oxidative damage resulted from increased superoxides, peroxides  and free radicals [39]. Since SsnB induces oxidative stress, we  asked whether SsnB affects intracellular levels of GSH in  neuroblastoma cells. After treatments with SsnB for 2 days (SH-  SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and  SK-N-BE(2) cells), the cellular GSH level was measured by  luminescence based glutathione assay kit. Compared to control,  the GSH level was significantly decreased (,40% of control) in cells treated with 10 mM SsnB (*p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM vs control; Figure 2F). However, the level of GSH at 1 mM SsnB concentra- tion was slightly higher or equals to control levels (#p#0.05 vs control) suggest that at initial stage basal antioxidant mechanism  trying to protect the cell against the toxic effects of SsnB. These  results indicated that the GSH depletion was unable to protect  neuroblastoma cells against SsnB (10 mM)-induced increased oxidative stress.  SsnB Promotes DNA Fragmentation in Neuroblastoma Cells  Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to  induce oxidative stress which in turn cleaves DNA that leads to cell  death. We next examined SsnB-induced DNA fragmentation in  neuroblastoma cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase  dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as described previously  [32]. In this assay, nicked DNA is identified by the addition of  fluorophore-labelled dUTPs by enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl  transferase (TdT) to the terminal ends of damaged DNA in  apoptotic cells. The TUNEL-positive cells (green) were quantitat-  ed by ImageJ programme and plotted. The number of TUNEL-  positive cells at 10 mM concentration of SsnB were significantly higher in all neuroblastoma cells compared to control (*p,0.005 vs  control; Figure 3A). The TUNEL-positive cells in SsnB (1 mM) were almost similar to DMSO-treated samples (ns = nonsignif-  icant vs control, p.0.05). The representative fluorescence images  from SH-SY5Y cells as shown in Figure 3B indicated that SsnB at  10 mM concentration induced DNA fragmentation (green), and the staining for fragmented DNA (TUNEL-positive staining, green  in color) and nuclei (blue) were overlapped in a single cell (as  shown in enlarged image) suggest that SsnB promotes apoptosis in  these cells. However, such TUNEL-positive cells were not detected  in DMSO- or SsnB (1 mM)-treated cells.  SsnB Activates Caspase-3 in Neuroblastoma Cells At cellular level, mitochondria- or receptor (Fas/FasL)-mediat-  ed pathways activate caspase signaling cascade which in turn  induces DNA damage and initiates programmed cell death  (apoptosis) [40]. To determine whether SsnB-induced cell death  is mediated by caspase activation, we performed Western blotting  as well as immunofluorescence assay to detect active form of  caspase-3 in neuroblastoma cells treated with SsnB for 2 days (SH-  SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1  and SK-N-BE(2) cells). The number of cleaved caspase-3 positive  cells (green) were quantitated by ImageJ programme and plotted.  The bar diagram in Figure 3C demonstrated that SsnB at 10 mM significantly increased the cleaved caspase-3 positive cells (green)  compared to DMSO or SsnB (1 mM) treated neuroblastoma cells (*p,0.005, SsnB 10 mM vs control). The representative immuno- fluorescence images for SH-SY5Y in Figure 3D indicated that the  color intensity of cleaved caspase-3 (green) was significantly  increased in SsnB-treated (10 mM) cells and the cleaved caspase- 3 fluorescence signals were exclusively present in cytoplasm and  did not overlap with nucleus (blue). The corresponding Western  blots in Figure 3E demonstrated that the cleaved and active form  of caspase-3 protein bands (17 and 19 kDa) were present in  protein samples prepared from 10 mM SsnB treated cells (*p, 0.005, SsnB 10 mM vs control, Figure 3E and F), while proteins samples from DMSO and SsnB (1 mM) had almost undetectable levels of cleaved caspase-3 (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vs control; Figure 3E and F). We further examined the activation of  caspase-3 by SsnB (10 mM) at different time points (6, 12, 24 and 48 h) in SH-SY5Y cells. The presence of an active form of  caspase-3 protein band (,19 kDa) showed that SsnB induces cleavage of caspase-3 in these cells even as early as 6 h SsnB  exposure (Figure 3G, upper panel). Thus, these data suggest that  SsnB induces apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 in all  neuroblastoma cell lines tested. We also observed increased  expression of p53 in SsnB (10 mM) treated cells compare to DMSO-treated cells (middle panel; Figure 3G). Activation of p53,  a tumor suppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2  phase of cell cycle, hence, increased expression of p53 by SsnB  Sparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer Activity  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343    suggested that p53 might also involve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity  in p53-containing neuroblastoma cells.  SsnB Reduces Expression of N-myc in Neuroblastoma Cells  N-myc proto-oncogene act as a transcription factor, and  amplification and overexpression of N-myc gene promotes  tumorigenicity in neuroblastoma cells [41]. We evaluated level  of N-myc proteins from 2 days (IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4  days (SK-N-BE(2) cells) SsnB-treated N-myc amplified neuroblas-  toma cells by Western blotting, and protein signal intensity was  measured by ImageJ programme and plotted. Western blot in  Figure 4A demonstrates that SsnB at 10 mM inhibited the  expression of N-myc protein in these cell lines (*p,0.005, SsnB  10 mM vs control; Figure 4A and B). However such reduction in protein expression was not observed at 1 mM concentration of SsnB (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vs control; Figure 4A and B).  N-acetylcystamine (NAC) Attenuates the Inhibitory Effects of SsnB in Neuroblastoma Cells  The reduced cell viability, increased ROS and decreased GSH  levels by SsnB indicated that depletion of glutathione may be a  primary cause for the cell death. Next, we examined whether  addition of N-acetylcystamine (NAC), a GSH precursor and an  antioxidant, can protect neuroblastoma cells from SsnB-induced  Figure 2. SsnB induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. ROS levels were evaluated by H2DCFDA staining after SsnB treatments (1 mM or 10 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32), 3 days (NGP) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells). Signals were examined under fluorescence microscope (A); carboxy-DCF positive cells (green) were quantitated by ImageJ programme and plotted (B). (A) Representative fluorescence images from SH-SY5Y cells showing that compared to DMSO and SsnB (1 mM), SsnB at 10 mM concentration induced ROS generation (green, H2DCFDA- positive cells) and signals were exclusively present in cytoplasm (as shown in enlarged images).

(C) Bar diagrams representing the fold change in fluorescence intensity of H2DCFDA in cells treated with or without SsnB (1 mM or 10 mM) as mentioned above.

Optical density (OD) at 540 nm were taken at different time points and plotted.

To test this hypothesis, neuroblastoma cells were  pretreated with NAC (0.5, 1 and 5 mM) for 1 h followed by  treatment with SsnB (10 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2)  cells), and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. MTT cell  viability assays showed that NAC treatment suppresses SsnB-  induced cell death in a concentration dependent manner  (Figure 5A). SsnB (10 mM) induced neuroblastoma cell death in range of 40-60% (*p,0.05 vs control) whereas presence of NAC  (1 mM or 5 mM) significantly increased the viability of SsnB-  treated cells (#p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM alone vs SsnB 10 mM + NAC 1 or 5 mM). Next we measured the levels of ROS in SsnB-treated  cells preincubated with NAC by fluorometry assay using  H2DCFDA dye. NAC at 1 and 5 mM concentration significantly  reduces ROS levels in SsnB (10 mM) treated neuroblastoma cells (#p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM alone vs SsnB 10 mM + NAC 1 or 5 mM; Figure 5B). These data suggest that NAC as an ROS scavenger  removes SsnB-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in  cells.  We further examined cleaved caspase-3 level in SH-SY5Y cells  (2 days treatment) and SK-N-BE(2) cells (4 days treatment)  incubated with SsnB (10 mM) with or without NAC (0.5, 1 or 5 mM) by Western blotting. Representative blot in Figure 5C and  corresponding bar diagram (Figure 5D) demonstrated that  Figure 3. SsnB induces apoptotic cell death. SsnB-treated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 for 2 days, NGP for 3 days, and SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells for 4 days) were used to monitor DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay (A and B), and cleaved caspsase- 3 by immunofluorescence (C and D), and Western blotting (E and F). DAPI (blue) was used to stain nuclei. Signals were examined under fluorescence microscope; number of TUNEL-positive cells (green) or cleaved caspase-3 positive cells (green) were counted by ImageJ programme and plotted (A and C).

SsnB Reduces the Tumorigenicity of Neuroblastoma Cells Next we tested if the anti-proliferative activity of SsnB affects the  tumor progression property of neuroblastoma cells by performing  two layer agarose gel colony formation assays. Agarose gel colony  formation assay is an anchorage-independent in vitro cell transfor-  mation assay, and mimics the process of in vivo carcinogenesis [34].  Neuroblastoma cells (N-myc amplified cell, SK-N-BE(2), and N-  myc nonamplified cell, SH-SY5Y) were grown in agarose in  presence or absence of SsnB (1 mM and 10 mM) and after 45 days number of colonies were counted. The representative phase  contrast images in Figure 6A showed that the size of colonies in  SsnB 10 mM treated samples were significantly smaller than the control and SsnB (1 mM) treated samples. The representative bar diagram demonstrated that SsnB at 10 mM concentration significantly inhibited the colony formation capability of both  cells (*p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM vs control; Figure 6B). Since SsnB inhibits the formation of neuroblastoma colony in  anchorage-independent agarose gel assay, we further tested if the  inhibitory effects of SsnB inhibit the initiation of neuroblastoma  tumors in hanging drop assay method. In hanging drop assay the  cells under the force of gravity and surface tension start  accumulating at the bottom of the hanging drop and join together  to form a spheroid. Spheroids represent an in vitro 3D tissue  structure that mimics in vivo tumor tissue organization and  microenvironment, and 3D culture better reflect cancer cells in  their native, in vivo, environment [35]. As shown in Figure 6C and  D, within 24 hour, both neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells, C;  and SK-N-BE(2) cells, D) grown in hanging drop culture start  aggregating at the bottom of the droplet. On day 12, the shape of  the aggregates became rounder and smoother with a gradual  decrease in the radius of the spheroid, and form compact cell  clusters in DMSO- and SsnB (1 mM)-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N- BE(2) cells. The decrease in size is the result of higher cell-cell  cohesion, which yields more compact aggregates. However, at  10 mM SsnB concentration the cells are loosely attached in spheroids suggesting that SsnB at 10 mM inhibits cell-cell attachment in both cell lines (SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) cells)  as a result these cells are unable to aggregate to form compact  spheroids.  Discussion  Neuroblastoma has heterogeneous population of cells of  different genetic background [15]. Increasing evidence supports  that molecular and genetic factors such as N-myc oncogene  amplification, deletion of short arm of chromosome 1 and high  expression of neurotrophin receptors (TrkA and TrkB) are  associated with malignant transformation and progression of  neuroblastoma. Despite targeting new molecular targets, and the  use of multimodal therapy which includes surgery, radiotherapy in  conjunction with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody based  immunotherapy, approximately 40% of children with high-risk  neuroblastoma remain incurable [23,43,44]. Hence, the identifi-  cation and development of new therapeutic compounds with less  toxicity are urgently needed.  We used a novel naturally-occurring compound, Sparstolonin B  (SsnB), isolated from the tubers of an aquatic Chinese herb,  Sparganium stoloniferum [1]. The crude extract prepared from this  herb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4-6]. In the  present study SsnB at 10 mM and above concentrations signifi- cantly inhibits the growth and viability of human neuroblastoma  cells of different genetic background such as N-myc amplified with  wild p53 cells (IMR-32 and NGP cells), N-myc amplified with  mutated p53 cells (SKN-BE(2) cell), and N-myc nonamplified cell  (SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells). However, the sensitivity of these  cells towards SsnB is different, SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells are  sensitive, NGP cells are moderate sensitive, and SKNF-1 and SK-  N-BE(2) cells are least sensitive (as shown by cell morphology and  MTT cell viability assays in Figure 1A and B). The reduced  viability by SsnB losses neuroblastoma cells ability to form  compact spheroids that decreases the tumorigenic potential of  both N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2) cells) and N-myc nonamplified  neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells) tested as seen in hanging  drop method and anchorage-independent colony formation assay  (Figure 6). These in vitro 3-D culture results further confirmed the  anti-tumorigenic activity of SsnB against human neuroblastoma.  The SsnB exerts its inhibitory effects only in neuroblastoma cell  lines, and up to ,100 mM concentration SsnB did not exhibits cytotoxicity towards various normal non-tumor human cells such  as human monocytic THP-1 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-  acetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophages, human umbilical vein  endothelial cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells [1].  The inhibitory effects of SsnB on cell growth and viability are  resulted from the caspase-mediated cell death (Figure 3C-F). The  Figure 4. N-myc protein level in IMR-32, NGP and SK-N-BE(2) cells.

The presence of apoptotic nuclei in SsnB-  treated neuroblastoma cells compared to control DMSO-treated  cells (as revealed by TUNEL assay, Figure 3A and B) indicates that  activation of caspase cascade by SsnB trigger apoptotic cell death  pathways. In addition, we also found that SsnB promotes ROS  generation in both N-myc amplified and N-myc nonamplified  neuroblastoma cells (Figure 2A-C). The ROS generating capacity  of SsnB was confirmed by our cell-free system in which SsnB in  presence of peroxidase (HRP) oxidized H2DCDA to fluorescent  compound (Figure 2D and E). Reactive oxygen species such as free  radicals and peroxides increases cellular oxidative stress which  promotes lipids peroxidation and oxidation of nucleic acid and  amplifies the cell death. The imbalance between the generation of  reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense status  disrupt the redox homeostasis [39]. In our present study, we  observed that SsnB significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) level  in neuroblastoma cells (Figure 2F). GSH acts as an antioxidant  and its role to remove oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen  species is well known hence GSH depletion in presence of SsnB  fail to remove free radicals and this might be the primary cause of  SsnB-induced cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. The  critical role of GSH in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity was further  supported by our observations obtained with N-acetylcystamine  (NAC). NAC is a GSH precursor and functions as an antioxidant.  Co-incubation of NAC removes free radicals from the SsnB-  treated cells and inhibits the activation of cleaved caspase-3  (Figure 5B-D). These events thus protect the cells against the  oxidative insults caused by SsnB and increased the cell viability  (Figure 5A). Hence these data suggest that SsnB-induced cytotoxic  Figure 5.

The induction of cell cycle arrest at a specific checkpoint and  thereby inducing apoptosis is a common mechanism for the  cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs [45]. The cell cycle arrest at  G2/M transition is a potential target for cancer therapy as it  prevents DNA-damaged cells from entering mitosis, and cell cycle  blockage at this checkpoint is carried out by cell cycle-related  proteins such as p53 and cyclins. Activation of p53, a tumor  suppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2 phase of cell  cycle [46]. The results in present study demonstrate that treating  neuroblastoma cells with SsnB (10 mM) resulted in cell cycle block in G2/M phase (flow cytometry analysis, Figure 1C) and increase  in expression of p53 compared to DMSO treated cells (Figure 3G).  These findings suggested that p53-mediated apoptosis might also  involve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity in p53-containing neuroblas-  toma cells.  It is well known that N-myc amplification is associated with  neuroblastoma tumor progression and drug resistance [41,47]. N-  myc, a member of the myc family of proto-oncoprotein, acts as a  transcription factor and regulates the expression of genes involved  in cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis, and overexpression of  N-myc in trasnsgenic mice results in neuroblastoma development  [48]. However, downregulation of N-myc expression has been  shown to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in neuroblastoma  cells [49,50]. In the current study, we found that SsnB at 10 mM concentration suppresses the N-myc expression in IMR-32, NGP  and SK-N-BE(2) cells (Figure 4) which might be correlated with  the SsnB-mediated anticancer activity on human neuroblastoma  cells.  In summary, the present study for the first time demonstrated  the anticancer property of SsnB on human neuroblastoma cells.  SsnB induces apoptosis in a wide range of neuroblastoma cell lines.  The reduced tumorigenic ability of both N-myc amplified and N-  myc nonamplified cells resulted from SsnB in our colony  formation and hanging drop assays, and a recent published study  showing that SsnB exerts anti-angiogenic property by downreg-  ulating mRNA level of cell cycle regulatory proteins [3] indicated  that SsnB can be a used as a novel therapeutics anticancer agent.  Drugs that generate ROS and induce apoptosis are used alone or  in combination with other therapies to treat cancer, suggesting  that SsnB can be a promising antitumor agent for neuroblastoma  and requires preclinical studies on animal models [51].
