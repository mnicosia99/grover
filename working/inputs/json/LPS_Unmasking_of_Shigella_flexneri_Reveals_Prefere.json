    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

Unlike IcsA however, the specific localisation of IcsP on the cell surface is unknown. To determine the distribution of IcsP, a haemagglutinin (HA) epitope was inserted into the non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 using Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE) PCR, and IcsPHA was characterised. Quantum Dot (QD) immunofluorescence (IF) surface labelling of IcsPHA was then undertaken. Quantitative fluorescence analysis of S. flexneri 2a 2457T treated with and without tunicaymcin to deplete lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O antigen (Oag) showed that IcsP  HA was asymmetrically distributed on the surface of septating and non-septating cells, and  that this distribution was masked by LPS Oag in untreated cells. Double QD IF labelling of IcsPHA and IcsA showed that IcsPHA preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells and to the septum of septating cells. The localisation of IcsPHA in a rough LPS S. flexneri 2457T strain (with no Oag) was also investigated and a similar distribution of IcsPHA was observed. Complementation of the rough LPS strain with rmlD resulted in restored LPS Oag chain expression and loss of IcsPHA detection, providing further support for LPS Oag masking of surface proteins. Our data presents for the first time the distribution for the Omptin OM protease IcsP, relative to IcsA, and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.

Introduction  Shigella flexneri is an intracellular pathogen which causes bacillary  dysentery, a disease characterised by the presence of severe  mucoid bloody diarrhoea and by invasion of the gut epithelium  [1,2]. IcsA (VirG) is a 120 kDa outer membrane (OM) protein  localised at the cell pole [3]. It mediates intracellular cytoplasmic  movement of S. flexneri in epithelial cells, and cell-to-cell spread, by  the assembly of an F-actin comet-tail at one pole of the bacterium  [4-6]. This type of movement is described as actin-based motility  (ABM). IcsA is secreted primarily at the \u2018old pole' of Shigellae [7]  which is opposite the \u2018new pole' (the pole derived from the site of  septation of the parent cell [8]. The 36.9 kDa IcsP (SopA) OM  protease of S. flexneri slowly cleaves IcsA at the Arg758- Arg759 bond position [9] resulting in the release of a 95 kDa amino-  terminal IcsA fragment that can be detected in culture superna-  tants [5,10]. Analysis of icsP/sopA mutants has shown that IcsA is  detected across the entire surface of these bacteria with polar  reinforcement [11,12]. Over-expression of IcsP results in the  complete removal of IcsA from the cell surface [13].  IcsP belongs to the Omptin family of proteases which consists of  6 members; OmpT and OmpP of Escherichia coli, Pla of Yersinia  pestis, PgtE of Salmonella enterica, Pla endopeptidase A of Erwinia  pyrifoliae, and IcsP of Shigella flexneri. Immunogold labelling of  overexpressed OmpP has shown that OmpP is symmetrically  distributed over the cell surface [14]. However to date, no studies  have attempted to describe the surface localisation of Omptins  expressed at native levels. While it has been suggested that IcsP  may also be located uniformly across the cell surface [13], its  specific distribution is currently unknown. In contrast to many  inner membrane proteins, such as FtsZ [15] and MreB [16]  involved in cell division and cell shape, few OM proteins have had  their subcellular distribution determined. An exception to this is  the E. coli OM protein LamB which has been characterised to exist  as two populations: one that diffuses in a helical pattern, and one  that is relatively immobile [17,18]. The E. coli Iss and Bor proteins  have been detected on the cell surface with no distinct pattern  [19]. A number of non-specific E. coli OM proteins were suggested  to be organised in stable helical swaths [20], and data by Shiomi  et al. (2006) suggested that the general protein translocation Sec  machinery itself may also be arranged in a helical array. Whether  IcsP possesses a distribution similar to these OM proteins, or has  an asymmetric distribution like IcsA, is the subject of this study.  In addition to the above, mutations affecting lipopolysaccharide  (LPS) have also been shown to affect the observed distribution of  OM proteins [21-24]. LPS is composed of three distinct regions:  lipid A, core sugars and O antigen (Oag) polysaccharide chains.  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70508    Strains with LPS containing all 3 regions intact are known as  smooth LPS strains. Shigella mutants lacking Oag are known as  rough LPS strains. Such strains have been shown to have high  levels of circumferentially distributed IcsA on the cell surface (at  both cell poles and on lateral regions) [25,26], compared to the  polar localisation of IcsA seen in smooth LPS strains. Treatment of  Y serotype derivatives of smooth LPS S. flexneri with bacteriophage  Sf6 tailspike protein (TSP) endorhamnosidase results in the  hydrolysis of Oag chains and an increase detection of circumfer-  ential IcsA on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence (IF)  staining [21]. This suggests that the presence of LPS Oag masks  the observed distribution of IcsA on the cell surface and supports  the idea that LPS Oag structure may block antibody accessibility  to the detection of surface proteins [22,23]. The effect of LPS Oag  structure on the detection and distribution of IcsP has not been  investigated.  In this study, we investigated the distribution of IcsP by cell  surface quantum dot (QD) IF labelling of functional, HA-tagged  IcsP (IcsP HA  ) in S. flexneri 2457T and establish that LPS Oag masks  detection of IcsP HA  on the cell surface by using tunicamycin to  inhibit Oag synthesis. Additional IF labelling with anti-IcsA  antibodies to mark the location of the old pole suggested that IcsP  is preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells and  to the septa of septating cells. We also investigated the distribution  of IcsP in a rough LPS 2457T strain to provide further support for  the LPS Oag masking hypothesis. Overall, our data presents for  the first time the cell surface distribution of the Omptin OM  protease IcsP and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.  This distribution has implications for IcsA polarity determination,  and a model is described to explain IcsP's contribution to IcsA  polarity in S. flexneri.  Methods  Ethics Statement The anti-IcsP and anti-IcsA antibodies were produced under  the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)  Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for  Scientific Purposes and were approved by the University of  Adelaide Animal Ethics Committee.  Bacterial Strains, Plasmids and Media Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in  Table 1. Bacteria were routinely grown at 37uC in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth with aeration or on Congo red agar [26]. Antibiotics  used were as follows: 50 mg ampicillin (Amp) ml21; 25 mg chloramphenicol (Cml) ml  21 ; 50 mg kanamycin (Kan) ml21.  DNA Methods E. coli K-12 DH5a was used for all cloning experiments. DNA  manipulation, PCR, transformation and electroporation was  performed as previously described [27,28]. Anti-HA monoclonal  antibody (#H3663) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-IcsP and anti-IcsA antibodies were prepared as described previously  [26,29]. The antibodies were produced under the National Health  and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Australian Code of  Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes  and were approved by the University of Adelaide Animal Ethics  Committee.  Insertion of HA Epitope into IcsP The sequence encoding the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was  inserted into the putatively non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 (based  on sequence alignments with E. coli OmpT) using SOE PCR  [30,31]. In the first part of this two-step PCR technique, upstream  and downstream amplicons were amplified from S. flexneri 2457T  genomic DNA using HA encoding primers (ET18/ET19) and icsP -  specific primers (ET3/ET10) (Table 2). The two amplicons from  this primary PCR were then mixed and used as a DNA template  for the second round of PCR with primers ET3/ET10. In this  second reaction, the HA encoding regions of the primary PCR  amplicons overlap and prime one another to give the final icsP  PCR product with an inserted HA epitope. The icsP HA  fragment  was then cloned into pGEMT-Easy and primers ET22/ET25  (Table 2) were used to amplify an icsP HA  product with KpnI and  HindIII restriction enzyme sites from this construct. The resultant  KpnI-HindIII fragment was digested and sub-cloned into likewise  digested pBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsP HA  , also referred to as  pIcsP HA  in text (Table 1). Primers ET22/ET25 were also used to  amplify the icsP gene from 2457T genomic DNA, and cloned into  pBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsP, referred to as pIcsP in text  (Table 1). DNA sequencing was used to confirm that no mutation  had been introduced by PCR into the sequence, and the presence  of the in-frame HA epitope tag sequence.  Construction of S. flexneri icsP mutant The S. flexneri 2457T icsP  - mutant strain was constructed using  allelic exchange mutagenesis [27] to inactivate the icsP gene by  insertion of a kanamycin resistance gene (kan R ). Initially, the icsP  gene was PCR amplified with primers ET3/ET4 containing  BamHI and SacI restriction sites from 2457T genomic DNA. The  resultant PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and SacI and  sub-cloned into likewise digested pSL1180 (Table 1). Further  digestion with ClaI allowed insertion of the AccI-AccI digested kan R  gene from pKTUWE (Table 1) to give pSL1180-icsP::kan R  (Table 1). Following re-digestion with BamHI and SacI, the  icsP::kan R  fragment was cloned into pCACTUS (Table 1) and  transformed into S. flexneri 2457T via electroporation. Allelic  exchange mutagenesis was performed as previously described [27].  The icsP::kan R  mutation in the virulence plasmid was confirmed by  PCR with primers ET3/ET4 (Table 2) to give the 2457T icsP -  mutant ETRM22 (Table 1).  Construction of S. flexneri icsP2/rmlD- Double Mutant The S. flexneri 2457T icsP  2 /rmlD  - mutant strain was constructed  using a modification of the l Red recombinase system to initially delete the rmlD gene [32]. Primers ET28/ET29 containing NheI  restriction enzyme sites (Table 2) were used to PCR amplify the  kan R  gene from pKD4 (Table 1). The amplified product was  ligated into pGEMT-Easy and pGEMT-Easy::kan R  was digested  with NheI. The NheI-kan R -NheI fragment was then subcloned into  likewise digested pRMA718 [26] to give pRMA718-rmlD::kan R  (Table 1). This plasmid was then digested with BamHI and the  rmlD::Kan R  fragment was cloned into the BamHI site of  pCACTUS. The pCACTUS-rmlD::Kan R  construct was then  electroporated into S. flexneri 2457T and allelic exchange  mutagenesis was induced to give the 2457T rmlD::kan R  mutant  ETRM230 (Table 1). ETRM230 was transformed with pCP20 at  30uC to flip out the FRT flanked kanR gene and give the 2457T rmlD  - mutant ETRM233 (Table 1). The rmlD mutation was  confirmed by LPS analysis. ETRM233 was further electroporated  with pCACTUS-icsP::kan R  (Table 1) and another round of allelic  exchange mutagenesis was performed to give the final 2457T  rmlD 2/  icsP -  double mutant ETRM240 (Table 1).  Analysis of IcsP/IcsPHA Protein Production For detection of native IcsP, strains were grown at 37uC in LB  broth with aeration for 16 h, subcultured 1/20 into fresh broth  Distribution of the Outer Membrane Protease IcsP  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70508    and grown for another 3 h to an OD600 of ,1. Strains harbouring pIcsP or pIcsP  HA were grown in LB broth containing 0.2% (w/v)  glucose for 16 h with aeration, subcultured 1/20 into fresh broth  and grown for 1.5 h to an OD600 reading of ,0.4. Cultures were then pelleted by centrifugation (22196g, 10 min, Sigma 3K15 centrifuge), washed 3 times in LB, and unless otherwise stated,  induced with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose for 1 h to an OD600 of ,1. Cells (56108) were then harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 2X sample buffer [33]. Protein samples were  solubilised at 100uC for 5 min, separated on SDS 15% polyacryl- amide gels, and stained with Coomassie R-250, or subjected to  Western immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membrane (Medos)  with either polyclonal rabbit anti-IcsP antiserum (at 1/250  dilution) or monoclonal mouse anti-HA (at 1/500 dilution).  Detection was performed with goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse)  horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (KPL) and chemi-  luminescence reagent (Sigma). Benchmark prestained molecular  weight markers (Invitrogen) were used as molecular size markers.  Sucrose Gradient Density Fractionation Fractionation of the cell whole membrane (WM) into cytoplas-  mic membrane (CM) and OM fractions was performed by sucrose  gradient centrifugation according to the method of Osborn and  Munson [34]. In brief, 200 ml cultures were grown and induced  with arabinose as described above, harvested by centrifugation  (9,8006g, 15 min, 4uC, JA14 rotor, Beckman centrifuge J2-21M), washed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and resuspended in 5 ml  10 mM HEPES in 1 mM MgCl2. The bacterial suspension was  then passed through a pre-cooled French Pressure cell (SLM  Aminco) once and re-centrifuged to remove cell debri. WM pellets  were collected by ultracentrifugation (115,0006g, 1 h, 4uC, 80 Ti rotor, Beckman Coulter Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge),  Table 1. Bacterial strains and plasmids.

Centrifugation to equilibrium was performed with  a Beckman SW40Ti swing out rotor (217,0006g, 20 h, 4uC, Beckman Coulter Optima L-100 XP ultracentrifuge) and 0.5 ml  fractions collected through the pierced bottom of the tube. 10 ml samples of each fraction were resuspended in 2X sample buffer  [33] and IcsP protein detected as described above.  Detection of Cell Associated and Soluble IcsA Whole cell and supernatant bacterial protein extracts were  prepared as described previously [35]. IcsA protein was detected  from 10 ml whole cell protein extracts and 20 ml supernatant protein extracts. Western immunoblotting was performed as  described above, but with a polyclonal rabbit IcsA antibody and  a goat anti-rabbit HRP conjugate.  LPS Analysis LPS samples and gels were prepared as described previously  [36,37].  LPS Depletion-regeneration Assay Depletion and regeneration of LPS was performed as previously  described [29] with the exception that 0.03% (w/v) arabinose  induction was included in the final hour of tunicamycin/  polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN) treatment.  Formaldehyde Fixation of Bacteria for Immunofluorescence (IF) Microscopy  Bacteria were grown and induced as described above 16108  cells of induced bacteria were then harvested by centrifugation,  washed once in PBS and resuspended in 100 ml 3.7% (w/v) formaldehyde (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min at room temperature  (RT). Fixed bacteria were then pelleted, washed three times in  PBS and resuspended in a final volume of 100 ml PBS.  Quantum Dot (QD) IF Staining and Epi-fluorescence Microscopy  Sterile glass coverslips were placed into wells of a 24-well tray  and coated with 10% (v/v) poly-L-lysine solution (Sigma) in PBS  for 1 h at RT. Coating solution was aspirated and 5 mL of formaldehyde fixed bacteria were spotted onto coverslips. The tray  was then centrifuged to assist adherence of bacteria (Heraeus  Labofuge 400R Centrifuge, 2,0006g, 5 min, 20uC). Bacteria were blocked for 1 h at RT with 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS)  diluted in PBS. For labelling, bacteria were incubated for 2 h at  RT with mouse anti-HA antibody (Sigma) and rabbit anti-IcsA  antiserum diluted 1:50 and 1:100 respectively in PBS containing  10% (v/v) FCS. Bacteria were then washed 3 times with PBS, and  then incubated for 1 h at RT with either QD 525 donkey anti-  mouse antibody (Invitrogen) or QD 625 donkey anti-rabbit  antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:50 and 1:100, respectively, in  PBS containing 10% (v/v) FCS. After a final 3 more washes with  PBS, coverslips were mounted on glass microscope slides with  Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem). All microscopy images were captured  Figure 2.

All IcsP HA  (525 nm) and IcsA (625 nm) channel images were acquired with  1 sec and 0.1 sec exposures respectively using an X-Cite 120Q  lamp set at high intensity as the excitation source. The excitation  filter used was FF01-435/40-25 (Semrock) and the emission filters  were FF01-525/15-25 and FF01-625/15-25 (Semrock). Semrock  FF510-Di01-25636 dichroics were used.  Fluorescence Quantification of QD Labelled Surface IcsPHA  Data for intensity profile plots were extracted from images using  MetaMorph's Line-scan function which averages intensities across  the perpendicular axis of a point-to-point scan. Single scans were  conducted from pole-to-pole with width (perpendicular axis) equal  to the bacterium (approx. 20 pixels). Cumulative scans of the  525 nm wavelength (IcsP HA  ) for non-septating cells were con-  ducted for 50 bacteria from each independent sample. Each  bacterium was scanned from the new pole to old pole where IcsA  was used as a marker of the old pole. From the same samples, all  septating cells from captured images were scanned starting from  the septum to the old pole of one daughter cell chosen at random.  An average of 26.8 septating bacteria were scanned for each  sample. Intensity data was then exported to MS Excel using  MetaMorph's Dynamic Data Exchange and subsequently ana-  lysed using GraphPad Prism. Statistical significances were tested  by Student's two-tailed t-test.  Results  Detection of IcsP Expression by Western Immunoblotting and Immunofluorescence  In initial experiments to detect cell surface IcsP, the optimal  time point for IcsP expression in S. flexneri was determined.  Western immunoblotting with a rabbit anti-IcsP was performed on  whole cell lysates collected from wild-type S. flexneri 2457T and the  2457T icsP - mutant (icsP  - ) grown for 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5 and 3 h after  subculture. A band consistent with the size of the IcsP protein  (,36 kDa) was detected at time points after 1.5 h for 2457T (Fig.  Figure 3. Analysis of IcsP/IcsPHA subcellular localisation by sucrose density gradient centrifugation of WM. S. flexneri icsP- strains harbouring either pIcsPHA and pIcsP were grown in LB for 1.5 h to an OD600 reading of ,0.4, washed 3 times, and induced with arabinose for 1 h (OD600 ,1). Whole membranes (WM) were prepared by French press lysis, and subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation 48] as described in the Methods.

We reasoned that IcsP levels at this time point were  high enough for subsequent immunofluorescent detection of IcsP.  No expression of IcsP was observed for icsP -  as expected (Fig. 1A,  lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 & 12). Subsequent attempts to detect IcsP on  the surface of 2457T with rabbit anti-IcsP however were  unsuccessful, even in a rough LPS strain (data not shown). We  speculate that as the IcsP protein used to raise antisera was  purified under denaturing conditions, this may have affected the  resulting antibody's ability to detect native IcsP. However,  difficulties with IF detection of cell surface IcsP with a polyclonal  antibody have also been reported by others [13]. Hence, in an  alternative approach to investigate the distribution of IcsP on the  bacterial cell surface, a HA epitope was inserted into the IcsP  protein.  Figure 4.

Based on sequence alignments with E. coli OmpT (Fig. 2B), a HA  epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) was hence inserted into the OM loop  5 of IcsP (Fig. 2B) using SOE PCR (as described in the Methods).  An area within this loop region with some sequence diversity  between IcsP and OmpT was selected as we reasoned that this  sequence variability might allow the protein to accommodate the  Figure 7.

Quantification and statistical analysis of IcsPHA surface distribution. A total of 9 independent cultures of Smooth LPS 2457T icsP-  strains harbouring pIcsPHA or pBAD30 were subcultured in LB for 1.5 h to an OD600 reading of ,0.4, washed 3 times in LB, and then further cultured for 2 in the presence of TP for Oag-depletion. Arabinose was included in the final hour of treatment at a concentration of 0.03% (w/v). A total of 9 independent cultures of Rough LPS 2457T icsP  - /rmlD  - strains harbouring pIcsP  HA or pBAD30 were also subcultured LB broth to an OD600 reading of  ,0.4, washed 3 times in LB, and induced with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose for 1 h. A sample from each culture was then fixed and subjected to QD IF using antibodies for HA epitope and IcsA. Fluorescence intensity scans of IcsP  HA (525 nm wavelength) were conducted on multiple bacteria from each  independent sample and accumulated scans were used to create mean intensity profiles. A total 450 non-septating bacteria were scanned for each strain. A further 355, 256, 172, and 173 septating bacteria were scanned for Oag-depleted icsP- [pIcsPHA], Oag-depleted icsP- [pBAD30], icsP-/rmlD-  [pIcsPHA], and icsP-/rmlD- [pBAD30] respectively.

The OM loop 5 region was also selected to increase the chance of  surface detection by antibodies. OM loops 2 and 4 were not  selected for HA tag insertion to avoid the proposed catalytic  residues present in OmpT [38] which also exist in IcsP (Fig. 2C).  The IcsP HA  (as well as IcsP) coding regions were placed in front of  the pBAD promoter in pBAD30 [39] to allow expression control  with arabinose. Expression of IcsP/IcsP HA  was confirmed by  Western immunoblotting with anti-IcsP or anti-HA antibodies  (Fig. 3A & B, lanes WM and Fig. 1A & C).  IcsPHA Activity on IcsA To determine whether insertion of a HA epitope into the OM of  IcsP affected IcsP's protease activity on IcsA, pellet and  supernatant protein preparations of 2457T, icsP -  and arabinose-  induced icsP -  strains expressing pIcsP HA  , pIcsP and pBAD30 were  subjected to Western immunoblotting with an anti-IcsA antibody.  The full length 120 kDa IcsA protein was detected in cell pellet  samples of all strains as expected (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9),  while the 95 kDa cleaved form of IcsA was only detected in the  supernatant sample of 2457T, icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP -  [pIcsP]  (Fig. 1B, lanes 2, 6 & 8). These results suggest that the insertion of  the HA tag into the OM loop 5 of IcsP does not affect its ability to  cleave IcsA, and hence the IcsP HA  protein is functional.  Localisation of IcsP/IcsPHA Protein to the OM Since IcsP  HA was modified compared to IcsP and expressed  from the pBAD promoter, the presence of IcsP HA  protein  exclusively in the OM was confirmed by using sucrose density  gradient centrifugation. The WM of icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP -  [pIcsP] were fractionated into CM and OM on sucrose gradients,  and fractions subjected to SDS 15% polyacrylamide gel electro-  phoresis, prior to visualisation by Coomassie Blue staining and  Western immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-IcsP. Analysis of  the sucrose gradient samples showed that fractions which were  enriched with OM proteins (OmpF, OmpC, and OmpA) [40]  contained the majority of the 36 kDa IcsP HA  and IcsP proteins  (Fig. 3A & B, lanes 2 to 5). These results indicate that IcsP HA  is  localised to the OM similar to IcsP, and that the HA insertion did  not result in any dramatic disruption of IcsP protein localisation.  Detection of Arabinose Induced IcsPHA Expression by Western Immunoblotting  Wild-type S. flexneri 2457T showed optimal expression levels of  native IcsP at 3 h (Fig. 1A). To investigate the conditions required  for comparable IcsP HA  expression, whole cell lysate samples were  prepared from icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP -  [pBAD30] induced with  0%, 0.003%, 0.006%, 0.0125%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% or 0.2%  (w/v) arabinose for 1 h. Western immunoblotting with anti-IcsP  showed that a band of ,36 kDa was detected for 2457T and icsP-  [pIcsP HA  ] induced with 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% (w/v) (w/  v) arabinose (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3-6), with expression levels  comparable to native IcsP for icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] observed between  0.025%-0.05% (w/v) arabinose induction (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 & 6).  Induction at 0.03% (w/v) arabinose was hence chosen for all  subsequent experiments.  Cell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in S. flexneri 2457T and the Effect of Tunicamycin Treatment  Having established an induction protocol that closely approx-  imates the level of expression of IcsP HA  to native IcsP, we next  attempted to detect IcsP HA  at these levels on the surface of 2457T  icsP -  using indirect QD IF microscopy. Strains icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and  icsP -  [pBAD30] were cultured with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, fixed,  and then probed for HA using a primary anti-HA antibody and a  secondary QD 525 conjugated antibody. However, no IcsP HA  was  detected on the cell surface, and intensity scans of icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ]  were equivalent to icsP -  [pBAD30] (Fig. S1).  Since IcsP HA  could not be detected on the cell surface of icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ], we reasoned that the presence of LPS Oag may mask  the detection of surface IcsP as this has previously been shown for  IcsA [21]. An LPS Oag depletion-regeneration assay [29] was  hence carried out on icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP -  [pBAD30] induced  with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, followed by IF labelling. This assay  involves the use of an inhibitor of the WecA enzyme necessary for  Oag subunit biosynthesis using tunicamycin, and polymyxin B  nonapeptide (PMBN) was used to improve OM penetration. Upon  removal of these two chemicals from growing bacteria, LPS Oag is  regenerated [29]. Analysis of the resulting LPS by SDS-PAGE and  silver staining showed that icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP -  [pBAD30]  samples treated with tunicamycin/PMBN (TP) had depleted LPS  Oag (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 & 6), with Oag production restored (R) upon  removal of TP (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 & 8). Untreated (U) and PMBN  treated (P) samples showed no inhibition of Oag biosynthesis as  expected (Fig. 4A, lanes 1-4).  Following successful depletion of LPS Oag, QD IF microscopy  was performed on the above mentioned samples. IcsP HA  could not  be detected on untreated or PMBN treated icsP - [pIcsP  HA ] cells, as  expected (Fig. S2A). However, surface IcsP HA  was detected on  icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] cells treated with TP, suggesting that LPS Oag is  able to mask antibody accessibility to IcsP HA  (Fig. S2A).  Interestingly, IcsP HA  appeared to be distributed asymmetrically  over the cell surface of the majority of cells examined and  fluorescence intensity line-scans revealed that IcsP HA  localised  preferentially to one pole of non-septating cells and the septa of  septating cells (Fig. S2A). To determine if the distribution of  IcsP HA  on the cell surface segregated to either the new pole or the  old pole, additional staining of the bacteria was conducted with  anti-IcsA antibodies since IcsA is known to localise to the old cell  pole [5]. Again, IcsP HA  could not be detected on untreated or  PMBN treated icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] cells (Fig. 5A & B) but could be  detected after TP treatment (Fig. 5C). Peak IcsP HA  detection was  consistently observed at the new pole (opposing IcsA at the old  pole) and at the septum of septating bacteria as shown by line-  scans (Fig. 5C). As expected, no surface IcsP HA  was detected for  untreated, PMBN treated, or TP treated samples of icsP -  [pBAD30] when stained for IcsP HA  (Fig. S2B) or double stained  for IcsP HA  and IcsA (Fig. S3). Notably, IcsA on icsP -  [pBAD30]  was detected at higher amounts laterally and at the septa of  bacteria (Fig. S3) as previously seen for DicsP strains [13].  Cell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in Rough LPS S. flexneri 2457T  To further investigate the effect of Oag on IcsP distribution, a  2457T icsP 2  /rmlD -  double mutant was constructed to indepen-  old poles of septating bacteria. Student's two-tailed t-tests (D) were also conducted on the fold differences of mean IcsPHA intensities between discrete positions (new pole, old pole, and septum) of Oag-depleted icsP- and icsP-/rmlD- bacteria.

Mutation of the rmlD gene in S. flexneri results in a  strain which is unable to synthesise the precursor deoxythymidine  diphosphate (dTDP)- rhamnose required for Oag repeat units and,  hence, results in a rough LPS phenotype [29,41]. Analysis of the  resulting LPS conferred by icsP 2  /rmlD -  strains expressing pIcsP HA  and pBAD30 showed that rough LPS was observed for both (Fig.  4B, lanes 1 & 2), with a band consistent with the size of the IcsP HA  protein (36 kDa) detected only in the icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pIcsP HA  ]  sample by Western immunoblotting, as expected (Fig. 4C, lane 1).  Fixed samples of icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pBAD30] cells were then probed for both IcsP HA  and IcsA using  the same QD IF staining protocol as previously conducted for  smooth strains. Similarly to LPS Oag-depleted icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ],  IcsP HA  was detected on the bacterial surface most predominately  at the new pole (Fig. 6A) and the septum (Fig. 6B). Again, the  majority of septating cells had higher peak IcsP HA  intensity at the  septum than new poles of non-septating cells (line-scans Fig. 6A &  B). Single staining of these cells for IcsP HA  was also conducted and  yielded the same localisation results (Fig. S4). As expected, IcsP HA  was not detected on the icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pBAD30] strain in IF  microscopy experiments when either single (Fig. S4) or double  stained (Fig. 6B). Again, IcsA on icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pBAD30] was  detected at higher amounts laterally and at the septum (Fig. 6A &  B).  To again demonstrate the effect of LPS Oag masking of IcsP HA  ,  smooth LPS structure was restored in the icsP 2  /rmlD -  strain  expressing pIcsP HA  by transforming pRMA727 carrying a  functional rmlD gene. Analysis of the resulting LPS conferred by  icsP 2  /rmlD - [pIcsP  HA ][pRMA727] showed restored smooth LPS  phenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 3), and when probed for IcsP HA  by QD  IF microscopy, was barely detectable (Fig. 7A). The control icsP 2  /  rmlD -  [pIcsP HA  ] strain carrying pACYC184 conferred a rough  LPS phenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and IcsP HA  was detected by IF  microscopy with the same distribution observed previously (Fig.  7B).  Multi-cell Line-scan Analysis of IcsPHA Surface Distribution  To determine if the observed sub-cellular preference of IcsP HA  to the new poles and septa is a statistically significant phenom-  enon, cumulative QD IF line-scan analyses on both IcsP HA  /IcsA  double stained LPS Oag-depleted icsP -  strains and rough icsP 2  /  rmlD -  strains was conducted for a larger population of cells.  Scanning was initiated from the new pole to the old pole (as  marked by IcsA) for non-septating cells, and from the septum to  the old pole for septating cells (Fig 8C). From 9 independent  samples of LPS Oag-depleted icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP -  [pBAD30],  a total of 450 non-septating cells each were line-scanned.  Additionally a total of 355 and 256 septating cells were scanned  for icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP -  [pBAD30] respectively. The resultant  mean fluorescence intensity profiles show that IcsP HA  is preferen-  tially localised at the new pole and tends to gradually decrease  towards the old pole on non-septating cells expressing pIcsP HA  (Fig. 8A). For septating cells, IcsP HA  mean intensity is localised  highest at the septum and declines more steeply towards the old  pole (Fig. 8A). As expected, the intensity profiles of icsP - [pBAD30]  cells were at a negligible level (Fig. 8A). Statistical analysis of mean  IcsP HA  intensity at discrete bacterial positions of LPS-depleted  icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] confirmed that the localisation of IcsP HA  is: (i) 2-  fold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole  (P = 0.004), (ii) 2.9-fold higher at the septum of septating cells than  the old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.5-fold higher at septa of  septating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells  (P = 0.038) (Fig. 8D).  For the rough LPS strains, 9 independent samples of icsP 2  /  rmlD - [pIcsP  HA ] and icsP  2 /rmlD  - [pBAD30] were investigated with  a total of 450 non-septating cells each line-scanned. Additionally, a  total of 172 and 173 septating cells were scanned for icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pIcsP HA  ] and icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pBAD30] respectively. Again, the  mean intensity profiles of non-septating cells expressing pIcsP HA  shows IcsP HA  is preferentially localised at the new pole and tends  Figure 9.

Likewise,  IcsP HA  mean intensity of septating cells is localised highest at the  septum and declines very steeply towards the old pole (Fig. 8B). As  expected, the mean intensity profiles of icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pBAD30]  were at a negligible level (Fig. 8B). Statistical analysis of mean  IcsP HA  intensity at discrete bacterial positions of icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pIcsP HA  ] again confirmed that the localisation of IcsP HA  is: (i) 2.2-  fold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole  (P,0.0001), (ii) 3.6-fold higher at the septum of septating cells than  the old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.7-fold higher at septa of  septating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells  (P = 0.0002) (Fig. 8D). Although, IcsP HA  fluorescence intensity was  an average of 2.5 times higher on icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pIcsP HA  ] cells than  LPS-depleted icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] cells, the ratios of intensity between  bacterial positions were comparable to the respective fold-changes  observed for LPS Oag-depleted icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ], suggesting that  IcsP HA  is localised similarly in both types of Oag deficient cells.  The lower level of IcsP HA  detection on LPS-depleted icsP -  [pIcsP HA  ] compared to icsP 2  /rmlD -  [pIcsP HA  ] indicates that TP  treatment is not 100% efficient in inhibiting Oag synthesis.  Discussion  The cell surface distribution of neither IcsP, or any other  member of the Omptin family, had not been previously  determined. In this study we investigated the distribution of IcsP  on the cell surface of S. flexneri 2a 2457T using a HA-tagged IcsP  protein (Fig. 2) under pBAD control. Characterisation of IcsP HA  showed that it was functionally able to cleave IcsA, and was  secreted into the OM comparably to IcsP (Fig. 1B & 3). However,  when IcsP HA  was expressed at native IcsP equivalent levels (Fig.  1A & C), it was undetectable in the OM via QD IF microscopy in  smooth LPS S. flexneri (Fig. S1) but detectable on both LPS Oag-  depleted and rough LPS Shigella bacteria (Fig. 4, 5 & 6).  Furthermore, this masking effect was restored in rough strains  upon complementation of rmlD (Fig. 4B & 7). We suggest that the  long LPS Oag chains of smooth strains sterically hinder the  accessibility of antibodies to the OM surface. This type of protein  masking by LPS Oag has also been shown for IcsA in 2457T [21],  and several other OM proteins [22,23]. It is interesting to note that  multi-cell line-scan analysis of IcsP HA  detection on the cell surface  showed that IcsP HA  fluorescence intensity was higher for rough  LPS cells than for LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8). Similar to its  Omptin homolog, OmpT, IcsP possesses most of the putative LPS-  binding sites found in OmpT (Fig. 2C) [38] and may also interact  with LPS. Since TP is only partly effective at blocking LPS Oag  synthesis, it is possible that the few LPS Oag molecules synthesised  are still closely bound to IcsP. This may cause a small amount of  masking and may explain the lower fluorescence intensity  observed on LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8A) compared to the  rough LPS cells (Fig. 8B).  IcsA distributions in DicsP strains previously provided indirect evidence to suggest that IcsP is distributed equally over the cell  surface of S. flexneri [12,13,42]. However, once the masking effect  of LPS Oag was circumvented, we were able to extensively study  the distribution profile of IcsP HA  in the OM. This work has shown  that IcsP HA  (and likely IcsP) has an asymmetrical distribution  which may be cell cycle dependent. On dividing cells IcsP  accumulates at high concentration at the septum and then declines  steeply towards the old pole of the emerging daughter cell.  However, once divided, detection of IcsP at the new pole (the pole  derived from the septum) of daughter cells decreased significantly  and then the decline towards the old pole is more moderate. To  explain this, we propose that IcsP is directed to septa of dividing  cells and that daughter cells \u2018inherit' a higher concentration of IcsP  at new poles (model Fig. 9). As the daughter cell elongates, IcsP is  laterally diluted, resulting in the gentle gradient on non-septating  cells. In this model, lateral dilution of IcsP may occur by  membrane insertion events during cell elongation similarly to that  described for E. coli LamB [43]. This model predicts increased  cleavage of IcsA at the septum and lateral regions of the cell in  order to help set up a relatively higher concentration of IcsA at the  old pole and to maintain the old pole preference of IcsA in  daughter cells. Additionally, the model may explain, and also fits,  the common observation that IcsA distributions and intensities  vary between cells in a given population of the same strain.  Many proteins are known to accumulate at the inner membrane  of the mid-cell in order to mediate septum formation and cell  division - for instance, FtsZ polymerises at the cytoplasmic face to  form the Z-ring and attract further divisome components [44].  However, few OM proteins have been shown to concentrate to the  septum. A notable exception to this is the OM lipoprotein LpoB  which localises as distinct foci at septa and complexes with  periplasmic penicillin binding protein 1B tethering it to other  divisome components [44,45]. Interestingly, septal localisation of  LpoB is lost when peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited [45].  Whether the localisation of integral OM protein IcsP to the septal  OM requires similar interactions with divisome components, or is  dependent on peptidoglycan synthesis, remains to be investigated.  In summary, this work has shown for the first time the surface  localisation of IcsP, a member on the Omptin family of OM  proteases. We have observed that: (i) the distribution of IcsP is  masked by LPS Oag in S. flexneri 2457T, and (ii) IcsP is  concentrated at new poles and at the septum of dividing cells.  This distribution of IcsP explains the observed IcsA localisation  defect in DicsP strains [11,12]. We have also proposed a model to explain the inheritance of OM proteins IcsP and IcsA through  generations of cell division. Finally, unmasking of surface antigens  via LPS Oag-depletion may be useful in the study of other  minimally exposed OM proteins.
