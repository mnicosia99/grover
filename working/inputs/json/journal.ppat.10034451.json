    "summary": "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity is an essential enzymatic step in the formation of neutral lipid i.e., triacylglycerol in all living cells capable of accumulating storage lipid. Previously, we characterized an oleaginous yeast Candida tropicalis SY005 that yields storage lipid up to 58% under a specific nitrogen-stress condition, when the DGAT-specific transcript is drastically up-regulated. Here we report the identification, differential expression and function of two DGAT2 gene homologues--CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b of this C. tropicalis. Two protein isoforms are unique with respect to the presence of five additional stretches of amino acids, besides possessing three highly conserved motifs known in other reported DGAT2 enzymes. Moreover, the CtDGAT2a and CtDGAT2b are characteristically different in amino acid sequences and predicted protein structures. The CtDGAT2b isozyme was found to be catalytically 12.5% more efficient than CtDGAT2a for triacylglycerol production in a heterologous yeast system i.e., Saccharomyces cerevisiae quadruple mutant strain H1246 that is inherently defective in neutral lipid biosynthesis. The CtDGAT2b activity rescued the growth of transformed S. cerevisiae mutant cells, which are usually non-viable in the medium containing free fatty acids by incorporating them into triacylglycerol, and displayed preferential specificity towards saturated acyl species as substrate. Furthermore, we document that the efficiency of triacylglycerol production by CtDGAT2b is differentially affected by deletion, insertion or replacement of amino acids in five regions exclusively present in two CtDGAT2 isozymes. Taken together, our study characterizes two structurally novel DGAT2 isozymes, which are accountable for the enhanced production of storage lipid enriched with saturated fatty acids inherently in C. tropicalis SY005 strain as well as in transformed S. cerevisiae neutral lipid-deficient mutant cells. These two genes certainly will be useful for further investigation on the novel structure-function relationship of DGAT repertoire, and also in metabolic engineering for the enhanced production of lipid feedstock in other organisms.",

for a more effective activation of innate immunity; however, the nature of the components for mounting this type of immunological memory is not well known. We identified an extracellular subtilase from Arabidopsis, SBT3.3, the overexpression of which enhances innate immune responses while the loss of function compromises them. SBT3.3 expression initiates a durable autoinduction mechanism that promotes chromatin remodeling and activates a salicylic acid(SA)-dependent mechanism of priming of defense genes for amplified response. Moreover, SBT3.3 expression-sensitized plants for enhanced expression of the OXI1 kinase gene and activation of MAP kinases following pathogen attack, providing additional clues for the regulation of immune priming by SBT3.3. Conversely, in sbt3.3 mutant plants pathogen-mediated induction of SA-related defense gene expression is drastically reduced and activation of MAP kinases inhibited. Moreover, chromatin remodeling of defense- related genes normally associated with activation of an immune priming response appear inhibited in sbt3.3 plants, further indicating the importance of the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase in the establishment of immune priming. Our results also point to an epigenetic control in the regulation of plant immunity, since SBT3.3 is up-regulated and priming activated when epigenetic control is impeded. SBT3.3 represents a new regulator of primed immunity.

Introduction  Plants are continuously faced with threats from pathogenic  microorganisms. They counteract microbial infections via activa-  tion of an innate immune system in a timely, accurate, and  effective manner following pathogen recognition. The innate  immune response is thought to act na\u0131\u0308vely to individual pathogen  encounters and is dependent on the recognition of broadly  conserved molecular features, known as microbe-associated  molecular patterns (MAMPs), by plasma membrane proteins  known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR perception of  MAMPs at the cell surface leads to a pattern-triggered immune  response called PTI [1]. PTI is characterized by the rapid  generation of ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species  (ROS), phosphorylation cascades, and a transcriptional repro-  graming that favors defense responses over routine cellular  requirements [2]. The defense programme is ultimately controlled  through the build-up of specific signalling hormone blends, of  which salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are particularly  important, and eventually establish a broad systemic alert state  throughout the plant.  Plants develop heightened activation of the innate immune  response state resulting from the initial infection manifested in the  form of enhanced resistance to subsequent infections by a broad  spectrum of pathogens. This type of induced resistance (IR) or  cross-protection exhibits memory characteristics after the first  encounter with a pathogen - training effect - and appears  evolutionarily conserved, even outside the plant kingdom. Netea  et al. [3] coined the term \u2018\u2018trained immunity'' to differentiate it  from \u2018\u2018innate immunity'' (as it is induced only secondarily in hosts  that have previously encountered a primary infection), or from  \u2018\u2018adaptive immunity'' (as this implies specificity through T and B  cells). In plants, two distinct types of this resistance form have been  described: systemic acquired resistance (SAR), and induced  systemic resistance (ISR) [4,5]; both represent a functional  immune acclimation requiring the defense response regulator  NPR1.  Particularly relevant in IR responses is the observation that  defence genes, in both the local (infected) and distal tissue, respond  to much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more rapid and  robust manner than controls, thus revealing a \u2018\u2018priming''  phenomenon. In fact, priming has long been known as a  component of IR responses in plants [6,7] and mammals [8-10],  and more recently in invertebrates, which like plants lack adaptive  immunity [11]. Similarly, Arabidopsis mutants attenuated in  pathogen defense (i.e. npr1) are also compromised in priming  [12,13]. Organic and inorganic compounds can also induce this  form of resistance in plants [14]. Among these, azelaic acid [15],  SA, and its functional analogue benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-car-  bothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) [16], or the non-protein amino  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445    acid b-aminobutyric acid (BABA) [17] have attracted marked interest as they potentiate pathogen-specific defense mechanisms,  and induction of a primed state. However, very little is known  about the molecular mechanism(s) and signals that set a priming  state in motion, or the identity of molecular components that  pertain to the maintenance of a long lasting immune primed state,  such as SAR.  Conrath et al. [18] hypothesized that IR or cell priming could be  built on the accumulation of dormant or inactive signalling  proteins, integral in signal amplification that becomes operative  following a challenge with another pathogen, thereby initiating  signal amplification leading to a faster and stronger activation of  defense responses. However, the identity of such signalling  components remains elusive. Interestingly, Beckers et al. [12] have  shown that during development of BTH induced resistance in  Arabidopsis, priming is associated with accumulation of inactive  proteins of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK3 and  MPK6. Exposure to the challenges of biotic and abiotic stressors  results in stronger activation of the two kinases in primed plants  relative to non-primed plants, which is linked to enhanced defense  gene expression. Priming of defense gene expression was reduced  in mpk3 or mpk6 mutants, showing that pre-stress deposition of a  MPK cascade is a critical step in priming plants for a full defense  response induction during IR [12].  Essential IR response components must rely in a plant's  capacity to reprogram gene expression. Among the mechanisms  involved in immune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the  importance of chromatin remodeling and covalent histone  modifications is emerging [19]. Jaskiewicz et al. [20], reported  that during primed BTH immunity, increased acetylation of  histone H3 at Lys-9 (H3K9ac) and trimethylation of histone H3 at  Lys-4 (H3K4me3) was detected at promoter regions of several SA-  responsive genes encoding transcription factors (i.e. WRKY6,  WRKY29, and WRKY52). Similarly, constitutively increased  H3K4me3 and H3K9ac mark setting in chromatin of the SA-  dependent PR1 gene was initially reported in sni1 (suppressor of nrp1-  1, inducible 1) mutant [21]. The settling of these histone  modifications lead chromatin into a suitable state for efficient  SA-responsive gene induction when needed. The results also  indicated a causal link between priming and chromatin remod-  eling, pointing to a histone memory for information storage in the  plant stress responses [19]. On the other hand RNA Polymerase V  is an enzyme critical in the epigenetic RNA-directed DNA  methylation (RdDM) pathway and is involved in regulating both  DNA methylation and histone modifications [22]. In this context,  Lo\u0301pez et al. [23] reported that RNA Polymerase V defective  mutants carry a constitutive priming phenotype where SA-related  defense genes are poised for enhanced activation via similar  H3K4me3 and H3K9ac histone modifications in their promoters.  These results emphasized the importance of epigenetic control as  an additional layer of complexity in plant immunity and IR  regulation [23]. Furthermore, DNA methylation has been  implicated in the transmission of a priming state or stress memory,  endowing progeny of pathogen-inoculated plants with heightened  resistance (transgenerational IR), suggesting plants can inherit  priming sensitization [24,25].  In the present study, we report on identification and charac-  terization of the inducible Arabidopsis subtilase SBT3.3 to  characterize additional cellular components mediating initiation  and or/maintenance of primed immunity. This extracellular  proteolytic enzyme serves a signaling role in establishing immune  priming. The mechanism subsequently activates chromatin  remodeling and defense genes become poised for enhanced  activation following pathogen attack. Our study provides strong  evidence that SBT3.3 is a primary switch in immune priming, and  it may represent one of the missing components in systemic IR  establishment.  Results  The Arabidopsis subtilase gene SBT3.3 is up-regulated in the csb3 mutant  The Arabidopsis enhanced disease resistance csb3 (constitutive  subtilisin3) mutant [26] was isolated during a search for negative  disease resistance regulators in a mutant screening that evaluated  constitutive expression of GUS activity driven by the 59 promoter  region of a pathogen-induced subtilase gene (P69C) from tomato  plants [27]. Arabidopsis possess fifty-six highly similar genes  encoding subtilases [28], therefore constitutive expression of the  Arabidopsis gene homologous to P69C would be similarly up-  regulated in the csb3 mutant. Constitutively expressed genes  differentially expressed in the csb3 mutant with respect to wild-type  plants were identified by microarray analysis of RNA transcripts  using ATH1 Affymetrix chips. The microarray analysis (NCBI  GEO Series number GSE35507) identified one hundred down-  regulated genes and 367 up-regulated genes in the csb3 mutant  (Supplemental Table S1 and Figure S1). Among the genes up-  regulated $2-fold (p values,0.05) in the csb3 mutant, we  identified 23 genes that could be linked to disease resistance and  SA-mediated responses based on published results (Supplemental  Table S2). It was notable that among them one encoded a  subtilase: SBT3.3 (At1g32960). Moreover, public microarray data  mining showed that SBT3.3, out of the 56 paralogous subtilases  from Arabidopsis, with the exception of At1g32940, is the one  showing strongest response to pathogen attack and to pathogen-  related stress signals (Supplementary Figure S2).  Coincident with what has been described in the tomato  genome, where the P69C subtilase clusters with three additional  P69C-like ORFs (i.e. P69A, P69D, P69C, and P69B) [29], the  SBT3.3 subtilase gene was similarly embedded in a genomic  cluster encompassing three additional subtilases (i.e. SBT3.5,  Author Summary  Following a first encounter with a pathogen, higher eukaryotes develop enhanced resistance to subsequent infections by a broad spectrum of pathogens. This type of induced resistance (IR) exhibits memory characteristics after the first encounter with a pathogen \u2014training effect\u2014 and appears evolutionarily conserved. IR response components must reside in a plant's capacity to reprogram gene expression. Among the mechanisms involved in immune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the im- portance of chromatin remodelling is emerging. Recent studies indicated a causal link between priming and chromatin remodelling, pointing to a histone memory for information storage in the plant immune response. These results emphasized the importance of epigenetic control as an additional layer of complexity in plant immunity. However, the nature of the components for activating this type of immunological memory remains elusive. Here, in a search aiming to identify cellular factors integral in regulating immunity in Arabidopsis, we found that the SBT3.3 gene, encoding an extracellular subtilase enzyme, is pivotal for establishing plant immune priming. Moreover, based on molecular and genetic evidences, our results indicate that SBT3.3 expression is under epigenetic control thus highlighting the importance of this mechanism of gene regulation in the control of plant immunity and IR.  SBT3.3 and Immune Priming  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445    SBT3.4, SBT3.3 and SBT3.2) in Chromosome 1 (Fig. 1A). Thus, it  seems very likely that the Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase, could  represent the evolutionarily conserved ortholog of the P69C  subtilase from tomato, and the promoter activation was the clue  for identifying the csb3 mutant.  The SBT3.3 gene encodes a 777 amino acid preproenzyme  (Fig. 1B and Supplemental Figure S3) containing a N-terminal 25  amino acid signal peptide followed by an 86-amino acid  propolypeptide (aa 26 to 111), and a 666-amino acid mature  polypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 71237 Da. The  mature polypeptide comprises eight potential asparagine-linked  glycosylation sites (NXS/T). On the basis of sequence similarities  with other subtilases, including P69C [30], the amino acid residues  Ser-555, Asp-145, and His-223 were identified as residues of the  catalytic triad (Fig. 1B).  Expression pattern of SBT3.3 following pathogen inoculation  To mode of SBT3.3 gene regulation in plant immunity was  assessed by inoculating Col-0 leaves with the bacterial pathogen  Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PsDC3000), carrying or not the  avirulence gene AvrRpm1, and temporal gene expression patterns  were determined by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). SBT3.3  was barely detectable in mock-inoculated plants, but strongly  induced during the PsDC3000 immune response (Fig. 1C).  However, inconsistent with observations for SA-regulated  marker genes (i.e. PR-1 and PR-2), SBT3.3 induction was  transient, peaking at 48 hpi (hours post inoculation) and  abruptly decaying thereafter. The strongest induction was  observed following inoculation with the avirulent strain  PsDC3000 (AvrRpm1) (Figure 1C); induction was again transient,  peaking at 12 h.p.i, and decayed thereafter. SBT3.3 expression  preceded PR-1 and PR-2 gene induction, suggesting that the  signals that set in motion transcriptional reprogramming of  these two types of gene responses might differ. Expression of PR-  1 and PR-2 genes in the distal non-inoculated leaves was also  observed for SBT3.3, although distal expression was not as high  as that attained in local leaves (Fig. 1C). High and rapid (within  an hour) induced SBT3.3 expression was also promoted by  bacterial PAMP flg22 application to Col-0 plants (Supplemental  Fig. S4), providing additional support for the association  of SBT3.3 expression with early innate immune response  activation.  SBT3.3 functions in disease resistance The importance of SBT3.3 in plant immunity was investi-  gated by characterizing the response of two independent T-  DNA insertion lines for SBT3.3 (sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2; Fig. 1A)  to PsDC3000 infection (Fig. 2A). We also characterized the  response of two independent T-DNA lines available for one of  the linked subtilase genes (i.e. SBT3.4) within the same genomic  cluster (sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2; Fig. 1A). The enhanced disease  susceptibility mutant npr1-1 was incorporated into the experi-  ments as a control. Disease performance was assayed by  measuring bacterial growth in the inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A).  The two control mutant lines, sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2 behaved as  inoculated Col-0 plants, indicating that SBT3.4 is not essential  to activate immune responses. However, npr1 plants, and either  one of the two sbt3.3 mutants, supported significant increases in  bacterial growth. The enhanced disease susceptibility was  accompanied by development of disease symptoms in the form  of visible chlorotic lesions on inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A). The  results suggest that SBT3.3 positively regulates disease resistance  to PsDC3000.  Changes in the susceptibility of sbt3.3 plants to biotrophic  pathogens were further investigated by inoculating plants with a  virulent strain of the obligate oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidop-  sidis (isolate Noco) (Fig. 2B). Disease severity was assessed at  7 d.p.i in lactophenol trypan-blue-stained leaves. The leaves were  Figure 1.

Both, sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-  2 mutant plants exhibited a significantly higher degree of  colonization by the oomycete than the control Col-0 plants  (Fig. 2B), becoming heavily covered with sporangiophores, which  elicited appearance of chlorosis and eventual leaf collapse  (namely Class V). The observed enhanced disease susceptibility  of sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2 plants to H. arabidopsidis was corroborated  by directly counting of spore production in inoculated plants  (Supplemental Fig. S5). These results confirmed that loss of  SBT3.3 function also enhanced plant susceptibility to H.  arabidopsisdis, further substantiating its value in establishing an  effective plant immune response.  SBT3.3 is required for expression of SA-responsive genes Compromised expression of SA-responsive genes is observed in  mutants defective in resistance to biotrophic pathogens (i.e. npr1;  [31]). Consequently, we considered the possibility that the  increased susceptibility towards pathogens observed in SBT3.3  defective mutants might be similarly accompanied by a compro-  mised expression of SA-responsive genes. Therefore, induction of  PR-1 accumulation was examined by Western blot in sbt3.3, npr1,  and Col-0 plants following inoculation with PsDC3000. The PR-1  protein, as expected, was nearly absent in npr1 plants, even at  48 hpi with PsDC3000 (Fig. 2C), while PR-1 accumulation was  notable in Col-0 following inoculation. Interestingly, sbt3.3-1 and  sbt3.3-2 plants exhibited results similar to the npr1 mutant, showing  Figure 2.

These results were confirmed at  the transcriptional level by measuring PR-1 transcript level by RT-  qPCR (Fig. 2D). As for NPR1 being required for full immunity,  our results suggest that SBT3.3 is required for full expression of  downstream SA-responsive genes. This helps explaining why  mutants defective in SBT3.3 are compromised in disease  resistance (Figure 2A and B).  SBT3.3 expression is SA-independent and responds to H2O2  The same mRNA preparations shown in Figure 2D were used  to quantify SBT3.3 transcript accumulation following inoculation  with PsDC3000 in Col-0 and npr1 plants (Fig. 2E). RNA  preparations from sbt3.3 plants (here used as a control) served to  demonstrate that in the mutant induced SBT3.3 expression was  drastically down-regulated due to the T-DNA insertion. In marked  contrast with the substantial reduction observed for PR-1  activation (Figure 2D), SBT3.3 expression in npr1 plants was  identical to that attained in Col-0 plants. Furthermore, in sid2-1  mutant plants (defective in SA synthesis) induction of SBT3.3  expression upon inoculation with PsDC3000(AvrRpm1), remained  unchanged with respect to Col-0 plants (Fig. 3A). This differs with  the compromised expression of PR-1 occurring in sid2 plants  (Fig. 3A). These contrasting differences indicated that for  pathogen-induced SBT3.3 expression, SA synthesis and its  perception through NPR1 are dispensable.  Since oxidative burst and concurrent H2O2 accumulation  preceded SA build-up during basal immunity activation [32]  and SBT3.3 induction appeared as an early event preceding PR  gene induction by SA (Fig. 1C-D), we hypothesized that H2O2 could mediate SBT3.3 induction. In fact, spraying Arabidopsis  leaves with a 1 mM solution of H2O2 elicited a rapid SBT3.3  induction which was notable at 1 to 3 hours after treatment  (Fig. 3B). Similarly, expression of the OXI1 gene, which encodes a  kinase highly induced under oxidative stress conditions [33] was  triggered by H2O2 (Fig. 3B). However, under similar inductive  conditions expression of the SA-regulated gene PR-1 remained  unchanged (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the cat2 mutant defective in the  dismutation of H2O2 and exhibiting enhanced H2O2 accumula-  tion, revealed increased SBT3.3 expression compared to Col-0  (Fig. 3C). These observations indicated that SBT3.3 activation  might result from early H2O2 production during the immune  response.  SBT3.3 is secreted and accumulates extracellularly Plant subtilases are synthesized in the form of preproprotein  precursors, translocated via a signal peptide into the endomem-  brane system, and activated through further cleavage of the  propeptide [34]. Most plant subtilases are considered glycopro-  teins that predominantly accumulate extracellularly [30,34,35].  SBT3.3 subcellular localization was determined by fusing mono-  meric cherry fluorescent protein (mCherry) to the C-terminus of  the full length SBT3.3, and the construct, driven by 35S promoter,  expressed in Nicotiana benthaminana leaves using agro-infiltration.  Localization of the fusion protein was confirmed by confocal  microscopy. Results showed that SBT3.3-mCherry fluorescence  was uniformly distributed in the pericellular apoplastic space  (Fig. 4A). Similar pericellular localization was observed in  transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a 35S::SBT3.3-GFP gene  construct (Supplemental Fig. S6). The mCherry-tagged subtilase  was co-expressed with either a construct bearing the plasma  membrane integral protein PIP1 fused to YFP, or alternatively  with a free cytosolic YFP protein to more precisely define its  localization. SBT3.3-mCherry was localized externally to the  cytoplasm, as revealed when co-expressed with a free cytosolic  YFP (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, SBT3.3-mCherry was found to be  sandwiched between the PIP1-YFP-tagged plasma membrane  marker of adjacent cells (Fig. 4B) and thus unambiguously  localized to the extracellular matrix. SBT3.3 extracellular local-  ization was also confirmed upon expression of a SBT3.3-GFP  protein fusion in the presence of FM4-64, a plasma membrane  specific fluorescent dye (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, expression of an  SBT3.3noSP-GFP gene construct in which the N-terminal 25  amino acid signal peptide of SBT3.3 has been deleted, revealed  that the SBT3.3noSP-GFP protein fusion was not secreted to the  extracellular matrix and was retained in the cytoplasm, as  delineated by the co-localization with FM4-64 (Fig. 4D). These  results indicate that SBT3.3 is secreted and accumulated in the  plant extracellular matrix, and secretion depends on the presence  of its signal peptide.  Figure 3.

[36] demonstrated that following agro-  infiltration with a GFP-tagged phytaspase, an Arabidopsis cell  death-associated subtilase of similar size to SBT3.3; two proteins of  ,110 and ,120 kD corresponding to the mature and the pro- protein phytaspases, respectively, accumulated in crude extracts  [34]. Following expression of SBT3.3-GFP, two similar protein  bands of ,110 and ,120 kD were detected in Western blots using an anti-GFP antibody (upper panel; Fig. 4E). The difference  between the theoretical mature 98,2 kD SBT3.3-GFP fusion and  the observed mature 110 kD proteins must be due to posttrans-  lational modifications. In fact, glycosylation was early proposed to  regulate activity of plant subtilases [37,38]. We performed  Western blots of the same leaf extracts and developed the  nitrocellulose filters with Concanavalin A (Con A) coupled to  horseradish peroxidase to identify if SBT3.3 is glycosylated. These  analyses revealed that Con A recognized the 120/110 kD doublet  (Fig. 4E) in extracts expressing the SBT3.3-GFP construct, thus  confirming that SBT3.3 is glycosylated. Interestingly, Con A also  recognized a band of ,70 kD that only accumulated following SBT3.3-GFP expression (Figure 4E). This ,70 kD band was reminiscent of a glycosylated 69 kD P69 subtilase conserved in the  Solanaceous species [27,30]. To verify this possibility, Western  blots were developed with anti-P69C antibodies [30]. Results  revealed that the ,70 kD Con-A reacting band was recognized by anti-P69 antibodies (Fig. 4E) indicating that SBT3.3-GFP signaled  tobacco cells to activate expression of an endogenous P69 subtilase  homologue. Interestingly, when we extended this analysis to other  defense-related proteins, i.e. by using antibodies against the PR-1a  isoform from tobacco, we observed that overexpression of SBT3.3-  GFP similarly triggered SA-responsive PR-1a protein accumula-  tion (lower panel; Fig. 4E). We subsequently created a missense  mutant in the SBT3.3-GFP \u2018\u2018catalytic triad'' (S555A; SBT3.3m-  Figure 4.

Expression of the missense  mutant in N. benthamiana no longer promoted local accumulation  of the corresponding endogenous P69 subtilase, or the PR-1a  protein (Supplemental Figure S7). All of these observations are  consistent with a model in which Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase  local expression autonomously triggers immune-like responses in a  heterologous system, and the serine proteolytic activity of the  subtilase is necessary for this effect. As occurs in SBT3.3OEX1  plants (see below), expression of the SBT3.3-GFP gene construct in  transgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred enhanced disease resis-  tance to PsDC3000 and is in contrast with the lack of effect  observed for the SBT3.3m-GFP construct (Supplemental Figure  S8). Moreover, the same SBT3.3-GFP gene construct is able to  abrogate the characteristic enhanced disease susceptibility pheno-  type of sbt3.3 plants, conferring enhanced disease resistance to  PsDC3000 to the stably transformed sbt3.3 mutant plants  (Supplemental Figure S9). This further indicates functionality of  SBT3.3-GFP fusion protein in promoting immune responses in  Arabidopsis.  SBT3.3 artificial expression in transgenic Arabidopsis triggers expression of the endogenous gene  The above observations indicated that SBT3.3 promotes the  expression and accumulation of a homologous subtilase (i.e. P69)  in N. benthamiana. We studied a stable transgenic Arabidopsis  line constitutively expressing SBT3.3 under the control of the 35S  promoter (SBT3.3OEX) by measuring activation on the corre-  sponding endogenous SBT3.3 gene to test if the same phenom-  enon could be reproduced in Arabidopsis. Antibodies against  SBT3.3 were not available; therefore we instead performed RT-  qPCR measurements using 2 different pairs of oligonucleotides.  One of those pairs discriminates between the endogenous SBT3.3  mRNAs (endoSBT3.3), transcribed from its own gene, and the other  pair was designed to measure the whole amount of SBT3.3  mRNAs (SBT3.3). In Col-0 plants, as expected, both SBT3.3 and  endoSBT3.3 transcript expression was very low (Fig. 4F). In  contrast, in the transgenic SBT3.3OEX line, SBT3.3 transcript  accumulation was prominent (Fig. 4F), and importantly, this was  also followed by a high endoSBT3.3 transcript accumulation. This  effect gives support to the hypothesis that SBT3.3 expression is  able per se to signal its own gene activation. This induction appears  \u2018\u2018self'' controlled, since endogenous PR-1 transcript levels in  transgenic plants do not exhibit significant variation with respect  to Col-0 plants (Fig. 4F). However, in agro-infiltrated tobacco  leaves we observed that SBT3.3-GFP expression promotes  accumulation of both the endogenous P69 subtilase homolog,  and the SA-dependent PR-1a protein. This difference can only be  explained by noting that in the experiments with N. benthamiana, A.  tumefaciens is inevitably present, which in turn may supply PAMPs  in collaboration with SBT3.3, triggering a downstream SA  signaling pathway, and in turn SA-defense related gene activation.  If this mechanism operated effectively, then SBT3.3 would be  required to facilitate early immune signaling preceding defense  response activation.  SBT3.3 overexpression confers enhanced disease resistance to PsDC3000 and H. arabidopsidis  Two independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines that overex-  press SBT3.3 were inoculated with PsDC3000 and disease  response recorded to further assess the role of SBT3.3 subtilase  in plant immunity (i.e. SBT3.3OEX1 and SBT3.3OEX2). The  enhanced disease resistance line overexpressing the NPR1  regulator (NPR1-H, [39]), one of the SBT3.3 defective mutants  (i.e. sbt3.3-1), and Col-0 were included in this experiment for  comparison. Figure 5A shows that the two SBT3.3OEX lines  exhibited significant enhanced disease resistance responses to  PsDC3000 compared to Col-0. This enhanced resistance was of  a magnitude similar to that attained by NPR1-H plants. In  contrast, the sbt3.3-1 mutant reproduced the expected increased  disease susceptibility previously shown in Figure 2.  The SBT3.3 overexpressing lines exhibited an enhanced disease  resistance phenotype when exposed to H. arabidopsidis (Fig. 5B).  The two lines overexpressing SBT3.3 exhibited a significantly  lower colonization of the oomycete than the control Col-0 plants  or the highly susceptible sbt3.3-1 mutant (Fig. 5B). The observed  enhanced disease resistance of sbt3.3-1 to H. arabidopsidis was  corroborated by directly counting of spore production in  inoculated plants (Supplemental Fig. S5). The observed height-  ened resistance against these two pathogens indicated that SBT3.3  functions as a positive plant immunity regulator. Furthermore,  when the SBT3.3 overexpression phenotype was assayed in an nrp1  or sid2 mutant background, the enhanced disease resistance to  PsDC3000 was abrogated (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that  SBT3.3, as a positive plant immunity regulator, operates upstream  of the SA pathway.  SBT3.3 expression confers enhanced activation of MPK kinases  Elevated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation  is genuinely linked to IR development [12], and in general to  innate immune responses [40,41,42]. Therefore, our next objec-  tive was to demonstrate if the enhanced resistance phenotype  mediated by the sole SBT3.3 subtilase expression could elicit  elevated MPKs activation. We subsequently employed an  antibody recognizing the phosphorylated residues within the  MAPK activation loop (the so called pTEpY motif, where p  denotes the phosphorylated residue). Western blot analysis of  protein extracts derived from healthy Col-0 plants or from two  SBT3.3OEX lines revealed positive immunoreactive signals in two  polypeptides corresponding to MPK6 and MPK3 [42]. Following  densitometric scanning of Western blots, the two immunoreactive  bands appeared moderately more intense in the overexpression  lines relative to Col-0 control lines (Fig. 5D-E). Inoculation with  PsDC3000 promoted a further activation-associated dual TEY  phosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6, which was higher in the  two SBT3.3OEX lines than in Col-0 plants (Fig. 5D-E). In  addition, MPK4/MPK11, which migrated as a single band on  SDS-PAGE [42], became activated only following bacterial  inoculation, and activation was again more intense in the two  SBT3.3OEX lines. Therefore, dual phosphorylation of the TEY  amino acid motif within the MPK activation loop, which is  required for kinase activity appeared increased in plants expressing  SBT3.3. However, despite these differences at the protein level, no  significant differences were detected with respect to transcript  accumulation induction for these MPKs between Col-0 and  SBT3.3OEX lines (Fig. 5F).  OXI1 is a serine/threonine kinase of the AGC protein kinase  family required for oxidative burst-mediated signaling in Arabi-  dopsis; its expression was consistent with that of SBT3.3, and was  induced by H2O2 ([33]; and Fig. 3B). OXI1 was required for  MPK3 and MPK6 activation and for basal resistance to H.  arabidopsidis [33]. In view of these observations, we hypothesized  that the imposed SBT3.3 expression might sensitize cells to bring  earlier or higher OXI1 expression levels following pathogen  infection, and in turn provide an explanation for the higher  activation observed in MPKs. We measured OXI1 comparative  SBT3.3 and Immune Priming  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 8 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445    transcript level between Col-0 and two SBT3.3OEX lines following  PsDC3000 infection by RT-qPCR. Results indicated the two  SBT3.3OEX lines expressed OXI1 to higher levels than Col-0  (Fig. 5G). This offers a viable explanation as to why MPKs  exhibited increased activation in SBT3.3OEX plants following  pathogen attack, even in the absence of differential gene  expression relative to Col-0. Moreover, in sbt3.3 mutant lines  MPKs activation following inoculation with PsDC3000 was  drastically reduced in comparison to Col-0 (Figure 5H). This  observation reinforces the consideration that SBT3.3 appears to  function as a positive regulator of the pathway leading to  activation of MAP kinases. Interestingly, MPKs activation was  not altered in the enhanced disease susceptibility nrp1 mutant  (Figure 5H) and neither was the expression of the SBT3.3 gene  altered in this same mutant (Figure 3F). This served as a control  towards the specific requirement of SBT3.3 for MAKs activation  and suggest that this specific signal module operates upstream of  the NPR1 regulator.  SA-mediated defense genes are poised for enhanced activation in plants overexpressing SBT3.3  The above results prompted us to search if SA-dependent genes  were poised for increase activation following SBT3.3 expression.  Therefore, we inoculated Col-0 plants, and one SBT3.3OEX line  with PsDC3000, and compared PR-1 expression patterns.  Interestingly, after pathogen inoculation induction of PR-1 gene  expression showed a notorious enhancement in SBT3.3OEX plants  when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the genes encoding  the transcription factors WRKY6, WRKY53, and WRKY35,  mediating transcriptional regulation of SA-related genes, including  PR-1 [43], themselves induced by pathogen infection [44], showed  similar enhanced induced expression in SBT3.3OEX plants  (Fig. 6A). Thus, SBT3.3 mediated poising of defense genes for  enhanced activation following perception of a pathogenic cue,  invoking a role for SBT3.3 in priming immune responses.  Poising SA-related genes and primed immunity concur in  plants defective in the RdDM pathway, such as mutants affected in  different subunits of the RNA Pol V (i.e. nrpd2) [23], and also  following pharmacological treatment with the priming agent BTH  [20]. In both cases, chromatin histone activation marks appeared  enriched in SA-related gene promoters. Consequently, we  hypothesized that following expression of SBT3.3 SA-related  defense genes could be poised for enhanced activation by  differential histone modification. By using chromatin immunopre-  cipitation (ChIP), we analyzed H3 Lys4 trimethylation  (H3K4me3) and H3 Lys9 acetylation (H3K9ac) on the PR-1,  WRKY6 and WRKY53 gene promoter region in both Col-0 plants  and SBT3.3OEX plants. The enhanced disease resistant mutant  nrpd2, defective in RNA PolV activity and compromised in the  RdDM pathway [23], was included as a control. On the PR-1  promoter, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks increased  more than two and three-fold, respectively in SBT3.3 overex-  pressing plants when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6B). The two  activation marks were similarly increased in nrpd2 plants, with only  some differences in intensity (Fig. 6B). As for PR-1, the histone  marks also showed increases in the WRKY6 and WRKY53  promoters in SBT3.3 overexpressing plants, and to a lesser extent  in nrpd2 plants, relative to Col-0 plants (Fig. 6B). Therefore,  chromatin marks normally associated with active genes abound in  the promoter regions of SA-related genes in SBT3.3 overexpress-  ing plants, although gene activation does not occur in these plants.  The marks appear to serve as an on-switch for priming, and helps  explain why the same genes show enhanced induction in  SBT3.3OEX plants upon pathogenic attack (Fig. 6A).  SBT3.3 expression increases H3K4me3 activation marks in its own promoter  Results showed the sole expression of SBT3.3 in transgenic  Arabidopsis plants was able to promote activation of the  endogenous gene (Figure 4F). Therefore, SBT3.3 per se might  be signaling chromatin remodeling of its own promoter as it  does for the PR-1 gene promoter (Fig. 6B). ChIP for H3K4me3  and H3K9ac marks at the SBT3.3 promoter region in SBT3.3  overexpressing plants revealed that the H3K4me3 mark was  notably increased compared to Col-0 plants, and moreover, the  enhancement in H3K4me3 marks was mirrored in nrpd2 plants  (Fig. 7A). However, H3K9ac marks in the SBT3.3 gene  promoter did not increase in the SBT3.3 overexpressing plants  and the nrpd2 mutant when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 7A). These  results contrasted with the common increase of both activation  marks in the PR-1 gene (Fig. 6B), and suggested the existence of  specific histone codes regulating gene expression. Alternatively,  because the increase in H3K4me3 activation marks observed in  the SBT3.3 gene promoter between nrpd2 and SBT3.3OEX  plants were matched, we reasoned that nrpd2 plants might also  carry constitutive SBT3.3 gene expression. SBT3.3 transcript  level determination by RT-qPCR in Col-0 and nrpd2 plants  showed the mutant constitutively expressing SBT3.3 (Fig. 7B).  These results suggest that SBT3.3 expression is under negative  epigenetic control, and expression is relieved following inhibi-  tion of RdDM. In fact, treatment of Col-0 seedlings with  sulfamethazine (SMZ), a chemical suppressor of epigenetic gene  silencing (i.e. RdDM) that derepress silenced genes [45],  relieved SBT3.3 and promoted transcript accumulation  (Fig. 7C), to levels similar to those attained in nrpd2 plants.  These observations therefore support the contention of an  epigenetic control towards SBT3.3, and indicate that SBT3.3  acts as a positive regulator of a priming phenomenon for more  efficient deployment of immune responses. In addition, a low  concentration (100 mM) pharmacological treatment with of the priming agent BTH administered to Col-0 plants promoted the  enhanced deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks in the  PR-1 gene promoter, and to a minor extent also in WRKY6 and  WRKY53 gene promoters (Fig. 7D), as was observed in previous  studies [20,23]. Similarly, BTH also induced H3K4me3  activation marks, and to a less extent also of H3K9ac marks,  in the SBT3.3 gene promoter in Col-0 plants. Thus, as a priming  agent, BTH not only induced chromatin remodeling of SA-  related genes similar to the RdDM-defective and enhanced  resistance mutant nrpd2; it also mimicked SBT3.3 chromatin  remodeling triggered by the SBT3.3 itself.  The importance of SBT3.3 in mediating activation of  chromatin remodeling during priming induction was further  evaluated in SBT3.3 defective plants. Figure 7D, F and G show  that BTH-mediated increases of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac  activation marks in the PR-1, WRKY6 and WRKY53 gene  promoters was partially impeded in sbt3.3 plant when  compared to Col-0 plants. For the SBT3.3 gene promoter  (Fig. 7E), the reduction in histone activation marks following  BTH treatment of sbt3.3 plants was most dramatic. This severe  reduction was most notorious in the case of H3K4me3  activation marks for which a full inhibition was observed in  BTH-treated sbt3.3 plants when compared to BTH-treated Col-  0 plants (Figure 7D). All the above observations therefore imply  that the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase is an integral component  mediating establishment of primed immunity, and moreover, it  appears to be targeted for negative epigenetic control of this  same mechanism.  SBT3.3 and Immune Priming  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445    Discussion  Priming, an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon where cells  respond to much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more  rapid and robust manner, is an important component of the  various forms of IR described in mammals [8-10], plants [6,18]  and invertebrates [11]. Despite the importance of priming, the  signal component(s) mediating this sensitized state remain elusive.  The sensitized state is in part explained by presumably dormant or  silent component characters, which accumulate during priming,  and are required only after pathogenic challenge [18]. In this  respect, pre-stress deposition of two MPK family members of  signaling enzymes, MPK3 and MPK6, has been described to play  an important role for priming in Arabidopsis [12]. However, it  remains undetermined whether or not activation of additional  factors operating upstream of the two MPKs is required to  establish priming.  Reverse genetic analysis was applied to identify the Arabidospsis  SBT3.3 gene, encoding a serine protease of the subtilisin clan,  which is pivotal in control of a priming mechanism that leads to  sensitization for activation of SA-dependent defense responses and  IR. SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants  elicited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. However, this  enhanced resistance was not preceded by a high constitutive  expression of SA-responsive genes as occurs in different disease  resistant mutants, which in general carry associated dwarfism, such  as in cpr1, edr1 or csb3 [26, and references therein] to mention a  few. Instead, the SBT3.3-mediated resistance can be explained by  accelerated and heightened activation of SA-responsive genes,  only elicited by pathogen inoculation, therefore mimicking a wild  type plant activated for priming. This phenotype is blocked in a  sid2 mutant background, which lacks SA, and is also blocked in the  npr1 mutant affected in signaling downstream of SA. SBT3.3 thus  functions as a positive regulator of innate immunity operating  upstream of the SA pathway. Consistent with the gain-of-function  phenotype, SBT3.3 suppression impairs induction of SA-respon-  sive genes and causes enhanced susceptibility to infection by  pathogens.  Interestingly, SBT3.3 expression is rapidly demanded during  activation of innate immunity preceding the activation of SA-  responsive genes. However, in contrast to PR genes, SBT3.3  expression does not require the SA pathway through the NPR1  regulator. Moreover, SBT3.3 activation responds very rapidly to  H2O2, a common ROS species generated very early during PAMP  recognition by PRR leading to activation of innate immune  responses. Consistent with other early induced and SA-indepen-  dent genes [46], H2O2 might be the first signal for early  transcriptional reprogramming of SBT3.3. Congruently, Daudi et  al. [47] showed that knocking down the Arabidopsis cell wall  peroxidases PRX33/PRX34, required for apoplastic H2O2 generation during innate immune responses, leads to changes in  the cell wall proteome with depletion of various PAMP-elicited  Figure 6.

Localized  SBT3.3 expression in the heterologous N. benthamiana system led to  expression of the endogenous P69 homologue. Similarly, its stable  expression in transgenic plants also led to activation of the  endogenous SBT3.3 gene by what appears to be a self-induction  mechanism, which adds further novelty to the SBT3.3 activation  mode. We hypothesize that to a subsequent initial activation by a  pathogen, the expressed SBT3.3 subtilase could initiate a signaling  process, which would lead to its own expression, at least to a  certain threshold level, as if forming a regulatory positive feedback  loop circuit. Maintenance of this expression threshold level should  be sufficient to keep cells in a sustained sensitized mode. The  autonomous and sustained SBT3.3 expression pattern should  consequently be the basis to explain the memory-based charac-  teristics of priming and IR, manifested only secondarily in hosts  after a primary infection. Thus, SBT3.3 appears key in regulating  this type of training effect leading to IR. Interestingly, MPK3 and  MPK6 activation, and to a lesser extend also MPK4/MPK11,  were enhanced in SBT3.3OEX plants following infection with  PsDC3000, and conversely, this activation was compromised in  sbt3.3 plants. These results are congruent with increased OXI1  expression in SBT3.3OEX plants, a kinase required for MPK3 and  MPK6 activation [33], and indicates that following SBT3.3  expression, plants respond faster to pathogenic stimuli. Because  the MPK3 and MPK6 activation is critical for priming [12], and  activation requires OXI1 expression [33], our data suggest  SBT3.3 positively modulates immune responses upstream of the  MAPK kinase pathway, and confirms that accumulation of  defense signaling components, such as SBT3.3 itself, prior to a  secondary pathogen challenge is essential for priming and induced  resistance.  Similarly, the observation that sole SBT3.3 expression poises  SA-responsive defense genes for enhanced activation following  perception of a pathogenic cue provides further support to SBT3.3  as an integral component in mounting primed immunity. ChIP  assays revealed this poising effect for enhanced gene expression  triggered by SBT3.3 was mediated by selective increases of histone  activation marks on the promoter region of SA-responsive genes.  Since similar histone activation marks have been found to appear  in SA-related genes when wild type plants are treated with the  priming agent BTH [20], our data therefore strongly support a  model where SBT3.3 positively mediates OXI1-mediated MPK  activation, and concurrent chromatin remodeling at SA-respon-  sive genes as specific hallmarks for primed immunity. Further-  more, the observation that immune priming, and similar  chromatin remodeling of SA-responsive genes is mirrored in  plants defective in the RdDM pathway [23] provides support for a  hypothesis that the observed SBT3.3-mediated priming mecha-  nism might be under similar epigenetic control. Moreover, the fact  that SBT3.3 gene expression is constitutively up in the nrpd2  mutant favors this interpretation. Furthermore, (1) the observation  that histone activation marks are established in the promoter of the  SBT3.3 gene and in the promoters of SA-dependent genes by  individual SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic plants; (2) the  reproducibility of similar chromatin remodeling of the SBT3.3  gene promoter in nrpd2 plants; (3) its similar remodeling in Col-0  plants following BTH treatment; (4) and the observation that such  chromatin remodeling is strongly abrogated in sbt3.3 plants,  further substantiates the importance of SBT3.3 gene activation as  a prerequisite for establishment of immune priming.

One  simple explanation is via SBT3.3-mediated protein substrate  processing that co-localizes extracellularly. This substrate could  exist in a soluble form, or be an extracellular domain (ectodomain)  of a larger protein, likely functioning as a receptor located in the  plasma membrane. After proteolytic shedding of the ectodomain  by SBT3.3, the receptor could become activated and initiate a  down stream immune signaling process. This mechanism has been  identified as common in activating a variety of signaling processes  in animal through the involvement of protease-activated receptors  (PARs), a group of receptors mediating different cellular processes  including proinflammatory responses, and is also a common  principle in various diseases [49]. Moreover, the proteolytic  processing mechanism of an extracellular substrate is reminiscent  of that mediating activation of innate immunity in invertebrates  through the transmembrane Toll receptor, or Toll-like receptors  (TLRs) in humans; PRR-type receptors consisting of a leucine-rich  repeat (LRR) ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a  cytosolic signaling domain [Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)], which  becomes activated only after the binding of a proteolytically  processed peptide ligand (i.e. spa\u0308tzle) by complex cascades of  CLIP-domain serine proteases [50] or less common following  specific cleavage of the receptor ectodomain by extracellular  proteases [51,52]. Alternatively, SBT3.3 processes the extracellu-  lar substrate and the cleaved polypeptide can be released and  function as a ligand recognized by a nearby specific extracellular  receptor, which in turn can initiate a downstream signaling.  Tornero et al., [30] reported SBT3.3 homologous P69C subtilase  can specifically process LRP in disease tomato plants, an  extracellular LRR-containing protein of unknown function, and  the first subtilase substrate identified in plants. This suggesting  SBT3.3 could similarly be involved in the cleavage and activation  of LRR-containing proteins, including PRR-type receptors, which  in turn may activate innate immune responses. The recent finding  that the lectin receptor kinase (LecRK)-VI.2, a member of the  LRR-containing superfamily of RLKs proteins existing in  Arabidopsis, is required for immune priming acting upstream of  MPK-mediated signaling [53] can give further support to this  hypothesis.  The results of the present study identified SBT3.3 as a  determinant host factor mediating activation of primed immune  responses. Our immediate future challenge is to identify the target  substrate processed by this subtilase and elucidate the mechanism  transducing the substrate into a signal for immune prime  activation.  Materials and Methods  Plants growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in  a growth chamber (19-23uC, 85% relative humidity, 100 mEm  22 sec  21 fluorescent illumination) on a 10-hr-light and  14-hr-dark cycle. All mutants are in Col-0 background; nrpd2-2,  npr1-1 and sid2-1 plants were previously described [23,26,54].  sbt3.3-1, sbt3.3-2, sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2 mutants and SBT3.3OEX1  and SBT3.3OEX2 overexpression lines were obtained from the  Plant Subtilase Database Consortium (PSDB) (http://csbdb.  mpimp-golm.mpg.de/csbdb/dbcawp/psdb.html).  Gene constructs and transgenic lines For the SBT3.3-GFP overexpressing construct, a full length  cDNA for SBT3.3 was amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA  polymerase (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) and specific primers  including Gateway adapters: BP SBT3.3 FW and BP SBT3.3 RV  and recombined into pDONR207 using BP ClonaseMixII kit  (Invitrogen). For the SBT3.3m-GFP construct,  pDONR207+SBT3.3 vector was amplified using Phusion Hot Start II polymerase (Thermo Scientific) with SBT3.3m FW and  SBT3.3m RV phosphorylated primers including a T 663  to G 663  mutation. The PCR product was then digested with DpnI  restriction enzyme (Fermentas), purified by Zymoclean DNA  Recovery Kit (Zymo Research) and religated using T4 Ligase  (Fermentas). For SBT3.3noSP-GFP construct pDONR207+SBT3.3 vector was amplified with SBT3.3noSP FW and SBT3.3 RV  primers and recombined into pDONR207 as described above.  After sequencing, all constructs were recombined with pB7FWG  destination vector using LR ClonaseMixII kit (Invitrogen) and  introduced into Arabidopsis (Col-0) via Agrobacterium transformation.  The sid2-1 SBT3.3OEX and npr1-1 SBT3.3OEX lines were  generated by the genetic crossing of the sid2-1 and npr1-1 mutants,  respectively, with a 35S:SBT3.3 transgenic line containing a single  insertion of the transgen. The sbt3.3 SBT3.3-GFP and sbt3.3  SBT3.3m-GFP lines were generated by direct genetic transforma-  tion of sbt3.3-1 plants with SBT3.3-GFP and SBT3.3m-GFP gene  constructs, respectively. The selected lines were those expressing  higher levels of the corresponding transgene as determined by RT-  PCR of RNA preparations. For PCR-based detection of the sid2-1  mutant allele the primers used were sid2-1 Fw and sid2-1 Rv GCA  GTC CGA AAG ACG ACC TCG AG and CTA TCG AAT  GAT TCT AGA AGA AGC), followed by Mun I digestion of the  ensuing fragment (the mutant allele sid2-1 cannot be digested). For  PCR-based detection of the npr1-1 mutant allele, the primers used  were npr1-1 Fw and npr1-1 Rv (59-ATGTCTCGAATGTACA-  TAAGGC-39 and 59-CTCAGTTTCCTAATAGAGAGG-39).  Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves Almost fully expanded leaves were infiltrated with a suspension  of Agrobacterium tumefaciens C58 bearing the relevant construct in  10 mM MES pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 150 mM acetosyringone at an OD600 = 0.5. After 3 days, fluorescence was analyzed in  infiltrated leaves by confocal microscopy. For co-infiltration,  Agrobacterium cultures grown separately and processed as indicated  above, were adjusted to an O.D. = 0.5, and mixed prior to  infiltration. Agrobacterium expressing the viral silencing suppres-  sor P19 was included in all infiltrations.  Fluorescence microscopy GFP/YFP fluorescence in inoculated plants was monitored  using Nikon SMZ800, and Leica MZ16F microscopes.  Gene expression analysis Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)  following the manufacturer's recommendations and further  purified by lithium chloride precipitation. For reverse transcrip-  tion, the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit  (Fermentas Life Sciences) was used. Quantitative PCR (qPCR)  amplifications and measurements were performed using an ABI  PRISM 7000 sequence detection system, and SYBR-Green  (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems). ACTIN2 was chosen as the  reference gene. The primers used to amplify the different genes  and DNA regions, and the PCR conditions employed for  genotyping T-DNA insertions, and RT-PCR and qRT-PCR  experiments are provided in the supporting information file Text  S1. RT-qPCR analyses were performed at least three times using  sets of cDNA samples from independent experiments.

Labeling and hybridiza-  tion on the ATH1 microarrays were performed according to the  manufacturer's instructions (www.affymetrix.com/support/  technical/manual/expression_manual.affx). Global analysis of  gene expression was performed by using Affymetrix MAS5.0.  SAM analysis (Significance Analysis of Microarrays software  package) was conducted for A. thaliana triplicate samples between  csb3 plants and control plants using a q value#0.05 and a fold  change cutoff $2 to identify the genes differentially expressed in  the mutant. We searched GO enrichment information for the  differently expressed probe sets using EasyGO (http://  bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/easygo/ category_treeBrowse.html).  We applied x 2  analysis for the biological process search, and the  cutoff for false discovery rate (FDR) was adjusted using a p value of  0.0001. GeneChip data set are available in a MIAME-compliant  format through GEO (accession no. GSE35507).  Bacterial and oomycete bioassays Bacterial strains were grown overnight and used to infect 5-  week-old Arabidopsis leaves by infiltration and bacterial growth  determined following [23,54]. Twelve samples were used for each  data point and represented as the mean 6 SEM of log c.f.u./cm 2 .  H. arabidopsidis WACO9 sporangia were obtained by washing  sporulating Col-0 leaves in 10 mM MgSO4, collected by  centrifugation, and resuspended in 10 mM MgSO4 to a final  density of 56104 sporangia per mL as described [25]. Three-week- old seedlings were challenge inoculated with H. arabidopsidis by  spraying with 10 mM MgSO4 containing 5610 4  conidiospores per  mL. Inoculated plants were maintained at 17uC and 100% relative humidity. Disease symptoms were scored for about 200 leaves per  treatment at 7 days after challenge. For determining leaf  colonization, infected leaves were stained with lactophenol  trypan-blue and examined microscopically at 7 days after  inoculation, as described [25] and scored on each leaf in the  following classes: I, no colonization; II, low tissue colonization  (,25% of leaf area colonized); III, medium tissue colonization  (25-50% of leaf area colonized); IV, high tissue colonization  (.50% of leaf area colonized). Sporulation was expressed as  intensity of pathogen sporulation on each leaf: I, no sporulation;  II, ,50% of the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; III, .50%  of the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; and IV, heavily  covered with sporangiophores, with additional chlorosis and leaf  collapse. When indicated, oomycete spore counting was per-  formed as previously described [26].  Chromatin immunoprecipitation Chromatin isolation and immunoprecipitation were performed  as described [55]. Chip samples, derived from three biological  replicates, were amplified in triplicate and measured by quanti-  tative PCR using primers for PR-1, WRKY6, WRKY53 and Actin2  as reported [21]. The rest of primers are described in Text S1 file.  All ChIP experiments were performed in three independent  biological replicates. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation  of modified histones from 2 g of leaf material were antiH3K4m3  (#07-473 Millipore) and antiH3K4ac (#07-352 Millipore).  Western blot Protein crude extracts were prepared by homogenizing ground  frozen leaf material with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplemented  with 5 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), and  protein phosphatase inhibitors (PhosStop, Roche). Protein con-  centration was measured using Bradford reagent; 25 mg of total protein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide w/v) and  transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filter was stained with  Ponceau-S after transfer, and used as a loading control.
