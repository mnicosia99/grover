This ability to respond to environmental daily rhythms has been conserved along evolution, and it is found among species from bacteria to mammals. The hematopoietic process of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is under circadian control and is tightly regulated by astakines, a new family of cytokines sharing a prokineticin (PROK) domain. The expression of AST1 and AST2 are light-dependent, and this suggests an evolutionarily conserved function for PROK domain proteins in mediating circadian rhythms. Vertebrate PROKs are transmitters of circadian rhythms of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain of mammals, but the mechanism by which they function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that high AST2 expression is induced by melatonin in the brain. We identify RACK1 as a binding protein of AST2 and further provide evidence that a complex between AST2 and RACK1 functions as a negative-feedback regulator of the circadian clock. By DNA mobility shift assay, we showed that the AST2-RACK1 complex will interfere with the binding between BMAL1 and CLK and inhibit the E-box binding activity of the complex BMAL1-CLK. Finally, we demonstrate by gene knockdown that AST2 is necessary for melatonin-induced inhibition of the complex formation between BMAL1 and CLK during the dark period. In summary, we provide evidence that melatonin regulates AST2 expression and thereby affects the core clock of the crustacean brain. This process may be very important in all animals that have AST2 molecules, i.e. spiders, ticks, crustaceans, scorpions, several insect groups such as Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Blattodea, but not Diptera and Coleoptera. Our findings further reveal an ancient evolutionary role for the prokineticin superfamily protein that links melatonin to direct regulation of the core clock gene feedback loops.

Circadian rhythms are often monitored by assaying behavioral  and/or molecular fluctuations [1]. Clock genes and hormones are  core regulators or pacemakers in circadian regulation, which  reside in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals and the  brain visual center in insects [2,3]. In Drosophila, the proteins  encoded by clock genes form two distinct heterodimers: Period  (PER) and Timeless (TIM) form one heterodimer, and Clock  (CLK) and Cycle (CYC) form the other [4]. In mammals, the  homologues of the CLK and PER proteins have the same name,  while the homologues of TIM and CYC are called cryptochrome  (CRY) and brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear  translocator (ARNT)-like 1 (BMAL1) respectively [5]. The PER-  TIM heterodimer functions as an autoregulatory negative  feedback loop that causes a decrease in transcriptional activation  by CLK and CYC [6]. Conversely, the CLK-CYC heterodimer  directly interacts with the upstream E-boxes (CACGTG) of the  PER and TIM genes to activate their transcription [7]. These clock  genes are detected in several neural and non-neural tissues,  suggesting that these feedback loops are not restricted to neurons  [8]. RACK1 was recently identified as an inhibitor of mammalian  CLK-BMAL1 activity by recruiting PKCa during the negative feedback phase of the cycle [9].  As described above, the SCN serves as the \u2018\u2018master clock'' in the  mammalian brain [10]. The SCN is reset on a circadian basis by  light input from the retina during the day and by melatonin  secretion from the pineal gland at night [11,12]. Several animal  studies have documented that melatonin is mainly synthesized and  released during darkness, while the melatonin level is low in the  presence of light [13]. This hormone is formed not only in the  pineal gland but also in the photoreceptive structures of both  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361    vertebrates and invertebrates [14]. The melatonin synthesis  pattern is known to reflect both daily rhythms and changes in  photoperiod, demonstrating that melatonin has major roles in  regulating both circadian and seasonal rhythms [15]. Several  circadian rhythms, such as the rest/activity cycle, core body  temperature, neuronal electrical activity and locomotor activity,  are driven by melatonin [16,17,18,19]. However, melatonin does  not directly induce immediate changes in clock gene mRNA  expression in the rat SCN, suggesting that the phase-shifting effect  of melatonin on the SCN molecular loop implicates a post-  translational rather than a transcriptional effect [15]. Little is  known about the molecular mechanism by which melatonin drives  the clock gene feedback loops in the SCN. In addition, the  nocturnal increase in the circadian secretion of the cytokine IL-2  and its immunobiological activity are under melatonin control  during the dark period [20]. There is a link between the rest/  activity cycle and the immune system via melatonin-cytokine  interactions [21].  Neuronal tissues that contain circadian clocks are present in the  brain of the crayfish Cherax destructor and Procambarus clarkii, the  latter of which is highly related to Pacifastacus leniusculus. These  species have photoreceptor cells not only within their eyes, but also  in extraretinal parts of the brain. In Cherax this area is located in  the anterior median brain soma cluster 6 [22], and the axons from  these cells terminate in an area within the protocerebral bridge  [23]. It is clear that these brain photoreceptors are sufficient to  maintain the circadian locomotor rhythm in these animals [23].  These areas have also recently been shown to be immunoreactive  for proteins encoded by the clock genes CLK, PER and TIM [24].  Several studies imply a conserved role of melatonin as an  important transducer of circadian information in invertebrates  and vertebrates, and melatonin production has been demonstrated  in the eyestalks of several crustacean species [25,26]. The presence  of MT2 melatonin receptors have not been conclusively shown in  crayfish, but indirect evidences for such a receptor were presented  by Mendoza-Vargas et al [27] since the application of the MT2  receptor selective agonist 8-M-PDOT or antagonist DH97 had a  significant effect on how melatonin affected the retinal photore-  ceptors [27].  In mammals, the secretion of prokineticin 2 (PROK2) by the  SCN is implicated in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle and  locomotor activity and is known to suppress the function of  melatonin [28]. The transcription of PROK2 is activated by the  CLK-BMAL1 heterodimer and light [29,30].  Crayfish astakines are invertebrate homologues of the prokine-  ticins (PROK), and there are two forms in the crayfish P.  leniusculus: astakine 1 (AST1, AAX14635) and astakine 2 (AST2,  EF568370) [31]. These astakines have been identified in several  invertebrates, and similar to PROK2, the expression profiles of  crayfish AST1 and AST2 follow a daily rhythm [32]. In contrast to  AST1, the rhythmic expression of AST2 is at its maximum level in  the dark phase [32]. Although the patterns of melatonin and AST2  release are circadian-regulated in crayfish [32,33], nothing is  known about their role in regulating rhythmic oscillations. In this  study, we provide evidence that melatonin regulates the circadian  rhythm and that this regulation is mediated by AST2 during the  dark phase. Our results imply that AST2 acts as novel negative  feedback regulator of CLK-BMAL1 activity.  Results  Melatonin induces the expression of AST2 In a recent report, we showed that AST2 mRNA is expressed in  the hematopoietic tissue (HPT) of P. leniusculus at higher levels at  night than during the day, the time when melatonin is also at a  high level [32,33]. Thus, we hypothesized that there may be a  physiological link between these two molecules. We examined the  expression of AST1 and AST2 in HPT cells incubated with  melatonin in vitro (Figure 1A-1B) and in HPT, hemocytes and  brain injected with melatonin in vivo (Figure 1C-1H). Melatonin  incubation or injection clearly affected AST2 expression  (Figure 1B, 1D, 1F and 1H), whereas AST1 expression was  unaffected by this treatment (Figure 1A, 1C, 1E and 1G). These  results were also confirmed at the level of translation using an  ELISA assay (Figure 2A-2C), in which melatonin treatment  resulted in higher levels of the AST2 protein. When cell lysates  from the brain and HPT were analyzed by western blot at 9:00  and 20:00, respectively, the level of AST2 was clearly higher at  night than during the day (Figure 2D).  AST2 binds to PlRACK1 In contrast to AST1, which is a secreted protein, AST2 is  mainly an intracellular protein (Figure S1). To identify any protein  that interacts with AST2 in HPT cells, recombinant AST2 (GST-  AST2) was used as a bait to bind to proteins in HPT and hemocyte  lysates by far overlay or pull-down assays (Figure 3A-3B). After  excluding the background proteins found in the control, a protein  with high similarity to Penaeus monodon RACK1 was identified as an  AST2-binding protein by mass spectra analysis. The Mascot  search resulted in significant hits where P. monodon RACK1 had  the highest significant protein score 781 (Table S1). This protein  was the significant hit detected in both the far overlay and the  GST pull-down assay.  By designing degenerate primers from the obtained amino acid  sequences, a complete RACK1 cDNA was identified by RACE  technique from P. leniusculus (PlRACK1). The open reading frame  of PlRACK1 contains 957 bp (JQ686053), encoding 318 amino  acids with a calculated molecular mass of 35.7 kDa (predicted  MW using ProtParam program), and its deduced amino acid  sequence was found to consist of seven conserved WD40 repeat  binding sites (Figure S2). PlRACK1 mRNA was highly expressed  in different crayfish tissues (Figure S3). To confirm the interaction  between PlRACK1 and AST2, recombinant GST-PlRACK1 was  Author Summary  Most living organisms are able to sense the time and in particular time of day by their internal clocks. So-called clock proteins control these internal clockworks. BMAL1 and CLK are two important clock proteins, which together form a complex that serves as a transcription factor and controls the production of diurnal proteins. These diurnal proteins, in turn, inhibit the formation of clock proteins so that the concentration of the different proteins in the cell oscillates back and forth throughout the day. External factors may affect the balance of clock proteins, and one such important factor is light. Melatonin is a darkness hormone produced in the brain of most animals during the night, and here we show that melatonin controls the formation of a protein named AST2 in crayfish. AST2 belongs to a group of proteins found in many arthropods, such as spiders, scorpions, crustaceans, and some insects, whose function has been unknown until now. Now we demonstrate that AST2 is induced by melatonin at night and then functions in the internal biological clock by preventing BMAL1 and CLK to form a complex. In this way, AST2 acts as a link between melatonin and the internal biological clock.

The GST-PlRACK1 was used in an in vitro binding  assay with a His-Trx-AST2 fusion protein (predicted mass of  33 kDa). The His-Trx and GST proteins were also expressed and  purified to serve as control proteins (Figure S5B: the predicted  mass of His-Trx and GST proteins are 20 and 26 kDa,  respectively). As shown in Figure 3C, western blot analysis  revealed that the His-Trx-AST2 protein was pulled down by  GST- PlRACK1, but not by GST alone. These data indicate that  there is an interaction between PlRACK1 and AST2.  PlBMAL1 forms a complex with PlRACK1 The finding that PlRACK1 is a binding partner of the  melatonin-induced protein AST2 led us to examine whether  PlRACK1 associates with BMAL1 to thereby act as a regulator of  circadian rhythm, as has recently been reported in mice [9].  BMAL1 cDNA was amplified from P. leniusculus (PlBMAL1,  JQ670886) with an open reading frame of 1,995 bp that encodes a  664 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of  73.64 kDa. One close sequence to PlBMAL1 was that of BMAL1  from Drosophila melanogaster (identity = 55%). Domain homology  analysis using SMART revealed that the deduced amino acid  sequence was highly conserved in its HLH (helix-loop-helix) DNA-  binding domain and the protein dimerization PAS and PAC  regions (Figure S4A). The expression of PlBMAL1 was highest in  hemocytes, followed by testis, nerve, intestine and brain (Figure  S4B). An interaction between PlBMAL1 and PlRACK1 was  demonstrated using a GST pull-down experiment with recombi-  nant GST-PlRACK1 (predicted mass of 62 kDa) and His-Trx-  PlBMAL1 (predicted mass of 94 kDa as shown in Figure S6A-  S6B). This in vitro GST pull-down assay showed an apparent  binding between these two recombinant proteins (Figure 4A). The  far western blotting using PlRACK1 without GST tag (predicted  mass of 36 kDa) as a prey and GST- PlBMAL1 (predicted mass of  100 kDa as shown in Figure S6C) as bait, also confirmed this  interaction (Figure 4B). The results show that the GST-PlBMAL1  was detected at the place where the PlRACK1 was located,  whereas the GST control protein could not be detected. Binding of  PlRACK1 to AST2 as well as to PlBMAL1 was detected using far  western after SDS-PAGE at reducing condition. The crystal  structure of human RACK1, with high homology to PlRACK1, is  known as a sevenfold \u00df-propeller structure [34]. A comparison of  the structure of human RACK1 with yeast RACK1 (that lacks  most of the cysteines present in animal RACK1's) show a high  similarity in the overall structure, indicating that the cysteines are  of minor importance for the main structure characteristics of this  group of proteins, which may explain retained binding properties  in the far western assay.  Interaction of AST2 with PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 in vitro To investigate if and how AST2 regulates an oscillatory  mechanism, we examined whether AST2 interacts with the  PlBMAL1-PlRACK1 complex. This interaction is mediated by  AST2 binding to PlRACK1, since we could show that AST2 is not  able to bind to BMAL1 alone (Figure S7). The results from GST  pull-down experiments showed that recombinant His-Trx-AST2  strongly associated with the recombinant GST-PlRACK1/His-  Trx-PlBMAL1 complex, and the binding of His-Trx-PlBMAL1  and His-Trx-AST2 was dependent on the concentration of GST-  PlRACK1 (Figure 4C). These results suggest that AST2 plays an  essential role as a stabilizer of the PlBMAL1-PlRACK1 complex,  thereby suppressing the CLK-BMAL1 interaction during the dark  period.  AST2 associates to form an AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complex during the dark period in vivo  The amount of AST2 protein varies in a circadian manner and  is highest during early night in the brain and HPT, while  PlBMAL1 and PlRACK1 protein levels do not change signifi-  cantly according to daily rhythms (Figure 5A-5B). Because our in  vitro experiments indicated an interaction between AST2 and  PlRACK1 and between PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1, we confirmed  these two interactions with in vivo experiments. To study the in vivo  interactions between these three proteins during the light and dark  periods, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments of brain  and HPT extracts. A high-molecular-weight complex was present  at night and disappeared during the day, as shown in Figure 5C  and 5D. This complex was abundant in the brain; it was also  found at very low levels in a few HPT samples (Figure 5C).  Reducing SDS-PAGE revealed that AST2, PlBMAL1 and  PlRACK1 were components of this approximately 200 kDa  complex (Figure 5C) (the native mass of these three proteins are  14, 74 and 36 kDa, respectively). During the light period, this high  molecular weight complex could not be detected; instead, a  smaller complex of AST2-PlRACK1 was identified (Figure 5D).  The CLK protein is detected as a component of the 400- kDa complex  To determine whether CLK (JQ670885) forms a complex with  BMAL1, crayfish brain lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitat-  ed with antibodies against BMAL1 and probed for CLK. The  CLK protein with a molecular mass of 95 kDa clearly coimmu-  noprecipitated with endogenous PlBMAL1 (Figure 6A), indicating  that CLK is one protein component of this large approximately  400 kDa complex. Confirmation of complex formation was  accomplished by switching the antibodies used for immunopre-  cipitation and for western blot detection, respectively (Figure 6A).  We then monitored the CLK protein levels in the brain during the  day and night by western blotting. As shown in Figure 6B, the  CLK protein level oscillated in a circadian rhythm, and its  expression peaked in the light period (Figure 6F). Furthermore, the  approximately 400 kDa CLK-PlBMAL1 complex was barely  detectable at night and reached maximal levels in the morning  (Figure 6B and 6C). More interestingly, the lowest level of the  CLK-PlBMAL1 complex in brain lysates coincided with the time  bars = control.

Thus, these data indicate that  AST2 is an important regulator of circadian rhythm by interfering  with formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex.  The effect of melatonin injection during the light period Because we detected a clear stimulatory effect of melatonin on  the expression of AST2 (Figure 2C), we decided to further confirm  this putative role of AST2 by determining the presence, in vivo, of  the approximately 400 kDa CLK-PlBMAL1 and approximately  200 kDa AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complexes, respectively,  after melatonin injection during the light period. Six hours after  melatonin injection, the approximately 200 kDa complex was  detected in the crayfish brains, but not in the HPT (Figure 6G-6I).  Conversely, the amount of the approximately 400 kDa complex  containing CLK-PlBMAL1 was reduced post-melatonin injection  (Figure 6G and 6H). These results indicate that either secretion of  natural melatonin at night or melatonin treatment causes an  Figure 2. Melatonin induces higher AST2 protein levels in vitro and in vivo.

AST2 is required for delayed CLK-BMAL1 formation To further test whether AST2 is crucial for the interference of  CLK-BMAL1 heterodimer formation, AST2 mRNA expression  was partially knocked down by RNAi, to ca 50% of the control. As  shown in Figure 7A and 7B, AST2 expression could be partly  decreased in the brain by injection of dsRNA. A reduction of the  approximately 200 kDa complex occurred during the night as a  result of this AST2 deficiency when compared to injection of the  dsGFP control (Figure 7C and 7E). In contrast to the control  group, the formation of the <400 kDa complex in AST2-silenced animals occurred at 21:00, as shown in Figure 7C and 7D. Thus,  this experiment further confirms that AST2 is required to interfere  with the formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1 heterodimer, and that  high AST2 levels at night cause lower amounts of CLK-PlBMAL1  heterodimer formation during the dark period (Figure 7C-7G).  AST2 gene knockdown induces CLK/BMAL1 E-box binding in the dark  Since knockdown of AST2 resulted in more CLK-PlBMAL1  complex formation during the dark period, we decided to test  whether AST2 also had an effect on CLK-PlBMAL1 E-box  binding. We assayed the CLK-PlBMAL1 E-box binding by a  DNA-protein binding assay. As expected, we could demonstrate  CLK-PlBMAL1 specific E-box binding during the night in AST2  silenced animals, whereas the control group (dsGFP) did not show  any E-box binding in the dark (Figure 8A-8B). A super shift of this  E-box binding was induced after incubation with anti-CLK  antibodies (Figure 8A), and controls using mutated or unlabelled  E-box oligonucleotides did not show any binding (Figure 8B and  Figure S8A-S8B). In contrast, melatonin injection during the day  (which leads to enhanced levels of AST2, Figure 2A) reduced the  DNA binding activity of CLK-PlBMAL1 compared to other  groups (Figure S8B). The complex formation of CLK-PlBMAL1  or AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 was followed by western blotting  after knockdown of AST2 expression by dsRNA or increasing  AST2 by addition of melatonin (Figure 8C-8E). These results  reveal that AST2 is an important regulator of the E-box binding  activity of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex.  Discussion  Various proteins are regulated by the circadian rhythm, and  there are a growing number of examples of circadian regulation of  stem cell activities, such as the proliferation and recruitment of  hematopoietic progenitor cells [33,35]. We have recently shown  that the hematopoietic cytokine AST1 is regulated by light and that  this regulation has an impact on hemocyte synthesis [26]. AST1  contains a prokineticin domain (pfam06607) and shares similarities  with vertebrate PROK2, which is regulated by light at the  transcriptional level by core clock genes [22]. Apart from  functioning in circadian clocks, vertebrate PROKs have document-  ed roles in the regulation of intestinal muscle contractility,  neurogenesis, pain perception, food uptake, and appetite regulation  [36,37]. In similarity with invertebrate astakines the vertebrate  PROKs also play roles in hematopoiesis and proinflammatory  immune responses. Therefore, the structural and functional  similarities between astakines and the vertebrate PROKs point to  an ancient similar role for these proteins [38].  The oscillation in PROK2 transcription in mice occurs in the  SCN, and it acts as an output molecule, signaling the rhythm to  other cells and tissues and thereby changing circadian behavior  [39]. Signal transduction from vertebrate PROK's are mediated  by two closely related G-protein coupled receptors, and the AVIT  motif has been shown to be crucial to this receptor binding and the  activity of the PROK's [40]. An analysis of the gene structure for  human PROK2 reveals that exon 2-4 share similarities to crayfish  AST2, while the first exon encodes the signal peptide and the  AVIT motif [41,42]. Thus, all invertebrate astakines found so far,  differ from the vertebrates PROKs in their N-terminal and lack of  the AVIT-motif [25] a fact that indicates different receptor  binding properties for this invertebrate group of PROK domain  containing proteins. Similar to PROK2, AST1 is a secreted  molecule with circadian expression, and these data indicate a  conserved role for this domain throughout evolution, from  arthropods to humans [25,26]. In this study, we report a more  direct role for another crayfish prokineticin, namely AST2, as an  intracellular regulator of the heterodimeric transcription factors  CLK and PlBMAL1. The expression of AST2 does not exhibit a  light-dependent pattern that is similar to that of AST1 or PROK2  in mice; instead, we detected high levels of AST2 expression in the  HPT and brain during the dark period when melatonin levels are  high. We also showed that melatonin administration clearly  increased the expression of AST2 at both the mRNA and protein  levels.  It is well established that the neurohormone melatonin has an  important function in the SCN in regulating the feedback loop of  the core clock genes and also functions as an output signal that has  an effect on peripheral cells [43]. Melatonin is mainly produced  within the eyestalks of crayfish, and its production is elevated  during the dark period [27]. Melatonin is known to influence  numerous physiological processes in crayfish [18,33,44], although  the molecular mechanism by which melatonin exerts its effect has  not been fully clarified. However, AST2 is an intracellular protein  that is present in several crustaceans and insect species [25]. Here,  for the first time, we identify a direct role for AST2 in the  regulation of the circadian clock and show that the protein acts as  a link between melatonin and the heterodimeric transcriptional  activator CLK-PlBMAL1. Intracellular PlRACK1 was identified  as an AST2-binding protein, and in the brain, the binding of  PlBMAL1 to this complex mediated a decrease in the formation of  the CLK-PlBMAL1 heterodimer. This process may be very  important in all animals that have AST2 molecules i.e., spiders,  ticks, crustaceans, scorpions, several insect groups such as  Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Blattodea but not Diptera and  Coleoptera. If any vertebrate PROK is performing the same  function still remains to be demonstrated.  Recently, RACK1 and protein kinase Ca (PKCa) were shown to interact with BMAL1 in a circadian manner, resulting in  suppressed CLK-BMAL1 activity [9]. This result is consistent with  our observation of the PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 interaction in the  crayfish brain. At night, we detected an approximately 200 kDa  complex in the crayfish brain and found that the components of  this complex consisted of AST2, PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1.  and 8; GST pull-down of His-Trx. B) The protein-protein interaction of PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1 was analyzed by far western blotting. C) Binding of AST2 and PlBMAL1 to GST-PlRACK1. GST-PlRACK1 (0, 5, 50 or 500 ng) was bound to Glutathione Sepharose beads and incubated with 500 ng His-Trx- PlBMAL1 and 500 ng His-Trx-AST2. Bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted for PlBMAL1 and AST2 using an anti-His antibody and for PlRACK1 with an anti-GST antibody. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003361.g004  AST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 8 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361    AST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 9 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361    Conversely, this complex disappeared during the light period due  to lower levels of AST2 during the day. Thus, our results show that  AST2 acts as a regulator of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex by  binding to PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 in an oscillatory manner that is  induced by changes in the level of melatonin.  Interestingly, enhancement of the approximately 400 kDa  complex consisting of PlBMAL1 and CLK was detected when the  level of the approximately 200 kDa complex was decreased either  during the light period or by knockdown of AST2 expression. A  similar high-molecular-weight complex of PlBMAL1 and CLK  (approximately 400 kDa) was also recently detected in mice [9].  The formation of the approximately 400 kDa crayfish complex is  dependent on the expression of CLK. The expression of mamma-  lian CLK is not rhythmic [45,46], while zebrafish CLK shows  robust rhythmic expression, as was the case for crayfish CLK in our  study [47,48,49]. As with zebrafish and Drosophila, the CLK of  crayfish is directly regulated by light [50,51]. Unlike those in  mammals, the protein products of PER and TIM (or CRY in  mammals) in Drosophila act to inhibit the transcriptional activity of  the CLK-CYC complex (CLK-BMAL1) by interacting with CLK  or a CLK-containing complex during the night but not during most  of the day [52]. In our experiments, the AST2-PlRACK1-  PlBMAL1 complex (approximately 200 kDa) competes for binding  to PlBMAL1 to interfere with the formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1  heterodimer during the dark period. Further it is clear from our  DNA mobility shift assay that AST2 can inhibit the transcriptional  activation activity of CLK-PlBMAL1. This 200 kDa AST2-  containing complex directly interacts with different proteins and is  clearly induced by melatonin. Therefore, our findings reveal an  ancient evolutionary role for a prokineticin superfamily protein that  links melatonin to direct regulation of the core clock gene feedback  loops, as indicated in the model (Figure 9).  Materials and Methods  Crayfish Healthy intermolt freshwater crayfish (P. leniusculus) were  obtained from Lake Hja\u0308lmaren, Sweden and were maintained in  aerated tap water at 10uC.  Cloning and sequence analysis of full-length P. leniusculus RACK1 (PlRACK1) and PlBMAL1 cDNAs  Total RNA was isolated from crayfish brains using TRIzol LS  (Invitrogen) followed by RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) treatment.  cDNA synthesis was accomplished with an oligo (dT) primer and  ThermoScript RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufac-  turer's protocol. A partial sequence of PlRACK1 was amplified  using primers that were designed based on the shrimp (P. monodon)  PmRACK1 sequence (GenBank accession no. EF569136), where-  as PlBMAL1 primers were based on the cDNA sequences from  several organisms (listed in Table S2). To obtain the full-length  cDNAs of the PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1 genes, 59 and 39 rapid  amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technology was performed  using the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech)  according to the manufacturer's instructions. The complete  PlRACK1 cDNA sequence was amplified using gene-specific  primers for PlRACK1 (Table S2) and the SMART Universal  Primer A. The PCR products were then cloned into the TOPO  TA cloning vector and sequenced. The deduced amino acid  sequence of the PlRACK1 gene was searched against the  GenBank database with the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.  nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Sequence alignment of PlRACK1 was  generated by ClustalW, and the protein domains were analyzed  with the SMART program (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/).  Tissue distribution analysis Total RNAs were isolated from different crayfish tissues using  TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by RNase-free DNase I  (Ambion) treatment. For reverse transcription, 1 mg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to produce cDNA using ThermoScrip RT-  PCR (Invitrogen). To amplify and visualize the cDNAs of PlRACK1  and PlBMAL1, two sets of primers were used: the forward and  reverse primers listed in Table S2. The PCR cycles were as follows: 1  cycle (95uC for 2 min); 28 cycles (95uC, 30 s; 55uC, 30 s; 72uC, 40 s) followed by an extension step (72uC for 5 min). The transcription of the 40S ribosomal protein was used as an internal control. All PCR  products were analyzed on 1% GelRed-stained agarose gels.  Crayfish HPT cell culture and maintenance The hematopoietic tissue was dissected, washed with CPBS  (crayfish phosphate buffered saline (pH 6.8), 10 mM Na2HPO4,  10 mM KH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM MnCl2,) and incubated in 600 ml of 0.1% collagenase (types I and IV) (Sigma) in CPBS at room temperature for 45 min to separate  the HPT cells. The separated cells were washed twice with CPBS  by centrifugation at 8006g for 5 min at room temperature. The cell pellet was re-suspended in modified L-15 medium, and cells  were then seeded at a density of 2.56106 cells/150 ml in 96-well plates. The HPT cells were supplemented with partially purified  plasma as a source of AST1 after 1 h of attachment at room  temperature. The culture plates were incubated at 16uC, and 1/3 of the medium was changed at 48 h intervals.  Melatonin treatment For the in vivo experiments, 100 ml of a melatonin solution  (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in crayfish saline (to a  final ethanol concentration of 1%). This solution was injected into  the base of a walking leg such that the amount of injected  melatonin was 4.3 nmol/g fresh weight. Control crayfish received  100 ml of saline with 1% ethanol. The hemolymph, brain, and HPT of these crayfish were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h post-  injection for the extraction of total RNA, whereas samples for total  protein extraction were dissected at 3 h post-injection. All  injections were performed during the day.  Figure 5. PlRACK1, PlBMAL1, and AST2 form an approximately 200-kDa protein complex during the dark period.

The medium was then replaced with 150 ml of L-15 medium containing 5 ml of the melatonin solution at final concentration of 0.43 nmol/well (3 mM) (the control group was supplemented with 5 ml of saline with 1% ethanol) and 5 ml of crude AST1, followed by incubation for 0, 0.25, 1, 3, 6, and 12 h at 20uC. Thereafter, the cells were harvested at each time point for extraction  of total RNA and protein. The transcription and translation levels of  AST1 and AST2 in vitro and in vivo were detected by quantitative  RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively.  Sampling times The light in the aquarium room was turned on and off at 4:00  and 20:00, respectively. Brains were dissected at 06:00, 12:00,  16:00, 21:00, and 03:00 from three crayfish at each sampling time,  which were kept in normal light/dark conditions. The experiments  were repeated at least twice. Complex formation and CLK  expression were determined by western blotting using antibodies  against BMAL1 and CLK, respectively. An anti-actin antibody  (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as an internal control.  Generation of dsRNA A T7 promoter sequence was incorporated into gene-specific  primers for AST2 and GFP (italic letters) at their 59 ends (AST2  RNAi-F, 59- TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGT CCA CGC CTC  TGA GTC TTT T-39; AST2 RNAi-R, 59- TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA  TAG GGA TGC CCA GAG TGT TGT CCT C-39 and GFP 63+, 59- TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC GAC GTA AAC GGC  CAC AAG T-39; GFP 719-, 59- TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGT  TCT TGT ACA GCT CGT CCA TG-39). These primers were used  to amplify PCR products as templates for dsRNA synthesis. A GFP  transcript was amplified with the pd2EGFP-1 vector (Clontech) as a  template and was used as a control. The amplified products were then  purified using a GenElute Gel extraction kit (Sigma) followed by in  vitro transcription using a MegaScript kit (Ambion), and the dsRNA  was purified with TRIzol LS (Invitrogen).  dsRNA in vivo Small intermolt crayfish (1562 g of fresh weight) were divided  into two groups with three crayfish in each group (n = 3). The first  and second groups were injected with 300 mg of GFP control dsRNA and 300 mg of dsAST2, respectively, at the base of the fourth walking leg. Twenty-four hours after the first dsRNA  injection, four drops of crayfish hemolymph were bled for total  RNA isolation to test the efficiency of the RNAi. Then, dsRNA  was injected a second time into both groups as described above.  Twenty-four hours after the second dsRNA injection, the brains  were dissected at 06:00, 12:00, 21:00, and 03:00 to determine  complex formation by western blotting.  Plasmid constructs PlRACK1 was amplified using the synthesized forward primer  RACK1_F1 and reverse primer RACK1_R1 (Table S2) by PCR.  The conditions for the PCR reactions were essentially identical to  those described in the manufacturer's protocol for the vector. All  constructs were sequence-verified. The PCR product was cloned  into the pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression vector at the BamHI and  SalI cleavage sites.  PlBMAL1 was amplified from crayfish testis cDNA by PCR  using 1 unit of Paq5000 DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and a pair  of specific primers listed in Table S2. EcoRI and XhoI sites were  engineered into the primers to facilitate subsequent cloning.  PlBMAL1 was further subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 and pET-  32a vectors. The recombinant plasmids containing the PlRACK1  and PlBMAL1 genes were confirmed by DNA sequencing.  Bacterial protein expression and purification The full-length cDNA encoding PlRACK1was cloned into the  pGEX-4T-1 bacterial expression vector to express a glutathione S-  transferase (GST)-fused PlRACK1 protein in the Escherichia coli  strain BL21(DE3). Protein expression was induced by adding IPTG  to a final concentration of 1 mM at 25uC for 6 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation followed by suspension in lysis buffer  (50 mM NaH2PO4 (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl and 2% Triton X-100)  and lysis by sonication. Inclusion body pellets were solubilized in  denaturing buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 8 M guanidine (GdnHCl)  and 10 mM DTT) followed by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for  15 min). The protein was refolded in refolding buffer (55 mM Tris-  HCl, 0.44 M L-arginine, 21 mM NaCl, 0.88 mM KCl and 10 mM  DTT). The refolded GST-PlRACK1protein was dialyzed in  Figure 6. A 400-kDa CLK-PlBMAL1 complex is present in the light in the crayfish brain. A) Immunoprecipitation (IP) of endogenous CLOCK (CLK) and PlBMAL1 in the brain (B) and HPT. Total proteins were extracted from the brain and HPT and were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the antibodies (Ab) indicated on the top of the blots, followed by western blot (WB) detection with antibodies against CLK or BMAL1 as shown at the bottoms of the blots. Reducing and non-reducing conditions of the samples are indicated by +DTT or 2DTT, respectively. B) The levels of the CLK- PlBMAL1 and AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (sample without DTT) followed by western blotting using an antibody against BMAL1. The AST2-PlRACK1 heterodimer and CLK were detected by western blotting using antibodies against AST2 and CLK, respectively. Time points were taken at 03:00, 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 21:00 (n = 4). An actin protein was used as an internal control. The horizontal band at the top of the histogram indicates the light condition (white = light, black = dark).

G) Melatonin injection inhibited the formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex; this inhibition is mediated by the AST2-PlRACK1- PlBMAL1 complex. The levels of the CLK-PlBMAL1 and AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 protein complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (sample without DTT) followed by western blotting using an antibody against BMAL1. The level of b-actin was used as an internal control.

The beads were washed with ice-cold PBS  followed by incubation in reducing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl and  20 mM reduced glutathione, pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temper-  ature. After centrifugation at 1,0006g for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE. The protein  concentration was measured, and the proteins were stored at  280uC. The full-length sequence of PlBMAL1 was ligated into EcoRI/XhoI-linearized pGEX-4T-1 and pET-32a vectors to create  a plasmid that expresses GST- and His-Trx fusion proteins,  respectively. The recombinant GST-PlBMAL1 protein was ex-  pressed and purified in a similar manner as the GST-PlRACK1  protein. The His-Trx-PlBMAL1 recombinant protein was purified  using a Ni-NTA column. His-Trx-AST2 was expressed and purified  as described in earlier publications [25]. Briefly, His-Trx tagged  AST2 was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and induced by the  addition of 0.02 mM IPTG. The cells were resuspended in lysis  buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl and 2% Triton  X-100) and purified using HisPur Cobalt Resin (Thermo Scientific).  The protein products of the His-Trx tag expression vector pET-32a  and the expression vector pGEX-4T-1, which are used for the  incorporation of N-terminal thioredoxin and GST tags, respective-  ly, were expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. The thioredoxin and  GST proteins were purified with HisPur Cobalt or Glutathione  Sepharose resins, respectively, as control proteins. All samples were  analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE.  In vitro GST pull-down assay To identify putative AST2-binding proteins, total protein was  extracted from crayfish brains in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-  HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF,  10 mM MG132 and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor tablets according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics).  Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,0006g for 10 min. Recombinant GST-AST2 was expressed in E. coli and  purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B resin according to  standard protocols. GST-AST2 or GST (3-4 mg) was incubated with 800 mg of crude brain total protein extract at 4uC for 1 h unless otherwise specified. Glutathione beads were recovered by  brief centrifugation and washed three times with 1 ml of washing  buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol  and 0.1% Tween 20). GST was used as a control protein in this  experiment. Pull-down mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE,  and after excluding the background proteins found in the control,  the remaining band of about 30 kDa was sequenced by mass  spectrometry after trypsin cleavage. Identification of the protein  was based on raw MS/MS data, and ions search using the Mascot  program (http://www.matrixscience.com).  The interaction between GST-PlRACK1and HisTrx-AST2  was examined by incubating purified GST-PlRACK1or the GST  control with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (50 ml a 50% bed slurry) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed three  times with PBS, purified HisTrx-AST2 or the His-Trx control  (5 mg) was added, and incubated for another 2 h at room temperature in PBS buffer. After washing with PBS, the  precipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer.  To determine the formation of a PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complex,  5 mg purified His-Trx-PlBMAL1 protein was incubated with 5 mg purified GST-PlRACK1 protein bound to Glutathione Sepharose  4B beads. The beads were then washed five times, and the  remaining proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer.  To explore whether AST2 can bind to PlRACK1 together with  PlBMAL1, purified His-Trx-PlBMAL1 (500 ng) and His-Trx-  AST2 (500 ng) were incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B-  bound GST-PlRACK1 (0, 5, 50, 500 ng) in PBS buffer at 25uC for 2 h. The protein-bead complexes were washed, and the bound  proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer. All protein samples  were resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by western blot.  Blot overlay assays In addition to an in vitro GST pull-down assay, a far western  overlay assay was used to identify any putative AST2 binding  protein. The protein was extracted from crayfish HPT and then  subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PDVF membranes,  and blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-  HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) at room  temperature. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were  incubated with 25 mM GST-AST2 or GST alone in 10 ml TBST  buffer at room temperature. The blots were washed twice and  incubated for 1 h with 1:2,000 dilution of anti GST antibody and  then washed twice, incubated for 1 h with 1:1,000 dilution of anti  mouse antibody for 1 h, and washed three times before detection  with an ECL western blotting reagent kit. The control reaction  was incubated with GST instead of GST-AST2.  Purified GST-PlRACK1 protein was cleaved by incubation with  thrombin (GE Healthcare, 1 ml thrombin per 100 mg recombinant protein) at 22uC overnight to remove the GST fusion tag. Free PlRACK1was eluted with PBS from the Glutathione Sepharose 4B  beads. PlRACK1 was run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to  PDVF membranes and incubated at 4uC overnight with purified GST-PlBMAL1 or GST alone (7 mg) in 10 ml TBST buffer. The blot was washed three times (10 min each) in TBST containing  0.05% Tween 20. Protein interactions were detected by western  blotting using an anti-GST antibody. Blot overlay assays were also  used to confirm the binding of AST2. Preparation of total crayfish  brain homogenates and gel overlays with recombinant GST-AST2  (far western blots) were performed as described above.  was used as a control (white).

The horizontal band at the top of the histogram indicates the light condition (white = light, black = dark).

Cell extracts for western  blotting and immunoprecipitation were prepared by suspending  the PBS-washed cells in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0),  150 mM NaCl, and 1.0% NP-40) with protease inhibitor cocktail  tablets (Roche). Following incubation on ice for 30 min, non-  extractable material was removed by centrifugation at  13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4uC. Cleared supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation, whereas whole homogenized cells were  mixed with 1X SDS loading buffer with and without DTT,  followed by western analysis. Cell extracts analyzed directly by  ELISA were homogenized in bicarbonate/carbonate coating  buffer (pH 9.6).  Western blot analysis Protein samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and  transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, America) in electro-  blotting buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20% methanol) for  120 min. After rinsing with TBST buffer, the membranes were  immersed in blocking buffer (5% skim milk powder in TBST) at  4uC, overnight, followed by incubation with primary antibody for 1 h (anti-GST or anti-His diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST).  Subsequently, the membranes were incubated in HRP-conjugated  rabbit anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) for 1 h and visualized by  the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham  Biosciences). The X-ray images from western blotting were  analyzed according to the Quantity One user guide. Briefly, the  western blotting films were scanned and saved as digital images as  a quantity-one file (or .1sc) by GS-800 calibrated imaging  E-box was used as control. C) Western blot showing the effect of AST2 knock down or melatonin treatment on the protein levels of CLK/PlBMAL1, AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complexes (upper panel), and AST2 level (middle panel). Actin was used as an internal control (lower panel). The horizontal band on top of this histogram indicates day (white) or night (black). D) Relative amounts of CLK-PlBMAL1 and AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 protein complexes in brain extracts isolated during the day (n = 9) as determined by western blotting, using an antibody against BMAL1. The AST2 protein was also detected by western blotting, using an antibody against AST2. White bars = dsAST2, black bars = melatonin, grey bars = dsGFP. E) Relative amounts of CLK-PlBMAL1 and AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 protein complexes in brain extracts isolated during the night (n = 9) as determined by western blotting, using an antibody against BMAL1. The AST2 protein was also detected by western blotting, using an antibody against AST2. White bars = dsAST2, and grey bars = dsGFP. In three independent experiments, proteins were visualized by western blotting and quantitated using the Quantity One software. These results are shown in graph D and E. Error bars indicate SD from nine replicates. The asterisks indicate significant differences (*P,0.05, **P,0.01); one-way ANOVA with Duncan's new multiple-range test and the Tukey test. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003361.g008  Figure 9. Molecular model of the circadian regulation by CLK, PlBMAL1, PlRACK1, and AST2. The protein level of CLK is enhanced during the light period, and a CLK-PlBMAL1 complex is formed that acts as a transcriptional activator. During the dark period melatonin secretion causes an upregulation of AST2 and this high AST2 level results in the formation of a complex between PlBMAL1 and PlRACK1. Then AST2 binds to PlRACK 1 in the PlBMAL-PlRACK1 complex and forms the AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complex and this interferes with the formation and activity of the CLK-PlBMAL1 heterodimer. doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003361.g009  AST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 16 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361    densitometer. These quantity-one files were used for protein  analysis. Protein bands in all scanned images (.1sc file) were  quantified and the values of the band intensities were calculated by  using the Volume and Match tools (Quantity One software version  4.6.0; Bio-Rad Laboratories). These values were used to perform  statistical analysis as described in the \u2018\u2018Statistical analysis'' part  below.  Immunoprecipitation Immunoprecipitations were performed by first incubating cell  lysates from brain or HPT with the indicated primary antibodies  overnight at 4uC. Immune complexes were then precipitated by incubating reactions for an additional 2 h at 4uC with either Sepharose-conjugated protein A or agarose-conjugated protein G.  The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1% Triton  X-100 lysis buffer and were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample  buffer for western blotting.  Transcription analysis The transcript levels of AST1 and AST2 were detected by  quantitative RT-PCR using QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit  (QIAGEN). The relative expression was normalized to the  expression of the mRNA encoding the crayfish ribosomal protein  gene (R40s) for each sample. The primers used are shown in Table  S2. The qPCR reactions contained 5 ml of 1:10 diluted cDNA template, 1xQuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix (QIA-  GEN) and 5 mM forward and reverse primers in a 25 ml reaction volume. The following amplification profile was used: 95uC for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94uC for 15 s, 58uC for 30 s, and 72uC for 30 s. All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicates. The hemocytes, HPTs and brains from a least three crayfish were  used for each time point. The statistical comparisons were  performed as shown below (Statistical analysis).  ELISA Cell extracts, containing protein at 20 mg/ml were coated in  wells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by  incubation with blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS). Following  three careful washes with PBS, the different proteins were detected  with the corresponding primary antibody (1:1000) followed by  HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000). After the addition  of 100 ml tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma) and incubation for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by 100 ml of stop solution (0.5 M sulfuric acid) and the absorbance of the  resulting color was measured at 450 nm. All samples were  performed in triplicates and each experiment was repeated three  times.  Antibodies Polyclonal antibodies against recombinant crayfish AST1 and  AST2 were raised in rabbit as have been described earlier [31]. A  goat polyclonal antibody to human BMAL1 (N-5: SC-8550) and  goat polyclonal antibody to mouse CLK (S-19: SC-6927) were  obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A goat polyclonal  antibody to RACK1 (GNB2L1: Orb22484) was obtained from  Biorbyt. A goat polyclonal antibody against actin (C-11: SC-1615)  was used as internal control. The specificity of each antibody was  tested by western blots, and all were found to be specific for each  protein.  Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) Mobility shift assays were performed according to reference  [53]. Briefly, a synthetic fluorophore labeled oligonucleotide probe  including an E-box element (CACGTG) was used as a substrate in  this assay. To generate an E-box containing double-stranded DNA  fragment, the two fluorophore labeled E-box oligonucleotides  described below were annealed. A 30 mL EMSA reaction mixture contained ,100 mM KCl, 50 ng of crude crayfish brain lysates, 1 mg poly (dI-dC), and 10 fmol of labeled probe. For control 10 fmol of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or mutant E-box  oligonucleotide were incubated as control. After incubation for  1 hour on ice, antibodies against CLK protein was added and  incubated another 20 minutes on ice. Protein-DNA complexes  were resolved by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specific  DNA-protein and antibody-supershifted complexes were observed  as retarded bands in the gel. E-box (59-TTT AGT GAA AAG  CCG CCG CTC ACG TGG CGA ACT GCG TGA CTT G-39  and 59-TTT CAA GTC ACG CAG TTC GCC ACG TGA GCG  GCG GCT TTT CAC T-39) and E-box mutant (59-TTT AGT  GAA AAG CCG CCG CTC AGC TGG CGA ACT GCG TGA  CTT G-39 and 59-TTT CAA GTC ACG CAG TTC GCC AGC  TGA GCG GCG GCT TTT CAC T-39) sequences were used in  the gel shift analysis (the E-box, and E-box mutant sequence is  underlined).  Statistical analysis All statistical comparisons were examined by one-way analysis  of variance, followed by Duncan's new multiple-range test and the  Tukey test. When two treatments were compared, a Student's  paired t-test was used. Differences were considered statistically  significant at P,0.05 and/or P,0.01. The results are expressed as  the mean 6 standard deviation (SD).
