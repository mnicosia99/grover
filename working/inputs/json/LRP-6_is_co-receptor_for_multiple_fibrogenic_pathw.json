    "summary": "Fibrosis of vital organs is a major public health problem with limited therapeutic options. Mesenchymal cells including microvascular mural cells (pericytes) are major progenitors of scar-forming myofibroblasts in kidney and other organs. Here we show pericytes in healthy kidneys have active WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling responses that are markedly up-regulated following kidney injury. Dickkopf-related protein 1 (DKK-1), a ligand for the WNT coreceptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP-5 and LRP-6) and an inhibitor of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling, effectively inhibits pericyte activation, detachment, and transition to myofibroblasts in vivo in response to kidney injury, resulting in attenuated fibrogenesis, capillary rarefaction, and inflammation. DKK-1 blocks activation and proliferation of established myofibroblasts in vitro and blocks pericyte proliferation to PDGF, pericyte migration, gene activation, and cytoskeletal reorganization to TGF-\u03b2 or connective tissue growth factor. These effects are largely independent of inhibition of downstream \u03b2-catenin signaling. DKK-1 acts predominantly by inhibiting PDGF-, TGF-\u03b2-, and connective tissue growth factor-activated MAPK and JNK signaling cascades, acting via LRP-6 with associated WNT ligand. Biochemically, LRP-6 interacts closely with PDGF receptor \u03b2 and TGF-\u03b2 receptor 1 at the cell membrane, suggesting that it may have roles in pathways other than WNT/\u03b2-catenin. In summary, DKK-1 blocks many of the changes in pericytes required for myofibroblast transition and attenuates established myofibroblast proliferation/activation by mechanisms dependent on LRP-6 and WNT ligands but not the downstream \u03b2-catenin pathway.",

Fibrosis of the internal organs, resulting from subclinical injuryto the organ over a period of time or from acute severe injury or inflammation, is a major global health problem. All organs may be affected by fibrosis, which matures into microscopic or mac- roscopic scarring within the tissue parenchyma. At present there are few therapies that specifically target the process of fibro- genesis, despite increasing evidence suggesting that fibrogenesis per se provokes further decline in organ function, inflammation, and tissue ischemia (1). In addition, myofibroblasts themselves are inflammatory cells that generate cytokines, chemokines, and radicals that promote injury. Myofibroblasts appear as a result of a transition from pericytes, cells that normally nurse, maintain, and regulate the microvasculature (2, 3). The transition from pericytes to myofibroblasts results in an unstable microvascula- ture leading to aberrant angiogenesis or rarefaction (3). These microvascular changes ultimately provoke tissue ischemia. There- fore, the myofibroblast and its transition from resident pericyte or fibroblast is a major new target for therapeutics to counter the deleterious consequences of tissue injury. Recently, SNPs in LRP-6, a transmembrane coreceptor for  WNTs that binds to Frizzled (Frz) receptors and thereby to the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling cascade, have been identified as independent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. However, the mechanisms still are obscure (4, 5).  The WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is a major regulator of cell function both in embryonic development and in adults. Both elevated and attenuated levels of signaling that fall outside the normal homeostatic range of WNT signaling are linked to ab- normal embryonic development and to diverse disease states (6). Increasing evidence indicates that WNT signaling plays critical roles in tissue regeneration and immune responses to injury and infection (7). However, the signaling cascade and the cellular responses are complex and context specific (8). Previous studies have highlighted the importance of WNT/  \u03b2-catenin in kidney regeneration (9), and studies of chronic dis- ease of the kidney glomerulus and liver sinusoids suggest that persistent activation ofWNT/\u03b2-catenin is deleterious (10), but the role of WNT signaling in myofibroblasts and their precursors, pericytes of the kidney capillaries, was not studied (2). Here we explore the consequences of reactivating WNT/\u03b2-catenin signal- ing in pericytes and myofibroblasts after kidney injury.  Results and Discussion Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin Pathway Is Up-Regulated in Myofibroblasts in Kidney Disease. To explore the extent of the activation of the canonical WNT pathway in cells of the normal kidney, we studied two distinct lines of mice that are transgenic for reporters of WNT/ \u03b2-catenin signaling. Axin2+/lacz generates \u03b2-gal in cells expressing the endogenous WNT/\u03b2-catenin target gene, Axin2. (Fig. 1A) (11). TCF/LEF-H2B-GFPTr is a recently validated transgenic line of mice reporting \u03b2-catenin activity by nuclear GFP expression. It exhibits enhanced sensitivity and specificity over previous re- porters of \u03b2-catenin nuclear activity (Fig. 1A) (12). In normal kidneys of Axin2+/lacz mice there is extensive WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the papilla, and there are more restricted responses in the normal medulla and kidney cortex, as we have demon- strated previously (Fig. S1A) (9). Among the cells expressing lacZ were podocytes, vascular smooth muscle of arterioles, and some pericytes (Fig. 1 B-D and Fig. S1 A and B). In response to injury initiated by obstructing urine flow from the kidney (the unilateral ureteric obstruction [UUO] model), there was marked increase in lacZ staining in the scar-forming cells known as \u201cmyofibroblasts\u201d that derive from pericytes (Fig. 1 B-D).

To visualize this WNT response in greater detail, we localized  WNT reporter activity in TCF/LEF-H2B-GFPTr mice. In normal kidney, \u03b2-catenin responses were more extensive than previously appreciated. We have shown previously that in normal kidney, proximal and distal epithelium exhibits little endogenous WNT/ \u03b2-catenin reporter activity (9). In contrast, in TCF/LEF-H2B-GFPTr mice there was evidence of WNT reporter activity in many of these cells (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1 C-G). However, like the Axin2+/lacz re- porter, a minority of pericytes showed active signaling in normal kidney. Following kidney injury, WNT/\u03b2-catenin reporter activity increased in epithelial cell compartments, but there was a much greater increase in the pericyte/myofibroblast population of cells (Fig. 1 E-G and Fig. S1C).  Kidney Myofibroblasts Up-Regulate Wnt Pathway Genes and Wnt Reporter Activity. To explore further the activation of the WNT pathway in kidney myofibroblasts, we purified nonactivated peri- cytes (normal kidney), activated pericytes (from day 2 after UUO), and myofibroblasts transitioned from pericytes (from days 5, 7, and 10 after UUO) by flow cytometric sorting of single-cell digests from kidneys of the Coll-GFPTr reporter mouse, which specifically expresses GFP in these cells (13). Purified cells showed marked up-regulation of pericyte genes, including P75 NGFR (Ngfr) (Fig. S2A), and at baseline expressed detectable levels of NG2 (Cspg4) and PDGFR\u03b2 (Pdgfrb) that were modestly up-reg- ulated over time postinjury (Fig. S2D, Table S1). We found pro- totypical profibrotic genes expressed in normal kidney and up- regulated over time postinjury in our disease model, including Col1a1, Tgfb1, Ctgf, and Fgf2. We also observed up-regulation of the phosphatonin Fgf23, which has been implicated in the path- ogenesis of cardiovascular disease (Fig. S2A). WNT ligands, in- cluding Wnt2, 3, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 10a, were up-regulated. Pericytes also express cell-surface receptors (Fzd) and coreceptors (Lrp5,  Lrp6) forWNT responsiveness (Fig. S2B). As the course of kidney disease progressed, there was a modest up-regulation of the Dickkopf-related protein (DKK) family of mRNAs known to in- hibit canonical WNT signaling via direct binding to the LRP-5 and LRP-6 coreceptors (Fig. S2C). Other WNT downstream target genes, including sFLT1 and WISP1, which play important roles in noncanonical and canonical WNT signaling pathways, re- spectively, also were up-regulated, consistent with activatedWNT/ \u03b2-catenin and also noncanonical WNT pathways (Fig. S2C).  DKK-1 Triggers G1 Cell-Cycle Arrest and Down-Regulates Activation in Myofibroblasts. To test the function of WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation in myofibroblasts, we generated primary myofibroblast cultures from Coll-GFPTr mice that had kidney fibrosis (13). Myofibroblasts also expressed WNT ligands and receptors (Fig. S3A). DKK-1 has been reported to inhibit the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway by binding to LRP-5 or LRP-6. We cloned Dkk1 and expressed soluble DKK-1 or the DKK-1-GFP fusion protein (Fig. S3B) in HEK293 cells. Soluble DKK-1-GFP binding to unlabeled cell lines was markedly enhanced by overexpression of LRP-5 or LRP-6 (Fig. S3C), and DKK-1-GFP readily bound to the surface of cultured myofibroblasts without the requirement for receptor overexpression (Fig. S3D), indicating high receptor density for DKK-1 on myofibroblasts. DKK-1 protein specifically blocked entry of myofibroblasts into the cell cycle induced by serum at the G1 checkpoint (Fig. 2 A-F and Fig. S3E), resulting in inability to proliferate (Fig. 2B). To understand the mechanisms better, we tested the effect of  DKK-1 on the steady-state level of \u03b2-catenin protein. Cytosolic and nuclear \u03b2-catenin increased 1 h and 16 h after serum acti- vation, an effect decreased by DKK-1 at 16 h (Fig. 2G), con- firming DKK-1 inhibits WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling but suggesting early DKK-1 responses may occur independent of regulation of \u03b2-catenin protein (Fig. 2G). Transcripts for \u03b1SMA (Acta2), a marker of myofibroblast activation, were increased by serum at 24 h, and DKK-1 significantly reduced this activation (Fig. 2H), suggesting that DKK-1 may regulate activation also.  Systemic Delivery of DKK-1 Inhibits Myofibroblast Expansion and Fibrosis. Next we tested whether DKK-1 inhibited pericytes and myofibroblasts in vivo. DKK-1 was delivered systemically using an  Fig. 1. WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling is activated during kidney injury in the pericyte/myofibroblast cell compartment.

In preventative studies using the UUO model, DKK-1 profoundly inhibited peri- cyte expansion, proliferation, and transition to myofibroblasts (Fig. 3 C-I), resulting in reduced fibrosis (Fig. S4). The inhibition on day 4 after UUO was associated with a marked reduction in inflammation (Fig. 3J) and epithelial injury (Fig. S4 A and B). Moreover, expression of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin reporters in kidney myofibroblasts was reduced, particularly at the earlier time points (Fig 3K). These studies were extended to day 10 after UUO in- jury, and there was a substantial reduction in organ fibrosis and collagen transcripts (Fig. 3 L-M). To study this effect in more detail, we performed a reversal  study in which DKK-1 was delivered after disease onset, and fi- brosis extent was assessed 10 d after UUO (Fig. 3 N-P). Myofi- broblast accumulation, proliferation, deposition of interstitial fibrosis, and rarefaction of the capillaries were inhibited. Fur- thermore, as in the preventative studies, DKK-1 inhibited in- flammation and epithelial injury (Fig. S4 A-C). Because recent evidence indicates that myofibroblasts in kidney arise from peri- cyte precursors which detach from peritubular capillaries in re- sponse to injury (2), we examined the effect of DKK-1 on pericyte precursor detachment, spreading, and migration in Coll-GFPTr reporter mice. DKK-1 inhibited pericyte detachment from capil- laries at early time points in this model (Fig. 3Q). We tested whether DKK-1 could inhibit disease in a second  model of inflammation and fibrosis, ischemia reperfusion injury (U-IRI) of a single (unilateral) kidney, a recognized model of chronic kidney disease following acute kidney injury (9). We performed a reversal study in this model and characterized the extent of scarring in the kidney 10 d after the initial U-IRI. Cir- culating DKK-1 inhibited myofibroblast accumulation, inflamma- tion, and interstitial fibrosis and reduced epithelial injury (Fig. S4 E-K) sufficiently to reverse existent fibrosis (Fig. S4L).  DKK-1 Blocks PDGF-Stimulated Proliferation of Kidney Pericytes by an LRP-6, P42/P44 MAPK-Dependent Mechanism. To study the mecha- nism of action of DKK-1, we tested its effects on primary kidney pericyte cultures, the precursors of myofibroblasts (2, 13). PDGF and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in pericytes are important factors in the detachment of pericytes from capillaries and their transition to myofibroblasts (3, 14) and as such are important factors in driving fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and its homolog CCN1 (Cyr61) also have been implicated in fibrosis and wound healing (15). Pericytes were stimulated by PDGF-BB to enter the cell cycle (Fig. 4A), but other profibrogenic growth fac- tors had no effect. Unexpectedly, exogenous addition of WNT3a did not stimulate proliferation. DKK-1 markedly attenuated PDGF-BB-stimulated proliferation (Fig. 4B). PDGF stimulation down-regulated transcripts for the activation markers CTGF, \u03b1SMA, and collagen I\u03b1 (1), and DKK-1 further down-regulated those transcripts (Fig. 4C), suggesting that DKK-1 therefore may enhance certain PDGF-mediated transcriptional events. None of the factors applied to pericytes affected viability (Fig. 4D). In keeping with a link between PDGF signaling and the WNT  pathway in pericyte proliferation, PDGF regulates a number of WNT ligands, including up-regulating Wnt2 and 5a and down- regulating Wnt7a, 10a, and 16 (Fig. 4E). However, inconsistent with such a link, exogenous WNT3a had no stimulatory effect on proliferation (Fig. 4A). Because DKK-1 acts via LRP-5 and LRP-6, and because PDGF regulates WNT transcripts (Fig. 4E), we expected DKK-1 to block the endogenous WNT/\u03b2-catenin  Fig. 3.

Binding of WNT ligands to Fzd receptors and LRP-6 coreceptors leads to activation and phosphorylation of LRP-6 (pLRP-6). Surprisingly therefore, PDGF-BB alone stimulates  pLRP-6 (Fig. 4F), and DKK-1 initially augments pLRP-6 mod- estly and inhibits it only at later time points (Fig. 4F and Fig. S5 A-C), indicating that PDGF may coactivate the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway and that DKK-1 regulates this coactivation. To test this possibility, we assessed whether PDGF-BB regulates the WNT/ \u03b2-catenin pathway in pericytes cultured from the \u03b2-catenin re- porter mouse (TCF/Lef:H2B-GFPTr) (Fig. 4G). After 16 h with PDGF, nuclear \u03b2-catenin activity was increased significantly. This increase was inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 4G), although the extent of \u03b2-catenin activation was much lower than the extent of cells triggered into the cell cycle (Fig. 4A), a finding that is consistent with the possibility that DKK-1 inhibits proliferation by a \u03b2-catenin-independent pathway. We therefore explored signaling pathways activated by PDGF-  BB but inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 4H and Fig. S5D). PDGF-BB stimulates the P42/P44 MAPK and the JNK signaling pathways. DKK-1 inhibits both these responses. PDGF-BB activates the P38 MAPK pathway, but DKK-1 enhances this response, perhaps explaining why DKK-1 can enhance PDGF-mediated transcrip- tion (Fig. 4C). As expected, PDGF-BB enhances cyclin D1 ex- pression (Fig. 4H and Fig. S5D), an effect inhibited by DKK-1. Although WNT3a alone had no apparent impact on cell prolif- eration (Fig. 4A), it nevertheless stimulated the activation of LRP-6 and accumulation of cyclin D1 (Fig. S5E), providing ev- idence that LRP-6 activation by PDGF-BB results in distinct signaling vs. activation by WNT3a. Because DKK-1 specifically inhibits PDGF-stimulated P42/  P44 MAPK and JNK activation (Fig. 4H), the relative impor- tance of these pathways was tested using specific inhibitors. The P42/P44 inhibitor U0126 completely replaced DKK-1 function in PDGF-BB-stimulated pericyte proliferation (Fig. 4I), whereas the JNK inhibitor SP600125 had no impact. Because there was no apparent linkage between the PDGF-BB-mediated activation of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway and its capacity to stimulate proliferation, we tested whether the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway is necessary for PDGF-mediated proliferation using a small-molecule inhibitor of \u03b2-catenin, XAV939 (a Tankyrase inhibitor). Strikingly, XAV939 had no effect (Fig. 4I). To con- firm this finding, cultured pericytes from kidneys homozygous for the floxed alleles of \u03b2-catenin (Ctnnb1fl/fl) underwent recombi- nation in vitro by transduction with Lenti-Cre virus, and Lenti- GFP virus was used as a control that does not catalyze recom- bination. One hundred percent of pericytes were transduced by GFP expression, and \u03b2-catenin protein was lost 48 h after trans- duction with Lenti-Cre (Fig. S6). Pericytes lacking \u03b2-catenin responded to PDGF and its inhibition by DKK-1 similarly to pericytes with \u03b2-catenin (Fig. 4J), confirming that PDGF stim- ulates and DKK-1 inhibits proliferation independently of the canonical WNT pathway, even though LRP-6 is activated. To study whether DKK-1 mediates its effects through an alternative cell-surface signaling mechanism or whether LRP-6 is necessary for the PDGF signaling pathway in this context, we immunopre- cipitated PDGFR\u03b2 from pericytes and pulled down active pLRP- 6 only when the receptor was engaged with ligand (Fig. 4K), in- dicating a close relationship between the two receptors at the time of signaling. Next, we overexpressed dominant-negative mutated forms of LRP-6 in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (3T3) that endogenously expresses PDGFR\u03b2 (Fig. 4L and Fig. S6). Expression of two different dominant-negative forms of LRP-6, but not theWT form, was sufficient to inhibit proliferation of 3T3 cells in response to PDGF-BB and to prevent DKK-1 effects (Fig. 4L), indicating that DKK-1 inhibits proliferation through signal- ing via LRP-6 and revealing that LRP-6 can be detected in a complex containing PDGFR\u03b2. Finally, because LRP-6 is required for PDGF-induced proliferation, we assessed whether WNT ligands are necessary for PDGF responses by blocking WNT se- cretion in pericytes using the Porcupine homolog inhibitor, IWP2 (Fig. S7). Porcupine homolog is required for palmitoylation and secretion of all WNTs from cells (16). IWP2, blocked PDGF- stimulated proliferation in a dose-dependent manner without affecting viability, suggesting that WNT engagement of LRP-6 at the cell surface is necessary for PDGF responses in pericytes.

Our in vivo stud- ies showed that DKK-1 prevents pericyte activation, detachment from capillaries, migration, and expression of the myofibroblast marker \u03b1SMA (Fig. 3). Previous and current studies (2, 14) suggest that PDGFR signaling does not affect these pericyte changes directly. Therefore we tested the effect of DKK-1 on pericyte activation and migration in response to other cytokines implicated in these processes (17, 18). In contrast to PDGF, TGF-\u03b2markedly and rapidly stimulates pericyte migration (Fig. 5 A-C), and over 48-72 h up-regulates collagen genes and the in- termediate filament \u03b1SMA (Fig. 5D). Similar observations on migration were made by treatment of pericytes with CTGF (Fig. 5 C andD), an extracellular protein that may signal via \u03b21-integrins, LRP-1, and possibly LRP-6 (19), and with CCN1 (Fig. S8A). TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF promote marked cytoskeletal reorganization of contractile filaments in pericytes after 24 h of cytokine treat- ment (Fig. 5E). DKK-1 inhibits all migratory, activatory, and cytoskeletal changes in pericytes in response to TGF-\u03b2 or CTGF (Fig. 5 A-E) but has no impact on migration in response to CCN1 (Fig. S8A). Strikingly, primary cultures of kidney epithelial cells have high endogenous migration that is weakly responsive to these cytokines. DKK-1 has a nonsignificant effect on these cul- tures (Fig. S3), suggesting DKK-1 has a major effect on pericytes, not epithelium. We next tested the impact of DKK-1 on activation of LRP-6  in the context of these activating ligands. TGF-\u03b2, and CTGF both activate LRP-6 within minutes of cytokine exposure, and, as ex- pected, WNT3a also stimulates LRP-6 activation (Fig. 5F and Figs. S5E and S8B). Within 10 min, DKK-1 weakly activates LRP- 6 (Fig. S5C) and does not block the activation triggered by TGF-\u03b2 orWNT3a (Fig. 5F and Fig. S8). However, LRP-6 was deactivated by DKK-1 in all activation conditions after 16 h (Fig. S5), indi- cating LRP-6 is activated rapidly by non-WNT ligands and DKK-1 either augments that signal weakly or does not affect it initially but silences it only at later time points. Because DKK-1 blocks TGF- \u03b2-mediated changes to pericytes, we tested whether TGF-\u03b2 signals via the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway directly or indirectly. TGF-\u03b2 reg- ulates WNT ligands in pericytes at 24 h (up-regulating Wnt2, 9a, and 11 and down-regulating Wnt2b and 16) (Fig. 5G), but DKK-1 had no impact on these changes. Both TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF triggered nuclear \u03b2-catenin activity in pericytes (Fig. 5H); this activity was inhibited by DKK-1, but, as with PDGF, the effect occurred in a minority of cells, suggesting that TGF-\u03b2 and CTGFmay regulate pericyte activation via aWNT/\u03b2-catenin-independent pathway and that DKK-1 may inhibit pericyte activation via that same pathway. We tested the effect of DKK-1 on TGF-\u03b2- and CTGF-medi-  ated signaling. Both TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF stimulate the P42/P44, P38, and JNK pathways. DKK-1 blocks activation of the P42/44 and JNK pathways and augments activation of the P38 pathway (Fig. 5 I and J). As expected, FAK is activated by both TGF-\u03b2 and CTGF and is inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 5 I and J). To test whether components of these DKK-1-regulated signaling cas- cades are responsible for the impact on migration, we measured the effect of DKK-1 on TGF-\u03b2 activation of the canonical SMAD activation pathway (Fig. S8C), which was not affected. Next we used small-molecule inhibitors of activation of TGF\u03b2R1 (SB431542), JNK (SP600125), P42/P44 (U0126), or \u03b2-catenin (XAV939) in TGF-\u03b2- or CTGF-stimulated migration assays. P42/P44, TGF\u03b2R1, and \u03b2-catenin inhibitors had no significant effect on TGF-\u03b2-stimulated migration, but JNK inhibitors blocked migration to TGF-\u03b2 completely (Fig. 5K and Fig. S8D), suggesting DKK-1-mediated silencing of JNK signaling is central to its ability to block TGF-\u03b2-stimulated migration. Inhibition of CTGF-mediated migration was independent of TGF\u03b2R1 activa- tion, was partially dependent on \u03b2-catenin and P42/P44 activa- tion, and was most dependent on JNK activation (Fig. 5L), highlighting similarities to and differences from TGF-\u03b2-mediated migration. CCN1-mediated migration occurred independently of P42/44 and JNK pathways (Fig. S8A). Because XAV939 showed little effect on TGF-\u03b2-mediated migration, we generated peri- cytes lacking \u03b2-catenin as described above (Fig. 4J). Compared  with controls, in the absence of \u03b2-catenin, DKK-1 completely blocked TGF-\u03b2-stimulated migration (Fig. 5M). However, overall (nonstimulated) migration was reduced in the absence of \u03b2-catenin, indicating that DKK-1 can function independently of WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling but that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway  Fig. 5.

To test whether LRP-6 also associated with the TGF\u03b2R complex, TGF\u03b2R1 was immunoprecipitated, and pLRP-6 was coprecipi- tated in resting cells. This association increased upon active sig- naling (Fig. 5N). To determine the role of LRP-6 in TGF- \u03b2-stimulated migration, we studied expression of the dominant- negative LRP-6 mutants in fibroblasts, as described above (Fig. 4L). Strikingly, although TGF-\u03b2-mediated migration occurred in the presence of mutant LRP-6, DKK-1 was now ineffective (Fig. 5O). Therefore, DKK-1 inhibits TGF-\u03b2 migration by an LRP-6- dependent mechanism, and active LRP-6 can be detected in a signaling complex with TGF\u03b2R1. That TGF-\u03b2 stimulates mi- gration in the presence of dominant-negative LRP-6 but DKK-1 no longer functions suggests that the endogenous LRP-6 still may be able to interact with TGF-\u03b2, whereas DKK-1 binds equally to the mutant forms; further studies will be required to understand LRP-6 interactions with TGF\u03b2R1. Finally, to test the role ofWNTs in TGF-\u03b2-mediated migration and in DKK-1 inhibition, we blockedWNT secretion using IWP2 as described above (Fig. S7). In this setting TGF-\u03b2-stimulated migration was blocked com- pletely, suggestingWNT engagement of LRP-6 at the cell surface is necessary for TGF-\u03b2 response in pericytes. These studies identify LRP-6 and signaling pathways down-  stream of LRP-6 as therapeutic targets to intervene in fibro- genesis of the kidney. In addition, they identify the soluble pro- tein DKK-1 and its receptor LRP-6 as important cofactors in multiple signaling pathways activated by TGF-\u03b2, CTGF, and PDGF (Fig. S8E). Because these multiple pathways are known to contribute to the development of fibrosis and its longer-term consequences on organ function, therapeutically delivered DKK- 1 or therapeutic targeting of the LRP-6 receptor are attractive strategies for treating fibrosis, microvascular inflammation, tubule injury, and microvascular rarefaction. Recent studies indicate that mesenchyme-derived cells, either pericytes or resident fibroblasts, are present in all organs and tissues and are the primary source of scar-forming myofibroblasts in multiple tissues (2, 20). Therefore it is likely that the DKK-1/LRP-6 signaling pathway regulates fibrogenesis in multiple organs and tissues. The MAPK signaling pathways from TGF\u03b2R signaling, CTGF  signaling, and PDGFR signaling appear to be functionally critical in the mesenchyme-derived perivascular cells in kidney. These pathways have received relatively little attention, and earlier studies have assumed that the canonical pathways activated by these receptors have been dominant in the process of fibrogenesis (14, 21); further studies should focus on these pathways in peri- cytes and fibroblasts. Our studies show that LRP-6 (and poten- tially LRP-5), when bound by WNT ligands, interacts physically with PDGFR\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2R1 upon cognate ligand interaction (Fig. S8E). It is possible, therefore, that LRP-6 is responsible for  transducing the signal that activates the MAPK pathways. Fur- ther studies should address this question. The fact that LRP-6 can function as a coreceptor for multiple pathways raises the question whether it requires an extracellular ligand, distinct from WNT ligands, to effect this interaction. It is likely that soluble ligands such as TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF are presented at the cell surface bound to extracellular modulators and that these complexes may bind to and be responsible for the recruitment of LRP-6. The studies also indicate that in pericytes and myofibroblasts CTGF activates cells independently of TGF-\u03b2, whereas previous reports have sug- gested CTGF augments TGF-\u03b2 responses in fibrogenesis. These studies suggest CTGF has a distinct receptor on pericytes and myofibroblasts that has not been fully appreciated. Further studies should define the CTGF receptor in these cells and the interaction of LRP-6 with that receptor. Genetic studies of LRP-6 and LRP-5 function in mice point to  their major role in WNT pathway signal transduction in early and later embryogenesis (5). However, the initial studies suggested that LRP-5/LRP-6 mutations interfered with other signaling pathways, including FGFR1 and Notch Delta (22). Recently, LRP-6 mutations have been found not only in humans with re- duced bone mineral density but also in patients with premature cardiovascular disease (4, 5). These reports also have suggested a potential link between LRP-6 and PDGFR signaling. In the context of our current findings, these studies suggest that LRP-6 may regulate multiple signaling pathways in mesenchyme-de- rived cells that play critical roles in bone mineralization, arterial wall functions, and microvascular wall functions. We conclude that DKK-1 is antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory  by inhibiting multiple signaling pathways in pericytes and myofi- broblasts through binding to the cell-surface receptors LRP-5/-6, which in turn act as coreceptors for multiple signaling pathways.  Materials and Methods Mouse Models. Col1a1-GFPTr (Coll-GFP), Axin2+/acz, and TCF/Lef:H2B-GFPTr  mice were generated and maintained, and genotyping was performed as described (11, 12). Ctnn1fl/fl mice were obtained from Jackson Labs. All studies were conducted in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Washington.  Statistical Analysis. Performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software). Significance was evaluated by one-way ANOVA.  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. We thank Dr. Xi He, Dr. Roel Goldschmeding, Dr. William B.
