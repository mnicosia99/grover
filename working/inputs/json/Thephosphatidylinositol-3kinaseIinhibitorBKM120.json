    "summary": "Melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24 (mda-7/IL-24) displays a broad range of antitumor properties including cancer-specific induction of apoptosis, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and modulation of antitumor immune responses. In our study, we elucidated the role of MDA-7/IL-24 in inhibiting growth of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells. Ad.mda-7 infection decreased proliferation of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells without affecting normal breast stem cells. Ad.mda-7 induced apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in breast cancer-initiating/stem cells similar to unsorted breast cancer cells and inhibited the self-renewal property of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells by suppressing Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Prevention of inhibition of Wnt signaling by LiCl increased cell survival upon Ad.mda-7 treatment, suggesting that Wnt signaling inhibition might play a key role in MDA-7/IL-24-mediated death of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells. In a nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft model, Ad.mda-7 injection profoundly inhibited growth of tumors generated from breast cancer-initiating/stem cells and also exerted a potent \"bystander\" activity inhibiting growth of distant uninjected tumors. Further studies revealed that tumor growth inhibition by Ad.mda-7 was associated with a decrease in proliferation and angiogenesis, two intrinsic features of MDA-7/IL-24, and a reduction in vivo in the percentage of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells. Our findings demonstrate that MDA-7/IL-24 is not only nontoxic to normal cells and normal stem cells but also can kill both unsorted cancer cells and enriched populations of cancer-initiating/stem cells, providing further documentation that MDA-7/IL-24 might be a safe and effective way to eradicate cancers and also potentially establish disease-free survival.",

  The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase I inhibitor BKM120 induces  cell death in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro  Lilian Amrein, May Shawi, Jeremy Grenier, Raquel Aloyz, and Lawrence Panasci Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Lady Davis Institute-Segal  Cancer Center from the Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada  Abstract  BKM120, a pan class I PI3K inhibitor, was cytotoxic in the majority of primary B-chronic   lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes, including samples from patients who have a high-risk   for poor response to treatment (patient with del11 and del17) at clinically obtainable   concentrations. The PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor Cal-101 is cytotoxic in B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro and is  active in the treatment of CLL in vivo. Interestingly, we demonstrated that BKM120 is 3.6 fold  more toxic than Cal-101 in malignant B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro. BKM120 cytotoxicity  correlated with the basal expression of proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway. A protein   signature of PI3K pathway proteins predicts the response to BKM120 treatment. In the primary B-  CLL lymphocytes tested in vitro, BKM120 decreased the phosphorylation status of molecular  biomarkers used as indicators of PI3K pathway inhibition in vivo. Also, BKM120 induced  apoptosis in primary B-CLL cells culture in the presence and absence of stromal cell support. Our   findings suggest that BKM120 should be tested clinically in CLL.  Keywords  chronic lymphocytic leukemia; BKM120; PI3K; leukemia therapy; CLL apoptosis  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of malignant B   lymphocytes expressing the surface antigens CD19, CD20, CD23 and CD5.1 These B-CLL   cells display altered apoptosis that is caused by both primary tumor features and co-  dependent stromal elements.2 Current treatments for this disease include chemotherapeutic   [alkylating agents (chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, bendamustine)], purine analogs   (Fludarabine) and immunotherapeutic agents (Rituximab, Alemtuzumab) or the combination   of immunotherapy with chemotherapeutics drugs [the gold standard for CLL treatment is   now fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR)]. However, none of these standard   treatments result in curative therapy supporting the need for the investigation of new   therapeutic targets and drug development in CLL as well as markers that can predict the   clinical response to these treatments.3  Correspondence to: Lawrence Panasci or Raquel Aloyz, 3755 Cote Ste Catherine Road, H3T 1E2, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Tel.:  +514-3408248, Fax: +514-3408302, lpanasci@hotmail.com or raquel.aloyz@mcgill.ca.

Overexpression of PI3K appears to play a critical   role in B-CLL cell survival. Freshly isolated CLL lymphocytes have high levels of NF-\u03baB  activity and loss of NF-\u03baB and Akt activity is associated with apoptosis.6-8 Cal-101 is a  specific inhibitor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; the delta isoform is   expressed primarily in hematopoietic lineages and is functionally important in B cells.   Preclinical data suggest that Cal-101 is cytotoxic to CLL in vitro.8 At the 2010 ASH  meeting, results were presented of a phase I study of 37 patients with CLL who were treated   with Cal-101.9 Patients had a median of five prior regimens; 65% were refractory to their   most recent prior regimen; 81% had bulky lymphadenopathy; and 36% of the patients had   del17. All patients showed reduction in lymphadenopathy with 80% achieving a nodal   response. However, concomitant with the decrease in lymphadenopathy there was an   increase in lymphocytosis in about 60% of patients over the first 1-2 months of therapy. This   lymphocytosis appeared to represent a redistribution of lymphocytes from lymph nodes and   bone marrow to peripheral blood; it generally peaked by month 2, after which it slowly   resolved. Patients generally experienced significant clinical benefit from the improvement in   lymphadenopathy, with no negative consequences from the lymphocytosis. The   lymphocytosis did limit the response rate, however, to 26%. Thus, Cal-101 is active in the   treatment of refractory CLL. Currently, the pan class I PI3K inhibitor BKM120 developed   by Novartis is under investigation in phase I and II clinical trials in advanced solid tumor   patients8,10 (clinicaltrials.gov).  Material and Methods  Patients  Sixty-five patients with a diagnosis of B-CLL followed at the Jewish General Hospital of   Montreal were enrolled in the study after informed consent. Patients were either clinically   untreated (n = 36) or treated with chemotherapy (n = 29) for various time periods  (Supporting Information Table 1).  Cell lines  The three B-CLL cell lines JVM2, EHEB and MEC2 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany)   were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), complemented with 10% fetal bovine   serum (FBS). BMS2 stromal cell line were maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle   medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS.  Amrein et al. Page 2  Int J Cancer.

The CLL lymphocytes (3 \u00d7 106   cells/ml) were treated with various concentrations of BKM120 (0.2-20 \u03bcM) (Novartis   Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) or Cal-101 (0.4-50 \u03bcM) (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA).   Control samples were incubated with the greatest volume of DMSO. The MTT assay was   performed 72 h after treatment as previously described12 and the cytotoxic effect of the drug   presented as the IC50 (the drug concentration resulting in 50% of control).  Western blot analysis  Cell lysates (50 \u03bcg/sample) and protein migration were obtained as described before.13 The   antibodies utilized were: 4E-BP1, 4E-BP1 (Thr37/46), Akt, Akt (Ser473), mTor, p70S6K,   p70S6K (Thr389), PTEN, raptor and rictor (Cell signalling Technology, Danvers, MA) and   actin, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The blots were developed using the   appropriate HRP-secondary antibodies [anti-mouse (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), anti-  rabbit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) or anti-goat (Santa Cruz)] and ECL (GE Healthcare).   Protein levels were quantified by densitometry with Scion image software (Scion   Corporation, Frederick, MA) and normalized to actin or the total protein expression for the   phosphorylated form of the protein.  Apoptosis assay  For this assay, 3 \u00d7 106 cells were treated with the DMSO or BKM120 IC50 in the presence   or absence of stromal cell for 24 hr. The induction of apoptosis was determined using the   APC AnnexinV/Dead cell apoptosis kit (Invitrogen).  Statistical analysis  The Pearson Product Moment Correlation and t-testing were used for the correlative analysis  of predictive biomarkers. The protein expression correlation with BKM120 cytotoxicty with   the best p values were utilized to generate Figure 1c. Statistical analyses were performed by  Friedman Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance on Ranks followed by Bonferroni t-test   with SigmaStat software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).  Results and Discussion  In view of the critical role of PI3K in CLL homeostasis, the activity of BKM120 was   examined in primary B-CLL lymphocytes and in B-CLL cell lines. The in vitro cytotoxic  effect of BKM120 was assessed in 3 B-CLL cell lines and in primary B-lymphocytes   isolated from the 65 B-CLL patients enrolled in our study (Supporting Information Table 1)   utilizing the MTT assay. The IC50 (drug concentration resulting in 50% cell death) obtained   in the B-CLL cell lines JVM2, EHEB and MEC2 were 0.9 \u00b1 0.1, 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 and 0.7 \u00b1 0.1 \u03bcM,   respectively. BKM120 was cytotoxic (IC50 below the maximum concentration (20 \u03bcM) of   BKM120 used in the MTT assay) in 78% of the primary B-CLL lymphocytes samples   tested. There are subsets of patients such as those with 17p (del17) or 11q (del11) deletions,   who have a high-risk for poor response to treatment.14 In our study, BKM120 is cytotoxic in   Amrein et al.

In the phase I clinical study, the maximum plasma concentration   (Cmax) of BKM120 obtained after administration of the maximum tolerated dose of the   drug was 5 \u03bcM.15 Interestingly, 60% of the B-CLL samples tested in our study have an IC50  below the Cmax. Furthermore, five of six patient samples with del11 or del17 have a   clinically achievable IC50. These results indicated that BKM120 may be useful as a single   agent in CLL therapy (Fig. 1a, Supporting Information Table 2). Previous studies have  shown that the PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor CAL-101 is cytotoxic in B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro.8,16   We therefore compared, by MTT assay, both PI3K inhibitors for their potency to induce cell   death in 20 primary B-CLL cells samples and demonstrated that BKM120 is 3.6 fold more   toxic than CAL-101 in malignant B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro (Fig. 1b, Supporting  Information Table 2). Furthermore, BKM120 is cytotoxic (IC50 < 20 \u03bcM) in 80% of these 20   samples tested while CAL-101 is only cytotoxic (IC50 < 50 \u03bcM) in 45% of these samples.   CLL has a widely variable response to therapy. Thus, we were interested in identifying   molecular features that can predict response to BKM120 treatment. We analyzed our   samples for somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin variable region (IgVH) genes and   CD38 expression profiles as well as the basal expression of proteins involved in the   PI3K/Akt pathway. Data Analysis with the Pearson product moment correlation test   demonstrated positive correlations between BKM120 cytotoxicity and the basal expression   of Akt (r = 0.592, p = 2.468E-06, n = 54), rictor (r = 0.418; p = 1.65E-03; n = 54), raptor (r =  0.463; p = 4.5E-03; n = 54), p70S6K (r = 0.584, p = 3.561E-06, n = 54) and 4E-BP1 (r =  0.371, p = 5.75E-03, n = 54) but not with PTEN, mTor, IgVH or CD38 expression. To  further analyze these predictive markers, we used the mean expression value for each protein   as a cut-off and, segregated the samples in two groups, samples with low level of basal   protein expression (below the cut-off) and high level of basal protein expression (above the   cut-off). We then simultaneously examine these different correlative markers together. We   demonstrated that all patients with a BKM120 IC50 \u2264 3 \u03bcM expressed low level of raptor   and p70S6K (Fig. 1c). Thereby, simultaneous expression of low basal level of these two  proteins may be useful to predict response to BKM120.  To determine whether the cytotoxic effect observed in our study was related to BKM120-  induced PI3K inhibition, we investigated the phosphorylation status of Akt, a direct   downstream target of PI3K in the three cell lines. In all cell lines, including the p53 mutated   cell line MEC2, BKM120 inhibits Akt phosphorylation (Akt S473) 24 hr after treatment   (Fig. 1d). In vitro studies have identified that stromal cells promoted cell survival and drug  resistance of B-CLL lymphocytes by cell-cell interaction and secretion of chemokines.17   Furthermore, bone marrow microenvironment modulates the PI3K/Akt pathway and   prevents apoptosis of primary CLL lymphocytes.18 To determine whether stromal cells can   protect B-CLL against BKM120 activity, six primary B-CLL samples were tested for   AnnexinV/7-AAD staining 24 hr after BKM120 treatment in the presence or absence of the   murine stromal cells BMS2. In the absence of BMS2 stromal cell support, BKM120 induced   apoptosis in the six primary B-CLL lymphocytes samples tested (mean AnnexinV positive   cells: DMSO = 17.2 \u00b1 3.7% vs. BKM = 33.2 \u00b1 5.5%; p < 0.001). As previously described17   the stromal cells protected B-CLL lymphocytes from apoptosis (DMSO = 17.2 \u00b1 3.7% vs.  BMS2 + DMSO = 5.6 \u00b1 1.1%; p = 0.004) but were not able to protect these malignant   Amrein et al.

The same results were obtained when we assessed the  cleavage of caspase-3 (Supporting Information Fig. 2). There is increasing evidence that the   major cause of resistance to therapy in CLL patients is a consequence of a small number of   leukemic cells that remain. This phenomenon, called minimal residual disease (MRD), is in   part a consequence of protection conferred by the stromal microenvironment to the   malignant lymphocytes and eradication of MRD by alemtuzumab treatment improved   overall and treatment-free survival in CLL patients.17,19 Interestingly, our results   demonstrated that the stromal cell microenvironment can not protect B-CLL lymphocytes   from apoptosis induced by BKM120 treatment.  Molecular biomarkers such as p70S6K and 4E-BP1 have been used as indicators of PI3K   pathway inhibition in vivo and BKM120 inhibits p70S6K phosphorylation in rat fibro-blast  cell lines in vitro.20,21 We demonstrated that the BKM120 IC50s correlated with basal  p70S6K and 4E-BP1 protein expression in primary B-CLL lymphocytes. We then assessed   in vitro the phosphorylation status of these two proteins used as biomarkers in vivo, in 8  (p70S6K T389) and 11 (4E-BP1 T37/46) primary B-CLL samples after treatment with   BKM120. Results demonstrated that after 24 hr treatment, BKM120 decreased the   phosphorylation status of 4E-BP1 (Figs. 2c and 2d) and p70S6K (Figs. 2e and 2f).  Although many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis, CLL is a progressive disease and   patients eventually require treatment. The main problems during the treatment of patients   living with CLL are the side effects of therapies and the resistance developed by malignant   cells after these treatments. Thereby, no current standard treatment option results in curative   therapy, and all patients eventually die. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the   class I PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may be useful as a single agent in CLL patients   independently of their IgVh mutational status, CD38 expression or genomic deletions (del11   and del17). Furthermore, a combination of different biomarkers (expression of raptor and   p70S6K) may predict the response to BKM120 treatment. Also, BKM120 abolished the   protection against apoptosis and drug resistance conferred by the microenvironment to the   primary B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro. Our preclinical study demonstrated that BKM120, a  molecule with acceptable clinical toxicity,15 may be useful in the treatment of CLL.

None of the standard treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) result in   curative therapy. In view of the critical role of PI3K in CLL homeostasis, here the authors   examine the activity of the pan class I PI3K inhibitor BKM120. They find that clinically   achievable concentrations of BKM120 have antitumor activity in CLL lymphocytes   associated with down-regulation of the PI3K pathway in vitro. They identify a protein  signature predicting BKM120 sensitivity in CLL lymphocytes. Moreover, BKM120   presents significantly greater cytotoxicity than the PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor Cal-101, which is  especially relevant since Cal-101 has known antitumor activity in relapsed CLL patients.
