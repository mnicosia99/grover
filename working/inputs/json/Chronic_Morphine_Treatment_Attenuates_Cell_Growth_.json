    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

It is currently thought that these effects are mediated by transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-controlled ERK1/2 and Akt signalling. The growth of many breast cancer cells is dependent on hyperactive ErbB receptor networks and one of the most successful approaches in antineoplastic therapy during the last decade was the development of ErbB-targeted therapies. However, the response rates of single therapies are often poor and resistance mechanisms evolve rapidly. To date there is no information about the ability of opioid analgesics to interfere with the growth of ErbB-driven cancers.  Methods and Principal Findings: Here we demonstrate that ErbB2 overexpressing BT474 human breast cancer cells carry fully functional endogenous m-opioid receptors. Most interestingly, the acute opioid effects on basal and Heregulin- stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation changed considerably during chronic Morphine treatment. Investigation of the underlying mechanism by the use of protein kinase inhibitors and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that chronic Morphine treatment results in rearrangement of the ErbB signalling network leading to dissociation of ERK1/2 from Akt signalling and a switch from ErbB1/ErbB3 to ErbB1/ErbB2-dependent cell growth. In chronically Morphine-treated cells Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling is redirected via a newly established PI3K- and metalloproteinase-dependent feedback loop. Together, these alterations result in apoptosis of BT474 cells. A similar switch in Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling from an ErbB2-independent to an ErbB2-, PI3K- and metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism was also observed in k-opioid receptor expressing SKBR3 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells.  Conclusions and Significance: The present data demonstrate that the ErbB receptor network of human breast cancer cells represents a target for chronic Morphine treatment. Rearrangement of ErbB signalling by chronic Morphine may provide a promising strategy to enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to ErbB-directed therapies and to prevent the development of escape mechanisms.

They mediate  their action via specific binding sites (d, k, m) that belong to the family of G protein-coupled receptors. Opioid receptors are  predominantly expressed in neuronal tissues and inhibit neuronal  excitability by regulating their \u2018\u2018classical'' effector systems adenylyl  cyclase, potassium channels and voltage-dependent calcium  currents [1]. Beside this, opioid receptors may also regulate the  activity of a variety of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases,  including Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/  2), c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38, Signal Transducer and  Activator of Transcription 5 (STAT5) and Protein Kinase B  (PKB/Akt) [2,3]. Activation of these \u2018\u2018non classical'' opioid  effector systems is mediated via transactivation of receptor tyrosine  kinase (RTK)-associated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling pathways  [4,5]. Due to the ability of opioid receptors to regulate the  dominant RTK system in a given cellular context [6], chronic  opioid treatment might provide a means to selectively interfere  with tumour cell growth. Because the opioid effects on tumour cell  proliferation and apoptosis reported so far are rather discrepant  and role of opioid receptors in these studies was not always clear  [7,8], the aim of the present study was to investigate chronic  Morphine regulation of RTK-dependent cell growth in a defined  tumour cell model carrying endogenous m-opioid receptors. The human Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Receptor family  (ErbB, also termed HER) consists of four members (ErbB1-4) and  belongs to subclass I of the superfamily of RTKs. They are  activated by more than 10 different growth factor ligands with  partly overlapping (EGF, HB-EGF, TGF-a, and Betacellulin) or more discrete (Neuregulins) receptor specificities [9]. ErbB  receptors are transmembrane receptors consisting of an extracel-  lular ligand binding domain, an intracellular kinase domain and  an intracellular C-terminal tail. Ligand binding favours receptor  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510    dimerization, which in turn leads to activation of the intracellular  kinase domain and autophosphorylation of distinct tyrosine  residues in the C-terminal tail. These provide docking sites for  binding of the Shc/Grb2/SOS complex linking ErbB receptors to  activation of the mitogenic Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signalling module  [10]. Although structurally highly homologous, individual ErbB  receptors differ with respect to ligand binding and kinase activity.  Most importantly, there is currently no endogenous ligand known  for ErbB2 [11], whereas ErbB3 lacks catalytic tyrosine kinase  activity [12]. Thus, both receptors must undergo heterodimeriza-  tion for signalling. While ErbB2 is considered a signal amplifier,  activated ErbB3 signal through their dimerization partner. In  ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, ligand activation of ErbB3 results in  ErbB1-mediated stimulation of the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway.  While all ErbB family members are able to cross-regulate the anti-  apoptotic Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in a  Ras-dependent manner, ErbB3 may also directly activate all 3  regulatory subunits of PI3K in the presence of ligand activated  binding partners [13]. Due to the ability of ErbB receptors to form  multiple homo- and heterodimers that considerably differ in their  signalling capacity, alterations in receptor abundance and  dimerization will have dramatic consequences on mitogenic and  anti-apoptotic signalling [9].  Human BT474 breast cancer cells were originally isolated from  a solid, invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast from a 60 years old  woman [14]. These cells are characterized by a dysregulated ErbB  receptor system, because they overexpress the ErbB2 receptor  [11]. ErbB2 is present in about 25-30% of breast cancer patients  [15] and is associated with poor prognosis and high relapse rate  [11]. BT474 cells also carry physiologic levels of ErbB1 and ErbB3  and low levels of ErbB4 [16], providing them a suitable model  system for investigating the impact of ErbB signalling on tumour  cell growth and ErbB2-targeted anti-tumour strategies [17]. In the  present study we demonstrate that BT474 cells carry endogenous  m-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine treatment attenu- ates Heregulin-induced cell growth and migration. The underlying  mechanism involves dissociation of Heregulin-induced ERK1/2  and Akt signalling from a common ErbB1/ErbB3 to separate  ErbB1/ErbB2 and ErbB1/ErbB3 mechanisms resulting in PI3K-  dependent cell growth. Similar chronic Morphine effects on ErbB  signalling were also observed in ErbB2 overexpressing SKBR3  human mammary adenocarcinoma cells that carry endogenous k- opioid receptors. These results demonstrate that chronic Mor-  phine treatment is able to interfere with the growth characteristics  of opioid receptor expressing tumour cells by rearrangement of the  ErbB receptor system. Such a mechanism might provide a  promising strategy to enhance the sensitivity of ErbB-directed  antineoplastic strategies and to prevent escape mechanisms.

Anti-G protein antibodies  have been produced in our laboratory (Gia2, Gia3, Gsa, Gb) or  were obtained from Gramsch Laboratories (Gq/11a, G12a, G13a, G14a). Primary antibodies recognizing ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/ 2 [Thr202/Tyr204], Akt, phospho-Akt [Ser473], ErbB1, ErbB2,  ErbB3, ErbB4, b-tubulin as well as cleaved PARP [Asp214] were from Cell Signalling Technology. Secondary horseradish perox-  idase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from  Promega and Cell Signalling.  Cell Culture, Chronic Opioid Treatment and Membrane Preparation  BT474 cells were purchased from Cell Lines Service Inc. and  grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-  inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml Penicillin, 0.1 mg/  ml Streptomycin, 0.2% Enrofloxacin and 0.02 mg/ml Insulin at  37uC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. SKBR3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)  and grown in McCoy's 5A modified medium plus supplements as  above. For experimentation, BT474 cells were seeded onto 96-,  24-, 12- and 6 well dishes as indicated at a density of 0.256104- 56105 cells per well, left to adhere overnight and then subjected to chronic opioid treatment by the addition of Morphine (10 mM) to the culture medium for 5 d with medium changes and drug  renewal every other day.  For evaluation of membrane proteins (m-opioid and ErbB receptors, G proteins) and radioligand binding studies, cells were  grown in 75 or 150 cm2 culture flasks and plasma membranes  were prepared as described [18]. In brief, cells were washed 3  times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH7.4),  scraped into 20 ml of TED buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM  EDTA, and 1 mM DTT; pH 7.4) and then homogenized for  10 sec using an Ultra Turrax. After removal of unbroken cells  (3006g; 10 min), membranes were recovered from the superna- tant fraction by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,0006g. The membrane pellet was washed once as above, resuspended in TM  buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2; pH 7.4) and stored in  aliquots at 280uC until use.  RT-PCR Total RNA was isolated using Trifast  TM reagent (Peqlab) and  transcribed into cDNA using the Fist Strand cDNA Synthesis KitH (Fermentas) according to manufacturers protocols. Integrity of  cDNA was controlled by determination of GAPDH. Opioid  receptors (OR) and adenylyl cyclase isoforms (AC) were amplified  using specific primer pairs given in Table 1. All PCR reactions  (50 ml) contained 10 pmol of each primer, 10 ng of cDNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.25 U Pfu DNA polymerase and 20 mM  MgSO4. Amplified fragments (20 ml) were resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under  UV light.  Radioligand Binding Equilibrium binding studies were performed in triplicate  determination for 2 h at RT in a total volume of 0.2 ml using  the high-affinity m-opioid receptor agonist [3H]DAMGO as the radioligand (2 nM) and 200-300 mg of membrane protein in TM buffer as described [19]. Non-specific binding was determined in  the presence of 1 mM DAMGO. Reactions were stopped by rapid filtration over WhatmanH GF/B glass fibre filters and radioactivity incorporated was determined by liquid scintillation in a Beckman  LS6500 counter (Beckman Coulter). Maximum binding capacity  was calculated according to the method of DeBlasi [20] using a Kd of 1.4 nM for the human m-opioid receptor [21].  Morphine Regulation of ErbB Signalling  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510    cAMP Accumulation Cells grown in 24 well dishes were washed 3 times with DMEM  containing 25 mM HEPES (DMEH) and 0.1 mM IBMX and  then incubated for 30 min at 37uC. Cells were chilled on ice and media were replaced by DMEH containing the following  stimulators and inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase: Forskolin (1 mM), Morphine (10 mM) and Naloxone (100 mM). Reactions were conducted for 15 min at 37uC and stopped by the addition of 0.75 ml 50 mM HCL per well. The amount of cAMP produced  was measured by ELISA after acetylation of the samples.  Cell Growth Cells were cultured in 24 well plates for 5 (BT474) or 3  (SKBR3) days in insulin-free growth medium in the absence or  presence of Morphine (10 mM), Naloxone (100 mM) and Here- gulin (40 ng/ml) as described [22]. Cells were then washed twice  with 0.5 ml PBS and fixed for 30 min at RT with 0.25 ml 20%  methanol in PBS containing 0.1% crystal violet. The dye solution  was aspirated, cells were washed extensively with PBS and finally  solubilised for 2 h in 0.25 ml 0.1 M citric acid per well. Colour  intensity was determined after 10 fold dilution at l= 492 nm in a TecanH Spectra Multiplate Reader. Background staining obtained from cells on the same plates fixed on day 0 was subtracted.  Scratch Assay Cell migration was evaluated using the in vitro scratch assay as  described [23]. BT474 cells (46105/well) were seeded onto 6 well culture dishes containing poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips to yield  90% sub confluent monolayers after 5 d of culture in the absence  (control) or presence of Heregulin (40 ng/ml), Morphine (10 mM) and Naloxone (100 mM) as indicated. Then, a scratch was made through the center of the well using a 200 ml pipette tip. Detached cells were removed and cells were cultured for another 24 h in  complete medium containing the above ligands. Cells were then  washed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, before cell  migration into the open area was assessed using an Olympus  BH2 microscope.  Cell Proliferation DNA synthesis was determined for 2 h in 96 well plates using  the BrdU Cell Proliferation ELISA (Roche Diagnostics) according  to the manufacturers instruction. Media were removed and cells  were stimulated for 2 h at 37uC with Heregulin b1 (40 ng/ml) and Morphine (10 mM) dissolved in 0.1 ml of insulin-deficient growth medium containing 10 mM BrdU. Reactions were stopped; cells were fixed and incubated with 0.1 ml anti-BrdU antibody coupled  to horseradish peroxidase. After the addition of substrate, colour  reaction was measurement at l= 405 nm. All experiments were done in triplicate determination.  ERK1/2 and Akt Phosphorylation Cells grown in 12 well plates were washed and equilibrated for  30 min at 37uC in DMEH containing 0.1% BSA before cells were stimulated for 5 min with Heregulin-b1 (40 ng/ml), EGF (100 ng/ml), Morphine (10 mM) and Naloxone (100 mM) as indicated. Reactions were stopped on ice and cells were solubilized  in 0.5 ml Laemmli sample buffer. In some experiments, the  following protein kinase inhibitors were added during the  equilibration period at the concentrations given: ErbB1 inhibitor  AG1478 (5 mM), ErbB2 inhibitor AG825 (50 mM), PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (1 mM) and the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor EGCG (10 mM). The activation state of ERK1/2 and Akt was determined by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies as  described below.  Apoptosis Assays Stress-induced apoptosis was evaluated in 12 well dishes by  culturing the cells for 6 h in serum-reduced growth medium (0.5%  FCS) in the absence or presence of Morphine (10 mM), Naloxone (100 mM) and Heregulin (40 ng/ml). Reactions were stopped by removal of the medium and solubilisation of the cells in 0.5 ml  Laemmli sample buffer. Apoptosis was determined by Western  blot using an antibody recognizing cleaved PARP.  Western Blot Analysis Samples were cleared by centrifugation (10,0006g; 5 min) and  proteins were resolved by electrophoresis over 8% (ErbB receptors)  or 10% (Akt, ERK1/2, G proteins, PARP) polyacrylamide gels as  Table 1.

Proteins were then blotted onto PVDF-membranes,  blocked and incubated overnight at 4uC with primary antibodies for phospho-specific ERK1/2 and Akt (1/2,000), ErbB receptors  (1/1,000), PARP (1/1,000), G proteins (1/2,000) and b-tubulin (1/ 4,000) diluted in TBS/T/BSA (50 mM Tris-HCL, pH 8.0,  150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA). Blots were washed,  incubated with secondary peroxidase-conjugated IgG and devel-  oped using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Immunoreactive  bands were quantitated by video densitometry using the Herolab  E.A.S.Y. RH-3 system.  Determination of Protein Abundance and Immunoprecipitation  The presence of G proteins and ErbB receptors was determined  in membranes using specific antibodies as described [6]. The  formation of distinct ErbB receptor dimers was examined by  immunoprecipitation experiments according to Garrett et al. [24]  in cells chronically treated with Morphine (10 mM; 5 d) or not (control). Cells of a 75 cm  2 flask were washed 3 times in PBS and  stimulated for 10 min at 37uC with Morphine (10 mM) and Heregulin (40 ng/ml) in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium  containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were then placed on ice, washed 3  times with PBS and cross-linked for 2 h with 5 mM DSP in PBS.  Reactions were quenched with 10 mM Tris-HCl and membranes  were prepared. Protein complexes were solubilized for 1 h at 4uC in TN buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl; pH 7.4)  containing 1% Triton X 100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride  and 4% Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics).  Samples were diluted 1/10 in TN buffer, cleared by centrifugation  (10,0006g; 5 min) and equal amounts of solubilisates were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight with anti-ErbB1  antibody (dilution 1/500) and 40 ml of Protein A-agarose beads. Immuncomplexes were washed 5 times with TN buffer containing  0.1% Triton X 100, cleaved by incubation for 5 min at 95uC in 0.1 ml of Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to gel electropho-  resis.  Cytochemistry Induction of apoptosis was determined by Annexin V-FITC/  propidium iodide staining of cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated  cover slips using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit  (Bender MedSystems) as described [5]. Cells were then fixed for  30 min at RT with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS before  specimens were mounted using VectaMount TM  AQ Aqueous  Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories) and cells were examined  by confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss) using an 636/1.4 oil immersion objective.  Statistics All data are expressed as the mean 6 S.E. of the number or  experiments given in the text. Statistical differences between two  groups were analyzed by Student\u0300s t test for unpaired data.  Multiple comparisons were done by ANOVA followed by the  Tukey post-hoc test.  Results  Characterization of Opioid Receptors in BT474 Cells To evaluate the specificity of acute and chronic opioid effects on  human BT474 breast cancer cells, the presence of opioid receptors  was determined first. RT-PCR experiments revealed the exclusive  expression of m-opioid receptors in this cell line (Fig. 1a). Receptor density was determined by equilibrium binding studies using the m- opioid receptor selective peptide agonist [  3 H]DAMGO as the  radioligand. The results show that BT474 cells contain about  7.362 fmol of m-opioid receptors per mg of membrane protein (n = 5) and that chronic Morphine treatment does not affect  receptor abundance (7.462 fmol per mg of membrane protein;  n = 3). The ability of m-opioid receptors to mediate cellular effects depends on the presence of adequate G proteins and effector  systems. As shown in Fig. 1b, BT474 cell membranes carry diverse  members of the family of inhibitory (Gia2, Gia3), stimulatory (Gsa), Gq (Gq/11a) and G12 (G12a, G13a, G14a) G proteins, allowing m-opioid receptors to regulate multiple intracellular signalling pathways. Because they also express several adenylyl  cyclase isoforms (AC 1-5, 9; Fig. 1c), the functional activity of m- opioid receptors was assessed by their ability to regulate  intracellular cAMP production. Indeed, acute m-opioid receptor activation by Morphine (10 mM) significantly inhibits intracellular cAMP generation by about 53%, an effect almost completely  blocked by Naloxone (100 mM). In chronically Morphine (10 mM, 5d)-treated cells an acute Morphine challenge is still able to inhibit  cAMP production by about 48% (Fig. 1d). These results  demonstrate that BT474 cells carry fully functional endogenous  m-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine treatment does not desensitize m-opioid receptor function providing an essential prerequisite to induce regulatory changes on post-receptor levels.  Inhibition of Cell Growth and Migration by Morphine The growth of human BT474 breast cancer cells is driven by  overexpressed ErbB2 receptor [11]. Due to the potential capacity  of m-opioid receptors to cross-regulate RTK signalling pathways [25], the ability of Morphine to interfere with BT474 cell growth  was determined. Chronic exposure of the cells to Morphine  slightly attenuates basal cell growth by about 11% as determined  by crystal violet staining. However, the inhibitory opioid effect is  much more pronounced when cells were cultured in the presence  of the ErbB3 receptor agonist Heregulin. Chronic Heregulin  treatment produces mitogenic effects and increases cell number by  about 47%. Co-incubation of the cells with Morphine now  significantly attenuates ErbB3-driven cell growth by about 49%.  Inhibition of both basal and Heregulin-stimulated cell growth by  Morphine is completely blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist  Naloxone (Fig. 2a). In addition, treatment of BT474 cells with the  inactive stereoselective enantiomer (+)-Morphine failed to affect cell growth (not shown), excluding a receptor-independent effect  on mitochondrial pH due to the alkaloid structure of Morphine.  Opioids have been shown to regulate a number of different  aspects of cell growth in tumour cell lines [26]. To gain a first  indication as to whether Morphine might also interfere with  Heregulin-stimulated BT474 cell migration, cell scratch assays  were performed on cells growing on poly-l-lysine coated cover  slips. As shown in Fig. 2b, Heregulin (40 ng/ml) treatment for 5 d  produces morphological changes and induces cell migration into  the gap 24 h after scratching. Co-incubation of the cells with  Morphine (10 mM, 5d) prevents cell differentiation and migration into the open field, an effect that was partially blocked in the  presence of Naloxone (100 mM). These results indicate that chronic Morphine treatment interferes with cell migration by  preventing cell-matrix or cell-cell interactions.  Regulation of Cell Proliferation by Morphine Inhibition of BT474 cell growth by chronic Morphine treatment  may be due to attenuation of cell proliferation and/or inhibition of  cell survival. To discriminate between these two possibilities, the  effect of acute and chronic Morphine treatment on ERK1/2  stimulation was determined. Most interestingly, acute m-opioid receptor activation produces discrepant effects on ERK1/2  Morphine Regulation of ErbB Signalling  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510    phosphorylation, depending on whether basal or Heregulin-  stimulated activities were measured in control or chronically  Morphine exposed cells. In control cells, acute m-opioid receptor activation using a maximum effective concentration of Morphine  (10 mM; determined in preliminary experiments) results in elevation of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but significantly  attenuates Heregulin (ErbB3)-induced ERK1/2 activation by  about 17%. Chronic Morphine treatment (10 mM, 5d) results in elevation of basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphor-  ylation. Under these conditions, acute m-opioid receptor activation now significantly enhances ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 activity by  about 14% (Fig. 3a). The increase in basal and Heregulin-  stimulated ERK1/2 activity by chronic Morphine treatment is  also given in Fig. 3b.  Similar results were observed when cell proliferation was  examined by determination of DNA synthesis for 2 h using the  BrdU assay. Again, acute m-opioid receptor activation in control cells significantly stimulates basal and inhibits Heregulin-stimulat-  ed cell proliferation by about 16% and 10%, respectively. Chronic  Morphine treatment completely abolishes the ability of acute m- opioid receptor activation to stimulate basal cell proliferation and  attenuates the overall effect of Heregulin by about 16%. In these  cells, acute m-opioid receptor activation now significantly enhances  ErbB3-stimulated cell proliferation by nearly 10% (Fig. 3c). These  results demonstrate that Morphine is able to regulate mitogenic  signalling in human BT474 breast cancer cells and that the kind of  acute m-opioid receptor effect produced largely depends on the activation state of the cell. In addition, they also indicate that  chronic Morphine treatment alters the ErbB receptor system  controlling the growth of BT474 cells.  Morphine Regulation of Akt Signalling The finding that chronic Morphine treatment attenuates basal  and Heregulin-stimulated cell growth in the presence of an  enhanced mitogenic m-opioid receptor activity suggests that additional mechanisms must exist that shortens the lifespan of  the cells. Therefore, we investigated whether chronic Morphine  treatment would possibly attenuate cell survival by inhibition of  Akt phosphorylation. As shown in !Fig. 4a, BT474 cells display  basal levels of Akt phosphorylation, which are stimulated after  activation of ErbB3 receptors by Heregulin. Chronic morphine  treatment results in elevation of both basal and Heregulin-  stimulated Akt activities. Acute m-opioid receptor activation fails to affect basal and Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling in both  control and chronically Morphine-treated cells. The increase in  basal and Heregulin-stimulated Akt activity after chronic Mor-  Figure 1. Characterization of m-opioid receptors in BT474 cells. (A) Detection of m-opioid receptors by RT-PCR.

These  results demonstrate that chronic Morphine treatment increases  basal and Heregulin-stimulated cell survival despite the overall  attenuation of cell growth.  Induction of Apoptosis by Chronic Morphine To explain this apparent discrepancy, we examined the  induction of apoptosis by chronic Morphine treatment by two  different experimental approaches. We first compared the effect of  Morphine on stress-induced apoptosis in control and chronically  morphine treated BT474 cells by means of PARP cleavage. In  control cells, serum starvation for 6 h failed to induce PARP  cleavage. Apoptosis was induced only in the presence of Heregulin  during the starvation period. Co-incubation of the cells together  with Morphine had no further effect on PARP cleavage.  Completely different results were obtained in chronically Mor-  phine-treated cells. Here, serum starvation alone was already  sufficient to induce PARP cleavage. The induction of apoptosis  was further enhanced by the addition of Heregulin and Morphine,  with their individual effects being additive (Fig. 4c). Similar results  were obtained when apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/  propidium iodide staining of the cells. Cultivation of BT474 cells  on cover slips for 5 d in complete growth medium resulted in  adherent patches that are negative for Annexin V-FITC staining.  Addition of Morphine (10 mM) during the incubation period resulted in cell rounding, strong Annexin V binding and nuclear  propidium iodide incorporation, which is indicative for the  induction of apoptosis. As observed in the cell migration assay,  chronic Heregulin treatment (40 ng/ml) produced morphological  changes towards a more differentiated cell shape and induced of  early steps of apoptosis as demonstrated by acquiring a polygonal  cell shape and bright Annexin V-FITC staining. Concomitant  treatment with Morphine prevented cell differentiation and  induced apoptosis as indicated by cell rounding and nuclear  propidium iodide incorporation. This chronic Morphine effect  again is completely blocked by Naloxone (Fig. 4d). Together, these  results demonstrate that chronic Morphine treatment of BT474  cells induces apoptosis and enhances Heregulin-stimulated cell  fate.  Figure 2.

To obtain a first indication for  whether changes in the ErbB receptor network would account for  the differences observed in mitogenic m-opioid receptor signalling after chronic Morphine treatment, several components of receptor  tyrosine kinase-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling pathways  were analysed by the use of established protein kinase inhibitors.  ErbB2-overexpressing BT474 cells contain physiologic levels of  ErbB3 receptors that are essential for ErbB2-driven cell growth  [27]. To our surprise, inhibition of catalytic ErbB1 function by the  tyrphostin analogue AG 1478 completely blocked all aspects of  basal, Morphine- and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt  phosphorylation in both control and chronically morphine treated  cells, indicating that ErbB1 must represent the obligatory binding  partner in all ErbB receptor dimers. In control cells, blockade of  Figure 3. Regulation of BT474 cell proliferation by Morphine. (A) Determination of ERK1/2 activation in control and chronically Morphine (10 mM; 5d)-treated cells.

In contrast,  AG825 exclusively attenuated Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2  activation in chronically Morphine-treated cells. Because AG825  also fails to affect Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling, the ErbB1/  ErbB2 heterodimer appears to mediate ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/  2 signalling in Morphine-treated cells. Pre-incubation of the cells  with the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin completely blocks Akt  phosphorylation under all conditions. In control cells, Wortman-  nin has no effect on basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2  phosphorylation. However, it largely attenuates ErbB3-stimulated  ERK1/2 activation in chronic Morphine-treated cells. This result  implies that chronic Morphine treatment of BT474 cells switches  Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling from a PI3K-indepen-  dent to a PI3K-dependent mechanism. The contribution of  metalloproteinases on chronic Morphine-induced mitogenic sig-  nalling was finally evaluated by pre-incubation of the cells with  EGCG. To our surprise, blockade of ectodomain shedding by  EGCG selectively attenuates basal and Heregulin-induced ERK1/  2 phosphorylation in chronically Morphine-treated, but not in  control cells. In addition, overall levels of Akt phosphorylation  appear to be reduced as compared to controls. This finding  indicates that activation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers in  chronically Morphine-treated cells appears to require the release  of an autocrine factor (Fig. 5a). Further studies revealed that the  IGF-1 receptor fails to contribute to chronic Morphine-induced  changes in ERK1/2 and Akt signalling (not shown).  To verify whether ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers contribute to  mitogenic signalling in chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells,  these were pre-treated with AG825 and subsequently stimulated  with EGF. In both control and chronically Morphine-treated cells,  activation of ErbB1 by EGF leads to stimulation of ERK1/2 and  Akt activities, as previously observed for Heregulin. Again,  functional inactivation of ErbB2 by AG825 selectively attenuates  EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Morphine-treated  cells (Fig. 5b). Thus, EGF appears to induce the formation of  ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers only after chronic Morphine treat-  ment of the cells.  One major mechanism by which the formation of ErbB  receptor dimers may be modulated is by regulation of receptor  quantity. As shown in Fig. 5c, chronic Morphine treatment  differentially regulates the relative abundance of ErbB receptor  types present. By means of Western blot analysis of BT474 plasma  membranes, strong immunoreactive bands were obtained for  ErbB1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors. The ErbB4 receptor signal  was only barely detectable. Chronic Morphine treatment produces  complex changes in ErbB receptor levels. It increases the relative  abundance of ErbB1 and ErbB3 and strongly down-regulates the  amount of ErbB2. The levels of ErbB4 remained unchanged.  Concomitant treatment of the cells with Naloxone at least partly  prevented these changes. These results suggest that chronic  Morphine treatment could possibly alter the formation of  individual ErbB homo- and heterodimers by regulating ErbB  receptor abundance.  To test whether chronic Morphine indeed leads to the  rearrangement of ErbB receptor dimers, co-precipitation studies  using an anti-ErbB1 antibody were performed. In membranes  from control cells, ErbB1 appears to exclusively form heterodimers  with ErbB3. Short-term stimulation of the cells with Heregulin  does not affect ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, but leads to co-  precipitation of traces of ErbB2. Besides ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodi-  mers, chronic Morphine treatment also results in the formation of  ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers. Again, short-term stimulation of the  cells with Heregulin did not affect dimer formation (Fig. 5d).  Together, these results demonstrate that chronic Morphine  treatment alters ERK1/2 and Akt signalling in BT474 cells by  the establishment of newly formed ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers.  To investigate whether similar alterations are also induced in  other ErbB-driven breast tumour cells, the effect on chronic  Morphine treatment on mitogenic signalling was examined in  SKBR3 human mammary carcinoma cells. These cells carry high  levels of ErbB2 and physiologic levels of ErbB1 and ErbB3 [16].  RT-PCR experiments verified the expression of k-type opioid receptors in this cells system (Fig. 6a), providing the basis for the  development of chronic Morphine-induced adaptations at the  level of the ErbB network. Although chronic Morphine (10 mM, 3d) treatment produced a subtle increase in the abundance of  ErbB1 in plasma membranes (Fig. 6b), no major effect on cell  growth was found as assessed by crystal violet staining (100 vs.  103.866%, mean 6 SE, n = 5). Nonetheless, the use of protein  kinase inhibitors revealed the induction of profound alterations in  ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling by chronic Morphine  treatment. As shown in Fig. 6c, EGF (100 ng/ml) and Heregulin  (40 ng/ml) both stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation to about the  same extent in control and chronically Morphine (10 mM, 3d)- treated cells. In both cells, pre-treatment with the ErbB1 inhibitor  AG1478 not only attenuates ErbB1-, but also ErbB3-stimulated  ERK1/2 activation. This indicates that Heregulin-stimulated  ERK1/2 signalling requires ErbB1 in both control and chronically  Morphine-treated SKBR3 cells. In contrast, pre-incubation of the  cells with AG825, Wortmannin and EGCG specifically attenuated  ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in chronically Morphine-  treated, but not in control cells. Thus, chronic Morphine  treatment of SKBR3 cells switches Heregulin-mediated ERK1/2  signalling to a PI3K-, matrix metalloproteinase- and ErbB2-  dependent mechanism comparable to that observed in BT474  cells. These results demonstrate that in tumour cells the  dysregulated ErbB receptor system represents a target for chronic  opioid treatment.  Discussion  There is increasing evidence that opioid analgesics interfere  with several aspects of tumour growth [3]. Here we describe that  human BT474 breast cancer cells endogenously express function-  ally active m-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine treatment produces fundamental changes in the ErbB receptor  network resulting in attenuation of Heregulin-stimulated cell  growth. These data add a new dimension on the mechanism of  opioid-stimulated mitogenic signalling, as they demonstrate that  opioid receptors not only transactivate RTK-associated signalling  pathways but also may alter the growth characteristics of tumour  cells by rearrangement of the ErbB receptor system.  The ErbB receptor family integrates a number of auto- and  paracrine signals to regulate normal cell growth, differentiation  (100 mM) as indicated. Samples were analysed by Western blot using an antibody recognizing full length (116 kDa) and cleaved (89 kDa) PARP. The same samples were blotted for b-tubulin (loading control).

In many cancers, the ErbB receptor  network is hyperactive and leads to clonal expansion of tumour  cells [29]. Among the best studied examples are human breast  cancers that overexpress the ErbB2 receptor. Because the level of  ErbB2 gene amplification in ErbB2 positive cancers is much  higher than in normal tissue, targeted inactivation of the ErbB2  protein evolved as one to the most promising and successful  antineoplastic strategies in these cancers. The outcome of anti-  ErbB2 treatments, however, is often limited by the induction of  compensatory resistance mechanisms due to the high plasticity of  the ErbB network [17]. In this context, the present study  performed on human BT474 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells  opens a new perspective in order to enhance the sensitivity of  ErbB2-directed treatments and to avoid escape mechanisms. This  idea bases on the finding that chronic Morphine treatment induces  apoptosis in BT474 cells by affecting the specificity of Heregulin-  stimulated ErbB signalling. These effects are mediated by the  formation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers in chronically Morphine  treated cells that switch tumour cell growth from an ErbB3- to and  ErbB2-dependent mechanism. Opposite changes in ErbB receptor  plasticity have been previously reported for BT474 and SKBR3  mamma carcinoma cells chronically treated with specific anti-  ErbB1 and ErbB2 inhibitors. In these studies, inactivation ErbB1  and ErbB2 receptors restored cell growth by reactivation of ErbB3  and ErbB4 receptor signalling [30] and redirected tumour cell  growth from an ERK1/2 to an Akt-dependent mechanism [24].  The changes in ErbB receptor network by chronic Morphine  treatment were detected by the use of protein kinase inhibitors to  block acute m-opioid receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt activity. Although the single use of protein kinase inhibitors may  be endowed with several drawbacks, like non-specific effects, it was  not possible to verify the present results by genetic approaches  because siRNA-mediated knock-down or protein overexpression  per se may alter ErbB signalling and mask possible chronic  Morphine effects. Nevertheless, the use of validated and generally  accepted protein kinase inhibitors in this study provided novel  insight into the composition of ErbB receptor dimers in BT474  and SKBR3 cells. Our experiments suggest that ErbB1 appears to  represent the obligatory binding partner in ErbB receptor dimers,  because pre-treatment of the cells with AG1478 blocked all aspects  of basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt activities. To  our surprise, ERK1/2 signalling was exclusively affected by  AG825 in chronically Morphine treated, but not in control cells.  This suggests that chronic Morphine treatment induces the  formation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, which was verified by  our co-immunoprecipitation studies in BT474 cells. Co-immuno-  precipitation also revealed the existence of ErbB1/ErbB3 hetero-  dimers in both na\u0131\u0308ve and chronically Morphine-treated cells,  substantiating the notion that the growth of BT474 cells is  dependent on ErB3 signalling despite overexpression of ErbB2  [27].  To investigate the role of chronic Morphine treatment on  ErbB3 signalling, Heregulin stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signal-  ling was investigated in BT474 and SKBR3 cells. In control cells,  Heregulin appears to mediate ERK1/2 and Akt signalling via  activation of single ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers. Activation of  ErbB3 in ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers has been shown to mediate  signal transduction by transactivation of ErbB1, which in turn  stimulates the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 cascade by binding the adapter  proteins Shc and Grb2 [31]. Because ErbB3 is deficient of kinase  activity, Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling must be accomplished  by Grb2/Gab1 mediated cross-regulation of PI3K [32]. After the  introduction of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, Heregulin-stimulated  ERK1/2, but not Akt signalling became dependent on ErbB2  receptors in BT474 cells. This finding suggests that Akt signalling  is further accomplished by ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, whereas  were stimulated for 5 min with or without Heregulin (40 ng/ml) to form receptor dimers. Proteins were cross-linked and ErbB1 containing dimers were immunoprecipitated using an anti-ErbB1 antibody. Individual ErbB receptors were determined in whole cell solubilisates (S) and immunoprecipitates (IP) by Western blot using type-specific antibodies. Equal protein load was verified by determination of IgG heavy chains (Fc). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g005  Figure 6. Regulation of ErbB signalling by chronic Morphine in SKBR3 cells.

Total ERK1/2 was determined using an overall reactive antibody. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g006  Morphine Regulation of ErbB Signalling  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510    ERK1/2 signalling is redirected to ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers.  Such a mechanism would require the autocrine release of an EGF-  like ligand by Heregulin, which then transactivates the ErbB1/  ErbB2 heterodimer. In our experiments, blockade of metallopro-  teinase activity by EGCG largely attenuated Heregulin- and EGF-  stimulated ERK1/2 activation, indicating that Heregulin indeed  induces the release of an EGF-like ligand. Reactivation of a  comparable autocrine loop maintaining ErbB2 activity has been  previously described for breast cancer cells chronically treated with  an anti-ErbB2 directed antibody [!33]. In chronically Morphine  treated cells, Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling also  became dependent on PI3K, whereas pre-treatment with  Wortmannin is ineffective in control cells. To date, cross-activation  of ERK1/2 signalling by PI3K has been observed only under  distinct conditions, however the underlying cellular mechanism  remain unclear. It has been suggested that PI3K-dependent Ras/  Raf/ERK1/2 signalling is that ErbB1 recruits GAP/SH2  complexes to cell membranes by PIP3 in the presence of low  doses of EGF-like ligands [34]. Although we cannot exclude such a  mechanism, our results suggest that PI3K contributes to the  Heregulin-induced cleavage of EGF-like ligands by metalloprotei-  nase. This would be in line with the finding that PI3K is able to  block a negative feedback loop in ErbB3-driven tumour cells,  resulting in a compensatory activation of the ERK signalling  pathway [35]. The question remains how Heregulin brings about  Akt phosphorylation in chronically Morphine treated BT474 cells.  Despite the lack of catalytic activity, ErbB3 is able to directly  activate PI3K by binding all three regulatory subunits through  their SH-domains [13]. However, phosphorylation of the 6  consensus phosphorylation sites in the C-terminus of ErbB3 is  only induced after ligand-induced activation of an ErbB binding  partner. In this respect, an EGF-like ligand released by Heregulin  might activate accomplish direct Akt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3  heterodimers in chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells. Such a  mechanism appears plausible because blockade of metalloprotei-  nase activity in chronically Morphine-treated cells substantially  attenuates the levels of Akt phosphorylation. A model of chronic  Morphine-induced changes in Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and  Akt signalling is shown in !Fig. 7.  In BT474 cells, the functional consequence of the chronic  Morphine-induced alterations in ErbB signalling is the enhance-  ment of Heregulin-induced apoptosis. Morphine is known to  possess pro-apoptotic effects in a number or cell models. Pathways  proposed to be involved in Morphine-induced apoptosis include  an increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bim, decreased expres-  sion of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [36] and stabilization of p53 [37]. On  the other hand opioids have also been shown to display strong  anti-apoptotic properties in a number of cell models, which are  mediated by activation of the Akt pathway [5]. On the first view,  the induction of apoptosis in BT474 cells is somewhat surprising,  since chronic Morphine treatment consistently increased basal  levels of Akt phosphorylation. One possible explanation for this  apparent discrepancy is that the switch from an ErbB3- to an  ErbB2-dependent signalling attenuates cell survival by masking  ErbB3 driven Akt signalling. An opposite mechanism has been  described in cancer cells with dominant PI3K signalling in which a  negative feedback loop dampens compensatory Ras/Raf/ERK1/  2 activity, maintaining anti-apoptotic signalling [35]. In this  respect, chronic Morphine-induced ErbB2 signalling may be  viewed as an escape mechanism that blocks Akt signalling.  The mechanism by which chronic Morphine regulates the  rearrangement of ErbB receptor dimers remains to be determined.  One possible explanation would be that Morphine, which acts as a  partial agonist at the m-opioid receptor, produces persistent  inhibitory opioid signalling due to its failure to desensitize the  receptor [38]. Indeed, although present at relatively low levels in  BT474, chronic Morphine treatment had no effect on m-opioid receptor abundance and signalling, providing an absolute  requirement for the induction of adaptational changes on post-  receptor level. In neuronal cells, such changes are proposed to  contribute to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence  [1]. In non-neuronal cells, chronic Morphine treatment has been  shown to facilitate persistent ERK1/2 signalling by down-  regulation of c-Cbl and blockade of ErbB1 receptor degradation  [18]. Inhibition of protein degradation could explain our finding  that chronic Morphine treatment elevates the abundance of ErbB1  and ErbB3 in BT474 cells. An opposite down-regulation of ErbB2  after chronic Morphine treatment might be the result of  activation-induced cleavage of the receptor, which is typical for  ErbB2-overexpressing cells [39]. Because regulation of ErbB  abundance is a critical determinant for the signalling activity in a  Figure 7. Model of chronic Morphine-induced changes in ErbB signalling. The scheme depicts the differences in Heregulin-stimulated ErbB signalling in control and chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells. In control cells, stimulation with Heregulin leads to activation of ERK1/2 and Akt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers. While AG1478 blocks both Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling, inhibition of PI3K by Wortmannin specifically prevents Akt signalling. Because ErbB3 phosphorylation and PI3K activation is dependent on the presence of a dimerized ErbB member with catalytic activity, these results indicate that Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling is predominantly mediated through ErbB1. The failure of Wortmannin to affect ERK1/2 activation in control cells further implicates that Heregulin stimulates Akt signalling via ErbB3. Chronic Morphine treatment alters mitogenic signalling by rearrangement of ErbB heterodimers. Whereas Heregulin still stimulates Akt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3, ERK1/2 signalling is now accomplished by ErbB1/2 heterodimers. These are activated indirectly by an EGF-like ligand liberated from Heregulin in a PI3K (Wortmannin)- and metalloproteinase (EGCG)-dependent manner. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g007  Morphine Regulation of ErbB Signalling  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510    given cell system [28], quantitative changes in ErbB receptors  represent a potential mechanism by which chronic Morphine  treatment influences the composition of individual ErbB dimers.  Conclusions The present study demonstrates that chronic Morphine  treatment produces fundamental changes in the ErbB receptor  network of human breast cancer cells that are characterized by  quantitative alterations in the abundance of individual ErbB  receptors, alterations in ErbB dimer formation and the introduc-  tion of an autocrine loop that redirects Heregulin-stimulated  ERK1/2 activation from ErbB1/ErbB3 to ErbB1/2-heterodi-  mers. Although these changes produce no major effect on  Morphine stimulated cell growth and mitogenic signalling, they  become evident when Heregulin-stimulated effects on cell growth  were examined. Direct modulation of ErbB signalling mechanisms  could explain the many discrepant opioid effects on cell growth  and apoptosis observed so far in individual cell systems and may  provide a novel strategy to stabilize certain ErbB dimers in order  to enhance the sensitivity of ErbB-directed anti-tumour therapies  and to avoid the development of drug resistance by preventing  escape mechanisms.
