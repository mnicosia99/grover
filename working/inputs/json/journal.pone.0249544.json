In patients with IBD, the  intestinal tight junction (TJ) barrier is compromised as characterized by an increase in intes-  tinal permeability. MMP-9 is elevated in intestinal tissue, serum and stool of patients with  IBD. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that MMP-9 causes an increase in intesti-  nal epithelial TJ permeability and that the MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal permeability  is an important pathogenic factor contributing to the development of intestinal inflammation  in IBD. However, the intracellular mechanisms that mediate the MMP-9 modulation of intes-  tinal barrier function remain unclear.  Aims  The main aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in  MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability using Caco-2 monolayers as  an in-vitro model system.  Results  MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability was associated with activation and cyto-  plasmic-to-nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65. Knocking-down NF-\u03baB p65 by siRNA trans- fection prevented the MMP-9 induced expression of the NF-\u03baB target gene IL-8, myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) protein expression, and subsequently prevented the increase in  Caco-2 TJ permeability. In addition, the effect of MMP-9 on Caco-2 intestinal epithelial TJ  barrier function was not mediated by apoptosis or necrosis.

Introduction  The intestinal epithelium is a single layer of cells within the gut lumen that serves an important  protective function. It acts as a selectively permeable barrier, which allows for absorption of  nutrients while preventing harmful luminal contents, such as gut microbes, from crossing the  intestinal epithelium [1, 2]. Defective intestinal tight junction barrier (TJ), manifested by an  increased intestinal permeability, serves as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of inflamma-  tory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), celiac dis-  ease, and other inflammatory conditions of the gut [3, 4]. Clinical studies in IBD patients have  shown the key role of intestinal TJ barrier function in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflamma-  tion and emphasized on the enhancement of intestinal barrier which correlated with sustained  long-term clinical remission [5, 6].  Recently, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of  intestinal inflammation in IBD [7-9]. MMPs are classified into major subgroups including col-  lagenases (MMP-1, -8, -13, -18), gelatinases (MMP -2, -9), stromelysins (MMP -3, -7, -10, -11,  -19), elastase (MMP -12), and membrane type (MMP -1, -5) [8, 10]. Under normal physiologic  conditions, MMPs are involved in processes including angiogenesis, degradation and remodel-  ing of extracellular matrix (ECM), wound repair, and the activation of a wide range of inflam-  matory cytokines [11, 12]. Dysregulated MMP expression, however, can lead to an exaggerated  and prolonged inflammatory response, leading to chronic inflammation [12, 13]. MMP-9 has  been postulated to be proinflammatory and its levels are shown to be markedly elevated in intes-  tinal tissue, serum, and stool of patients with IBD and closely correlate with the disease activity  [14, 15]. Previous studies have shown that in animal models of colitis, MMP-9 was upregulated  and played an important role in the development of intestinal inflammation [16-19]. The dex-  tran sodium sulfate (DSS) and the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis were  inhibited in MMP deficient mice [17, 20, 21]. Furthermore, it has been shown that MMP-9 inhi-  bition (by a pharmacologic inhibitor or by genetic knock down) prevented the intestinal inflam-  mation in an ileus model of enterocolitis [22]. Together, all previous data suggested the critical  role of MMP-9 in mediating the development of intestinal inflammation. Little is known about  the mechanisms of MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal TJ permeability, and even less has  been reported on whether MMP-9 has a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD in relation to  the TJ barrier function. Our recent studies suggested that MMP-9 at clinically relevant concen-  trations causes an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability in vitro and in vivo [23]; how- ever, the intracellular mechanisms involved in MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal TJ  permeability remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to further elucidate the intracellular  mechanisms involved in the MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability,  using a well-established in vitro intestinal epithelial model system consisting of filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers. Our results showed that the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ perme-  ability was mediated by an activation of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Identification of intracellular and molecular processes involved in the MMP-9 disruption of intestinal TJ barrier function  could be important in developing new restorative approaches to enhance the intestinal TJ bar-  rier and subsequently in preventing intestinal inflammation.

MLCK antibody was obtained from Sigma  (St. Louis, MO). Phospho-NF-\u03baB p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1, NF-\u03baB p65 and \u03b2-actin antibodies were pur- chased from Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX). SiRNA of NF-\u03baB p65 (RelA), and transfection reagents were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The active form of MMP-9 was purchased  from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), isolated from stimulated human neutrophil granulocytes,  disulfide-bridged MMP-9 homodimer. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were  purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), VWR (Aurora, CO), or Fisher Scientific  (Pittsburgh, PA).  Cell culture  Caco-2 cells (passage 20) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection-ATCC  (Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37\u02daC in a culture medium composed of DMEM with 4.5  mg/ml glucose, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 U/ml streptomycin, 4 mM glutamine, 25 mM HEPES,  and 10% FBS. The cells were kept at 37\u02daC in a 5% CO2 environment. For growth on filters,  high-density Caco-2 cells (1 X 10 5  cells) were plated on Transwell filters with 0.4-\u03bcm pore (Corning, Corning, NY) and monitored regularly by visualization with an inverted microscope  and by epithelial resistance measurements. Caco-2 monolayers were cultured for 3-4 weeks  after seeding and only Caco-2 cells from passages 21 to 28 were used to maintain consistency.  The filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers have been used extensively over the last 20 years as in vitro model system of functional epithelial barrier [24].  Determination of epithelial monolayer resistance and paracellular  permeability  The transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the filter-grown Caco-2 intestinal monolayers  was measured using an epithelial voltohmeter (EVOM; World Precision Instruments, Sara-  sota, FL) as previously reported [23, 25]. Electrical resistance was measured in 5% difference  on three consecutive measurements. Caco-2 paracellular permeability was assessed by measur-  ing the luminal-to-serosal flux rate of a paracellular probe, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled  FITC dextran 10 kDa (mol wt.: 10,000 g/mol). For determination of mucosal-to-serosal flux  rates, known concentration (25 \u03bcg/ml) of FITC dextran 10 kDa was added to the apical solu- tion at the beginning of each experiment. After each experimental period, the solution from  the basolateral chamber was collected and measured in a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-  tek Flx 800). All flux studies were carried out at 37\u02daC and filter-grown Caco-2-monolayers  having epithelial resistance of 400-550 O-cm 2  were used. All of the permeability experiments  were repeated three to four times in triplicate.  Assessment of protein expression by Western blot analysis  Protein expression from Caco-2 cells was assessed by Western blot analysis, as previously  described [23, 26]. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,  500 M NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 100 M vanadate, 100 M PMSF, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml pepstatin A,  40 mM paranitrophenyl phosphate, 1 g/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100) on ice for 30 min.  The lysates were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge (5417R; Haup- pauge, NY) to obtain a clear lysate. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration  PLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-\u03baB activation  PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 3 / 17  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544   was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Laemmli gel  loading buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to the lysate containing 10-20 \u03bcg of protein and boiled at 100\u02daC for 7 min, after which proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins from the  gel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight. The membrane was incubated  for 2 hrs in blocking solution (5% dry milk in TBS-Tween-20 buffer) and then incubated with  antibody in blocking solution. After a wash in TBS-1% Tween buffer, the membrane was incu-  bated in secondary antibody and developed using enhanced chemi-luminescence reagents on  ChemiDoc Gel Imaging (Biorad, Hercules, Ca).  Transfection of siRNA NF-\u03baB p65 Targeted siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). Caco-2 monolayers were  transiently transfected using DharmaFect transfection reagent. Briefly, 5 x 10 5  cells per filter  were seeded into a 12-well transwell plate and grown to confluence. Caco-2 monolayers were  then washed twice with PBS and 0.5 ml of Accell Media was added to the apical compartment  of each filter and 1.5 ml was added to the basolateral compartment of each filter. Five nano-  grams of the siRNA and 2 \u03bcl of DharmaFect reagent were added to the apical media. Non-tar- get (NT) siRNA was used as a control. The MMP-9 experiments were carried out 72 hrs after  transfection. The efficiency of silencing was confirmed by Western blot analysis.  Nuclear extracts and ELISA  Filter-grown Caco-2 cells were treated with MMP-9 for 60 minutes. Nuclear and cytoplasmic  fractions were extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol using Nuclear Extract Kit  from ActiveMotif [27]. The NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity assay was performed using Trans- AM ELISA-based kits from Active Motif according to the manufacturer's protocol. In brief,  the binding reactions contained 1 pM biotinylated probe (Integrated DNA Technologies) and  5 \u03bcg of nuclear extract in complete binding buffer with a total volume of 50 \u03bcl. After 30 min of incubation, the solution was transferred to an individual well on the plate and incubated for 1  h. Rabbit NF-\u03baB p65 Ab (2 \u03bcg/ml) was added to the well to bind NF-\u03baB p65 from the nuclear extract. After incubation for 1 hr, NF-\u03baB p65 Ab was removed, and 100 \u03bcl of anti-rabbit HRP- conjugated IgG were added to the well and incubated for 1 hr. Subsequently, 100 \u03bcl of develop- ing solution was added for 2-10 min, and 100 \u03bcl of stop solution were added. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined using the SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices).  Immunostaining of NF-\u03baB p65 Cellular localization of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB p65 was assessed by an immunofluores- cent Ab-labeling technique as previously described [28]. At the end of the experimental period,  filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers were washed twice in cold PBS and were fixed with methanol  for 20 min. Then, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room tempera-  ture for 20 min. The Caco-2 monolayers were then incubated in blocking solution composed  of BSA and normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr. Cells were then labeled with primary Abs in  blocking solution overnight at 4\u02daC. After being washed with PBS, the filters were incubated in  FITC-conjugated secondary Ab for 1 hr at room temperature. Prolong Gold antifade reagent  with DAPI was used to mount the filters onto the coverslips. Immunostaining of NF-\u03baB p65 was visualized and images obtained using a Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped with  Axiocam digital camera in automatic mode. Images were processed with Zen software (Zeiss).

The culture media was then collected and centrifuged and IL-8 levels were then mea-  sured using Multi-Analyte ELISArray kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's protocol.  Assessment of apoptosis and cell death  After MMP-9 experimental treatment (24 and 48 hrs), Caco-2 cells were trypsinized and  assessed for apoptosis using the Annexin V FITC  Apoptosis Detection kit II from Biolegend  according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were digested by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA  solution, washed twice with cold PBS and stained with Annexin V-PE (5 \u03bcL) and 7-amino- actinomycin D (7-AAD) (5 \u03bcL) in binding buffer. Annexin VFITC was used to stain for the apo- ptotic cells and 7-AAD was used to stain the necrotic cells. Cells were washed two times with  FACS staining buffer and analyzed by 16-color BD LSR Fortessa. Treated or untreated cells  were washed and 20,000 cells were re-suspended in 20ul of trypan blue. Cells were counted  under a microscope by using a cell counting hemocytometer. Trypan blue-stained dead or  necrotic cells were excluded from the total number of cells.  Statistical analysis  Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SD of triplicate measurements. Two-way ANOVA were per- formed to determine whether different treatments affect the outcomes. Multiple comparisons  were conducted following significant ANOVA by using t-tests. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism 7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software). A P value of 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. All experiments were repeated at least three  times to ensure reproducibility.  Results  NF-\u03baB requirement in MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability In these experiments, MMP-9 (400 ng/ml) caused a time-dependent drop in Caco-2 trans-epi-  thelial resistance (TER) (Fig 1A), as also shown previously by us [23], MMP-9 caused time-  dependent drop in Caco-2 TER (25%) between 24 and 72 hrs of treatment. Conversely, MMP-9  caused a correlated increase in Caco-2 permeability to a paracellular marker, dextran 10 kDa  (Fig 1B) starting at 12 hrs of MMP-9 treatment and continued up to 72 hrs of treatment (~  Fig 1.

The time course of Caco-2 TER recovery following MMP-9 removal was also examined.  The removal of MMP-9 after 72 hrs of treatment resulted in recovery of the Caco-2 TER starting  at 24 hrs and continued up to 72 hrs of removal until full recovery was achieved (Fig 1C).  Many studies have reported the important role of NF-\u03baB activation in regulating the intesti- nal TJ barrier function in vitro and in vivo [29-36]. In these experiments, we examined the possible involvement of NF-\u03baB in MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. MMP- 9 treatment caused a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated NF-\u03baB p65, peaking at 1 hr of treatment and continued up to 4 hrs of treatment (Fig 2A). Since I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation is required for the activation of NF-\u03baB p65, we also examined the effect of MMP-9 on I\u03baB-\u03b1 deg- radation in Caco-2 monolayers. MMP-9 caused a time-dependent degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1, indi- cating that MMP-9 caused activation of NF-\u03baB p65 (Fig 2A).  To further validate the MMP-9 activation of NF-\u03baB p65 in Caco-2 monolayers, we examined the effect of MMP-9 on cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 by measuring NF- \u03baB p65 expression in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. In control Caco-2 monolayers, NF- \u03baB p65 is expressed mostly in the cytoplasmic fraction, with only minimal amount in the nuclear fraction (Fig 2B). MMP-9 treatment resulted in cytoplasmic NF-\u03baB p65 translocation into the nuclear fraction (Fig 2B). MMP-9 induced NF-\u03baB p65 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translo- cation was also examined by immunostaining. MMP-9 treatment resulted in a rapid increase in  NF-kB p65 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation following MMP-9 treatment (1-hr  Fig 2.

(A) Phospho-NF-\u03baB p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 expression were determined in filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers treated with MMP-9 (400 ng/ml) for increasing time periods (0-6 hrs).

(D) NF-\u03baB p65 binding to the oligonucleotide probe containing the \u03baB- binding site was determined by ELISA-binding assay. MMP-9 caused a significant increase in NF-\u03baB p65 binding (1-hr experimental period). The oligonucleotide containing a mutated NF-\u03baB-binding (mut) motif did not inhibit the NF-\u03baB p65 binding to the DNA probe; however, the addition of wild-type (WT) oligonucleotide containing the consensus NF-\u03baB p65-binding site as a competitive inhibitor prevented the binding of NF-\u03baB. --- P< 0.001 vs control. (E) NF-\u03baB p65 siRNA transfection resulted in a marked depletion in NF-\u03baB p65 protein expression.

(F) NF-\u03baB p65 siRNA knock-down prevented the MMP-9 induced increase in NF-\u03baB p65 binding to the oligonucleotide probe containing the \u03baB-binding site. --- P< 0.0001 vs control; ###  P< 0.001 vs MMP-9 treatment.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544.g002  PLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-\u03baB activation  PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 6 / 17  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544.g002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544   experimental period) (Fig 2C), confirming that MMP-9 causes activation and translocation of  NF-\u03baB p65 in Caco-2 monolayers. Next, we examined the effect of MMP-9 on NF-\u03baB p65 activ- ity by assessing the nuclear binding of NF-\u03baB p65 to its consensus sequence by ELISA-binding assay. As shown in Fig 2D, MMP-9 caused a significant and marked increase in NF-\u03baB p65 binding to the consensus \u03baB sequence (50-GGGACTTTCC-30) on the oligonucleotide probe, suggesting an increase in NF-\u03baB p65 transcriptional activity in response to MMP-9 in Caco-2 monolayers. The specificity of NF-\u03baB p65 binding to the DNA probe was confirmed by adding a high dose of wild-type oligonucleotide containing the consensus \u03baB-binding site as a competi- tive inhibitor for NF-\u03baB p65 binding. As expected, the addition of wild-type oligonucleotide inhibited the binding of NF-\u03baB p65 to the DNA probe. In contrast, the mutated NF-\u03baB-binding motif (50-CTCACTTTCC-30) did not inhibit the NF-\u03baB p65 binding (Fig 2D), indicatingthat MMP-9-activated and -transclocated NF-\u03baB p65 binds to a \u03baB site on DNA. To further investi- gate the requirement of NF-\u03baB p65 in the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 intestinal TJ per- meability, we knocked-down the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 by siRNA transfection in filter- grown Caco-2 monolayers. As shown in Fig 2E, knocking-down NF-\u03baB p65 by siRNA transfec- tion resulted in a near-complete silencing of p65 expression, and completely inhibited the  MMP-9 induced increase in NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear binding to its DNA probe (Fig 2F).  NF-\u03baB p65 requirement for MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression In the following studies, we showed that knocking-down NF-\u03baB p65 by siRNA transfection prevented the MMP-9 induced drop in Caco-2 TER and increase in dextran 10 kDa flux (Fig  3A and 3B), suggesting a crucial regulatory role of NF-\u03baB p65 in the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 intestinal TJ permeability. Furthermore, we examined the effect of MMP-9 treat-  ment on NF-kB down-stream target gene IL-8 production in Caco-2 monolayers. Fig 3C  showed that MMP-9 treatment resulted in a significant increase in IL-8 levels in medium col-  lected from Caco-2 cultures as measured by ELISA. Knocking-down NF-kB p65 by siRNA pre-  vented the MMP_9 induced increase in IL-8 production, suggesting that MMP-9 activation of  NF-kB is associated with an increase in the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8.  Recent studies from our laboratory indicated that the MMP-9-induced increase in intestinal  TJ permeability in vitro and in vivo was mediated by an increase in MLCK protein expression and activity [23]. However, the intracellular pathways involved in the MMP-9 regulation of  MLCK gene and protein expression remain unclear. We examined the possibility that the NF-  \u03baB p65 pathway regulates the MMP-9 induced up-regulation of MLCK protein expression. MMP-9 caused an increase in Caco-2 MLCK protein expression (Fig 3D), and knocking-  down NF-\u03baB p65 by siRNA transfection inhibited the MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression (Fig 3D). These findings indicated that MMP-9 activation of the NF-\u03baB p65 path- way mediated the increase in MLCK expression. It has also been reported that MMP-9 modu-  lation of MLCK expression was mediated by p38 kinase activation [23]. To examine the role of  p38 kinase in MMP-9-activation of NF-\u03baB in Caco-2 monolayers, we silenced p38 kinase by siRNA transfection and determined MMP-9 activation of NF-\u03baB p65 in Caco-2 monolayers. SiRNA p38 kinase prevented the MMP-9 induced activation/phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 (Fig 3E), suggesting that NF-\u03baB p65 regulation of MLCK is down-stream of p38 kinase  MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability is not due to apoptosis  MMP-9 has been previously shown to play controversial pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic roles in  different cell types [37-45]. In the following studies, we examined whether MMP-9 induced dis-  ruption of Caco-2 TJ barrier was due to apoptosis or cell death.

Apoptosis quantifi-  cation was determined by detecting membrane phosphatidylserine using Annexin V as a probe.  While, necrosis was determined by measuring the membrane integrity where 7-AAD is able to  permeate across the cell membrane to label the DNA. As shown in Fig 4, MMP-9 treatment did  not result in Caco-2 cell apoptosis or necrosis, indicating that the MMP-9 induced increase in  Caco-2 TJ permeability was due to intracellular mechanisms not involving apoptosis or cell death.

The present study demonstrated the involvement of NF-\u03baB p65 in MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability. The results showed  that MMP-9 at a physiologically relevant concentration (400 ng/ml) caused rapid and early  activation of NF-\u03baB p65 in filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers. Moreover, knocking-down NF- \u03baB p65 by siRNA prevented the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. Addi- tionally, silencing NF-\u03baB p65 prevented the MMP-9 induced up-regulation of MLCK, a key regulator of the intestinal TJ barrier. Moreover, the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 intes-  tinal epithelial TJ permeability was not mediated by apoptosis.  MMP-9 is one of the metalloproteinases family consisting of 25 members [47]. MMP-9 is  unique as its protein expression and activity is undetectable in most healthy intestinal tissues  but has been shown to be highly expressed in a variety of inflammatory states, including IBD  [48]. It has been shown recently that MMP-9 caused an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ per-  meability in Caco-2 monolayers [23]; however, the intracellular mechanisms involved have yet  to be delineated. In this study, we examined potential intracellular mechanisms that mediate  the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial TJ barrier. Extensive studies have  indicated that the transcription factor NF-\u03baB plays a crucial role in regulating the intestinal TJ barrier function and increased permeability in vitro and in animal models of colitis [30, 33, 49-53], and inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling improved symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice [54, 55]. It is also worth noting that NF-\u03baB activity was found to be increased in patients with IBD [56]. Moreover, previous studies have provided compelling evidence on the crucial role  that the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway plays in mediating the cytokine-induced increase in intesti- nal epithelial TJ permeability, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-\u03b3, IL-13 and others [26, 30, 57-62]. Although there appears to be an existing relationship between NF-\u03baB activity and downstream activation of MMP-9 in intestinal inflammation, there is no clear evidence of  MMP-9 activating NF-\u03baB to modulate the intestinal epithelial TJ barrier. For example, it has been shown that TNF- \u03b1 induced the expression of MMP-9 in human bronchial epithelial cells and that this induction is mediated via the NF-\u03baB -mediated pathway [63, 64]. Earlier studies have shown that Helicobacter pylori induced activation of NF-\u03baB, leading to MMP-9 gene transcription in gastric epithelial cells [65]. More recent studies have shown that aluminum  caused an increase in HT-29 intestinal epithelial TJ permeability that was mediated by NF-\u03baB induced up-regulation of MMP-9 [66]. In addition to their roles in increasing intestinal per-  meability, the current study showed the sequential relationship of MMP-9 activating the  downstream effector NF-\u03baB to regulate the intestinal epithelial TJ barrier function. MMP-9 caused a rapid degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit in Caco-2 cells. The requirement of NF-\u03baB p65 in the MMP-9 induced increase in TJ permeability was demonstrated by the silencing of NF-\u03baB p65 expression in Caco-2 cells. NF-\u03baB p65 depletion by NF-\u03baB p65 siRNA transfection significantly attenuated the MMP-9-induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. In combination, these studies confirmed the requirement of NF-\u03baB in mediating the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. Interestingly, our results  showed that inhibition of NF-\u03baB also prevented the MMP-9 activation of the NF-\u03baB target gene IL-8. This finding is consistent with previous reports demonstrating the requirement of  intestinal epithelial MMP-9 in mediating intestinal inflammation through increase secretion  of IL-8 and disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier in a genetically engineered mouse model  that can overexpress MMP-9 specifically in intestinal epithelial cells [67]. Additional investiga-  tion is needed to delineate the MMP-9 induced mechanisms in vivo, including possible recruit- ment of immune cells that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to further disruption  of the intestinal epithelial TJ barrier.  MMP-9 had been proposed to trigger apoptosis in many cell types [68-70] and the increase  in apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells has been postulated to be an important mechanism for  PLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-\u03baB activation  PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 9 / 17  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544   the leakiness observed in IBD patients [71-73]. Due to these findings, we examined the possi-  bility that the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability may also be due to an  increase in cell apoptosis. MMP-9 treatment over different time periods did not induce apo-  ptosis or necrosis in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that Caco-2 cell apoptosis or cell death was not a  mechanism mediating the MMP-9-induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. The role of  MMP-9 in apoptosis has been controversial: previous studies have shown that MMP-9 up-reg-  ulation had a protective effect in colitis associated cancer (CAC) and induced apoptosis via  activation of Notch-1 signaling [37, 39]; other studies have shown that knock-out models of  MMP-9 resulted in delayed apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes [74]. It is worth noting  that apoptosis has been suggested to be an important intracellular mechanism for some cyto-  kine (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 IL-4, and IL-13)-induced increase in intestinal TJ permeability [51, 75- 77]. In line with our current studies, NF-\u03baB has been shown to protect cells from death by inducing expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-xL, FLICE-like inhibitory pro-  tein, and members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family [78, 79]. In contrast, other reports  have shown that NF-\u03baB activation in epithelial cells caused an increase in the production of  Fig 5. Schematic diagram of intracellular mechanism involved in MMP-9 regulation of Caco-2 TJ barrier function.  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544.g005  PLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-\u03baB activation  PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 10 / 17  https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544.g005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544   inflammatory chemokines that recruit immune cells to tissues, thereby initiating an inflamma-  tory amplification cascade and acting in a pro-apoptotic manner [80]. Since we have found  herein that MMP-9 caused an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability in an apoptosis-  independent manner, future studies identifying the anti-apoptotic proteins involved will be of  great insight into understanding the intracellular mechanisms required in MMP-9 induced  increase in intestinal TJ permeability and barrier defect.  Previous studies from our laboratory and others have shown the central role of myosin light  chain kinase (MLCK) in regulating the intestinal epithelial TJ permeability [81-84]. MLCK is a  Ca 2+  -calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that has been shown to regulate peri-junc-  tional acto-myosin filaments and mechanical induced opening of the TJ barrier in intestinal epi-  thelial cells. Moreover, previous studies have found that increased MLCK expression activity  strongly correlated with active inflammation in IBD [85]. MLCK has also been shown to be  essential in mediating the TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-13-induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability in vitro and in vivo [25, 30, 34, 85-88]. In addition, several studies have found a pathogenic role of MLCK in both intestinal barrier dysfunction and intestinal inflammation in  animal models of IBD [88-90]. Recently, we showed that MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal  epithelial TJ permeability was also mediated by an increase in MLCK expression in a p38 kinase-  dependent manner in vitro and in vivo and in a DSS-colitis mouse model [23, 91]. However, the involvement of NF-\u03baB in MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression was not determined. In the current study, we demonstrated the requirement of NF-\u03baB activation in MMP-9-upregula- tion of MLCK expression in Caco-2 monolayers. Silencing of the NF-\u03baB p65 subunit prevented the MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression and subsequent increase in intestinal epithe-  lial TJ permeability. Consistent with the current data, previous studies have shown that the NF-  \u03baB signaling pathway mediated the cytokine-induced MLCK activation leading to an MLCK- dependent increase in intestinal TJ permeability in vitro and in vivo [30, 88, 92, 93].  In conclusion, the current results demonstrated for the first time that NF-\u03baB plays a key role in MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression and subsequently leads to an increase in  intestinal epithelial TJ permeability in Caco-2 monolayers. An overall schematic diagram of  the intracellular pathway examined in this study is shown in Fig 5.  Supporting information  S1 Raw images.
