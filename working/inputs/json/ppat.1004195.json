In tissue arrays of RMS tumor cores from 71 patients, 80% of RMS patients expressed high levels of Sp1 protein, whereas low expression of Sp1 was detected in normal muscle tissue. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) tolfenamic acid (TA) inhibited growth and migration of RD and RH30 RMS cell lines and also inhibited tumor growth in vivo using a mouse xenograft (RH30 cells) model. The effects of TA were accompanied by downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes in RMS cells and tumors, and the role of Sp protein downregulation in mediating inhibition of RD and RH30 cell growth and migration was confirmed by individual and combined knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins by RNA interference. TA treatment and Sp knockdown in RD and RH30 cells also showed that four genes that are emerging as individual drug targets for treating RMS, namely c-MET, insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), PDGFR\u03b1 and CXCR4, are also Sp-regulated genes. These results suggest that NSAIDs such as TA may have potential clinical efficacy in drug combinations for treating RMS patients.",

Here we show that ERK- mediated reactivation is dependent on the mitogen and stress activated kinase (MSK) family. Furthermore, this MSK mediated response is dependent on CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). Specifically, CREB binding to the MIEP provides the target for MSK recruitment. Importantly, MSK mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. Taken together, these data suggest that CREB binding to the MIEP is necessary for the recruitment of the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate the chromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for reactivation. Thus the importance of CREB during HCMV reactivation is to promote chromatin modifications conducive for viral gene expression as well as acting as a classical transcription factor. Clearly, specific inhibition of this interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention.

The prototype betaherpesvirus member, Human  Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is no exception, establishing a latent  reservoir in the haematopoietic cells of the bone marrow (reviewed  in [1]). It is likely that sporadic reactivation and shedding -  although subclinical - is important for the sero-prevalence of  HCMV in the population via horizontal transmission. However, it  is the reactivation of HCMV (as well as primary infection) in  immune-compromised transplant recipients or late-stage AIDS  sufferers that represent a significant source of morbidity and  mortality in these high risk patient populations [2,3,4]. Conse-  quently, an understanding of the molecular and physiological cues  that promote reactivation could inform on the design of novel  therapeutic strategies.  Studies from a number of laboratories using analyses of  experimental and natural latency have led to a consensus that  HCMV establishes latency in the haematopoietic cells of the bone  marrow [5,6,7,8,9], persists in the monocyte/myeloid lineage  [10,11,12] and reactivates upon the differentiation and/or  stimulation of these cells to a more mature or activated phenotype  [8,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Furthermore, these reactivation events  appear to be augmented by inflammatory cytokine signalling  (e.g. TNF, interferon-gamma) acting in concert with cellular  differentiation [13,16,18]. Indeed we, and others, have reported  that the incubation of latently infected myeloid cells with IL-6 can  be a trigger for HCMV reactivation in experimental latency  [13,17]. Furthermore, we have also observed that the reactivation  of naturally latent virus from the dendritic cells (DCs) of healthy  individuals can be markedly abrogated using neutralising IL-6  antibodies [13,16]. Although we have postulated a role for ERK-  MAPK and interleukin-6 signalling in this event the underlying  mechanisms are still unclear [13].  In concert with observations in primary cells, studies of the  quiescent infection of the embryonal T2 carcinoma cell line have  suggested that elevated cAMP signalling promotes reactivation in a  creb response element (CRE) dependent manner [19,20]. This  alleviation of quiescent infection can be achieved using both  chemical (forskolin) and biological (vasoactive intestinal peptide)  activity and is suggestive that regions of the major immediate early  promoter (MIEP) shown to be redundant during lytic infection  may have important functions during reactivation from latency in  response to these stimuli [19,20,21]. In contrast, transfection  experiments with the MIEP point towards a role for TNF-a and downstream NF-KB signalling during reactivation [22] and, indeed, murine CMV (MCMV) studies support an important role  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004195&domain=pdf   for these signalling pathways also [23,24,25]. Furthermore, the  reactivation of HCMV from experimentally latent cell lines has  also been reported using phorbol esters and TNF-a - again consistent with a role for aspects of NF-Kb signalling being involved in HCMV reactivation [26,27] by triggering IE gene  expression.  ERK MAPK signalling can be activated by a diverse number of  ligands acting through two upstream modulators. Classical Ras-  Raf mediated ERK-MAPK signalling often acts in response to  mitogenic stimulation [28] with aberrant signalling associated with  a transformed phenotype in oncogenic cells [29]. Alternatively,  signalling can be activated by tpl2/Cot1 [30] which targets  downstream ERK phosphorylation following the engagement of  Toll-like [31] and receptors in the TNF super-family [32]. ERK  phosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation and subsequent  phosphorylation of a number of target proteins [33]. These targets  include the mitogen and stress activated protein kinases (MSKs)  and 90kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSKs) [34,35,36] which  themselves target a number of cellular substrates [35,37].  Interestingly, these targets include transcription factors and histone  proteins that may have roles in the regulation of HCMV  immediate early gene expression [15,19,20,38,39,40].  In this study, we have sought to address the mechanisms that  are important for the induction of IE gene expression required to  initiate HCMV reactivation. We have focussed on the interplay  between cellular signalling pathways and the activation of target  transcription factors. Building on our previous studies looking at  ERK-MAPK signalling we have addressed the impact of CREB  binding to the MIEP and how it asks as a platform to integrate  cellular signalling at the MIEP in differentiating DCs capable of  supporting reactivation. Using interleukin-6 or LPS as a tool to  initiate HCMV reactivation, we have identified that phosphory-  lated CREB occupancy on the MIEP is important for the  induction of IE gene expression. Furthermore, we also show that  histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 correlates with induction  of IE gene expression. Interestingly, the activation of the upstream  MSKs is pivotal for reactivation - with CREB and Histone H3  being major targets for this kinase which is also recruited to the  MIEP prior to the induction of IE gene expression. Intriguingly,  we also observe that histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP is  defective in the DCRE virus suggesting that binding and phosphorylation of CREB by MSKs promotes the subsequent  phosphorylation of histone H3. Finally, we show that abrogation  of ERK-MAPK signalling using a dominant negative form of  MEK1, the upstream kinase of ERK1/2, diminishes MSK  activation and blocks CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation at  the MIEP resulting in a substantial defect in IE gene expression.  Since histone H3 phosphorylation is a key event in the transition  from a repressed (latent) to an active (reactivated) promoter these  data suggest that CREB is an important factor for reactivation not  only because of its classical role as a transcriptional activator but  also via co-operative interaction with MSK to drive elevated  histone phosphorylation at the MIEP and subsequent activation of  gene expression.  Results  IE gene expression from latent virus is promoted through Ras-Raf mediated ERK-MAPK signalling  Ongoing studies of the pathways important for HCMV  reactivation from DCs have highlighted the ERK-MAPK pathway  as an important factor [13]. The maturation of DCs in response to  LPS triggers ERK phosphorylation which could occur via at least  two potential pathways - tpl2/Cot1 or Ras-Raf. To test which  pathway was important in the context of LPS induced reactiva-  tion, latently infected monocytes were differentiated to immature  DCs and then, prior to stimulation with LPS, incubated with a pan  ERK-MAPK inhibitor or specific inhibitors of the tpl2 and Ras-  Raf pathways. A qRT-PCR analysis for IE gene expression  confirmed our previous data that ERK-MAPK inhibition blocked  induction of HCMV IE gene expression (Fig. 1A,B). However,  inhibition with the upstream targets suggested that it was Ras-Raf,  and not tpl2 signalling, which was important for triggering the  induction of IE RNA expression (Fig. 1A,B). Previously, we have  observed that a major component of HCMV reactivation upon  DC stimulation with LPS is IL-6 and that activation of ERK-  MAPK signalling was also important in this response. Again,  consistent with a major role for Ras-Raf it was only inhibition of  this effector molecule - and not tpl2 signalling - which had a  major impact on HCMV IE RNA reactivation in response to IL-6  (Fig. 1B). Crucially, this defect in RNA expression was also  observed at the protein level. Pre-incubation of immature DCs  with inhibitors prior to stimulation with LPS or IL-6 resulted in a  marked defect in the number of IE-expressing cells in ERK, Ras-  Raf but not tpl2 inhibitor treated cells (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the  observation that LPS induced gene expression is dependent on  Ras signalling is consistent with LPS inducing reactivation via an  indirect mechanism (IL-6; Ras-ERK signalling) rather than a  direct mechanism (tpl2-ERK signalling).  CREB binding and phosphorylation to the MIEP is important for the induction of IE gene expression in primary DCs  Studies with the laboratory strain, Towne, using a quiescent  infection model in T2 cells have suggested that the CREB  response elements in the MIEP could have an important role in  reactivation in response to mitogenic stimuli [20] and thus we  hypothesised that differential binding to the MIEP of CREB could  be a potential mechanism in primary DCs. To address this, a series  of experiments were performed in reactivating CD14+ derived DCs. (Fig. 2). Firstly we examined CREB binding to the MIEP.  Interestingly, the co-immunoprecipitation of the MIEP with  CREB was observed in both CD14+ monocytes as well as differentiated DCs although increased levels of specific CREB  binding was detected as the cells became more differentiated when  compared to the isotype matched control (Fig. 2A). However,  despite the inhibitory effect (Fig. 1), pre-treatment with an ERK-  MAPK had no impact on the binding of CREB to the MIEP  Author Summary  Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of immune- compromised individuals is a significant cause of morbid- ity. In a number of settings disease is caused by the reactivation of a pre-existing quiescent infection of the host (latency) which, in the absence of a controlling immune response, is a major source of disease. Work to understand the switch from a latent to active (reactivated) infection has focussed on the regulation of the promoter that controls the major viral gene products IE72 and IE86 - an important first step towards HCMV reactivation. In this study we have correlated the activation of cellular signalling pathways with the downstream activation of this promoter. Specifically, the activation of cellular kinase in an ERK-MAPK dependent manner which displays an affinity for a protein bound to a key viral promoter drives a change in the chromatin architecture that allows viral gene expression - releasing the virus from the latent state.

However, a second analysis that assayed  relative levels of CREB and phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB)  bound to the MIEP suggested that the levels of CREB  phosphorylation most strongly correlated with induced IE gene  expression - and the effects of chemical inhibitors. In CD14+ monocytes, minimal binding of p-CREB to the MIEP was  observed. In contrast, in reactivating cells the predominant form  was p-CREB except when the cells were pre-incubated with an  ERK-MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 2B) at a concentration known to block  induction of HCMV IE gene expression (Fig. 1). Furthermore,  Western blot analysis suggested that these effects were not due to a  global inhibition of CREB phosphorylation in the cell by the ERK  inhibitor (Fig. 2C) consistent with multiple pathways capable of  promoting phosphorylation of the total cellular pool of CREB.  Taken together these data suggested that whilst inhibition of ERK-  MAPK signalling had little impact on CREB binding to the MIEP  it did result a marked reduction in the detection of p-CREB bound  to the MIEP correlating with a defect in the levels of viral IE gene  expression.  The CRE elements in the MIEP of HCMV promote efficient IE gene expression upon exit from latency  The prediction therefore would be that deletion of the CRE  within the MIEP would impact on HCMV reactivation from DCs.  To test this, 19 bp repeat deletions were generated in the  endothelial-tropic strain, TB40/e as described previously for  Towne [21]. Firstly, we confirmed that CREB did not bind to the  MIEP of the DCRE virus (Fig. S1). Then these viruses were used to establish a latent infection in CD14+ monocytes as evidenced by long term UL138 gene expression in an absence of UL123  expression. Unsurprisingly, there appeared to be no overt defect in  the ability of the mutant virus to establish a latent infection nor  any differential ability to carry HCMV genomes from monocytes  to immature DCs (Fig. 3A,B). However, when the cells were  differentiated and then subsequently stimulated with LPS or IL-6 a  defect in the ability of the DCRE mutant virus re-initiate IE gene expression was observed (Fig. 3C) - an effect more profound when  IL-6 stimulation was used (Fig. 3C). These data directly correlated  with a ChIP analysis for the presence of histone 3 dimethylated at  lysine 4 (H3-K4 2me  ) at the MIEP which, indicative of active  transcription from a promoter, was more abundant on the wild type  and revertant MIEPs compared with the DCRE (Fig. 3D). The defect in MIEP activity during reactivation appeared to be specific for this  phase of infection as the initiation of lytic infections in both HFFs and  Figure 1. Signalling via the Ras-RAF arm of ERK-MAPK is required for HCMV reactivation. A-B) RNA isolated from immature DCs or DCs stimulated with LPS (A) or IL-6 (B) was amplified qRT-PCR (IE and GAPDH). Prior to addition of LPS or IL-6 cells were incubated with inhibitors of ERK, Raf or tpl2 signalling for 1 hour.

In contrast to our observations with the DCRE virus, a deletion of the NF-KB binding sites from the MIEP appeared to have little impact on the induction of IE gene expression in primary DCs in  response to IL-6 (Fig. S3). Thus, under these experimental conditions,  the CRE sites in the MIEP were important for the induction of IE  gene expression upon exit from latency.  Inhibition of mitogen and stress activated protein kinase activity blocks induction of HCMV gene expression  Taken together these data suggested that ERK-MAPK signal-  ling initiated by mitogenic stimuli (i.e. IL-6) promoted HCMV  reactivation in a Ras-Raf dependent manner and that CREB, a  downstream target of ERK, was important for this. Thus our next  Figure 2. The binding of phosphorylated CREB to the MIEP correlates with reactivation.

We first asked whether inhibition of either of these pathways  resulted in an inhibition to HCMV reactivation. Pre-incubation of  immature DCs with an MSK inhibitor significantly abrogated IL-  6 induced IE gene expression in reactivating DCs (Fig. 4A).  Interestingly, this effect was more profound than observed with an  ERK-MAPK inhibitor (possibly due to the incomplete inhibition  of MSK phosphorylation seen with the ERK-MAPK inhibitor  (Fig. 4B)). Furthermore, the effect was specific for the MSK family  as no effect was observed with an RSK inhibitor (Fig. 4A).  Furthermore, the effects appeared to be specific to latency.  Primary infection of DCs in the presence or absence of MSK or  RSK inhibitors had little impact on IE gene expression when  measured by IE-RT-PCR (Fig. 4C) or by indirect immuno-  fluorescent staining for IE protein expression (Fig. 4D).

As such, we remained  intrigued by the observation that MSK inhibitors had such a  dramatic impact on HCMV IE gene expression in DCs (Fig. 4)  and thus we reasoned it was an essential integration point for  defining the ERK triggered response. Indeed, unlike ERK-  MAPK, the inhibition of MSK activity profoundly blocks IL-6  induced CREB phosphorylation in DCs (Fig. 5A) whilst,  unsurprisingly, having little impact on the phosphorylation of  ERK and MSK themselves (Fig. 5A). Although we cannot rule out  an effect of H-89 on Protein Kinase A activity - itself a protein that  can phosphorylate CREB - the rapid induction of MSK  phosphorylation by IL-6 which signals in a PKA independent  manner [42,43].  Consequently, we hypothesised that other targets of MSK may  also be important for inducing IE gene expression from latency.  An attractive candidate was histone H3. Predominantly methyl-  ated when bound to the MIEP in latency, reactivation in DCs is  concomitant with global acetylation of histones bound to the  MIEP [15]. Clearly signalling pathways dictate this phenotypic  switch and we focussed on the ability of MSK to promote histone  H3 phosphorylation at serine residue 10 [44] - an event which has  been hypothesised to provide a critical intermediary step between  histone de-methylation and subsequent histone acetylation on  multiple \u2018early response' cellular promoters [45,46].  A time of addition study, analysing the ability of neutralising IL-  6 antibodies to block HCMV reactivation following stimulation  with LPS, revealed that the effects of IL-6 signalling must manifest  at immediate-early times post infection (Fig. S4). Consequently, we  performed an initial time-course analysis revealed that histone  phosphorylation at serine-10 occurred rapidly with phosphoryla-  tion detectable within 1 hour post stimulation (Fig. S5). Consistent  with a role for ERK-MAPK activation in reactivation we also  observed that histone phosphorylation and acetylation was  observed in IE-expressing DCs and that this phenotype was  inhibited by ERK-MAPK or Raf inhibitors (Fig. S6). Further-  more, the phosphorylation of histone H3 in response to IL-6 did  not require de novo viral (or cellular) gene expression (Fig. S7)  suggesting it occurred prior to HCMV lytic gene expression and  thus reactivation. More pertinently, the pre-incubation of imma-  ture DCs with MSK inhibitors resulted in a significant decrease in  the detection of the phosphorylated forms of both histone H3 and  CREB bound to the MIEP (Fig. 5B). In contrast, use of an RSK  inhibitor appeared to have no impact (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the  relatively higher levels of H3-K9 methylation at the MIEP in  MSK inhibitor treated cells supports the hypothesis that MSK  activity is required for a switch in the chromatin phenotype from a  repressed to active state at the MIEP.  Finally, we examined reactivating cells for the presence of MSK  at the MIEP. A time-course analysis showed that MSK immune-  precipitated with the MIEP but, unlike observed with histone H3  phosphorylation (Fig. S5), the occupancy appeared far more  transient (Fig. 5C) which is likely reflected in the different  functional roles these proteins play. Both histones and CREB  are likely associated with the MIEP for longer duration whereas  MSK recruitment and activity is likely a more acute response to  signalling. Once the targets are phosphorylated MSK may be  released from the complex.  The phosphorylation of CREB bound to the MIEP promotes histone H3 phosphorylation  Our data suggested that for the successful initiation of HCMV  reactivation to occur phosphorylation of both CREB and histone  H3 were necessary. Thus, we reasoned that ChIP analyses of  reactivating cells generated from either wild type or DCRE infected monocytes could still be bound by phosphorylated  histones and the defect in the DCRE virus possibly due to a lack of CREB binding. However, we were intrigued to observe that an  overt lack of phosphorylated histone H3 bound to the MIEP of the  DCRE infected cells was observed upon stimulation with IL-6 (Fig. 6A). This suggested that histone H3 phosphorylation at the  MIEP was dependent on CREB binding. Consequently, we  performed a ChIP re-ChIP analysis on reactivating cells to  determine whether the binding of phosphorylated CREB was  indeed co-incident with histone H3 phosphorylation. To do this  we performed a ChIP analysis on IL-6 treated DCs 2 hours post  stimulation or unstimulated DCs with anti-H3-S10 p , anti-H3-  K9 3Me  and the appropriate isotype matched control. As expected,  the analysis of the first round IP showed that the MIEPs in the  stimulated DCs were predominantly associated with phosphory-  lated and not methylated histones whereas as in the unstimulated  DCs the MIEP was predominantly associated with methylated  histones (Fig. 6B) consistent with the IE gene expression profile in  these different cell populations. We then focussed on the  reactivating samples to determine whether CREB was concom-  itantly bound with H3-S10 P . Consistent with our hypothesis, we  could detect the IP of the MIEP following incubation with the p-  CREB antibody. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the GAPDH  promoter (the regulation of which is CREB-independent [47])  showed that this promoter was not enriched in the sample (Fig. 6C)  nor did we detect any MIEP sequences in a p-CREB IP from the  H3-K9 3Me  primary IP sample. Taken together, these data suggest  that phosphorylated CREB and histone H3-S10 P  were concom-  itantly bound to the MIEP in IE expressing DC populations.  Finally, the data and the model predicted that MSK recruit-  ment to the MIEP would also be on the same promoters  harbouring phosphorylated histones. Thus we performed the  same ChIP re-ChIP procedure to assess MSK binding. Our  analysis, performed at 2 hpi (when both MSK and H3-S10-P can  be detected on the MIEP (Figs. 5 and S5)) showed that we could  observe enrichment for MSK binding to the MIEP also bound by  H3-S10-P (Fig. 6D). Thus, MSK, CREB and H3-S10 phosphor-  ylation could be detected on the same MIEPs in reactivating cells.  Figure 5.

We reasoned that the  inefficient transfection of primary DCs with siRNAs would not  allow us to see effects on HCMV when between 3-5% of cells are  actively supporting HCMV latency based on IE positivity upon  IL-6 stimulation. Therefore, we infected differentiating monocytes  4 days post differentiation with adenoviruses expressing GFP or a  dominant negative form of ERK kinase MEK1 (Figure 7).  Importantly, using adenoviruses we could establish between 60-  70% infection based on the expression of GFP when the cells were  analysed 24 hours post infection. Consistent with the expression of  a dominant negative form MEK1, ERK and downstream  phosphorylation of MSK was substantially reduced (Fig. 7A) -  giving us further confidence that CREB phosphorylation in  response to IL-6 was MSK and not PKA dependent (Fig. 5).  Importantly, no effect on STAT-3 phosphorylation was observed  in response to IL-6 confirming that there was not a global  inhibition of IL-6 signalling (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, we analysed  DCs 48 hours post infection with the adenoviruses for HCMV  gene expression. Interestingly, expression of MEK1 had a  profound impact on the level of IE gene expression in DCs  (Fig. 7B). Pertinently, the expression of inactive MEK1 also  impacted on CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP  (Fig. 7C). The normal phosphorylation of CREB and histone H3,  and concomitant loss of histone methylation, was severely  abrogated (Fig. 7C).  Activation of histone H3 phosphorylation induces IE gene expression in dendritic cells independent of CREB  The data thus far argue that MSK-mediated phosphorylation of  CREB and histone H3 correlated with an induction of IE gene  expression. We hypothesized that one explanation for the major  role of CREB during reactivation is to enhance histone H3  phosphorylation which would promote gene expression via the  adoption of an open chromatin conformation. We reasoned,  therefore, that a surrogate signal for histone phosphorylation may  be sufficient to trigger HCMV IE gene expression in the DCRE virus. Histone phosphorylation is dynamically regulated and,  consequently, the inhibition of the histone dephosphorylase  protein phosphatase 2A promotes hyper-phosphorylation of  histones at a number of cellular promoters. Interestingly,  incubation of immature DCs derived from latently infected  monocytes with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid  was sufficient to drive induction of IE gene expression of both wild  type and, albeit less efficiently, the DCRE virus (Fig. 8A). Although we cannot rule out off-target effects associated with the use of  okadaic acid, the well established effects of okadaic acid on histone  phosphorylation was consistent with elevated levels of phosphor-  ylated histones bound to the MIEP were observed by ChIP assay  correlating with the detection of HCMV gene expression (Fig. 8B)  suggesting that chemical insults, similar to those proposed with the  use of histone deacetylase inhibitors, triggered IE gene expression  from quiescent virus. However, we note that unlike observed with  HDAC inhibitors, okadaic acid did not trigger IE gene expression  in monocytes under the same experimental conditions suggesting  that cellular differentiation was also important.  Discussion  Understanding the cellular and molecular basis of HCMV  reactivation remains an enigmatic problem. Numerous studies of  both HCMV and murine CMV have shown that inflammation is a  key component of CMV reactivation [8,13,17,18,22,24,25] by  inducing or augmenting the expression of the IE genes from a  previously quiescent state. An understanding of the role of  inflammation and, specifically, the signalling components activat-  ed by it, will be pivotal for delineation of the molecular basis of  HCMV reactivation which, subsequently, impacts on the design of  future therapeutic targets to control HCMV disease. Ultimately, a  blockade - or at least a diminishment of the induction of IE gene  expression will prevent efficient HCMV reactivation.  Pivotal early events in the reactivation of HCMV include  cellular differentiation and concomitant activation of transcription  of the major IE genes [1]. Indeed, we argue that cellular  differentiation is a key event for the effects we observe. In our  model for the induction of HCMV IE gene expression from  latency we hypothesise that MSK activity via CREB is important  for the first stages of HCMV reactivation in IL-6 stimulated  immature DCs. Importantly, we also observe that IL-6 does not  directly trigger HCMV reactivation from monocytes [13] and thus  the MIEP in monocytes is intrinsically unresponsive to IL-6 (Fig. 9).  This suggests that cellular differentiation, or even long term  culture of monocytes [17], either eliminates an intrinsic block to  IL-6 mediated activation of the MIEP or, alternatively, up-  regulates a co-factor that helps drive the induction of HCMV gene  expression from latency.  Robust IE gene expression can be triggered by IL-6 or LPS in  this system and, previously, a number of different cytokines have  been implicated in the initiation of HCMV and MCMV IE  reactivation [8,17,18,24,25]. These include interferon gamma and  TNF, interleukin-1b, or GM-CSF and IL-4 and thus cytokines important for myeloid cell differentiation and inflammation also  promote and propagate CMV reactivation. Indeed, it is important  to re-iterate that we argue that IL-6 induces robust reactivation of  HCMV from immature DCs in our hands rather than acting as a  \u2018latency breaker' - in that it cannot reverse latency in primitive  progenitor cells. Consistent with this, low level reactivation is  Figure 6. Phosphorylation of histone H3 is dependent on CREB binding to the MIEP. A) Immature DCs (iDC) derived from monocytes infected with wild type (WT), Revertant (Rev) or CRE deletion virus (DCRE) were left un-stimulated (1,3,5) or IL-6 treated cells (2,4,6). Then, chromatin immunoprecipitation of histone H3-S10P was performed and samples amplified in an MIEP qPCR (2 hours post stimulation). Following normalisation to GAPDH, samples were expressed as a ratio of the Input signal. B-C) immature (latent;1,2) and IL-6 stimulated (reactivating, 3,4) DCs (2 hours post stimulation) were subject to chromatin immunoprecipitation with an anti-histone H3-S10  P (S10P), anti-histone H3-K9  3Me (K9M) or isoptype control  (IgG) antibodies and then amplified in an MIEP qPCR and signal expressed as a ratio of the Input. C) The primary ChIPs from the reactivating samples (B) were then subject to a second ChIP with a phosphor CREB antibody or isotype matched control. The phosphor-CREB IP from H3-S10P IP (1-4) was then expressed as a ratio of the Input signal for the MIEP or GAPDH qPCR. Alternatively, the phosphor-CREB or isotype control IPs from H3-K93Me (5,6) were amplified in an MIEP qPCR and expressed as a ratio of Input. S.D. of n = 2. D) IL-6 stimulated DCs (2 hours) were subject to a primary IP with anti- histone H3-serine 10 antibody then subject to second IP with an anti-MSK1 antibody or isoptype control.

However, the addition of exogenous IL-6 acts as a factor that  drives robust HCMV IE gene expression in cells on the cusp of  reactivation making it more efficient - with possible similarities to the  \u2018accelerator' function recently postulated for the regulation of IE86  expression during lytic infection [49]. We reason that this could  explain why neutralising IL-6 antibodies significantly reduce the level  of HCMV reactivation we observe but do not abolish it completely.  It is highly plausible that there is not one molecular pathway  that is responsible for acting as a latency breaker and that actually  the notion of a single \u2018latency breaker' is fundamentally flawed.  The composition of the MIEP should, theoretically, make it  responsive to diverse stimuli. A number of motifs render it  responsive to activators of NF-KB, CREB, AP-1 and IFN activated pathways suggesting that redundancy (or co-operativity) exists  Figure 7. A dominant negative MEK1 blocks IE gene expression and CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP.

Consistent with redundancy, the deletion of a  number of these elements does not significantly impact on the  growth of HCMV mutants in fibroblasts in vitro [21]. In contrast,  consistent with a degree of co-operativity, it has been reported that  CREs located in the proximal enhancer region may be important  for co-ordinating efficient transcription factor activity at the MIEP  Figure 8. Okadaic acid promotes histone phosphorylation at the MIEP and partially rescuing the CRE deletion virus.

As such, it has been postulated  that these regions could be important in a cell type or context  specific manner [20,50]. In this study, we asked whether  previously identified CRE elements were important for HCMV  reactivation in primary cells. Based on these observations the  reactivation of the DCRE virus was less efficient than wild type. This defect in reactivation correlated with a failure to promote the  modification of histones from a latent (H3-K9 3me  ) to an active  (H3-K4 2me  ) upon reactivation. Key to this switch was the activity  of MSKs which promote extensive histone H3 phosphorylation at  the MIEP in the early stages of reactivation. The idea of CREB/  MSK-mediated phosphorylation of the histones bound to the  MIEP as an important trigger of reactivation is highly attractive.  Firstly, previous work has shown histone phosphorylation at serine  10 can synergise with histone acetylation [51] as well as de-  stabilising the binding of chromo-domain proteins such as  heterochromatin protein 1 [52,53] - a protein that is recruited  to methylated histones bound to promoters including the viral  MIEP during latency [15]. Furthermore, histone phosphorylation  is associated with a distinct set of promoters (the so-called \u2018rapid  response genes') argued to promote hyper-acetylation of histones  at these loci in a MAPK and MSK dependent manner [53].  Clearly, these events would positively influence HCMV reactiva-  tion if the MIEP is subject to the same mechanisms of regulation.  Indeed, in vitro biochemical studies on the c-fos promoter have  shown that the chromatin bound to the c-fos promoter is highly  resistant to MSK mediated phosphorylation [54]. However, the  binding of CREB (itself a target for MSK kinase activity) acts to  promote histone phosphorylation and, as such, the parallels with  our cell based analyses of HCMV latency and reactivation are  striking. Furthermore, it is intriguing that this response at the c-fos  promoter was enhanced by the presence of HMG (high mobility  group) proteins [54] - a family of chromatin bound proteins  implicated in the regulation of RTA mediated regulation of  gamma herpes virus gene expression [55,56] - including  reactivation from latency. As such, it is tempting to speculate that  MSK could play a role in the reactivation of multiple herpes viruses.  Initially it was slightly surprising that MSK but not RSK activity  contributed to the reactivation. RSK activity is predominantly  associated with ERK-MAPK signalling whereas MSKs are  activated via both ERK and p38 mediated mechanisms yet it  appears ERK activation is important for HCMV reactivation [13].  However, the role of ERK-MAPK signalling via MSKs in  response to pro-inflammatory cytokine and growth factor stimu-  lation [57] likely explains why this pathway predominates in the  reactivation phenotype compared to other MAPK pathways in  this setting. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that  the MSK pathway provides important kinase activity responsible  for histone phosphorylation in a CREB dependent manner at  specific promoters. The detection of MSK binding to the MIEP  prior to reactivation is supportive of this.  In conclusion, we have shown that IE gene expression from  latency in DCs is acutely sensitive to MSK chemical inhibition and  that reactivation of HCMV involves the phosphorylation of  histones bound to the latent MIEP. MSK mediated phosphory-  lation of these histones is highly dependent on concomitant CREB  binding to the MIEP. Indeed, it is an important consideration that  these studies relied extensively on the use of chemical inhibitors  which can have multiple effects on cellular signalling pathways  over and above their reported specificities and thus will require  further investigation. However, an interaction between CREB and  MSK at the MIEP provides a mechanism for the signal integration  required to promote HCMV reactivation from DCs in an ERK-  MAPK dependent manner. Furthermore, using the regulation of  the MIEP during HCMV latency and reactivation as a model of  differential gene expression we provide further in vivo evidence for  a functional interaction between MSK and CREB at promoters  which, in this case, is important for controlling the gene expression  of a clinically important pathogen. Clearly, because the effects of  MSKs on gene expression are restricted to specific promoters  further de-lineation of the pathways responsible for activation of  the MIEP provides the potential for new therapeutic interventions.

The expression of IE gene expression is restricted in CD14+ monocytes and is inherently unresponsive to inflammatory IL-6 signalling. However, cellular differentiation to a permissive phenotype renders latently infected cells responsive to stimuli that support IE gene expression and, ultimately, reactivation. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004195.g009  MSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus Reactivation  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195    dance with established guidelines for the handling and processing of  said tissue by the Cambridge Local Research Ethics committee.  Virus, cell lines, culture and reagents The clinical isolate TB40/e (a kind gift of Christian Sinzger,  University of Tuebeingen, Germany) was purified from infected  human retinal pigment epithelial cells using sorbitol gradients as  previously described [58]. Viruses for these studies were  characterised by their ability to infect primary dendritic cells to  assay myelo-tropism - routinely, virus preparations infected 10-  20% DCs when used at an MOI of 5 calculated on fibroblasts.  To generate HCMV mutants in the CREB response elements a  galk BAC recombineering method was used as described  previously [21]. Essentially, base substitutions in the 5 copies of  CRE present in the MIEP was performed by site directed  mutagenesis in the P4EDM plasmid and the enhancer fragment excised using Eag1 and Bsrg1 restriction digest. For BAC  mutagenesis, galk primers with 50 bp homology to HCMV MIE  flanking +1 to 2580 were used (59- ATC TGA CGG TTC ACT AAA CGA GCT CTG CTT ATA TAG ACC TCC CAC CGT  ACC CTG TTG ACA ATT AAT CAT CGG CA and 59- CAG  CGT GGA TGG CGT CTC CAG GCG ATC TGA CGG TTC  ACT AAA CGC CTG TTG ACA ATT AAT CAT CGG CAT  AGT ATA TCG GCA TAG) were used to amplify galk with  flanking HCMV sequences using galk BAC in SW102. SW105  cells containing the TB40/e BAC were electroporated with the  galk fragment and selected for using galactose containing agar  plates and MacConkey galactose plates for verification. Sequence  verified positive clones were then subject to a second round of  recombination which introduced the Enhancer fragment isolated  initially. Recombinants which had deleted galk were selected for  on 2-deoxygalactose containing plates. Purified BACs were  isolated, sequence verified and then transfected into permissive  fibroblasts to reconstitute infectious virus.  The generation of the NF-KB mutant virus was performed using the same BAC mutagenesis protocol to generate point mutations  by site-directed mutagenesis at positions 294, 2157, 2262 and 2  413 relative to +1 transcription start site in P4EDM as described previously [59].  Primary CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the venous blood of anonymous donors who had given informed consent under the  appropriate local rules. Typically, 50 mls of venous blood was  diluted in PBS either 1:1 and, following separation on a ficoll  gradient (Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Melville, NY) peripheral blood  mononuclear cells were then purified using either a CD14+ cell direct isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Labelled  CD14+ positive cells were rescued using Magnet Activated Cell Sorting (MACS) and cultured in X-vivo 15 (Cambrex, Walkers-  ville, MD) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine and cytokines  to promote DC differentiation where appropriate.  Experimental infection of primary cells and differentiation  The establishment of an in vitro experimental latent infection of  primary CD14+ cells was performed by infecting CD14+ monocytes (56105 cells/well) were infected in 250 ul of X-vivo 15 media plus HCMV (MOI = 5) for 3 hours then rescued in 1 ml  fresh media. After 3 days, experimentally infected CD14+ cells were differentiated to immature monocyte derived DCs (MoDCs)  as described previously [13]. Briefly, CD14+ monocytes were cultured with Interleukin-4 (100 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (100 ng/  ml) to promote differentiation to an interstitial-like DC phenotype  [60]. Following culture, immature DCs was matured using  Lipopolysaccharide (500 ng/ml; SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) or  incubated with recombinant IL-6. All cytokines were from  Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) unless otherwise stated.  Inhibitors and antibodies To test for inhibition of HCMV reactivation, inhibitors were  added prior to LPS or IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of MEK/ERK  was achieved using U0126 (or inactive analogue U0124; both  5 uM), tpl2 (tpl2 kinase Inhibitor II; 1 uM), Raf (Raf Kinase  Inhibitor IV; 500 nM), RSK (BI-D1870; 500 nM; Selleckchem,  Houston, TX) and MSK (H-89; 10 uM; Sigma Aldrich, Poole,  UK) inhibitors (all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA unless  otherwise stated). All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and  added 2 hours prior to addition of LPS directly to the culture  media. Prior to use, all inhibitors were titrated to ensure determine  a dose that gave activity against its target without any over effect  on the viability of the cells (trypan blue exclusion). To promote  histone H3 phosphorylation, the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A  inhibitor okadaic acid (5 uM, Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK) was  added to cells 3 hours prior to the induction of reactivation.  Where appropriate inhibitors were shown to have no impact on  lytic infection of DCs or HFFs and, over the time frame of  analyses, were shown not to be deleterious to cell viability.  For immuno-fluorescent detection of viral antigens, cells were  fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilised with 0.1%  Triton X/PBS. An anti-IE (Millipore, 1:1000 in PBS) and then  with an Alexafluor 594 nm conjugated Goat anti-mouse antibody  (Millipore; 1:1000 in PBS). All antibody incubations were  performed for 1 hour at room temperature.  Protein expression was detected by Western blotting of  denatured protein samples. To detect protein expression nitrocel-  lulose filters were incubated at 4uC overnight with anti-CREB or anti-phosphor-CREB antibodies, (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology,  Charlottesville, VA), anti-p42/p44 or phosphor-anti-p42/p44  antibodies, anti-MSK1 or anti-phosphor-MSK1 (serine 360) (all  1:1000; Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, MA) and anti-  STAT-3 or phosphor-STAT-3 (tyrosine 705) (1:250; Santa Cruz  Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated with a HRP  conjugated Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000; Santa  Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hr at RT. As a loading  control, nitrocellulose filters were also incubated with a rabbit anti-  GAPDH control (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by an  HRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000; Santa Cruz  Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) - both antibody incubations  performed at RT for 1 hr. Blots were processed using ECL plus  (GE life sciences, Amersham, UK) and exposed to Kodak  autoradiograph film (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK).  Nucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription and PCR RNA was isolated from 10  6 cells using RNAeasy spin columns  as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  Following isolation, total RNA was incubated with DNAse I  (Promega, Madison, WI) and then amplified by qRT-PCR. IE,  UL138 and GAPDH gene expression was determined using a  Taqman Triplex qRT-PCR system (SIGMA, Poole, UK) with the  following primers and probes: IE, 59- CAA GAA CTC AGC CTT  CCC TAA GAC and 59- TGA GGC AAG TTC TCG AAT GC  with the probe CCA ATG GCT GCA GTC AGG CCA TG-  (TAM); UL138, 59- CGC TGT TTC TCT GGT TAG and 59-  CAG ACG ATA CCG TTT CTC with the probe CCG ACG  ACG AAG ACG ATG AAC-(Cy5); and GAPDH, 59- GGA AGC  TTG TCA TCA ATG and 59- CCC CAC TTG ATT TTG GAG  with the probe ATC ACC ATC TTC CAG GAG CGA G-(JOE).  Reactions were set up using the Qiagen RT-PCR Quantitect kit  (Qiagen, Sussex, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer's  MSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus Reactivation  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195    protocol and the samples amplified for ABI 7500 Fast Real Time  PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA; 95uC for 15 s and 60uC for 45 s).  Chromatin immunoprecipitation and analysis All procedures were performed essentially as described previ-  ously. Briefly, DCs were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (10 mins)  and then lysed and sonicated to fragment DNA. DNA associated  with histones was immunoprecipitated with control serum (Sigma,  Poole, UK), anti-phosphor-histone H3-serine 10 antiserum (ChIP  grade, 1:200 dilution), anti-dimethyl lysine 4 histone H3 antiserum  (ChIP grade, 1:200), anti-trimethyl lysine 9 H3 antiserum (ChIP  grade, 1:200 dilution), anti-phosphor or total CREB (both 1:250),  or anti-MSK1 antibody (1:200 dilution; Cell signalling Technol-  ogy, Danvers, MA) - all antibodies Upstate Biotechnology,  Charlottesville, VA unless stated. For detection of the MIEP of  HCMV, DNA from disrupted nucleosomes was precipitated and  amplified by qPCR using 59-CCAAGTCTCCACCCCATTGAC  (sense) and 59-GACATTTTGGAAAGTCCCGTTG (anti-sense)  primers and quantified using a Taqman probe FAM-59-TGG-  GAGTTTGTTTTGGCACCAAA-39-TMR. Cellular DNA se-  quences (GAPDH promoter) were amplified using 59-CGGC-  TACTAGCGGTTTTACG (sense) and 59-AAGAAGATGC-  GGCTGACTGT (anti-sense) and quantified using a Taqman  probe FAM-59-CACGTAGCTCAGGCCTCAAGACCT-39-  TMR. Specific immuno-precipitation of sequences was expressed  as enrichment from Input.  Adenoviral delivery of MEK1 proteins and analysis in latency  To deliver exogenous proteins to primary cells, adenoviral  vectors expressing GFP or a dominant negative version of MEK1,  were used (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA). Four days into the 6 day  differentiation protocol, differentiating cells were infected with  adenoviral expression vectors (MOI 250) for 3 hours then the  media replaced with fresh growth media. At Day 6 of differen-  tiation (48 hours post adenovirus infection), cells were stimulated  with IL-6 and then harvested for Western Blot analysis 15 mins  post culture, 2 hours post stimulation for ChIP analyses, or left  overnight and subject to either RT-qPCR for IE gene expression.  Supporting Information  Figure S1 CREB does not bind to the MIEP of the DCRE virus. Chromatin immunoprecipitations on immature DCs (iDC) stimulated with IL-6 (2 hours) were performed with an anti-CREB  antibody or isotype control. Samples were amplified in an MIEP  qPCR and expressed as a ratio of the Input. Error bars represent  SD of a triplicate analysis.  (TIF)  Figure S2 Deletion of CRE from the MIEP does not impact on infection of DCs. monocyte derived DCs or HFFs were infected with wild type, DCRE or revertant viruses (MOI = 5:HFFs) and stained, 24 hpi, for IE expression and  counter-stained with DAPI. Cell counts from 5 random fields  were performed from triplicate wells.  (TIF)  Figure S3 Deletion of the NF-kB binding sites does not inhibit IL-6 induced reactivation in DCs. A) Monocytes infected with wild type (WT), Revertant (Rev) or DNF-kB deletion  virus (DNF-kB) were analysed 5 days post infection for UL138 and GAPDH gene expression by qRT-PCR. Viral gene expression  (UL138) was expressed as a ratio to GADPH. B) Alternatively, infected CD14 cells were differentiated to immature DCs and  stimulated with IL-6 to promote reactivation. The percentage of  IE positive cells was calculated by indirect immunofluorescence  and DAPI nuclear counterstaining. S.D. shown from n = 2 (A,B).  (TIF)  Figure S4 The inhibition of HCMV reactivation by IL-6 neutralisation occur immediately post LPS stimulation. A) CD14+ cells infected with HCMV were differentiated to immature DCs and then stimulated with LPS (2-6) to induce  reactivation. Cells were then incubated with neutralising IL6  antibodies (3-6) between 0-6 hours post LPS stimulation and  percentage reactivation calculated by indirect immunofluores-  cence for IE gene expression (24 hrs) and DAPI nuclear  counterstaining. S.D. shown from n = 3.  (TIF)  Figure S5 Histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 accumulates post IL-6 stimulation of DCs. Chromatin immunopreciptations with anti-histone H3 phospho-serine 10 or  isotype control antibodies were performed on DCs derived from  monocytes infected with HCMV (1-3) subsequently stimulated  with IL-6 between 15 minutes and 3 hours post reactivation. DNA  was amplified in an MIEP PCR and expressed as ratio of the Input  sample. S.D. of n = 2.  (TIF)  Figure S6 Inhibition of Raf-ERK MAPK signalling blocks phosphor- and acetyl modification of histones at the MIEP. A-B) Chromatin immunoprecipitation of histone H3-S10  P , pan acetyl histone H4 or isotype matched control was  performed on CD14+ cells differentiated to immature DCs. Prior to IL-6 (A) or LPS (B) stimulation cells were incubated with  DMSO, ERK, Raf or tpl2 inhibitors for 2 hours then stimulated  for 3 hours prior to ChIP. DNA was then amplified in an MIEP  qPCR and signal expressed as a ratio of the Input. S.D. of n = 2.  (TIF)  Figure S7 Histone phosphorylation occurs independent of viral gene expression. A-B) Immature DCs derived from monocytes infected HCMV were incubated with actinomycin D  (4 hours pre-stimulation) and then incubated with IL-6. At 2 hours  post stimulation ChIP assays (A) with anti-histone H3-phospho  serine 10 or isotype control antibodies was performed. DNA was  amplified in an MIEP qPCR and signals expressed as a ratio of  Input S.D. n = 2. Alternatively, RNA was isolated 24 hours post  IL-6 stimulation and analysed for IE and GAPDH gene expression  by qPCR (B). The fold increase in IE gene expression was  calculated relative to immature DCs not stimulated with IL-6.  S.D. n = 2.
