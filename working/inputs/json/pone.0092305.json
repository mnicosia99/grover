Enzyme responsible for this process is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that maintains an altered methylation pattern by copying it from parent to daughter DNA strands after replication. Aberrant methylation of the promoter regions of genes critical for normal cellular functions is potentially reversible. Therefore, inactivation of DNMT1 seems to be a valuable target for the development of cancer therapies. Currently, the most popular DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi) are cytidine analogues like 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside (zebularine). In colorectal cancer, epigenetic modifications play an essential role at each step of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we have addressed the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors may potentiate inhibitory effects of classical chemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), commonly used in colorectal cancer therapy. Here, our report shows that DNMTi can have positive interactions with standard chemotherapeutics in colorectal cancer treatment. Using pharmacological models for the drug-drug interaction analysis, we have revealed that the combination of decitabine with 5-FU or oxaliplatin shows the most attractive interaction (synergism), whereas the effect of zebularine in combinations with chemotherapeutics is moderate and may be depended on genetic/epigenetic background of a cell line or secondary drug used in combination. Our results suggest that DNMTi administered in combination with standard chemotherapeutics might improve the treatment of patients with colorectal cancers.

It is estimated that over  600000 people die from it globally each year [1]. It means that  colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer related deaths.  Unfortunately, CRC develops for a long time without any  symptoms; therefore the disease is recognized at advanced stages.  Generally, the risk of CRC increases with age and is caused not  only by genetic alterations involving oncogenes and tumor  suppressor genes, but is also driven by epigenetic alterations  involving changes in gene expression patterns, which are not  dependent on changes in the DNA sequence. One of the  epigenetic events is caused by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs),  which catalyze the covalent addition of the methyl group to the 59  position of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide from the donor S-  adenosylmethionine. Cytosine methylation occurs in genomic  regions called CpG islands and it is known to alter the chromatin  structure leading to gene silencing. During colorectal cancer  progression, a global genome demethylation coupled with selective  hypermethylation of tumor suppressors, cell cycle regulators and  proapoptotic genes is observed [2]. Because epigenetic modifica-  tions are potentially reversible, they constitute an interesting  therapeutic strategy with use of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi).  Decitabine and zebularine are DNMT inhibitors, which may  potentially reverse epigenetic alterations resulting in reactivation of  silenced genes, blocking cancer cell proliferation and/or inducing  apoptosis [3,4]. Both agents seem to be very interesting and  valuable for therapy of solid tumors. Decitabine, a cytidine analog,  has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) for the treatment of hematological malignancies [5],  whereas zebularine in comparison to other cytidine analogs is  more stable, less toxic and can be orally administered [6].  It appears to be reasonable to use demethylating agents in  combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Interestingly, encour-  aging results were obtained with combination of decitabine and  carboplatin in patients with solid tumors [7]. The authors  concluded that decitabine combines safely with carboplatin and  that the regimen causes epigenetic changes. In another phase I  study, a combination of cisplatin with decitabine resulted in one  partial response in patient with cervical cancer and two minor  responses: one in patient with non-small-cell lung cancer and the  other in patient with cervical cancer [8]. However, despite lines of  evidence indicating that demethylating agents might improve  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/   anticancer activity of classic chemotherapeutic agents, the  knowledge for using them for solid tumors is still insufficient and  needs to be further evaluated.  Therefore, to test this hypothesis, the CRC cell line survival  model was chosen to study these interactions. With the help of this  model and pharmacological analysis we have designed the study to  find out the outcome of the interaction between DNMT inhibitors,  decitabine or zebularine, and classic anticancer chemotherapeutics  used in the treatment of CRC such as oxaliplatin, an inter- and  intra-DNA cross-linking agent, and 5-fluorouracil, a thymidylate  synthase inhibitor. The studies of interactions between chemo-  therapeutic agents and DNMTi agents seem to be reasonable,  because all these compounds have been tested for their cytotoxic  properties against normal cells [5,9,10] and all of them except  zebularine are approved by the U.S. FDA for medical use.  Materials and Methods  Cell culture and drug treatment As a model of colon cancer cells, the HT-29 and SW48 human  colorectal cancer cell lines, obtained from American Type Culture  Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), were used. The cells  were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Paisley, UK)  supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum  (FBS, Gibco), 2 mM glutamax (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin,  100 mg/ml streptomycin and 250 ng/ml amphoterycin (Gibco) at 37uC in a humidified atmosphere including 5% CO2. Cells were incubated with the drugs for 24, 48 and 72 h, but only results  observed following the 72 h treatment are presented as their  positive become more pronounced.  Drugs The following drugs were studied: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),  oxaliplatin, zebularine and decitabine (Sigma, St. Louis, MI,  USA). The concentrations of the drugs were in the range up to  100 mM. All agents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide Hybri- Max (DMSO, Sigma) and then diluted in the media for  experiments. The final concentration of DMSO, without affecting  cell survival, was maintained at 0.2%. In all experiments, control  cells were incubated with DMSO.  MTT assay The assay relies on the ability of viable cells to metabolically  reduce a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan product.  This reaction requires active mitochondrial reductase enzymes.  Cells were grown in 96-well plates (16104 cells/200 ml/well). After incubation with the reagents, the medium was removed and  the cells were treated with 50 ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)- 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (MTT, Sigma) for 4 h  at 37uC. Next, 150 ml of solubilization solution (10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS) was added and the mixture was incubated at  37uC overnight. The solubilized formazan product was spectro- photometrically quantified using a microtiter plate reader, Power  Wave XS (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA), at 570 nm wavelength.  Analysis of drug interactions Cells of SW48 and HT-29 cell lines were simultaneously  incubated for 72 h with chemotherapeutic agents and DNMT  inhibitors or with each agent alone. The nature of the interactions  between drugs studied was analyzed with the help of izobologram  [11] and combination-index (CI) methods, derived from the  median-effect principle of Chou and Talalay [12,13]. The data  obtained from the cytotoxicity experiments were used for  mathematical and quantitative evaluation of drug-drug interac-  tions.  Isoboles were defined by effects of the paired drugs studied. The  effects obtained by the half maximal inhibitory concentration  (IC50) of either drug within the pair formed the basis for the  additivity line; synergism or antagonism was present, when the  same effect was obtained by the combination of drugs in lower or  higher doses, respectively.  A commercial software package, CalcuSyn ver. 2.0 (Biosoft,  Cambridge, United Kingdom), was used for median-effect  analysis. We calculated the CI values based on the formula: CI  = (D)1/(Dx)1 + (D)2/(Dx)2 for mutually exclusive drugs. In the denominator, (Dx) is for D1 \u2018\u2018alone'' that inhibits a system x%, and  (Dx)2 is for D2 \u2018\u2018alone'' that inhibits a system x%. In the  numerators, (D)1 + (D)2 \u2018\u2018in combination'' also inhibit x%. CI values were generated at different effect levels (Fa, the fraction  affected by D, i.e. percentage inhibition/100) from 0.05 to 0.95 (5-  95% cell kill). Synergy is indicated by CI values ,1, additivity by  CI values = 1 and antagonism by CI values .1.  Flow cytometry analysis For cell cycle analysis the cells (,16106) were suspended in  4 ml of 80% ethanol (220uC) and incubated at 220uC for 24 h, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained with  50 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 100 mg/ml RNase in 0.1% PBST solution (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100) for  30 min in the dark at 4uC. The samples were then measured using a BD FACSCalibure flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,  CA, USA). The DNA histograms were analyzed using ModFit  software (BD Biosciences).  Apoptosis of the cells was measured, according to the  manufacturer's instructions, using an annexin V-FITC kit (BD  Biosciences). The cells were collected after treatment, washed  twice with PBS and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in  ice-cold binding buffer. The annexin V-FITC and PI solutions  were added to the cell suspension and gently mixed. The samples  were then incubated for 15 min in the dark before flow cytometry  analysis.  For immunofluorescent staining, cells were fixed in 1.5%  formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and  permeabilized with cold methanol for 20 min at 4uC. After washing, cells were incubated with desire primary antibody (Cell  Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) against phospho-ATR  [(P)-Ser428, Cat. No. 2853] and phospho-ATM [(P)-Ser1981,  Cat. No. 5883] at 1:100 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT.  After washing with PBS, appropriate secondary antibody conju-  gated with FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)  were added at 1:500 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS and incubated for  30 min at RT. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow  cytometry.  For all applications 10,000 events per sample were analyzed by  fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).  Semi-quantitative RT-PCR The mRNA levels of CCNE1, ATM and GAPDH were analyzed  by RT-PCR using total RNA from HT-29 and SW48 cells isolated  using the GenElute TM  Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit  (Sigma), as described by the manufacturer. One hundred ng of  total RNA was used in the reverse transcription reaction with  Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)  and oligo (dT)18 primer (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). The PCR  amplifications were performed in a 50 ml total volume according to manufacturer's instruction using HotStarTaq Master Mix  (Qiagen), 3 ml of cDNA as a template and the following primers  DNMTi Improve the Effect of Cytostatics  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305    pairs: CCNE1 (5'-AACTCAACGTGCAAGCCTCG-3', 5'-CAT-  CTCCTGAACAAGCTCCA-3'), ATM (5'-GCCTTGAGTCT-  GTGTATTCG-3', 5'-CCACTCAGAGACTCCACAGC-3') and  GAPDH (5'-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3', 5'-TGGTCA-  TGAGTCCTTCCACG-3'). The GAPDH mRNA levels were  used as internal controls. The amplified fragments were separated  on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and  photographed under UV light.  Preparation of protein lysates and Western blotting The cells were washed with cold PBS buffer and then proteins  from five cellular compartments were isolated using the Subcel-  lular Protein and Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Pierce,  Rockford, IL, USA). Protein concentration in the samples was  measured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples containing  60 mg of protein were denatured and fractionated by 7, 12 or 15% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred  onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-human  antibodies specific to: cyclin A1 and D1, PARP, caspase-3 and -8  (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p21 (Cat. No. 554228), p53 (Cat.  No. 610183), Bax (Cat. No. 610982, BD Biosciences); b-actin (Cat. No. A1978, Sigma); and the DNA Damage Antibody  Sampler Kit (phospho-Chk1 [(P)-Ser296], phospho-Chk2 [(P)-  Thr68], phospho-histone H2A.X [cH2A.X, (P)-Ser139], phospho- p53 [(P)-Ser15], and phospho-BRCA1 [(P)-Ser1524]; Cat.  No. 9947; Cell Signaling Technology). All antibodies in the  DNA Damage Antibody Sampler Kit recognize their targets  proteins only when modified at the indicated sites. Therefore,  antibodies against unmodified proteins were not used.  Anti-Bax antibody recognizes human Bax-a form. An alterna- tive splicing of Bax pre-mRNA produces the integral membrane  form Bax-a and the two cytosolic forms b and c. This antibody is recommended by BD company for detection of apoptosis. Anti-  p53 antibody recognizes the C terminal region of the protein (the  195-393 a.a. was used as an antigen) and is able to recognize both  the wild-type and R273H forms of p53. This antibody is also  recommended by BD company for detection of apoptosis.  The signal on blots was detected by a colorimetric method using  the CN/DAB Substrate Kit (Pierce) and SignalBoost Immunore-  action Enhancer Kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA).  Mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) measurement The DYm was measured by flow cytometry using 10 mg/ml of  5,59,6,69-tetrachloro-1,19,3,39-tetraethylbenzimidazolo- carbocya-  nine iodide (JC-1 dye, Sigma), which stains mitochondria in living  cells. In healthy cells, the dye accumulates in mitochondria,  forming aggregates that emit red fluorescence, while in apoptotic  cells the dye remains in monomeric form in cytoplasm and emits  green fluorescence. Cells were treated with chemotherapeutics,  DNMT inhibitors or their combinations for 72 h and stained as  described by Mahyar-Roemer et al. [14] and then examined by  FACSCalibure flow cytometer. Mitochondria containing red JC-1  aggregates in healthy cells were detectable in FL2 channel, while  green JC-1 monomers in apoptotic cells were detectable in FL1  channel.  Statistical analysis Data are presented as mean values 6SD. Statistical compar-  isons among groups were performed by Student's t-test or one-way  analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test.  Significance was assumed at P , 0.05 (marked with asterisks on  graphs).  Results  Growth studies and effects of combination treatments of chemotherapeutic agents with DNMTi  As the first step, we examined the effect of the agents applied  alone on SW48 and HT-29 cell viability. The cells were treated  with 10 to 100 mM of the evaluated agents. The results of MTT cell viability assay indicated that CRC cells incubated with  oxaliplatin and 5-FU showed the most potent inhibition of cell  growth following 72 h incubation time (Figure 1). The inhibitory  effects of chemotherapeutics were dose-dependent and the  correlation coefficients (estimated from the inhibitory dose-  response curves) were above 0.9. Demethylating agents, decitabine  and zebularine, have demonstrated different modes of inhibition:  decitabine was already inhibitory at starting concentration  (20 mM) and zebularine showed inhibitory effect from 80 and 40 mM for SW48 and HT-29 cells, respectively.  We tested also the treatment of chemotherapeutic agents in  combination with DNMTi on CRC cells survival (Figure 1).  Decitabine potentiated the inhibitory effects of oxaliplatin at the  concentration from 20 mM up to 100 mM, whereas its impact on 5-FU activity starts at 80 mM. Zebularine tested at concentrations up to 100 mM slightly potentiated the inhibitory effects of either chemotherapeutics (Figure 1).  The type of drug interactions of two evaluated compound  groups were analyzed with the help of isobolographic and median  effect methods. The isobolograms show results for single 50%  effect level and indicate that interaction of decitabine with  chemotherapeutic agents results in synergistic effect, whereas  administration of zebularine with oxaliplatin or 5-FU results in  synergistic or slightly additive effects (Figure 2A).  Analysis performed by means of median effect method  confirmed that the combination of decitabine and chemothera-  peutic agents in both cell lines produced synergistic effects at 50%  cell kill level (Fa = 0.5), achieving CI (Combination Index) values  , 0.9 (Figure 2B).  Combination of zebularine and chemotherapeutics for Fa =  0.5 indicated slight synergistic or additive effects.  Analysis of DNA damage To elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis, we analyzed the  phosphorylation status of proteins being of major signaling  checkpoints in response to DNA damage.  Upon sensing the DNA damage, series of cellular signaling  events designed to maintain the integrity and proper function of  cells and biological pathways are involved. The proteins chosen for  testing by Western blotting initiate cascades of events that block  cell cycle progression either to allow time to repair damaged DNA  or activate cell death pathways if too much damage has been  incurred. Phosphorylated histone H2A.X localizes to the sites of  the DNA damage and activates the ATM/ATR kinases, the  central mediators of the DNA damage response. In turn, ATM/  ATR kinases initiate cascades, which inhibit progression into  mitosis through the activation of the Chk kinases (Chk1 for ATR  and Chk2 for ATM) or tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to  either cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or apoptosis through  regulation of p53 downstream effectors. BRCA1, as the guardian  of genomic stability, is also phosphorylated by ATM, ATR, and  Chk2 in response to DNA damage and can co-localize with other  proteins at DNA damage sites [15].  We observed a significant phosphorylation of histone H2A.X at  Ser139 in response to chemotherapeutic agents and their  combinations with DNMTi, especially in HT-29 cells. Lower  levels of cH2A.X (phospho-H2A.X) were observed in cells treated  DNMTi Improve the Effect of Cytostatics  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305    with DNMTi agents only. We also observed elevated levels of  phosphorylation of proteins as ATR at Ser428, ATM at Ser1981,  p53 at Ser15, BRCA1 at Ser1524 as well as kinases Chk1 and  Chk2 at Ser345 and Thr68, respectively (Figure 3A and B).  Phosphorylation status of kinases Chk1 and Chk2 was more  pronounced in HT-29 then in SW48 cells. In SW48 cells,  phosphorylation levels of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases was higher after  the combined treatment with oxaliplain and decitabine as  compared to the treatment with both chemotherapeutics and  DNMTi applied singly (Figure 3B).  Combinations of chemotherapeutics with DNMTi influence the cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis  In the control culture, the percentage of cells in each phase of  the cell cycle was stable, whereas the tested compounds had  various effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Treatment  with the chemotherapeutics resulted in a consistent increase in the  number of cells in the S phase at the expense of G1 phase.  Decitabine arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M or S phase in the  SW48 and HT-29 cells, respectively. Zebularine did not exert  statistically significant changes in both cell lines, as compared to  the controls.  The combination of decitabine with oxaliplatin or 5-FU  induced a cell cycle arrest at the S/G2/M phase boundary and  at the S phase, respectively, in both cell lines (Figure 4). The  combination of zebularine with oxaliplatin increased percentage of  the HT-29 cells at the S/G2/M phase boundary, whereas the  combination of zebularine with 5-FU increased percentage of  these cells in S phase from 12% to 36% as compared with control.  In the case of the SW48 cells, the combinations of zebularine with  chemotherapeutics caused the arrest of cells in the G2/M or S  phase (Figure 4A).  The analysis of gene expression revealed that the combination  of decitabine with oxaliplatin, as compared to oxaliplatin alone,  increased mRNA level of ATM in both cell lines as well as CCNE1  in SW48 cell line (Figure 4B). The combinations of demethylating  agents with 5-FU showed a similar tendency, but at a lower level  than the combinations with oxaliplatin. The analysis of proteins  specific for cell cycle progression revealed that the combination of  DNMTi with chemotherapeutics, as compared with oxaliplatin/5-  FU alone, increased the level of cyclin A1 and protein p53 and  decreased the level of cyclin D1 (but not in the SW48 cells)  (Figure 4C and 5B). The combination of zebularine with  chemotherapeutics increased the level of p21 in SW48 cells  (Figure 4C).  Since the prolonged treatment with chemotherapeutics or  DNMTi might induce cell death, the early apoptotic marker was  thus analyzed. For this purpose we used annexin V, which  recognizes phosphatidyl serine (PS). During induction of apoptosis,  membrane asymmetry is lost and translocation of PS from  intracellular to external leaflet of the plasma membrane takes  place. As we expected, the treatment of the CRC cells with  oxaliplatin or 5-FU alone induced apoptosis in ,30% of the cells, while combinations of the evaluated agents generally increased the  number of apoptotic cells from ,45% to 60% (Figure 5A) with the exception of the HT-29 cells incubated with demethylating agents  and oxaliplatin together. In this case, the induction of apoptosis  was at a lower level than for other combinations, but still  statistically significant as compared with oxaliplatin applied alone.  In addition, the induction of apoptosis in the CRC cells by  combination of chemotherapeutics with demethylating agents was  confirmed by changes at the protein level of pro-caspase-3 and -8.  The proteolytic cleavage of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase  Figure 1. Effects of chemotherapeutic agents and DNMT inhibitors on cell viability of colorectal cancer cell lines.

The changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm)  During early apoptosis the disruption of mitochondrial mem-  brane potential DYm may occur resulting in rapid collapse of the electrochemical gradient. In this work, we explored the effect of  DNMTi, chemotherapeutics or their combinations on DYm by staining the cells with JC-1 dye. The analysis of cytograms showed  that the control cells emitted the red fluorescence due to high  DYm, whereas the cells treated with chemotherapeutics and DNMTi agents exhibited increased membrane depolarization,  detected by green fluorescence, and the effect was sustained  (oxaliplatin + DNMTi in HT-29 cell line) or stronger when cells were co-incubated with these compounds (Figure 5C).  Discussion  In the 90s it has been confirmed that the CRC results not only  from accumulation of genetic mutations but also as a consequence  of epigenetic alterations of the cellular genome that transforms a  normal glandular epithelium into adenocarcinoma. It is well  established that the most extensively characterized epigenetic  alteration in CRCs is gene promoter hypermethylation, which  occurs in CpG islands that are often present at the 5' region of  approximately 60% of the genes. This phenomenon results from  the increased activity of the DNMT enzyme whose overexpression  is a hallmark of almost all the transformed cells [16]. A growing  number of genes that are expressed in the colon have now been  shown to be hypermethylated and silenced in colorectal cancer.  These include genes involved in cell-cycle control, growth,  differentiation, angiogenesis, adhesion, metastasis or DNA repair  [17]. Since epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible, the  Figure 2. Interactions of standard chemotherapeutics with DNMT inhibitors in the human colorectal cancer cell lines SW48 and HT- 29. A.

Therefore developing of some new strategies for  the treatment of such tumors is a challenge to oncology [18]. That  is why we have presented the results of in vitro study concerning  interactions of standard cytotoxic drugs, 5-FU and oxaliplatin  [19], with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as  decitabine and zebularine.  DNMTis have recently gained a lot of attention as agents  inhibiting cancer growth including colorectal carcinoma [20].  However, the role of their therapeutic potential may be properly  evaluated only in combination with classic agents used in the CRC  treatment, because all new therapeutic agents are introduced as  add-on options. Since 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin constitute the  backbone treatment of CRC [19], we investigated the effects on  CRC cells survival adding decitabine or zebularine - the DNA  methyltransferase inhibitors - to these chemotherapeutics.  We have confirmed under in vitro conditions that the studied  agents given alone are able to induce the growth inhibition of the  cancer cells with comparable order of potency calculated on the  basis of the percentage of cell survival (Figure 1). Moreover, we  have found an increased inhibition of CRC cells growth after  treatment with the anticancer agents applied in combination  (Figure 1). The isobolograms, constructed on the basis of IC50 values, indicated synergistic or additive interactions between  Figure 3.

Decitabine had the most  favorable interactions (synergy) in combination with chemother-  apeutics in both cell lines; whereas interaction analysis for  zebularine showed moderate synergistic or additive effects and  the best results were achieved for combination with oxaliplatin  (Figure 2).  The interactions observed between both DNMTi agents and  chemotherapeutics were dose- and cell line-dependent. The  synergy between evaluated chemotherapeutics and decitabine  was seen in the SW48 and HT-29 cell lines as well as in the Colo-  205 cells, as previously reported [21]. The sensitivity of CRC cells  in combination of zebularine with chemotherapeutics was different  and dependent on cell line. For this combination, synergism and  addition as well as previously presented antagonism were observed  [21]. Moreover, reactions of the CRC cells to zebularine and its  combinations were a little weaker. It appears that the two DNA  methyltransferase inhibitors belonging to the same class of agents  influence the inhibitory effects of chemotherapeutics on CRC cells  growth in a qualitatively different manner. These differences may  be related to their structure that exerts a direct effect on the  survival of CRC cells [4]. The same observation was made in  leukemic cells by Flotho et al. [22], who have shown that DNMTis;  such as azacitidine, decitabine and zebularine; produce distinct  patterns of gene induction and repression and that this diversity is  related to the differences in the structure and cellular pharmacol-  ogy among DNMT-inhibiting cytosine nucleoside analogues.  Decitabine has nitrogen in the place of carbon at position 5 of  the pyrimidine ring, but zebularine does not. In spite of that, both  agents are incorporated into DNA but before incorporation the  substances require phosphorylation to render the respective  nucleotide forms. Decitabine is converted by deoxycytidine kinase,  whereas zebularine is a substrate for uridine-cytidine kinase  [22,23,24]. The inhibitory activity of zebularine is not specific for  DNMTs. It is also a strong inhibitor of cytidine deaminase [25,26],  therefore most of the drug may be sequestered by the enzyme,  lowering thereby the effective concentration of the drug. Another  explanation is that the inhibition of cytidine deaminase by  zebularine increases cellular concentration of cytidine and  deoxycytidine resulting in competitive inhibition of zebularine  [27]. In addition, the kinetics of activation/inactivation and  intracellular half-life of metabolites differ among different cytosine  analogues.  Generally, decitabine and zebularine possess ability to bind  covalently with DNMT thus obstructing DNA synthesis and, in  this way, leading to the cell death. Additionally, decitabine may  also induce DNA damage through structural instability at the site  of incorporation [28,29]. Our results reviled that the potential  therapeutic effect of DNMTi agents, especially decitabine, may be  enhanced by 5-FU or oxaliplatin. The former, as an antimetab-  olite, can impair replication fork progression by becoming  incorporated into the DNA, whereas the latter induces DNA  lesions by interstrand cross-links resulting in replication stress.  Therefore, we decided to evaluate whether DNA damage process  took place in the cells after treatment with chemotherapeutics,  DNMTi and their combinations. It was confirmed by the  phosphorylation analysis of histone H2A.X, a member of a  histone H2A family. H2A.X becomes phosphorylated at Ser139  by ATM/ATR kinases to form cH2A.X, the earliest indicator of DNA damages [30,31]. In the current study, we found that the  level of cH2A.X was strongly increased, especially in HT-29 cells.  Our results show that chemotherapeutics as well as their  combinations with DNMTi may activate ATM/ATR kinases  pathways (Figure 3) leading, in consequence, to perturbations in  the cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis induction. This finding  was confirmed by further studies discussed below.  Combinations of DNMTi with chemotherapeutics led to CRC  cell cycle arrest in the S/G2/M transition or S phase, when  compared to the control cycle and the reduction of cell number in  the G1 phase (Figure 4). This was accompanied by increased  mRNA level of ATM, as well as phosphorylation level of ATM at  Ser1981. Furthermore, we observed the elevated level of ATR  phosphorylated at Ser428. Activation of both kinases suggests that  DNA double-stranded breaks (DBS) as well as single-stranded  DNA (ssDNA) are formed [32]. The ssDNA is present at processed  DSB ends but also at stalled replication forks. Phosphorylation of  ATM and ATR kinases induces activation of Chk2 and Chk1  kinases, respectively, which in turn induces via phosphorylation the  degradation of Cdc25A and C and phosphorylation of p53 protein  [33]. We observed elevated levels of Chk2 and Chk1 phosphor-  ylated at Thr68 and Ser345, respectively (Figure 3). This might  indirectly confirm down regulation of Cdc25A and C, the protein  tyrosine phosphtases, which are downstream targets of both  kinases. Additionally, we observed a higher level of cyclin A  probably connected with down regulation of Cdc25A and elevated  phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser1524, which is essential for  activating the Chk1 kinase and finally G2/M arrest (Figure 3) [34].  It is well known, that once the cells accumulate the excess of  DNA damages that overwhelm their capacity of repairing the  mechanisms for selective elimination of such cells are activated.  Indeed, we have observed that simultaneous administration of the  tested agents increased the apoptotic response of the cells  (Figure 5A). The interaction among the agent combinations led  to augmentation or maintaining of the protein levels of caspase-8  and p53 as well as the level of pro-caspase-3 dependently of the  cell line studied (Figure 5B). Thus, the cytotoxic effect of DNMT  inhibitors and chemotherapeutics may result from apoptosis  induced by internal and slightly external signals. In fact, the  possible involvement of mitochondrial pathway was confirmed by  the finding that the agent combinations (with the exception of  oxaliplatin + zebularine in HT-29 cells) strongly induced the disruption of DYm (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the activity of these combinations was manifested by the cleavage of PARP protein  into 84 kDa and 25 kDa fragments, which facilitates cellular  disassembly and also serves as a marker of cells undergoing  apoptosis (Figure 5B).  The results obtained in the analyzed cells lines are in some cases  different, however the main observations and final conclusions are  similar. In our opinion, the differences in the response of both cell  lines may depend on genetic and epigenetic background of the  cells. These cell lines carry a BRAF mutation (Colon Cancer Panel  2, BRAF; ATCC No. TCP-1007), but the HT-29 cells also carry a  mutated p53 gene (GRA mutation at codon 273 resulting in an ArgRHis substitution, R273H) causing overproduction of a pathogenic form of p53, while SW48 cells have a wild-type allele.  Since this additional mutation may cause higher sensitivity to such  drug combinations, it may also be responsible for observed, in  some cases, more pronounced response of HT-29 cells.  On the other hand, the SW48 cell line is known to harbor more  of the epigenetic changes such as hypermethylation of CpG islands  in the promoter regions leading to inappropriate silencing of some  gene, used as an internal control.

Moreover, both cell lines differ in global DNA  methylation levels. Mossman et al. [35] have shown that HT-29  cell line displayed a lower level of global DNA methylation than  SW48 cell line and that following the treatment of cells with  decitabine, a substantial decrease of genomic DNA methylation  was observed. The decrease in global methylation in SW48 cell  line was greater than 50%, whilst the decrease in HT29 cell line  was not so extensive. The authors also reviled that reduction of  methylation at specific gene CpG islands was significantly less  effective [35]. For this reason, we have also analyzed the  methylation status of selected genes such as p16 INK4a  , APC,  p14 ARF  , DAPK and MLH1 using methylation-specific PCR (MSP)  (data not shown) and the obtained results were comparable to  those published by Deng et al. and Lind et al. [36,37]. Among both  cell lines tested, the biallelic methylation of promoter region was  observed in p16 INK4a  and MLH1 genes, whereas the biallelic  methylation of p14 ARF  gene was observed only in SW48 cell line.  Unfortunately, our studies did not confirm that the application of  DNMTi restores the expression of the evaluated genes and that it  is the way by which both agents might enhance the action of  chemotherapeutics. Perhaps such results are linked to the dosage  levels of the compounds tested as well as the incubation time. Most  results presented by other authors, who observed the reactivation  of silenced genes after decitabine or zebularine application, were  conducted for longer time duration, i.e. up to 5-8 days, and doses  of the compounds were much lower [8,38]. Nevertheless, our  results clearly show that DNMTi application can bring benefits  also in methylation-independent manner and that their action  relies on cytotoxic properties in the applied range of doses.  The mechanism of positive interactions between DNMT  inhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents is related to triggering  the cascade of events leading finally to apoptosis. Such augmen-  tation suggests that the cytotoxic effects of classical chemothera-  peutics used in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma could be  obtained at lower doses and with higher probability for inducing  cancer cell death when combined with DNMT inhibitors. It is also  known that the abnormal methylation of promoter regions of  regulatory genes is commonly associated with cancer development.  Therefore, the methylation inhibitors such as decitabine or  zebularine may reactivate the silenced tumor suppressor genes  [39] responsible for controlling the cell cycle progression and  induction of apoptosis, and in this way improve the effectiveness of  anticancer therapy with chemotherapeutic agents.  In summary, we have demonstrated that DNMT inhibitors, in  spite of the less potent action of zebularine, may exert a positive  interaction with oxaliplatin and 5-FU, the standard chemothera-  peutics used in cancer treatment, potentiating the inhibition of  CRC cell survival in vitro. It seems very likely that in the case of  zebularine a more favorable response could be achieved with  higher doses than those presented here, since the toxicity of this  agent was shown to be minimal [27]. Even so, the obtained results  provide a rationale to continue research studies that could help  develop more effective treatments using methylation inhibitors  together with standard chemotherapeutics as a new hope in the  colorectal cancer therapy.
