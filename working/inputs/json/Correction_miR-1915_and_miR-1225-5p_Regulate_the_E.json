    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

Recent studies on stem cells indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that participate in the regulation of gene expression, may play a key role in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Distinct sets of miRNAs are specifically expressed in pluripotent stem cells but not in adult tissues, suggesting a role for miRNAs in stem cell self-renewal. We compared miRNA expression profiles of ARPCs with that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and renal proximal tubular cells (RPTECs) finding distinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed in ARPCs. In particular, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p regulated the expression of important markers of renal progenitors, such as CD133 and PAX2, and important genes involved in the repair mechanisms of ARPCs, such as TLR2. We demonstrated that the expression of both the renal stem cell markers CD133 and PAX2 depends on lower miR-1915 levels and that the increase of miR-1915 levels improved capacity of ARPCs to differentiate into adipocyte-like and epithelial-like cells. Finally, we found that the low levels of miR-1225-5p were responsible for high TLR2 expression in ARPCs. Therefore, together, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p seem to regulate important traits of renal progenitors: the stemness and the repair capacity.

Introduction  In the last years regenerative medicine was mainly directed  towards the use of adult stem cells to improve the repair of injured  organs. This trend was observed within various medical segments,  including nephrology [1-3]. In particular many researchers  focused their attention on the possibility of using adult renal  stem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) for regenerative purposes. These  cells exhibited multipotent differentiation ability by generating  tubular epithelial-like, osteogenic-like, adipocyte-like, and neuro-  nal-like cells. When injected into mice with glycerol-induced acute  renal injury, these CD133+/CD24+ ARPCs contributed to tubular regeneration [1,4-6].  ARPCs, first identified in the renal interstitium and then in  Bowman's capsule, are positive for PAX2, CD133 and CD24  [4,5,6-8]. Their expression profiles and their phenotypical  characteristics are very similar [7] but some specific properties  as the inclination of tubular cells to proliferate upon tubular injury  in patients with acute or chronic tubular damage were different  [6,7,9]. Moreover, markers allowing distinction between glomer-  ular and tubular progenitor subpopulations have been recently  identified [6].  Recent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), a  class of noncoding small RNAs that participate in the regulation of  gene expression, may play a key role in stem cell self-renewal and  differentiation [10]. MicroRNAs are specifically attractive candi-  dates for regulating stem cell identity, which includes self-renewal  and cell fate decisions, as their ability to simultaneously regulate  many targets provides a means for coordinated control of gene  action. Although direct evidence for a functional role for miRNAs  in stem cell biology is just emerging, exciting hints regarding their  involvement based on expression patterns, predicted targets, and  over-expression studies suggest that miRNAs may be one of the  key regulators [11]. Distinct sets of miRNAs are specifically  expressed in pluripotent stem cells but not in adult tissues,  suggesting a role for miRNAs in stem cell self-renewal [12,13].  Expression level of several miRNAs has been correlated to the  time of stem cell differentiation, suggesting that these miRNAs  could be used as markers to monitor stem cell identity and  differentiation [12-14]. Furthermore, discovery of both stem cell  differentiation-related miRNAs and their potential target mRNA  genes may provide further insights about their functional roles in  stem cell maintenance and differentiation. To date, relatively little  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296    is known about functions of miRNAs in the kidney and in  particular in ARPCs.  In this study we compared miRNA expression profiles of renal  progenitors with that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and of  renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) and found  distinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed in ARPCs.  In particular, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p regulated the expres-  sion of important markers of renal progenitors, such as CD133  and PAX2, and important genes involved in the repair mecha-  nisms of ARPCs, such as TLR2.  Results  Isolation and Characterization of ARPCs CD133-positive ARPCs were isolated, by magnetic sorting,  from glomerular and tubular fractions of healthy cortex of kidney  removed for renal carcinoma. Both ARPCs isolated from  glomeruli (gARPCs) and from tubular compartment (tARPCs)  were positive for CD133, CD24, PAX2, BMI-1, Oct-4 and CD44  (Figure 1A-F, J-L), previously described as markers of adult renal  progenitors [3-5,6,15]. However, gARPCs were positive for the  CD106 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1, VCAM1) expression  (Figure 1M), whereas tARPCs did not express the CD106 marker  (Figure 1N). However, CD34, CD105, and CD45 membrane  proteins were not detectable (data not shown).  Identification of Differentially Expressed miRNAs in tARPCs, gARPCs and MSCs Compared to RPTECs  To identify miRNAs typically expressed in ARPCs, we analyzed  their global expression profile in 5 different tARPC and gARPC  clones by microarray technology and compared them with  RPTEC and MSC global miRNA expression. Among 1205  human miRNAs represented on the microarrays, we found 327  miRNAs that resulted expressed between different cell types. The  2-D hierarchical clustering and the principal component analysis  showed that miRNA expression profile was different among  MSCs, RPTECs and ARPCs, whereas it was very similar between  gARPCs and tARPCs (Figure 2A and 2B), even if statistical  analysis identified some little differences. In fact, applying the  Benjamini-Hochberg statistical method and selecting genes  modulated with a fold change of 2, we identified 21 miRNAs  discriminating tARPCs from RPTECs, 41 miRNAs discriminating  gARPCs from RPTECs, 24 miRNAs discriminating tARPCs from  MSCs, 31 miRNAs discriminating gARPCs from MSCs and 30  miRNAs discriminating MSCs from RPTECs (Table 1). When we  compared miRNAs modulated in tARPCs and gARPCs in respect  to RPTECs with a fold change of 2, we found 14 miRNAs that  were jointly modulated. However, 7 miRNAs were specifically  modulated in tARPCs and 27 in gARPCs (Table 2). Moreover,  comparing miRNA expression of MSCs with that of tARPCs and  gARPCs, we found 5 miRNAs varying in ARPCs in comparison to  RPTECs that were also modulated in MSCs; 6 miRNAs were in  common between gARPCs and MSCs and 19 miRNAs were  exclusively modulated in MSCs (Figure S1 in File S1).  Identification of miRNA Targets To study the molecular mechanisms in which miRNAs are  involved, we performed a bioinformatic analysis to predict target  genes of the modulated miRNAs. To reduce the number of false  positives, we used 4 different algorithms and potential targets were  selected overlapping results and selecting gene targets predicted by  at least 2 of them. Based on the results of bioinformatics analysis  we found several genes, of great interest for the stem cell biology,  that were potentially targeted by some of modulated miRNAs. In  particular, among miRNAs modulated respect to RPTECs, we  found miR-1225-5p and miR-1915 that were down-regulated in  tARPCs and gARPCs and predicted to regulate genes involved in  the stemness property of ARPCs, as CD133 and renal embryonic  transcription factors PAX2 and PAX8, that are markers of adult  renal progenitors, the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44, the toll-like  receptor 2 (TLR2), IL-8, HOXA1, some WNT genes and other  chemokines and growth factors (Figure 3, Table S1). All these  genes have been previously found upregulated in ARPCs and have  an important role in specific biological function and stemness  characteristics of ARPCs [1,4-5,7-9,16].  Validation of miRNA Expression and in silico Analysis of miRNA Targets  To validate expression results of miRNAs whose putative target  genes were more connected with stem cell biology, we performed  real-time PCR (q-RT-PCR) for miR-1225-5p, miR-1915, miR-371-  5p and miR-196a on miRNAs isolated from ARPCs of an  independent set of 5 tARPCs, 5 gARPCs clones and 3 RPTEC  lines. The expression of all analyzed miRNAs was significantly  lower in stem/progenitor cell lines, confirming microarray results  (Figure 4).  To deepen the biological interaction among miRNAs and  among genes targeted by miRNAs that were found modulated in  ARPCs, we performed a new bioinformatics analysis on pathways  and biological processes in which target genes of miRNAs were  involved. We considered target genes of miRNAs that were jointly  modulated in tARPCs and gARPCs respect to RPTECs and  genes-miRNA pairs with inverse expression relationships. Among  significant canonical pathways we found WNT/b-catenin signal- ling, ERK5 signalling, growth hormone signalling and glutamate  metabolism (Figure S2A in File S1), however among significant  biological processes we found cellular growth proliferation, cellular  and organismal development, cell morphology and cell-to-cell  signalling and interaction (Figure S2B in File S1). Moreover,  merging miRNAs with ARPC modulated genes resulting from the  gene expression profile published in our previous work [7] (GEO  Series Accession Number GSE8611), we found that miRNAs were  strongly interconnected with the expressed mRNAs with an  inverse pairs expression relationships (Table S2) and two specific  significant networks, involving the WNT/B-catenin and Frizzled  signalling, were identified (Figure S3 and S4 in File S1). Then, we  studied the biological interaction among miRNAs modulated in  MSCs and genes targeted by miRNAs, again taking advantage of  our previous gene expression data. We considered only genes-  miRNA pairs with inverse expression relationships. Among  significant canonical pathways we found Inhibition of matrix  metalloproteases, WNT/b-catenin signalling, PTEN signalling, regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Figure S5A in  File S1). Among significant biological processes we found cellular  movement, cellular growth proliferation, cell death and survival,  cellular and organismal development, cell morphology and cell-to-  cell signalling and interaction (Figure S5B in File S1). miRNAs and  genes more contributing to these biological processes formed two  significant networks represented in Figure S6 and S7 in File S1.  miR-1915 Regulates both the CD133 and PAX2 Expression in tARPCs  The CD133 is known as the most important marker of renal  progenitor cells, however the genetic basis of its expression in stem  cells are unknown. Our in silico analysis showed that the miR-1915  downregulation in ARPCs in respect to differentiated renal tubular  cells could be the cause of the CD133 overexpression. To confirm  miRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296    miRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296    that the miR-1915 was able to modulate the expression of the  CD133 mRNA, we performed transient transfection experiments  using an independent group tARPC clones. We increased the  amount of the endogenous miR-1915 within cells, transfecting  short RNA sequences that mimic the action of the miRNA, in  order to simulate the situation found in RPTECs, that have higher  levels of miR-1915. tARPCs, transfected with 25 nM miR-1915  mimic, showed a 1.5 fold reduction of endogenous CD133 mRNA  levels (p,0.01, Figure 5A). Since the same miRNA was found by  bioinfomatic analysis to target also PAX2 mRNA, we checked  whether miR-1915 mimic lowered also its levels and found that  transfection with 50 nM miR-1915 mimic caused a 1.5 fold PAX2  mRNA levels reduction too (p,0.0003, Figure 5B). Moreover,  transfecting tARPCs with the 50 nM miR-1915 mimic twice at a  distance of three days, on the sixth day from the first transfection  we obtained a large reduction of CD133 protein surface  expression (8% vs 96% of mock transfection control, Figure 5C).  The transiently transfection of renal progenitors with 100 nM  miR-1915 mimic led also to strong decrease of endogenous PAX2  protein expression (2 fold, p,0.02 Figure 5D) on the sixth day  following miRNA mimic induction. All together our results  showed that miR-1915 regulated the expression of both CD133  and PAX2, the two most important stemness markers of ARPCs.  miR-1915 Upregulation Favors tARPC Differentiation To study whether miR-1915, affecting CD133 and PAX2  expression, influenced also renal progenitor differentiation capac-  Figure 1.

The 2-D hierarchical clustering (A) and the PCA (B) showed that miRNA expression profile was different among MSCs, RPTECs and ARPCs, whereas it was very similar between gARPCs and tARPCs. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068296.g002  miRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296    Table 1. miRNAs modulated between ARPCs, RPTECs and MSCs (FDR,0.01).  tARPCs vs RPTECs gARPCs vs RPTECs MSCs vs tARPCs  miRNA Fold change miRNA Fold change miRNA Fold change  hsa-miR-1225-5p 23,530 hsa-miR-7 9,640 hsa-miR-30a 27,019  hsa-miR-130b 3,504 hsa-miR-874 22,033 hsa-miR-196b 23,328  hsa-miR-93 2,617 hsa-miR-1225-5p -4,519 hsa-miR-93 23,155  hsa-miR-16 2,470 hsa-miR-887 212,854 hsa-miR-92a 25,353  hsa-miR-193b 2,299 hsa-miR-625 4,770 hsa-miR-19b 214,477  hsa-miR-1306 2,777 hsa-miR-130b 3,951 hsa-miR-30b 27,790  hsa-miR-373* 24,669 hsa-miR-196b 3,072 hsa-miR-17 214,038  hsa-miR-1977_v14.0 3,340 hsa-miR-128 2,566 hsa-miR-107 22,130  hsa-miR-17 3,602 hsa-miR-484 8,361 hsa-miR-30a* 25,005  hsa-miR-455-3p 2,307 hsa-miR-320c 2,049 hsa-miR-1181 2,554  hsa-miR-1181 26,379 hsa-miR-16 2,700 hsa-miR-210 211,421  hsa-miR-1915 22,185 hsa-miR-92a 2,985 hsa-miR-30c 27,624  hsa-miR-1226* 22,616 hsa-miR-193b 2,497 hsa-miR-28-5p 23,876  hsa-miR-20b 2,916 hsa-miR-320a 2,346 hsa-let-7b 2,360  hsa-miR-371-5p 23,773 hsa-miR-373* 219,333 hsa-miR-20b 26,852  hsa-miR-125b 4,684 hsa-miR-17 3,926 hsa-miR-155 227,322  hsa-miR-100 5,623 hsa-miR-455-3p 2,954 hsa-miR-125b 14,093  hsa-miR-20a 3,195 hsa-miR-505 4,678 hsa-miR-100 6,149  hsa-miR-15a 2,199 hsa-miR-296-5p 23,128 hsa-miR-103 22,469  hsa-miR-25 2,202 hsa-miR-629* 28,553 hsa-miR-151-3p 23,364  hsa-miR-15b 2,790 hsa-miR-663 26,565 hsa-miR-146b-5p 26,004  hsa-miR-1181 224,765 hsa-miR-20a 28,674  MSCs vs gARPCs hsa-miR-134 212,748 hsa-miR-30d 23,394  miRNA Fold change hsa-miR-1915 22,634 hsa-miR-30e* 23,492  hsa-miR-1275 22,0642676 hsa-miR-574-3p 2,791  hsa-miR-30a 26,151071 hsa-miR-20b 3,337 MSCs vs RPTECs  hsa-miR-31 23,471138 hsa-miR-371-5p 25,501 miRNA Fold change  hsa-miR-196b 24,8021374 hsa-miR-1207-5p 23,784 hsa-miR-874 22,7487714  hsa-miR-331-3p 22,5886998 hsa-miR-718 212,757 hsa-miR-1225-5p 27,3637238  hsa-miR-193a-5p 3,0352206 hsa-miR-1469 23,469 hsa-let-7i 4,453724  hsa-miR-342-3p 22,4045403 hsa-miR-125b 7,029 hsa-miR-30a 27,8995056  hsa-miR-92a 26,043755 hsa-miR-196a 2,285 hsa-miR-193a-5p 3,3988273  hsa-miR-30b 27,9313436 hsa-miR-100 8,157 hsa-miR-320c 2,208497  hsa-miR-17 215,299799 hsa-miR-197 2,294 hsa-miR-193b 2,5278797  hsa-miR-455-3p 22,5227208 hsa-miR-150* 25,103 hsa-miR-30b 26,955626  hsa-miR-107 22,339731 hsa-miR-181a* 5,393 hsa-miR-30a* 24,9433923  hsa-miR-30a* 25,1749806 hsa-miR-320b 2,310 hsa-miR-99a 3,9254699  hsa-miR-210 211,182305 hsa-miR-151-3p 2,060 hsa-miR-29b-1* 2,093193  hsa-miR-425 22,2963724 hsa-miR-320d 2,029 hsa-miR-30c 29,263635  hsa-miR-361-5p 22,0869288 hsa-miR-602 23,607 hsa-miR-28-5p 22,423316  hsa-miR-30c 28,070546 hsa-miR-15b 3,372 hsa-let-7b 2,5691411  hsa-miR-28-5p 24,199433 hsa-miR-140-5p 3,055944  hsa-let-7b 2,8582647 hsa-miR-20b 22,3495286  hsa-miR-20b 27,840423 hsa-miR-29a 2,2842536  hsa-miR-155 229,704147 hsa-miR-1207-5p 25,718977  hsa-let-7c 2,1411626 hsa-miR-155 224,928856  hsa-miR-125b 9,391929 hsa-miR-23a 2,029089  hsa-miR-196a 22,167844 hsa-miR-221* 3,449269  hsa-miR-103 22,7692318 hsa-miR-125b 66,01536  miRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296    ity, we increased miR-1915 levels in tARPCs by mimic  transfection (50 nM miR-1915 mimic) and induced their differ-  entiation towards epithelial or adipocytic phenotype.

However, no significant difference was found in ZO-1 marker  expression between mimic-transfected and mock-transfected  tARPCs after 20 days of culture in epithelial differentiation  medium (Figure 6L, N,O and Figure S8B in File S1). Nevertheless,  we found an increase of both ZO-1 and CK-19 expression in  tARPCs transfected with the miR-1915 mimic and cultured for 20  days in maintenance medium respect to mock transfected cells  (Figure 6F, H, J and 6K, M, O, respectively and Figure S8 in File  S1). Moreover, we found also increased levels of aquaporin 1 and  aminopeptidase A transcripts in mimic-transfected tARPCs  following epithelial differentiation (Figure S9 in File S1).  miR-1225-5p Regulates TLR2 Expression in tARPCs Our bioinformatics analysis identified a putative miR-1225-5p  binding element in the 39 UTR of TLR2 transcript, a key gene of  damage signalling found up-regulated in ARPCs and that can give  rise to repair processes in acute renal tubular damage [7,16]. To  examine whether miR-1225-5p downregulation led to TLR2  overexpression in tARPCs, we increased the miRNA levels  transfecting renal progenitors with the miR-1225-5p mimic to  simulate the higher levels of this miRNA in RPTECs. We found  that the transfection with 25 nM miR-1225-5p mimic led, after 24  hours, to a reduction of 1.3 fold of the TLR2 mRNA expression  (p,0.01, Figure 7A). Moreover, the increase of the miR-1225-5p  levels (50 nM) completely prevented the TLR2 protein expression,  compared to mock-transfected cells, 3 days after transfection  (Figure 7B-C). All together these results show that, in tARPCs,  TLR2 mRNA is regulated by miR-1225-5p.  Discussion  miRNAs may be one of the key regulators of the stem cell  identity, including self-renewal and cell fate decisions, thanks to  their ability to simultaneously regulate many targets that provides  a means for coordinated control of gene action [10-14]. Here we  found distinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed both  in tARPCs and gARPCs. Among them, we found some miRNAs  whose target genes overlapped with genes that were modulated in  comparison to RPTECs in our previous works and whose  expression resulted inverse respect to modulated genes [7-8,16].  Some of these miRNAs were predicted to target genes involved in  the regulation of WNT/B-catenin signals, such as FZD5,  SLC6A6, and HOXA9 (Figure S2 and S3 in File S1).  In stem cells WNT signals are transduced to the canonical  pathway for cell fate determination and to the noncanonical  pathway for control of cell movement and tissue polarity. Target  genes of WNT signaling cascades are determined in a context-  dependent manner due to expression profile of transcription  factors and epigenetic status [17-18]. Canonical WNT signals are  transduced through Frizzled family receptors and LRP5/LRP6  coreceptor to the b-catenin signaling cascade. WNT, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Notch, Hedgehog, and transforming growth  factor b/bone morphogenetic protein signaling networks are implicated in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by regulating  self-renewal of normal stem cells as well as proliferation or  differentiation of progenitor (transit-amplifying) cells, regulating  the balance between stem and progenitor cells [17-18]. Specifi-  cally, Fzd5 can regulate WNTs, interpreting WNT signals during  embryonic mesoderm and neural induction [19-20]. Moreover, it  is known that HOXA9 shows positive regulation of genes in the  Wnt pathway important for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal  [21].  Among many miRNAs modulated in ARPCs, we focused in  particular on two of them, the miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p, that  were interesting since together were predicted to target several  markers typical ARPCs, such as CD133, PAX2, PAX-8, CD44  [1,4-5,7] and several genes found over-expressed in ARPCs, such  as TLR2, inhibin, cyclin D1, BMP receptor 2, IL-8 and MCP-1  [7-8,16]. We demonstrated that in renal progenitors the  expression of both the stem cell markers CD133 and PAX2  depends, at least in part, on lower miR-1915 levels.  CD133, a pentaspan membrane glycoprotein, is a marker for  adult stem cells in various tissues and tumor types. Stem cell  specificity is maintained by tight regulation of CD133 expression  at both transcriptional and post-translational levels but very little is  known about its regulation and its molecular function [22-24].  However, PAX2, a transcription factor critical for kidney  development [25] is another important marker of ARPCs that is  also re-expressed in tubular cells damaged by renal toxins [26-27].  Moreover it has been shown that Activin/Inhibin A signaling  can regulate the expression of PAX2 and can induce an immature  phenotype in tubular cells [28].  We found that the increase of levels of miR-1915 improved  capacity of tARPCs to differentiate into adipocyte-like and  epithelial-like cells, suggesting that the down-regulation of  CD133 and PAX2 expression led renal progenitors to be more  prone to differentiation.  Another important key gene of ARPCs is TLR2 since the  engagement of the receptor that it codifies can activate renal  progenitors leading to increase secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1  chemokines and enhancing differentiation capacity of renal stem/  progenitor cells [7]. Moreover, the TLR2 plays an important role  in the acute tubular cell injury: it can work as a sensor of the  Figure 3. Principal genes predicted to be targeted by miR- 1225-5p and miR-1915. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0068296.g003  miRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296    damage and drive tARPCs to repair damaged RPTECs by  secretion of Inhibin-A and microvesicle-shuttled Decorin and  CyclinD1 [16]. We showed that the low levels of miR-1225-5p in  tARPCs were responsible for high TLR2 expression and found  that the same miRNA was predicted to regulate other important  genes found overexpressed in ARPCs, such as PAX-8, IL-8,  BMPR2, IGF1, Inhibin-A, CyclinD1 and WNT1 [7-8,16].  Therefore, together, the miR-1915 and the miR-1225-5p seem  to regulate important traits of ARPCs: the stemness and the repair  capacity. Their relevance was supported by the bioinformatic  analyses showing that these two miRNAs have multiple target  genes that are all highly interconnected and that were all found  up-regulated in renal progenitors.  Further studies will be necessary to determine whether the  modulation of these two miRNAs could enhance, in vivo, the  regenerative capacity of ARPCs for therapeutic purposes.  Materials and Methods  Renal Tissue-derived Primary Cell Cultures Fresh human renal cortical tissue was harvested from patients  diagnosed with renal carcinoma. All patients gave signed consent  for the use of their tissue for research purposes at the time of  radical nephrectomy. The study was carried out according to the  principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by our  institutional ethics review board (Independent Ethical Committee  of Policlinic Hospital of Bari). Portions of normal-appearing cortex  were isolated surgically and examined histologically to exclude  presence of carcinoma. Isolation of renal fractions was achieved as  reported elsewhere [7-8,15-16], recovering both glomerular and  tubular fractions. Briefly, cortex renal fractions were dissected by  the passage through a graded series of meshes steel sieves to  remove the fibrous component. The cellular fraction was then  passed through a 120-mesh sieve to isolate the capsulated  glomeruli from the tubular fraction. After several washes, the  two isolated fractions were cultured separately in EGM-MV  medium (Lonza) supplemented with 20% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich).  After 4-5 days, cultures were washed twice with Hanks' buffer to  remove non-adherent cells and after about 1 week in culture, cell  viability and number were checked. CD133-positive cells were  then isolated by magnetic cell separation technology (MACS) by  means of CD133Ab-conjugated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi  Biotec). The eluted cells were resuspended and maintained in  EGM-MV medium supplemented with 20% FBS and incubated at  37uC with 5.0% CO2. After cell expansion, ARPC markers were checked by cytofluorimetric determination and by cell immuno-  fluorescence microscopy. Cytofluorimetric analysis was performed  using a Partec Flow-Max cytofluorimeter (Partec). Each determi-  nation was performed on 10 5  cells. The following antibodies were  used: PE-conjugated anti-CD133/2 (293C3), FITC-conjugated  anti-CD34, and FITC-conjugated anti-CD45 (all from Miltenyi  Biotec); FITC-conjugated anti-CD105 and FITC-conjugated anti-  Figure 4.

The miRNA relative expressions were normalized to the expression of U6. Expression levels of miR-1225-5p, miR-1915, miR-371-5p and miR-196a were found significantly lower in tARPCs and gARPCs compared to RPTECs.

FITC-conjugated  mouse IgG1 (Serotec) was used as an isotype control. In all  cytofluorimetric determinations performed using Miltenyi anti-  bodies, nonspecific sites were blocked with the FcR blocking  reagent (Miltenyi Biotec). Immunofluorescence experiments were  performed using the following primary antibodies: mouse anti-  human CD133/1 mAb (clone AC133; Miltenyi Biotec), mouse  antihuman CD133/2 mAb (Miltenyi Biotec), rabbit anti-human  PAX2 pAb (Covance, Princeton, NJ), mouse anti-human CD105  mAb (Abcam), mouse anti-human CD24 mAb (Dako), mouse anti-  human CD44 mAb (Chemicon), mouse anti-human Bmi1 mAb  (Upstate Biotechnology), rabbit anti-human Oct-4 pAb (Abcam).  The following secondary antibodies were used: Alexa Fluor 555  goat anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG, and  Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG1 (all from Molecular  Probes).  Other Cell Cultures MSCs and RPTECs were purchased from Lonza and  maintained in the recommended medium, REGM and MSCGM,  respectively (Lonza). Primary RPTECs stain positive for gamma-  glutamyl transpeptidase (g-GTP) and for alkaline phosphatase and  can form tubules on matrigel.  miRNA Isolation Total RNA was extracted from a minimum of 10  6 cells/line  using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the  manufacturer's protocol. DNase treatment was carried out to  remove any contaminating DNA (RNase-Free DNase Set,  Qiagen).  Total RNA, including small RNA fractions, was then eluted in  RNase-free water. The RNA concentration was determined with  NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). The  miRNAs quality was assessed by using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer  (Agilent Technologies), and only samples with RNA integrity  number .8.5 were used.

(A) TLR2 expression levels were analyzed by real-time PCR following transfection with 25 nM miR-1225-5p mimic. Increasing the amount of miR-1225-5p within ARPCs resulted in a 1.3 fold reduction of TLR2 mRNA levels 24 hours after transfection. Expression data were normalized on the housekeeping gene b-actin. Data are representative of three independent experiments (means 6 SEM), *p,0.01. (B-C) TLR2 protein expression after transfection with 50 nM miR-1225-5p mimic.

Probe sets were sorted after  significant P-value and were adjusted to account for multiple  testing using the FDR method of Benjamini-Hochberg. To  determine the features that were differentially expressed between  two types of cells with a stronger statistic, we applied a filter with  FDR,0.01 and a fold change .2. Two-dimensional hierarchical  clustering and PCA were performed using Genespring software  (Agilent Technologies). To assess biological relationships among  genes, we used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA,  Ingenuity System; http://www.ingenuity. com). IPA computes a  score for each network according to the fit of the set of supplied  focus miRNAs/genes. These scores indicate the likelihood of focus  genes to belong to a network versus those obtained by chance. In  IPA, the Expression Pairing tool was then applied to display the  microRNA-mRNA pairs, and to filter down the pairs with inverse  expression relationships.  miRNA targets were predicted by means of miRBase 17.0  (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk) [29], TargetScan 5.2 (http://www.  targetscan.org/) [30], PicTar (http://pictar.org) [31] and RNA22  1.0 (http://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22v1.0) [32] algorithms. The  algorithms interrogated the databases by searching for the  presence of conserved 8mer and 7mer sites that match the seed  region of each miRNA at 3'-UTR, 5'-UTR or coding sequences.  The scanning algorithms were based on sequence complementar-  ity between the mature miRNA and the target site, binding energy  of the miRNA-target duplex, and evolutionary conservation of the  target site sequence and target position in aligned homologous  genes. Potential targets were chosen overlapping results from the  four algorithms and selecting gene targets predicted by at least 2 of  them and based on a score cutoff computed by a weighted sum of  a number of sequence and context features of the predicted  miRNA:mRNA duplex. Bioinformatic analysis to study the  potential binding sites of miRNAs in CD133 target mRNA was  carried out by the RNAhybrid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-  bielefeld.de) [33]. In general, the program finds the energetically  most favorable hybridizations of a small RNA to a large RNA by a  thorough statistical analysis of minimum free energies (MFEs).  We evaluated statistical significance with the Student's t test for  comparisons between 2 mean values. Pearson's correlation test was  used to study continuous variables. All values were expressed as  the mean6SD of data obtained from at least three independent  experiments. Results were considered statistically significant at  p,0.05.  Quantitative RT-PCR Total RNA, including small RNA fractions, was reverse  transcribed with miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen)  following the manufacturer's instructions.  The real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction  (RT PCR) for the quantification of miRNAs was carried out with  miScript Primer Assays and miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit from  Qiagen. Real-time PCR amplification reactions were performed in  triplicate in 25 ml of final volume via SYBR Green chemistry on iCycler (Bio-Rad).  Normalization was performed with a small nucleolar RNA U6  endogenous control. Comparative real-time PCR was performed  in triplicate, including no-template controls. Relative expression  was calculated using the 2 2DCt  method.  For CD133, PAX2 and TLR2 expression analysis, total RNA  was reverse transcribed with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription  Kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Quantita-  tive RT-PCR amplification reactions were performed in triplicate  in 25 ml final volumes using SYBR Green chemistry on an iCycler. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect  Primer Assay and the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR mix  (Qiagen). Genes were amplified according to the manufacturer's  directions. The b-actin gene amplification was used as a reference standard to normalize the target signal. Relative expression was  calculated using the 2 2DCt  method.  miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p Mimic Transfection For each transfection, tARPCs and gARPCs were cultured at  1*10 5  cells per well in a 6-well plate with EGM-MV with 20%  FBS at 37uC in 5% CO2. The transfection of miRNA mimic was carried out using TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent (Mirus) in  accordance with manufacturer's procedure. All miRNA mimics  were purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In  transfection experiments a mock-transfection control was per-  formed by putting cells through the transfection procedure without  adding miRNA. The validated nonsilencing siRNA sequence  AllStars Negative Control siRNA (50 nM, Qiagen) and the Syn-  hsa-miR-1 miScript miRNA Mimic (25 nM, Qiagen) were used as  negative control and positive control, respectively, for the setup of  miRNA mimic transfections. Each transfection experiment was  done in triplicate. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24  hours for total RNA extraction. For the protein analysis, cells were  transfected twice at a distance if 3 days and the protein expression  was assayed 6 days after the first transfection.  Flow Cytometric Analysis The CD133 protein surface expression, after transfection, was  determined by flow cytometric analysis. ARPCs were washed and  resuspended in FACS buffer and incubated with PE-conjugated  anti-CD133/2 (293C3) (Miltenyi Biotec). Non-specific sites were  blocked with the FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells  were analyzed on a \u2018\u2018EPICS XL'' Flow Cytometer (Beckman  Coulter). The area of positivity was determined using an isotype-  matched mAb, a total of 10 4  events for each sample were acquired.  Western Blot Analysis The amount of PAX2, after transfection, was determined by  Western blotting analysis. Total protein extracts were prepared  with RIPA lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-  HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 1.5% NonidetP-40, 1 mM sodium  orthovanadate, plus proteinase inhibitors. The protein concentra-  tion was determined by the Bradford assay (BioRad). 80 mg of each protein lysate was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and  transferred to polyvinyldene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Milli-  pore). The membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat milk powder  diluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (T-PBS) for 2 h at  room temperature (RT) and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-  PAX2 antibody (Novus Biologicals) in blocking buffer overnight at  4uC. Finally, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody of horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa  Cruz). Immunocomplexes were detected with ECL method (GE  Healthcare). The same membranes were stripped and reprobed  with anti- b-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Images of autoradiography were acquired using a scanner  EPSON Perfection 2580 Photo (EPSON) and quantified by Image  J 1.34 Software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

Cell Immunofluorescence and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy  The expression of TLR2, after transfection, was evaluated by  indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopic analysis on  ARPCs placed on a cover slip and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde.  The cells were blocked for 1 h (BSA in PBS, pH 7.4) and then  incubated with a mouse anti-human TLR2 mAb (Hycult  Biotechnology) and a mouse anti-human CD133 mAb (Miltenyi  Biotec) overnight at 4uC. The immune complexes were identified after the incubation of the cells with the specific secondary  antibodies (Alexa Flour 488 and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse  IgG, respectively) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were  washed in PBS after each step, counterstained with To-pro-3  (Molecular Probes), mounted in Gel/Mount (Biomeda), and sealed  with nail varnish. Negative controls were obtained by incubating  cells with the blocking solution and then omitting the primary  antibody. The stained cells were viewed under the Leica TCS SP2  (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) confocal laser-scanning microscope  using x40 and x63 objective lenses. Fluorescence levels were  quantified and expressed as area fraction (%).  Differentiation To evaluate the effects of the miR-1915 on ARPCs differen-  tiation, the ARPCs were transfected with 50 nM miR-1915 mimic  (Dharmacon) at the first day of differentiation and every 7 days.  The undifferentiated and untransfected cells were used as negative  controls.  The extrarenal differentiation experiments were performed  using the adipogenic induction/maintenance medium and osteo-  genic differentiation medium (Lonza), according to the manufac-  turer's instructions. For adipogenic differentiation, 3 cycles of  induction/maintenance were performed. Each cycle consisted of  culturing ARPCs in induction medium for 3 d and in maintenance  medium for 1-3 d. After 3 complete cycles, the cells were cultured  for seven more days in adipogenic maintenance medium,  replacing the medium every 2-3 d. At the end of the treatment  the lipid vacuoles were stained with Oil red-O (Sigma). Briefly,  cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde  for 15 min, rinsed with PBS and incubated with Oil red-O for  30 min.  Epithelial differentiation was obtained by culturing ARPCs in  commercially available REGM medium (Lonza) supplemented  with 50 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor (Sigma) for 20 days.  Tubular cells were identified by the expression of CK-19 and ZO-  1 in immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-human ZO-1 poly-  clonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-human CK-  19 mAb (Novus Biologicals).
