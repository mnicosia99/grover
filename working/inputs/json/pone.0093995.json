    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

  TGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates Stem Cell/Developmental Gene Expression and Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell De-Differentiation Xudong Shi., Daniel DiRenzo., Lian-Wang Guo.*, Sarah R. Franco, Bowen Wang, Stephen Seedial,  K. Craig Kent*  Department of Surgery, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America  Abstract  Atherosclerotic-associated diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States. Despite recent progress, interventional treatments for atherosclerosis can be complicated by restenosis resulting from neo-intimal hyperplasia. We have previously demonstrated that TGF-b and its downstream signaling protein Smad3:1) are up-regulated following vascular injury, 2) together drive smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration and 3) enhance the development of intimal hyperplasia. In order to determine a mechanism through which TGF-b/Smad3 promote these effects, Affymetrix gene expression arrays were performed on primary rat SMCs infected with Smad3 and stimulated with TGF-b or infected with GFP alone. More than 200 genes were differentially expressed (.2.0 fold change, p,0.05) in TGF-b/Smad3 stimulated SMCs. We then performed GO term enrichment analysis using the DAVID bioinformatics database and found that TGF-b/ Smad3 activated the expression of multiple genes related to either development or cell differentiation, several of which have been shown to be associated with multipotent stem or progenitor cells. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed up- regulation of several developmental genes including FGF1, NGF, and Wnt11 (by 2.5, 6 and 7 fold, respectively) as well as stem/progenitor cell associated genes CD34 and CXCR4 (by 10 and 45 fold, respectively). In addition, up-regulation of these factors at protein levels were also confirmed by Western blotting, or by immunocytochemistry (performed for CXCR4 and NGF). Finally, TGF-b/Smad3 down regulated transcription of SMC contractile genes as well as protein production of smooth muscle alpha actin, calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. These combined results suggest that TGF-b/Smad3 stimulation drives SMCs to a phenotypically altered state of de-differentiation through the up-regulation of developmental related genes.

Each year over a million  vascular reconstructions are performed to restore circulation to  ischemic organs. Unfortunately, a good number of these  eventually fail due to intimal hyperplasia which re-narrows the  vessel lumen. Currently, the only clinical approach to prevent  restenosis is the drug eluting stent, which is implanted into a vessel  following angioplasty, releasing drugs such as rapamycin or  paclitaxel. Even with the use of these stents, the incidence of  restenosis remains ,15% in the coronary arteries and higher in the peripheral circulation [1]. Moreover, patients are predisposed  to a risk of thrombosis resulting in sudden death. Therefore, it is  imperative to further delineate the underlying mechanisms of  restenosis with the goal of devising better strategies for prevention.  Intimal hyperplasia, or injury-triggered growth of the subintimal  layer of an artery or vein is the primary pathological event leading  to restenosis. Essential to this process is the transformation of  medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from a quiescent and  contractile state to a synthetic phenotype, active in the production  of extracellular matrix [2]. These \u2018\u2018activated'' cells quickly multiply  and migrate into the subintimal space forming a highly cellular  neointimal plaque. While attracting enormous interest, the nature  of this SMC phenotypic transformation has remained controver-  sial. A common observation is that injury-stimulated SMCs re-gain  the ability to proliferate and migrate while losing signature SMC  characteristics, i.e. loss of the spindle morphology and a decrease in  SMC markers such as smooth muscle actin (SMA), calponin, and  myosin heavy chain (MHC). It has been hypothesized by some  that SMCs, in response to injury, switch to a phenotypically  modulated state [2]. However, in a recent study, it was  hypothesized that this \u2018\u2018synthetic'' cell population is derived from  resident stem cells in the media, rather than de-differentiation of  mature medial SMCs [3].

Following ligand binding, the TGF-b receptor heterodimer is activated and phosphorylates the two cognate Smads, Smad2  and Smad3, which then bind to Smad4. The resulting complex  translocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression of a  plethora of genes by binding to their promoters [4]. The  regulatory power of Smad3 as a master transcription factor is  augmented or modulated by interactions with some 50 co-  transcription factors. Aside from these canonical pathways,  TGF-b is also able to regulate gene expression through non- canonical pathways, typically MAPK including ERK, JNK, and  p38. Moreover, these noncanonical pathways crosstalk with the  canonical TGF-b/Smad3 pathway forming a complex TGF-b signaling network. As such, TGF-b function can vary and depends upon cell type, the extracellular environment, as well as the  signaling context [4].  TGF-b has been found to be an inhibitor of proliferation in many cell types including cancer cells. In vascular SMCs we and  several other groups have observed in vitro, that TGF-b inhibits cell proliferation as well as migration [5,6,7]. This is surprising in that  TGF-b has been found to enhance the formation of intimal hyperplasia at the time of arterial injury, which is characterized by  SMC proliferation and migration [8]. Our group has found that  the anti-proliferative effect of TGF-b is reversed in the presence of elevated Smad3 expression, and Smad3 expression is enhanced  following arterial injury. Moreover, adenoviral expression of  Smad3 following arterial injury exacerbates the formation of  intimal hyperplasia [6]. Thus, in a background of elevated Smad3,  the function of TGF-b in SMCs is paradoxically opposite of the anti-proliferative effect generally observed in cell culture. We  reason that when Smad3 protein is increased (in vitro or in vivo), the  canonical TGF-b/Smad3 pathway may over-ride other TGF-b- associated pathways and dominate the TGF-b signaling network, leading to an altered outcome in SMC behavior. We hypothesize  that TGF-b/Smad3 signaling alters the expression profile of the Smad3-responsive genome thus driving SMCs to a distinct, de-  differentiated fate.  In order to investigate the TGF-b/Smad3-directed SMC transcriptome, we performed gene array following TGF-b stimulation of primary rat aortic SMCs transduced with an  adenovirus expressing Smad3, mimicking the in vivo condition of  TGF-b and Smad3 elevation following arterial injury. Interest- ingly, our data reveal, in response to TGF-b/Smad3, up- regulation of a large number of genes associated with development  and/or multipotent stem cells or progenitor cells. Our findings  suggest a novel mechanism whereby elevated TGF-b/Smad3 reverses the developmental lineage to a de-differentiated state.  These findings provide novel, important insight into the disparate  function of TGF-b in vitro and in vivo as well as the molecular mechanisms of intimal hyperplasia.  Materials and Methods  Ethics Statement The experiments involving animal use were carried out in strict  accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care  and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of  Health. The protocol (Permit Number: M02273) was approved by  the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the  University of Wisconsin-Madison. All surgery was performed  under isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize  suffering.  Reagents Recombinant human TGF-b1 was purchased from R&D  Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium  (DMEM) and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen  (Carlsbad, CA). All the other reagents were from Sigma (St. Louis  MO) unless otherwise specified.  Smooth Muscle Cell Culture and Viral Infection Rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated  from the thoracoabdominal aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats  based on a protocol described by Clowes et al. [9]. Vascular SMCs  were used at passages 5 to 6 for all experiments and were  maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine  solution (FBS) at 37uC with 5% CO2. For experiments involving Smad3 overexpression, vascular SMCs were infected with  adenovirus (36104 particles/cell) expressing Smad3 (or GFP control) in DMEM containing 2% FBS for 4 h at 37uC followed by recovery in media containing 10% FBS. After overnight  incubation, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for  24 h. The cells were then treated with recombinant TGF-b (5 ng/ ml) or solvent for desired hours. For microarray analysis, passage  5 SMCs from 3 different animals were infected with AdSmad3 or  AdGFP control followed by treatment with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) or solvent (for GFP control) for 24h. Adenoviral vectors expressing  Smad3 (AdSmad3) and GFP (AdGFP) were constructed as  previously described [7].  RNA Isolation and Quality Control Total RNA from SMCs treated with AdSmad3 and TGF-b or  AdGFP alone was isolated using the Qiagen RNA/DNA Mini Kit  (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer's instruc-  tions. For quality control, 1 mg of total RNA was analyzed by capillary electrophoresis using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip and  the Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,  CA). All RNA samples used in this study showed no sign of  degradation.  Microarray Microarray was carried out at the University of Wisconsin-  Madison Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI). Whole transcript  target labeling was carried out with total RNA using Ambion's  expression kit to generate terminal labeled cDNA (Austin, TX).  Labeled cDNA was hybridized to rat Genechip (Rat Gene 1.0 ST  Array) overnight in the AFX HybOven480 (Santa Clara, CA), and  then post-processed on the Fluidics450 station. Post-hybridization  washing was performed according to manufacturer's instructions.  The microarray slides were scanned on a G7 scanner (Affymetrix,  Santa Clara, CA). Data were extracted using the Affyrmetrix  console software. The complete data set is available at Gene  Expression Omnibus (GEO Accession: GSE54624).  Basic Analyses The fold changes of gene expression, P values and heat maps  were calculated using the ArrayStar software (DNASTAR, Inc.,  Madison, WI). A moderated t-test was performed to identify  putative genes with significant expression changes. Putative genes  that were up or down regulated more than 2-fold with a P value  less than 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed and  selected for further analysis.  Functional Analysis of Significantly Affected Genes Genes that were up or down regulated more than 2 fold (P,  0.05) after TGF-b/Smad3 treatment compared to GFP control  TGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation Genes  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995    were submitted to David Bioinformatics Resources 6.7, NIAID/  NIH (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). The overall functions regu-  lated by these TGF-b/Smad3 modulated genes were identified by Functional Annotation Clustering and ranked by enrichment  scores.  Real-time Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) mRNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen,  Valencia, CA). Potential contaminating genomic DNA was  removed by using gDNA Eliminator columns provided in the  kit. The purified mRNA (2 mg) was used for the first-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the  7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,  CA). Each cDNA template was amplified in triplicates using  SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,  CA) with gene specific primers.  Western Blotting Analysis Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,  1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing  Protease Inhibitor Cocktail I (Millipore,Billerica, MA). Protein  concentration was determined by Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit  (Hercules, CA). Thirty micrograms of proteins from each sample  were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocel-  lulose membranes. Protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting  with the following rabbit antibodies for FGF-1, NGF, Wnt11,  CXCR4, CD34 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),  calponin, and myosin heavy chain (Abcam, Cambridge, MA),  mouse antibodies for a-smooth muscle actin and b-actin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After incubation with appropriate primary  antibodies and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary  antibodies, the specific protein bands on the membranes were  visualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce,  Davenport, IL).  Immunocytochemistry Immunostaining was performed to detect in situ the expression  of CXCR4 and NGF in SMCs, following our published method.  Cells were prepared by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS  for 10 minutes. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% triton  x-100 in PBS and blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA/5% donkey serum  for 1 h. Primary antibody was applied overnight at 4uC, and then a secondary antibody was incubated with the cells for 1 h at room  temperature followed by fluorescence microscopy.  Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis of the data other than microarray results was  conducted using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and  data were presented as mean 6 SEM derived from at least three  independent experiments, unless otherwise stated. If significant,  the ANOVA was followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test. P  value less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.  Results  Stimulation of Vascular SMCs with TGF-b/Smad3 Drives Large-scale Gene Expression  The genome-wide changes in mRNA expression that occur in  SMCs in response to enhanced TGF-b/Smad3 signaling are of great interest and will provide significant insight into the role of  TGF-b in the development of restenosis. To identify which genes are influenced, rat primary SMCs were infected with adenoviral  vectors expressing human Smad3 or control GFP. SMC cultures  were serum-starved for 24 hours and the Smad3 group was  stimulated with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours prior to RNA isolation and Affymetrix gene expression array analysis. By  comparing control (AdGFP) SMCs to cells expressing Smad3  and stimulated by TGF-b our goal was to mimic a comparison between uninjured artery with low levels of TGF-b and Smad3 and injured artery with increased expression of both proteins. This  combined TGF-b/Smad3 stimulation led to the significant (p, 0.05) (.2.0 fold) changes in the expression levels of 219 genes with  143 genes up-regulated and 76 genes down-regulated (Figure 1A).  Although we used p,0.05 as our threshold and a two-fold change  in expression, 289 additional genes were observed that had a  statistically significant (p,0.05) change in gene expression but the  numerical change was not greater than 2.0 fold (Figure 1B).  Additionally, there were 466 genes that exhibited a greater than  2.0 fold change in gene expression but these differences did not  reach statistical significance (Figure 1B). Although the criteria used  to select the 219 genes that are the focus of this analysis were  reasonably stringent, there are clearly additional genes that are  affected by the combination of TGF-b and Smad3. Nevertheless, the findings from this gene expression array demonstrate that  combined TGF-b/Smad3 signaling leads to changes in expression of a large number of genes that are potentially responsible for the  altered cellular state of SMCs following in vivo vascular injury.  DAVID GO-term Analysis of TGF-b/Smad3 Differentially Regulated Genes  Additional studies were then performed to identify the putative  biological function of these 219 genes. In order to better  understand the consequences of TGF-b/Smad3 activation of SMCs we utilized the DAVID bioinformatics database (http://  david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) to determine enriched gene ontology  (GO) terms. The gene ontology project provides a controlled  vocabulary of terms for describing gene product characteristics  and gene product annotation data from the published literature.  These terms are designed to establish a universal vocabulary for  describing the molecular function, biological processes, and  cellular component associated with every gene in the genome.  For this particular analysis, DAVID identified significantly  enriched biological processes associated with our list of 219  differentially expressed genes and clustered these into functional  categories. The top 20 functional categories, based on enrichment  score, are displayed in Figure 2 and the entire data set can be  found in Table S1. Interestingly, the most enriched functional  category with an enrichment score of 5.9 is \u2018\u2018Developmental  Process,'' suggesting that SMCs stimulated by TGF-b/Smad3 may reactivate a developmental pattern of gene expression. Included in  the top 20 were other functional categories relating to the  developmental processes including \u2018\u2018Regulation of Cell Differen-  tiation,'' \u2018\u2018Branching Tube Morphogenesis,'' Respiratory System  Development,'' \u2018\u2018Limb Development,'' and \u2018\u2018Immune system  Development'' (Figure 2). Although categories related to develop-  ment of the limb, respiratory, and immune systems seem  counterintuitive, it is probable that similar genes function in the  development of multiple organ systems, including the vascular  system. In sum, these results reinforce the notion that SMCs, when  exposed to Smad3 and TGF-b, reactivate a pattern of develop- mental gene expression.  Following vascular injury and as a precursor to intimal  hyperplasia, SMCs migrate, become proliferative and are resistant  to apoptosis. In SMCs activated by Smad3 and TGF-b we observed functional categories of genes that promote all three of  these processes. Inclusive within the top 20 functional categories  were \u2018\u2018Regulation of Cell Migration,'' \u2018\u2018Regulation of Cell  TGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation Genes  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995  http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/   Response/Chemotaxis,'' \u2018\u2018Negative Regulation of Cell Migration''  and \u2018\u2018Positive Regulation of Cell Migration'' showing that multiple  genes affected by TGF-b/Smad3 influence SMC migration. Also, \u2018\u2018Negative Regulation of Cell Apoptosis'' and \u2018\u2018Regulation of  Apoptosis'' indicate that TGF-b/Smad3 may have a significant effect on SMC apoptosis. Finally, \u2018\u2018Regulation of Cell Growth''  and \u2018\u2018Leukocyte Proliferation'' suggest that TGF-b/Smad3 activation of SMCs can also influence proliferation. In our  previous studies we have demonstrated that TGF-b/Smad3 stimulation is capable of enhancing proliferation and migration  and protecting against apoptosis of vascular SMCs thereby  contributing to the development of neo-intimal hyperplasia. The  identification of these enriched categories provides potential  mechanisms for our previous findings.  Taken together, the DAVID GO-term enrichment analysis  reinforces that TGF-b/Smad3 activates genes associated with de- differentiation/differentiation as well as SMC proliferation,  migration and apoptosis. The sum of these effects may provide  an explanation why TGF-b/Smad3 have such a potent stimula- tory effect on the development of intimal hyperplasia.  Categorization of Developmental Related Genes The \u2018\u2018Developmental Process'' is the most enriched functional  category populated by the 219 differentially expressed genes  induced by TGF-b/Smad3. We combined the various functional clusters and generated a list of 60 genes that are related to  development/differentiation/or de-differentiation. To better un-  derstand the role of these 60 genes in SMC behavior we conducted  an extensive literature search and classified each into one of three  major categories: \u2018\u2018de-differentiation related,'' \u2018\u2018differentiation  related,'' or \u2018\u2018other developmental related.'' TGF-b/Smad3 treatment of SMCs significantly regulated a cluster of 17 genes  that have been previously associated with de-differentiation in one  or more cell types (Table 1). We also identified an additional 34  genes that, in at least one cellular system, have been found to be  associated with cell differentiation (Table 2). There were an  additional 9 developmental genes that we could not categorize as  associated with de-differentiation or differentiation (Table 3).  For those 17 de-differentiation genes, the degree of de-  differentiation might be further subdivided into a hierarchy of  progenitor cells being the least de-differentiated, followed by  multipotent cells and then pluripotent cells as the most de-  differentiated. A single gene was found to be associated with  pluripotency. This gene, telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (Terf1),  is essential for the protection of telomere ends and induction of  induced pluripotent stem cells from somatic precursors [10]. In  contrast, we found several genes associated with multipotent  hematopoietic stem cells including the stem cell chemoattractant,  CXCL12 (SDF-1) and its corresponding receptor CXCR4.  Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is also included in the de-  differentiation table in that it has been shown to inhibit the  differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into myeloid cells [11].  In addition, several genes associated with multipotent mesenchy-  mal stem cells were also observed. The secreted factors FGF1 and  HB-EGF have both been shown to play essential roles in  mesenchymal stem cell renewal and inhibition of spontaneous  differentiation [12,13,14]. Likewise, Gremlin-1 (Grem1) and  Wnt9a expression are responsible for maintaining a population  of mesenchymal stem cells in a pre-osteoblast state [15,16]  whereas expression of PTH-LH inhibits chondrocyte differentia-  tion from mesenchymal stem cell precursors [17]. We also  identified 5 genes from the de-differentiation category that are  involved in progenitor cell activity. Interestingly, these genes were  shown to inhibit the differentiation of local progenitor cells into  their adult counterparts in various tissues including: for skin  keratinocytes, Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2); for  blood cell progenitors, Sox18; for chondrocyte progenitors,  Chordin-like 2 (Chrdl2); and for retinal progenitor cells, Wnt2b  [18,19,20,21]. Of most relevance to vascular disease, Forkhead  Figure 1. TGF-b/Smad3 treatment significantly affects gene expression in vascular SMCs.

Reactivation of development related genes may be of significant  consequence after vascular injury. These genes can modulate the  de-differentiation of SMCs into stem-like cells which regain  plasticity with increased capacity to proliferate and migrate.  Validation of Array Data for TGF-b/Smad3 Gene Expression by qRT-PCR  Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to corrobo-  rate our microarray findings for TGF-b/Smad3 regulated gene expression. The Affymetrix gene array revealed a number of  intriguing genes regulated by TGF-b/Smad3 and up-regulation of several that have been previously reported to be associated with  de-differentiation. To confirm the microarray results, SMCs were  infected with AdGFP or AdSmad3 and then treated with solvent  or TGF-b. The mRNA levels of several highly regulated genes associated with development were evaluated by qRT-PCR  (Figure 3). We initially evaluated three genes due to their well-  established roles in the development of a variety of mammalian  tissue including vascular, epithelium, and neuronal tissue. The  results of qRT-PCR were in agreement with microarray results  with regard to the expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1),  nerve growth factor (NGF) and wingless-related MMTV integra-  tion site 11 (Wnt11). FGF1 was elevated ,2.5 fold in TGF-b/ Smad3-stimulated cells compared to GFP control, whereas NGF  and Wnt11 were up-regulated ,6 fold and ,7 fold, respectively (Figure 3). Although all these genes were elevated, there were  differences in the expression profiles of each. For Wnt11, TGF-b alone produced an effect on gene expression that was almost as  significant as that found with combined TGF-b/Smad3 stimula- tion. In contrast, FGF1 and NGf up-regulation by TGF-b was heavily reliant on the presence of elevated levels of Smad3  (Figure 3A). We further confirmed up-regulation of protein  production of these 3 factors. Western blotting showed an ,2.5- 3 fold increase of all 3 proteins either in SMC lysates (Figure 3B)  or cell culture media (Figure 3C), as a result of TGF-b/Smad3 treatment. Following the treatment with AdSmad3 alone (no  TGF-b), while only FGF-1 was significantly up-regulated in cell lysates, all 3 factors were significantly increased in conditioned  media.  In additional experiments we evaluated expression of CXCR4  and CD34, both stem/progenitor associated genes. The qRT-  PCR data indicate that CXCR4 and CD34 mRNA levels were  increased by ,10 fold and 45 fold, respectively, after TGF-b/ Smad3 stimulation (Figure 4A); Western blotting confirmed an  increase of these two proteins in cell lysates albeit to a lower extent  (,3 fold) (Figure 4B). In order to understand the temporal expression profiles of these two genes, we determined the qRT-  PCR time course. SMCs were infected with AdSmad3 and treated  with TGF-b (5ng/ml) for the indicated times, AdGFP served as a control. TGF-b/Smad3 gradually and consistently increased CD34 expression to 30 fold at 12 hours and to a maximum of  50 fold at 48 hours. In contrast, CXCR4 was enhanced and  peaked at 50 fold at 6 hours then gradually fell to 10-fold by 48  hours (Figure 4C). These results further validate the array findings  and confirm that TGF-b/Smad3 activate two additional genes associated with cell development. Interestingly, the time course of  each differs with CXCR4 associated with a peak in expression at 6  hours and CD34 expression gradually increasing over time.  Using immunocytochemistry we then determined the percent-  age of SMCs that express development/progenitor associated  genes in response to the combined stimulation of AdSmad3 and  TGF-b. In order to avoid an interference of GFP fluorescence with  Figure 2. Functional role of TGF-b/Smad3 regulated genes.

TGF-b/Smad3 regulated genes are associated with multiple functions based upon clustering annota- tion measured by Fisher Exact in the DAVID system. The enrichment scores represent the relative importance of the function of each the regulated genes. An enrichment score of 1.3 is similar to P,0.05. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093995.g002  TGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation Genes  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995    microscopic detection of immunostained proteins, we sought to  use GFP as a surrogate of viral expression of Smad3 because the  adenoviral vector was designed to co-express GFP and Smad3.  Indeed, after AdSmad3 infection and TGF-b treatment, over 90% of GFP-expressing SMCs were Smad3-overexpressing cells (Figure  S1 in File S1). We then immunostained two representative factors,  NGF and CXCR4, in AdGFP and AdSmad3 infected (and TGF-b treated) cells. We found that ,60% of GFP cells were NGf and CXCR4 positive cells (Figure 5), indicating a strong association of  up-regulation of these factors with Smad3 expression.  In sum, through determination of mRNA, protein, and in situ  cellular expression, we have confirmed significant up-regulation of  five genes, all of which were found by the Affymetrix gene  expression array to be associated with SMC development.  TGF-b/Smad3 Negatively Regulates SMC Differentiation TGF-b is classically considered a stimulant of SMC differen-  tiation [23,24,25,26]. However, the foregoing suggests that in the  context of elevated Smad3, TGF-b promotes de-differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, we propose that TGF-b/Smad3 might also inhibit SMC differentiation. To explore this possibility,  using qRT-PCR we evaluated the effect of TGF-b/Smad3 on expression of smooth muscle actin (SMA), Calponin, and smooth  muscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), which are three proteins  known to be associated with SMC differentiation. SMCs were  infected with AdSmad3 and treated with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) for 24 h or infected with AdGFP. qRT-PCR revealed that activation  of the TGF-b/Smad3 pathway significantly decreased the expression of the SMC contractile genes, SMA, Calponin, SM-  MHC to approximately 60% of control (Figure 6A); either  AdSmad3 or TGF-b alone did not produce a significant change (Figure S2 in File S1). These findings were then confirmed by  Western blotting, using an identical experimental protocol. Protein  levels associated with each of these genes fell to approximately  50% of control (Figure 6B, C). Thus, our findings suggest that  TGF-b/Smad3 not only enhance expression of factors that  promote cellular de-differentiation but also inhibit factors that  have been previously found to be associated with differentiation or  preservation of the SMCs in a quiescent, contractile state.  Whereas TGF-b alone has been strongly associated with SMC differentiation, the sum of our findings suggest that in the presence  of elevated Smad3, TGF-b transforms into a potent stimulant of SMC de-differentiation.  Discussion  TGF-b is a critically important factor in the development of intimal hyperplasia. Its expression is up-regulated in arteries and  veins following vascular reconstruction. Moreover, increasing  TGF-b through viral expression in an animal model of arterial injury exacerbates intimal hyperplasia, whereas inhibiting TGF-b signaling by using antibodies or by expressing a soluble form of the  TGF-b receptor attenuates it [8]. These findings are surprising since, TGF-b, in vitro, is a potent inhibitor of SMC proliferation and migration, both necessary contributors to intimal hyperplasia.  Our recent published findings bring some resolution to this  conundrum. It appears that TGF-b in the presence of elevated levels of its canonical signaling protein Smad3, transforms from an  inhibitor of SMC proliferation and migration to a stimulant of  both processes. We have previously demonstrated that adminis-  tration of TGF-b to cultured SMCs coupled with adenoviral overexpression of Smad3, leads to enhanced proliferation,  migration, and synthesis of extracellular matrix [6,27,28,29].  These results are mirrored in vivo where overexpression of Smad3  was found to enhance balloon injury-induced intimal hyperplasia  in rat carotid arteries [6,29]. While transfection with siRNA to  reduce Smad3 levels reversed SMC proliferation stimulated by  AdSmad3 [63], adenoviral expression of Smad7, which blocks  Smad3 signaling, effectively inhibited intimal hyperplasia [6].  Despite the current knowledge that TGF-b/Smad3 play crucial roles in stimulating SMC proliferation, migration and intimal  hyperplasia in response to arterial injury, changes in gene  expression and the mechanism behind this response remain  Table 1.

We performed the Affymetrix gene expression arrays on  SMCs infected with AdSmad3 and stimulated by TGF-b, with the assumption that identification of genes regulated by the combina-  tion of TGF-b/Smad3 may provide important insight into how this signaling axis affects intimal hyperplasia. We identified 219  genes whose expression was substantially altered (.2 fold change,  p,0.05). We then applied DAVID bioinformatics tools to analyze  TGF-b/Samd3 regulated gene functions. The most salient finding of this analysis was that the most prominently regulated genes were  those related to development, some of which are associated with  stem or progenitor cells. It is likely that expression of these  developmental and stem cell-related genes is indicative that TGF-  b/Smad3 at minimum produces SMC de-differentiation or at maximum transforms SMCs into stem or progenitor cells following  vascular injury.  It has been thought for many years that for neointimal  hyperplasia to occur, a transformation of medial SMCs is  necessary to allow for their migration to and proliferation within  the subintimal space. Classically, this process has been described as  \u2018\u2018phenotypic switching'' or \u2018\u2018phenotypic modulation'' whereby  SMCs transition from quiescent and contractile to synthetic cells  following vascular injury [2,30]. As a consequence, SMCs reduce  their expression of contractile genes, most notably smooth muscle  alpha-actin, calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain  while up-regulating expression of genes that lead to the production  of extracellular matrix [2,30]. A variety of factors released at the  time of arterial injury, including PDGF-BB, PDGF-DD, oxidized  phospholipids and extracellular matrix proteins, have been  implicated in the transformation of SMCs from a contractile to  a synthetic phenotype [31,32,33,34]. Furthermore, many of these  stimulants exert their function through the intra-cellular signaling  Table 2. Cont.

Our data show that TGF-b/Smad3 in SMCs can re-activate the expression of development/stem cell related genes which may in  part account for the SMC phenotype transition to a more de-  differentiated state. The concept that SMCs express stem cell-  related genes following arterial injury is not entirely novel and has  been suggested by recent studies. Our group has previously  reported the presence of the stem cell factor, C-kit, in vascular  SMCs derived from human saphenous vein. Moreover, we found  a substantial increase in C-kit in hyperplastic plaque that develops  in the rat carotid model of intimal hyperplasia [37]. Ferlosio et al.  demonstrated an increase in the percentage of medial cells  expressing the stem cell markers flt-1 and c-kit in large arteries of  aged humans and rats versus younger controls [38]. SMCs isolated  from aged rats were also more proliferative, migratory and  expressed less SMC alpha actin compared to younger controls  [38]. These findings reinforce the notion that SMCs up-regulate  stem cell-associated genes in response to injury or chronic stress  such as aging.  Additional evidence that SMCs can activate stem cell gene  expression following arterial injury is revealed through numerous  studies of the epigenetic regulator, Klf4. Several publications by  the Owens group have demonstrated that Klf4 is up-regulated by  PDGF-BB and plays a pivotal role in phenotypic transformations  of SMCs [39,40]. These studies are especially interesting in that  Klf4 is one of the four \u2018\u2018Yamanaka factors'' that are capable of re-  programming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.  The role of Klf4 in SMC de-differentiation, however, is still  somewhat unclear. Other studies have shown that Klf4 has an  inhibitory effect on SMC proliferation [41]. The discrepant role of  Klf4 in SMC differentiation/de-differentiation is discussed in a  recent review where it is suggested that post-translational  modifications of this protein might explain its variable function  [42]. Regardless, the stem cell marker Klf4 appears to play an  important, but somewhat controversial, role in SMC differentia-  tion, proliferation, and vascular restenosis.  PDGF-BB is by far the most widely studied stimulant of de-  differentiation and numerous investigators have dissected the  molecular mechanisms through which this protein induces  phenotypic switching of SMCs. PDGF-BB has been shown to  activate the MAPK signaling cascade leading to Elk-1 phosphor-  ylation [43]. Myocardin is a master regulator for differentiation  and contractile protein expression in SMCs [46]. Phosphorylated  Elk-1 displaces myocardin at the promoter of SMC contractile  genes and reduces its expression [44]. IL-1b has also been shown in numerous studies to push cells towards a de-differentiated state  by inhibiting myocardin. This effect is mediated through NF-kB  and Notch3 [45]. These findings demonstrate that there is  significant cross-talk between signaling proteins, suggesting that  SMC phenotypic switching is a highly dynamic process that  involves multiple pathways.  The role of TGF-b in SMC differentiation is controversial and appears to depend upon the cell-type and developmental stage. In  vitro, TGF-b has been found to stimulate SMC differentiation as evidenced by enhanced contractile protein expression. Chen et al.  showed that TGF-b signaling promotes contractile protein expression in neural crest (Monc-1) cells which leads to their  differentiation into SMCs [24]. Imamura et al. showed that TGF-b has the capacity to induce differentiation of bone marrow derived  progenitor cells toward a SMC lineage through myocardin.  Alternatively, our data suggest that TGF-b and Smad3 promote de-differentiation of adult SMCs, at least partially by reactivating  expression of genes related to embryonic development and  suppressing expression of SMC differentiation markers. Thus in  the presence of elevated Smad3, TGF-b switches from a stimulant of differentiation to a promoter of de-differentiation.  It has been previously discovered that in some cells, TGF-b positively regulates stem cell function. For example, TGF-b signaling is necessary for proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells  [47]. Moreover, the TGF-b family has been implicated in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells [48], preventing these cells  from differentiating and migrating. Falk et al. reported that TGF-b regulates neuronal stem cell proliferation through Wnt signaling  [49]. Coincidentally, we found that TGF-b/Smad3 stimulate Wnt, Sox, and FGF family gene expression (Table 2). It appears that  elevated Smad3 is crucial for TGF-b regulated de-differentiation. Phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3 have been  observed in stem cells and both are decreased when stem cells  differentiate [50], suggesting that activated TGF-b signaling is required to maintain de-differentiation. TGF-b regulates embry- onic stem cell function by clustering Smad3 with other key  regulators including Nanog and Oct4 [51,52]. Together, Nanog  and Oct4, along with Lin28 and Sox2, can induce differentiated  cells into pluripotent stem cells with full capacity to differentiate  into any cell type [53].  Our findings demonstrate that reactivation of embryonic  developmental genes by TGF-b/Smad3 in a similar manner, leads to SMC plasticity and its consequences including SMC  proliferation. Our qRT-PCR data confirm the microarray results  and support a positive role for TGF-b/Smad3 in regulating expression of stem cell-related genes and SMC de-differentiation.  It is interesting to note that CXCR4 and CD34, which are stem  cell/progenitor markers, are substantially up-regulated in SMCs  following treatment with TGF-b/Smad3. Furthermore, we found that FGF-1, a potent mitogen for hematopoietic stem cell  expansion, was significantly up-regulated following TGF-b/ Smad3 stimulation. In contrast to FGF-1, basic fibroblast growth  factor (FGF-2) is widely studied in SMCs and is known to enhance  proliferation, migration, and drive intimal hyperplasia. Although  there is a paucity of research regarding FGF-1 in SMCs, a report  by Takahashi et al. demonstrated that FGF-1 expression was  sufficient to inhibit the differentiation of SMCs from progenitor-  like cells [54]. CD34 and CXCR4 have also been studied in the  vascular system. CD34 is a well-known marker for hematopoietic  stem cells and is often found in endothelial cells [55]. However,  our finding of CD34 in SMCs is novel. Several reports have shown  that the SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis is important in the development of  intimal hyperplasia [56]. Nevertheless, the finding of CXCR4 in  SMCs is also relatively novel. In contrast to stem/progenitor  markers, SMA, calponin and MHC, signature markers of SMC  differentiation, are all down-regulated in SMCs in response to the  treatment with TGF-b/Smad3. A decrease of these SMC markers  Figure 3. Up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of FGF-1, NGF and Wnt11 in SMCs by AdSmad3/TGF-b treatment.

The sum of our data reveals down-regulation of markers of SMC  differentiation and up-regulation of stem/progenitor markers that  are not typically expressed in mature SMCs. Thus, it is reasonable  to postulate that TGF-b in the presence of elevated Smad3 triggers  Figure 4. Up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of CD34 and CXCR4 in SMCs by AdSmad3/TGF-b treatment.

In addition to the foregoing factors we also observed increased  expression of NGF and Wnt11. While the functions of these two  genes in SMCs are not currently known, they have been reported  to play a role in differentiation of non-SMC cell types [57,58], not  supporting the hypothesis that TGF-b/Smad3 promotes de- differentiation. However, many developmental genes play differing  or even opposite roles depending upon the context or the cell type.  It may well be that NGF and Wnt11 in SMCs promote de-  differentiation. Alternatively, it might be that TGF-b/Smad3  induce transcription of genes associated with differentiation (NGF  and Wnt11) as well as de-differentiation, but the balance of their  combined effect favors de-differentiation. It is also interesting to  note that TGF-b/Smad3 significantly increased (by ,5-10 fold compared to AdGFP control) the expression of osteopontin, nestin,  and collagen type II, which are markers of osteoblasts, neurocrest  cells, and chondrocytes, respectively (Figure S3 in File S1).  Moreover, TGF-b/Smad3-conditioned media were able to up- regulate osteopontin and nestin as well (Figure S4 in File S1). Up-  regulation of these genes of different lineages lends additional  evidence to our assessment that TGF-b/Smad3-stimulated cells  Figure 5.

It is reasonable to  postulate that de-differentiated cells have a greater potential than  differentiated SMCs to express marker genes of other cell types.  Taken together, the foregoing results prompt us to propose that  enhanced TGF-b/Smad3 signaling confers on SMCs the propen- sity to de-differentiate toward an earlier stage in the developmental  lineage, which is consistent with our earlier observations that  TGF-b/Smad3 promotes SMC proliferation and migration and intimal hyperplasia.  Our primary hypothesis is that SMCs that contribute to intimal  hyperplasia are initially differentiated but transform into a de-  differentiated state in response to factors such as TGF-b/Smad3. Alternative hypotheses have been proposed that might explain the  presence of de-differentiated cells in arterial media and subintimal  plaque. One possibility is that these de-differentiated cells  translocate from another site. For example, there is substantial  evidence that at least some cells that contribute to the neointima  are myofibroblasts derived from the arterial adventitia [59]. There  are a series of studies showing in the murine model, that neo-  intimal cells are, in part, derived from the bone marrow  [7,60,61,62]. A recent study raised the controversial notion that  de-differentiation of mature SMCs is not the primary driving force  behind the development of intimal hyperplasia [3]. Rather,  neointima develops from undifferentiated multipotent vascular  stem cells (MVSCs) that naturally reside in the media of the  normal uninjured artery and then become activated with vascular  injury [3]. Although this notion is highly contentious, our findings  are not at complete odds with this theory. In studies of animal as  well as human plaque, we have found that some but far from all  cells, have enhanced expression of Smad3 [63]. Possibly up-  regulation of Smad3 signaling is confined to MVSCs following  vascular injury. Although the classical concept that quiescent  medial SMCs transform into the cells that comprise subintimal  plaque is still well accepted, the contribution of de-differentiated  cells derived from other sources including the adventitia, bone  marrow, or an intrinsic population of stem cells within the normal  arterial wall requires further exploration.  TGF-b/Smad3 play an important role in the development of vascular restenosis following arterial reconstruction. Our findings  suggest an important role for TGF-b/Smad3 in de-differentiation of vascular SMCs placing the TGF-b/Smad3 signaling axis at the center of a novel pathway that drives a phenotypic switch of  vascular SMCs following arterial injury. We have identified a  group of novel TGF-b/Smad3 regulated genes that may be central to this process. Blocking de-differentiation is a strategy that might  be used to prevent the development of intimal hyperplasia. Thus, a  thorough understanding of the de-differentiation factors that are  enhanced or the differentiation factors that are suppressed could  lead to novel therapeutics to prevent restenotic disease. An  approach that includes simultaneous suppression or accentuation  of several of these factors might be particularly strategic. The  identification of global targets and molecular pathways associated  with TGF-b/Smad3 pathway will provide a better understanding of the multi-faceted roles of TGF-b in complex pathophysiological processes of restenosis.
