The mechanism by which quiescent TECs re-obtain a potential to regenerate remains unknown. In this study, we observed a transient re-expression of embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2) in adult rat TECs in vivo during ischemia- reperfusion induced AKI and most Pax2 positive TECs co-expressed kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker. The re-expression of Pax2 was accompanied by increased levels of intrarenal Angiotensin II, which is a crucial injury factor of AKI. Furthermore, we also found a temporary re-expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells under the stimulation of Angiotensin II. This stimulatory effect could be blocked by PD123319 (Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) inhibitor) and AG490 (Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor). As Pax2 is essential for the phenotypic conversion from mesenchymal stem cells to TECs during kidney development, we proposed that the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be an indicator of \u2018\u2018atavistic'' transition which mimics but reverses the processes of development of TECs. This could be proved by that a progenitor marker, CD24, was also found to be transiently expressed shortly after the expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotensin II. The expression of CD24 was also suppressed by PD123319 and AG490. Moreover, knockdown of Pax2 by RNA interference could significantly reduce the expression of CD24 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotension II. Those findings suggest that mature TECs can trans-differentiate into progenitor-like cells by \u2018\u2018atavistic transition'', which may participate in the recovery of tissue structure and Pax2 may play a pivotal role in this process. That might have important implications for further understanding of tubular regeneration after injury.  Citation: Jiang Y, Jiang T, Ouyang J, Zhou Q, Liang Y, et al.

The recovery of renal function after AKI depends on the  recovery of renal tubular epithelium[1], but the mechanism of  tubular epithelial reconstruction remains unclear. It has been  proposed that surviving tubular epithelial cells (TECs) re-enter cell  cycle and replace damaged TECs by proliferating, but the  mechanism by which quiescent TECs regain the potential to  regenerate is still unknown. Meanwhile, this model has been  challenged by recent studies which suggest a role for stem/  progenitor cells in kidney repair. Nevertheless, the origin of these  stem/progenitor cells remains unclear [2,3,4,5].  Our previous study demonstrated that TECs could be induced  to temporarily re-express embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2)  during chronic kidney injury, which indicated that TECs could  transform into an immature cell phenotype and participate in  kidney repair during chronic kidney injury [6]. We then proposed  that a similar \"atavistic\" phenotype transition might also occur  during AKI [7]. This notion is supported by the finding that a  mesenchymal cell marker, vimentin, could be expressed in tubular  epithelium during the recovery stage of AKI [8].  The transition of TECs from one phenotype to another is not a  new concept. During the embryonic stage of the kidney, the  mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) which mesenchymal  stem cells (MSCs) are converted into a polarized tubular epithelial  phenotype is a pivotal event for the differentiation of TECs. Pax2  is expressed during MET and essential for this phenotype  transition [9]. During chronic kidney injury, epithelial to  mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proven to occur in  mature TECs. Pax2 is also expressed during EMT and essential  for this phenotype transition [6]. Those findings suggest that the  expression of Pax2 controls the phenotype transition between  stem/progenitor cells and epithelial cells. Therefore, we believe  that the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be a sign of  cell atavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic and  cellular processes of tubular development. This atavistic transition  allows mature TECs to gain a characteristic of stem/progenitor-  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093563&domain=pdf   like cells, which could re-differentiate into TECs that restore tissue  structure.  In this study, we demonstrated that Pax2 was re-expressed in  TECs during AKI in vivo, and we also found that Pax2 and a  stem/progenitor cell marker, CD24, were temporarily re-  expressed in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotensin II (Ang  II) in vitro. Both AT2R/JAK2 inhibitor and Pax2 iRNA could  block the re-expression of Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells  induced by Ang II. These findings led us to propose that mature  TECs can undergo an atavistic transition to convert into stem/  progenitor-like cells and participate in renal repair during AKI.  Pax2 may play a central role in this process.  Results  The construction of AKI animal model AKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in Wistar  rats as IRI is the most common cause of AKI [1]. The heart rate  and glucose levels did not statistically differ before, during, or after  operation both in experimental groups (IRI groups) and control  groups (sham operation groups) (data not shown). The total  elimination rate (due to death in all cases) was 5/96 (3/48 for IRI  groups and 2/48 for sham operation groups).  The induction of renal damage by IRI was verified by  biochemical and histological measurements. Both blood ureani-  trogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) increased significantly during the  early stage of AKI in IRI groups (24 to 48 hours (h) after  operation). No alteration of BUN and Cr levels was observed in  sham operation groups (figure 1).  Kidney sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) showed  remarkable changes consistent with AKI in IRI groups 24 h after  IRI, such as disrupted brush borders and flattened epithelia.  Epithelial cell proliferation changes were observed 72 h after IRI  (figure 2A). Pathology scores of kidney showed significant increases  after IRI in experimental groups, indicating remarkable renal  tissue damages were induced by IRI (figure 2B). No significant  changes were observed in animals of sham operation groups. Both  the biochemical and histological results showed that the IRI-  induced AKI rat model was successfully established.  Re-expression of Pax2 in proximal tubular epithelium during recovery stage of AKI  The re-expression of Pax2 in the tubular epithelium during AKI  was verified via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  (RT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) detec-  tions. A remarkable raise of Pax2 mRNA and protein levels was  observed in the renal cortex of animals in IRI groups. The  expression levels of Pax2 increased at 24 h, maximized at 72 h  and decreased at 96 h after IRI. No apparent expression of Pax2  could be observed in sham operated animals (figure 3). The IHC  detection showed that Pax2 could not be detected in proximal  TECs in normal kidney, while 24-72 h after IRI, Pax2 was  expressed in the nuclei of proximal TECs (figure 4). No changes of  Pax2 expression pattern was observed in sham operation groups.  Pax2 re-expression occurs primarily in injured epithelia cells  To elucidate the relationship between Pax2 expression and  tubular injury, we co-stained for Pax2 and kidney injury  molecular-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker, We found that  77.0612.5% of Pax2-positive cells co-expressed KIM-1 (figure 5).  This result indicates that most if not all Pax2 re-expression occur  in injured TECs during AKI.  Pax2 expression was accompanied by intrarenal Ang II increases in vivo  The intrarenal Ang II concentration significantly increased after  operation and maintained a high level in IRI groups. The levels of  intrarenal Ang II also slightly increased in sham operation groups  and gradually decreased to a lower level thereafter (figure 6).  Ang II stimulated Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells via AT2R and JAK2  In vivo studies proved that the level of intrarenal Ang II  increased during AKI and was accompanied by Pax2 re-  expression. Therefore, we used Ang II to stimulate NRK-52E  cells to verify that mature TECs have the ability of Pax2 re-  expression. Pax2 was observed to be transiently expressed in  NRK-52E cells in response to Ang II stimulation. Ang II  stimulated Pax2 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner  (figure 7A, figure 7B). The immunofluorescence analyses showed  that Pax2 was expressed in the nuclei of NRK-52E cells,which is  consistent with the fact that Pax2 is a nuclear transcription factor  (figure 7C).  To investigate signaling mechanisms that mediate Ang II  induced Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells, we pre-incubated  Figure 1. BUN (A) and Cr (B) results. In sham operation groups, there was no alteration of BUN and Cr levels after operation. In IRI groups, BUN and Cr levels increased significantly during the early stage of AKI (24 to 48 h after operation)(N = 6 for each time point, *P,0.05, IRI compared with sham), indicating impaired kidney function in IRI groups 24 to 48 h after operation. 72 h after operation, BUN and Cr levels in IRI groups decreased significantly and showed no difference with sham operation groups, indicating the recovery of renal function in IRI groups 72 h after operation. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g001  Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563    NRK-52E cells before Ang II administration with PD123319  (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor). Results with  western blot and RT-PCR showed that both PD123319 and  AG490 could block the stimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2  expression in NRK-52E cells (figure 8), suggesting that the  stimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2 expression in TECs is  mediated by AT2R and JAK2 pathways.  These data indicate that mature TECs can re-express embry-  onic gene Pax2 in response to stimulation of injury factors like Ang  II and the re-expression of Pax2 might be a sign of cell atavistic  transition.  Pax2 expression was accompanied by CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells induced by Ang II  To further confirm that mature TECs have the ability of cell  atavistic transition in response to stimulation of injury factors like  Ang II, we measured the expression of a stem/progenitor cell  marker, CD24[10], in NRK-52E cells stimulated by Ang II. We  observed a transient expression of CD24 shortly after the  expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells in response to Ang II  stimulation. The immunofluorescence analyses showed that CD24  was expressed at the surface of NRK-52E cells, which consistent  with the fact that CD24 is a cell membrane protein (figure 9).  We also used PD123319 (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2  inhibitor) to examine whether the mechanisms that mediate Ang II  induced CD24 expression are similar with that mediate Ang II  induced Pax2 expression. Western blot and RT-PCR showed that  both PD123319 and AG490 could inhibit Ang II induced CD24  expression (figure 10). These data suggest that Ang II stimulates  the atavistic transition of TECs via the AT2R and JAK2 pathways.  Knockdown of Pax2 suppressed Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells  The experiments above demonstrated that both Pax2 and  CD24 could be stimulated in mature TECs by Ang II via the same  signal pathways. Therefore, we used shRNA (pshRNA-Pax2-983)-  mediated RNA interference of Pax2 to further determine the  relationship between Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells induced  by Ang II.  Transfection of NRK-52E cells with Pax2 shRNA resulted in a  significant decrease in Ang II induced Pax2 expression levels as  shown by western blot and RT-PCR. The repression rate was  74.368.2% as judged by western blot. Transfection with emptily  plasmid vector failed to reduce Pax2 expression. The effect of Pax2  shRNA was specific in that it failed to knock down the expression  of unrelated protein b-actin (figure 11). Western blot and RT-PCR showed that the knockdown of Pax2  significantly suppressed Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-  52E cells (figure 12). These data suggest that Pax2 regulates the  expression of CD24 in mature TECs induced by Ang II. That  might indicate a central role of Pax2 in the cell atavistic transition  process of TECs.  Discussion  Pax2 is a transcription control factor which plays a crucial  regulatory role during kidney development. During fetal life, Pax2  is essential for the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET),  which mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are converted into tubular  epithelial phenotype[9]. Pax2 is not originally expressed in MSCs,  but is only induced when MSCs meet the ureteric bud. Pax-2  controls the process of MET by initiating a genetic cascade that  includes WT1, Wnt4, Six2 and c-Ret to suppress the expression of  mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, and promote epithelial  markers, such as E-cadherin and cytokeratin [11,12,13]. Pax2 is  down-regulated once nephrogenesis is complete, showing a  transient expression pattern [14].  Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical  problem. The recovery of renal tubular epithelium after AKI is  critical for the recovery of renal structure and function. It is still  not clear how quiescent TECs regain the potential to regenerate  and whether a group of specialized stem/progenitor cells play a  role during kidney repair [2,3,4]. Our previous study demonstrat-  ed that TECs could be induced to temporarily re-express Pax2  during chronic kidney injury [6], which suggested that mature  TECs could transform into an immature cell phenotype during  chronic kidney injury. We then proposed that a similar atavistic  transition might also occur during AKI.  In this study, we observed a transient Pax2 re-expression in  proximal tubular epithelium of IRI-induced AKI animals. Pax2  Figure 2. Pathology results of renal cortex sections. IRI groups showed remarkable changes on tubular structures detected by HE staining (A). Disrupted brush borders and flattened epithelia were observed at 24 h after IRI, which indicated apparent tubular damage. Epithelial cell proliferation changes were observed at 72 h after IRI. Tissue structures recovery were observed at 120 h after IRI (B). The pathology scores of the IRI groups significantly increased 24 h after IRI, and were sustained higher than sham operation groups 120 h after operation (*P,0.05, IRI compared with sham). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g002  Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563    was expressed during the recovery stage of AKI. Most Pax2  positive epithelial cells co-expressed a tubular injury marker, KIM-  1, indicating that Pax2 was primarily expressed in injured TECs.  These data suggest that Pax2 re-expression might have a  functional link with kidney epithelium injury and repair.  It remains to be shown which factors induce the transient re-  expression of Pax2 in TECs after IRI. Intrarenal Angiotensin II  (Ang II) is one of the most important injury factors in IRI-induced  AKI [15,16]. We verified a dramatic increase of intrarenal Ang II  after IRI by RIA. Ang II plays an important role during tubular  development and up-regulates Pax2 expression in fetal kidney  epithelial cells [17,18]. Thus, we hypothesized that Ang II might  also stimulate the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs. We then  used Ang II to simulate NRK-52E cells in vitro and verified that  Ang II could stimulate Pax2 expression in mature TECs in a time-  and dose-dependent manner. The expression of Pax2 in NRK-  52Es also showed a transient pattern, which is consistent with the  transient expression feature during tubular development.  During embryonic stage, the stimulatory effect of Ang II on  Pax2 is mediated by AT2R. Pax2 and AT2R share a similar  transient expression pattern during renal development, both of  them are down-regulated in TECs when nephrogenesis is  completed [17,19,20]. Interestingly, AT2R is also up-regulated  in TECs after kidney injury [21,22]. In fetal kidney epithelial cells,  AT2R activates Pax2 via JAK2 pathway [18]. Therefore, we pre-  incubated NRK-52E cells before Ang II administration with  PD123319 (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor) to  investigate signaling mechanisms that mediate Ang II induced  Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells. We found that both AT2R  inhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor could block Ang II induced Pax2  expression in NRK-52E cells, indicating that the stimulatory effect  of Ang II on Pax2 expression in mature TECs is mediated by  AT2R-JAK2 pathway.  Renal Pax2 is down-regulated once nephrogenesis is complete  and is not normally expressed in mature TECs. We believe that  the re-expression of Pax2 in TECs is an initiating event of cell  atavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic and  cellular processes of tubular development. This process could  allow mature TECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/  progenitor cells. We provided evidence for this hypothesis by the  observation that a progenitor marker, CD24 [10],was transiently  expressed in Ang II induced NRK-52E cells shortly after the  expression of Pax2. This model could also be supported by a  previous study which showed that a mesenchymal cell marker,  vimentin, was expressed in the tubular epithelium during the  recovery stage of AKI[8].  Moreover, we found that both AT2R inhibitor (PD123319) and  JAK2 inhibitor (AG490) which could not only block Ang II  induced Pax2 expression, but CD24 expression as well in NRK-  52E cells. This result indicaed a regulative role of Pax2 on CD24  expression. We then used shRNA-mediated RNA interference of  Pax2 to further determine the relationship between Pax2 and  CD24 in NRK-52E cells induced by Ang II. We found that  knockdown of Pax2 expression resulted in an apparent suppress of  Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells. These data  demonstrate that CD24 is regulated by Pax2 in NRK-52E cells  stimulated with Ang II.  In summary, our findings demonstrated that mature TECs can  undergo an atavistic transition under the induction of acute injury  factors such as Ang II. This atavistic transition allows mature  TECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/progenitor cells, which  could re-differentiate into TECs to restore tissue structure. Pax2  might play a central part in this process. Currently, exogenous  stem cells used for AKI treatment are difficult to obtain and  extremely expensive. It is very likely that enhancing the atavistic  transition of surviving TECs could be more effective than injecting  Figure 3. Pax2 expressions in renal cortex detected by RT-PCR and western blot. The mRNA (A) and protein (B) levels of Pax2 in renal cortex were detected via RT-PCR and western blot.

That might have important implications for  further understanding of AKI treatment.  Materials and Methods  Animals and experimental model of AKI The animal experiment was approved by the Medical Ethics  Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen  University. All animal experimental studies were conducted in  accordance with the National Guidelines of Laboratory Animal  use and Care in China. Male Wistar rats weighing 250 g to 300 g  were obtained from the Experiment Animal Center of Sun Yat-sen  University. Animals were maintained at a controlled temperature  of 2262uC with a 12 to 12 h light/dark cycle, with free access to food and water.  Animals were randomly divided into 12 groups of 6 animals per  group. 6 groups received IRI operation and 6 groups received  sham operation without IRI induction.  Figure 4. IHC detection of Pax2 in renal cortex. IHC detection showed that Pax2 was expressed in the nuclei of proximal TECs in the IRI groups 24-96 h after IRI (A). The sham operation group did not show Pax2 expression in proximal tubules.

Renal ischemia was  induced by clamping both renal arteries with microserrefines.  The clamps were removed after 45 min to re-establish blood flow  in order to mimic the reperfusion injury. Sham operation groups  received surgery without IRI induction. The body temperature  was monitored with a rectal probe and maintained at 37uC during the entire procedure by surrounding the animals with 37uC water bags. The blood glucose levels and heart rate were measured  before, during, and after the operation. After surgery, the incisions  were sutured and rats were maintained in separated cages with  free access to food and water.  Each group of rats was anesthetized with chloral hydrate at  0,24, 48, 72, 96, 120 h after operation. Blood samples were  obtained by aspiration from abdominal vein. Blood ureanitrogen  (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) levels were measured by a HITACHI  7170A Analyzer (HITACHI). The kidneys were removed and the  renal cortex parts were separated for the subsequent experiments.  The animals were then sacrificed by injecting overdose of chloral  hydrate and potassium chloride.  Animals that did not show renal pathology changes or died after  operation were excluded from the experimental groups.  Histological studies The cortex parts of kidneys were fixed in 10% neutral buffered  formalin and embedded in paraffin; 2 mm thick sections were cut on a microtome (Rotationsmikrotom 3455 Leitz; Lecica), and  hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was carried out to document the  histological damage. Histological changes were examined via light  microscopy in a blinded fashion according to the Pallers standard  [23].  The immunohistochemical (IHC) studies were performed using  an indirect immunoperoxidase technique: 4 mm thick sections were cut from the cortex sections of kidneys embedded in paraffin.  Figure 5.

Cells incubated in serum free medium only  were used as normal control. For immunofluorescence analysis,  cells were treated similarly in 6 wells plates containing coverslips.  For signaling pathways study, cells were incubated with  10 26  mol/L AT2R blocker PD123319 or 10 26  mol/L JAK2  blocker AG490 for 10 min before Ang II (10 29  mol/L) admin-  istration. Cells incubated in serum free medium only were used as  normal control. Cells incubated with Ang II (10 29  mol/L) without  blockers were used as positive control. Cells were harvest at 1 h  (for Pax2 RT-PCR), 2 h (for Pax2 western blot) and 4 h (for CD24  RT-PCR and western blot) after incubation.  Immunofluorescence analysis For the indirect immunofluorescence analysis, cells grown on  coverslips were fixed with 4% para-formaldehyde for 20 min,  followed by permeabilizing with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min  (For Pax2 detection). After blocking in 3% bovine serum albumin  (BSA), cells were probed with each antibody as indicated. The  following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-rat Pax2 polyclonal  antibody (1:400, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-rat CD24 polyclonal  antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz) and FITC-labeled anti-rabbit  secondary antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) [25].  The immunofluorescence images were recorded with a fluores-  cence microscope (Nikon 80i Microscope).  Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's  protocol using Trizol Reagent (TaKaRa). The reverse transcrip-  tion was performed using a ReverTra Ace-a cDNA Synthesis Kit  Figure 9. Ang II stimulates CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells. The RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) data showed that 1029 mol/L of Ang II could stimulate CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells shortly after the expression of Pax2; Ang II induced CD24 expression was started from 1 h post exposure, reached a peak at 4 h and began to disappear at 6 h (*P,0.05, compared with Time = 0 h). (C) Immunofluorescence analyses showed that CD24 was expressed at the surface of NRK-52E cells. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g009  Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563    (TOYOBO). PCR was performed in a 50 ml volume with TaKaRa PCR Kit (TaKaRa). The primers used for PCR are  listed below: For Pax2, the forward primer was 5'-AACGGTGA-  GAAGAGGAAACG-3 and the reverse primer was 5'-GGAA-  GACATCGGGATAGGAA-3\u2018 (244 bp). For CD24, the forward  primer was 5'-TCAAAAGTCACAACGGCAA-3' and the reverse  primer was 5'- TCCAGTCCTCACATCCCAA-3' (257 bp). For  b-actin, the forward primer was 5'-GCCCATCTATGAGGGT- TAC-3' and the reverse primer was 5'-CTGGAAGGT GGA-  CAGTGAG-3' (570 bp).  The reactions were initially heated to 95 uC for 3 min and then subjected to 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 uC, 30 s at 55uC, 30 s at 72 uC,  Figure 10. PD123319 and AG490 block Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells. NRK-52E cells were pretreated with PD123319 (1026 mol/L) and the AG490 (1026 mol/L) for 10 min before Ang II (1029 mol/L) administration. Cells were harvest at 4 h post exposure for RT-PCR and western blot assays. Results of RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) showed that both the AT2R blocker PD123319 and JAK2 blocker AG490 could block the stimulatory effect of Ang II on CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells (*P,0.05). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g010  Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563    and a final extension at 72uC for 10 min in a PCR Detection System (ABI 9700). The PCR products were separated by  electrophoresis in 1.5% agarose gel.  Western blot analysis For western blot analysis, tissue samples were homogenized and  sonicated prior to lysis. Cells and tissue samples were lysed for 1 h  in a RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl,  1% NP-40,) in the presence of 1 ml/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF). The lysed samples were centrifuged at  15,000 rpm for 20 min and boiled for 10 min. Protein concen-  trations were measured with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime).  Protein samples were separated via sodium dodecyl sulfate-  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrotrans-  Figure 11. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Ang II induced Pax2 in NRK52E cells. NRK-52E cells were transfected with Pax2 shRNA or emptily plasmid by lipofection method before Ang II administration. RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) data demonstrated that the transfection of NRK-52E cells with Pax2 shRNA resulted in a significant decrease in Ang II induced Pax2 expression. The repression rate was 74.368.2% as judged by western blot (*P,0.05). Transfection with emptily plasmid vector pGenesil-1 failed to reduce Pax2 expression. The effect of Pax2 shRNA was specific in that it failed to knock down the expression of unrelated protein b-actin. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g011  Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563    ferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane  (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The PVDF membranes were  blocked with TBST buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM  NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk for 0.5 h.  After washing with TBST, the membranes were probed with each  antibody as indicated. The following antibodies were used; rabbit  anti-rat Pax2 polyclonal antibody (1:400, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-  rat CD24 polyclonal antibody (1:200, Santa Cruz), anti-mouse  IgG and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:1000, Cell  signaling technology). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized  using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Forevergen).  Triple replicates were performed for each experiment. The  following antibodies were used: mouse anti-rat b-actin polyclonal antibody.  RNA interference (RNAi) experiments A previously designed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) pshRNA-  Pax2-983 were used for the knockdown of Pax2 [6]. The sequence  Figure 12. Knockdown of Pax2 suppressed Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK52E cells. NRK-52E cells were transfected with Pax2 shRNA or emptily plasmid before Ang II administration. Cells were harvest at 4 h post exposure. RT-PCR (A) and western blot (B) results showed that knockdown of Pax2 significantly suppressed Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells, while transfection with emptily plasmid pGenesil-1 did not affect CD24 expression. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g012  Cell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial Cells  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563    of pshRNA-Pax2-983 is 5'-GATCCGTGTGTCAGGCACACA-  GACGTTCAAGACG CGTCTGTGTGCCTGACA-  CATTTTTTGTCGACA-3', which targeting at the 983-1002  bp of Pax2 coding region. The shRNA were sub-cloned into  pGenesil-1 expression vector for transfection. The emptily vector  pGenesil-1 was used as vector control. The plasmids were  amplified and purified by Wuhan cell marker biotechnology  Co., Ltd (Wuhan, China)  The RNAi experiment was conducted as previously de-  scribed[6]. Briefly, cells were seeded 1 day before transfection at  a density of 26106 cells/ml onto 35-mm plates in 2 ml of complete medium (DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS). Cells were divided into 4  groups: Group A, serum-free medium alone; group B, Ang II  (10 29  mol/L) stimulated; group C, shRNA and Ang II (transfected  with pshRNA-Pax2-983 and stimulated with 10 29  mol/L of Ang  II); group D, empty vector control (transfected with pGenesil-1  and stimulated with 10 2  mol/L of Ang II).  Plasmid transfection was performed according to the protocol  by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). All cells were cultured in  complete medium for 24 h after 4 h of transfection. Cells were  then synchronized in serum-free medium fot 12 h. After that, cells  in groups B, C and D were treated with 10 29  mol/L of Ang II and  cells in group A were treated with serum-free medium alone. Cells  were harvested at different time points for further experiments (1 h  for RT-PCR of Pax2, 2 h for western blot of Pax2, 4 h for RT-  PCR and western blot of CD24).  Statistical Analyses The data were expressed as Mean6SEM. The differences  between groups were assessed by Student's t test. A p value , 0.05  was considered significant.
