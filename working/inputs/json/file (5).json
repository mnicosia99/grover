Since drugs can have off-target effects, we studied the effects of AR deletion on the development and molecular abnormalities that contribute to diabetic retinopathy. Since recent data suggests an important role for leukocytes in the development of the retinopathy, we determined also if AR in leukocytes contributes to leukocyte- mediated death of retinal endothelial cells in diabetes.  Methods: Wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) and AR deficient (AR2/2) mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin. Mice were sacrificed at 2 and 10 months of diabetes to evaluate retinal vascular histopathology, to quantify retinal superoxide production and biochemical and physiological abnormalities in the retina, and to assess the number of retinal endothelial cells killed by blood leukocytes in a co-culture system.  Results: Diabetes in WT mice developed the expected degeneration of retinal capillaries, and increased generation of superoxide by the retina. Leukocytes from diabetic WT mice also killed more retinal endothelial cells than did leukocytes from nondiabetic animals (p,0.0001). Deletion of AR largely (P,0.05) inhibited the diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal capillaries, as well as the increase in superoxide production by retina. AR-deficiency significantly inhibited the diabetes-induced increase in expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in retina, but had no significant effect on expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), phosphorylated p38 MAPK, or killing of retinal endothelial cells by leukocytes.  Conclusions: AR contributes to the degeneration of retinal capillaries in diabetic mice. Deletion of the enzyme inhibits the diabetes-induced increase in expression of iNOS and of superoxide production, but does not correct a variety of other pro- inflammatory abnormalities associated with the development of diabetic retinopathy.

Hyperglycemia clearly initiates the disease process, but which of  the sequelae of hyperglycemia are causal in development of the  retinopathy is not clear.  Activation of aldose reductase (AR) by elevated glucose was one  of the first biochemical mechanisms postulated to explain the  pathogenesis of diabetic complications [1]. Particularly with  regard to cataractogenesis, evidence suggested that pathology  occurred as a result of osmotic consequences of AR-mediated  reduction of glucose to its polyol, sorbitol [2]. Since then, AR has  been found also to regulate a variety of additional abnormalities  (including oxidative stress and inflammation) that have been  implicated in the pathogenesis of various complications of diabetes  [3-5] and other diseases [6-16].  Efforts to inhibit this pathway to inhibit diabetic retinopathy in  patients have relied heavily on pharmacologic inhibitors of the  enzyme [17]. Nevertheless, results of these studies with regard to  the retinopathy have been inconsistent and controversial. Some  studies of diabetic or galactosemic rodents or dogs showed  beneficial effects of AR inhibitors on lesions of the retinpathy  [18-23], whereas no significant effects were detected in clinical  studies in patients and other studies of diabetic and galactosemic  dogs and rodents [24-27]. Possibilities that have been discussed to  explain the lack of agreement among studies include differences in  the degree of inhibition of AR, the presence of isoforms of the  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62081    enzyme that respond differently to therapies, genetic differences  among individuals, and possible off-target effects of the different  AR inhibitors [17].  Generation of animals that are totally deficient in AR is one way  to overcome the shortcomings associated with the use of  pharmacologic inhibitors of AR. Moreover, AR 2/2  animals allow  the opportunity to investigate the molecular pathways by which  AR acts in hyperglycemia. Thus, the availability of AR 2/2  animals makes it worthwhile to revisit this topic. In the present  study, we investigated the effect of AR deficiency on diabetes-  induced degeneration of retinal capillaries in early diabetic  retinopathy, and on diabetes-induced pro-inflammatory and pro-  oxidant changes in the retina.  Research Design and Methods  Experimental Animals AR  2/2 mice were prepared [28] and backcrossed with C57BL/  6 mice for seven generations. Male C57Bl/6J mice and AR 2/2  mice were randomly assigned to become diabetic or remain as  nondiabetic group. Diabetes was induced by 5 sequential daily  intraperitoneal injections of a freshly prepared solution of  streptozotocin in citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at 45 mg/kg of body  weight. Insulin was given as needed to prevent weight loss without  preventing hyperglycemia and glucosuria (0-0.2 units of NPH  insulin subcutaneously, 0-3 times per week). Glycohemoglobin  (GHb) was measured by Bio-Rad Total Glycated Hemoglobin  Assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA) every 2-  3 mos and just before animals were sacrificed. Food consumption  and body weight were measured weekly. Animals were studied for  durations of 10 months or 2 months of diabetes in order to  investigate effects of the therapy on retinal histopathology, or  molecular and physiologic changes, respectively. These durations  were chosen because 2 mos diabetes has been found to result in  numerous metabolic alterations which precede (and likely  contribute to) the later appearance of vascular histopathology,  and 10 mos duration of diabetes has been shown to have  developed robust vascular histopathology characteristic of the  early stages of the retinopathy.  Ethics Statement Treatment of animals conformed to the ARVO Resolution on  Treatment of Animals in Research, as well as to institutional  guidelines (Case Western Reserve University IACUC # 2010- 0156).  Retinal histopathology. After 10 months of diabetes, one  retina was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, washed in running  water overnight, and digested in elastase (Calbiochem,  Cat#324682) buffer (40 unit/ml elastase in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (containing 150 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM  ethylenediamene tetraacetic acid (EDTA; pH 6.5) in an agitating  water bath at 37u for 1K h [29]. Then, retinas were washed overnight in 100 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.5) at room temperature,  and cleaning was finished the next day. When totally cleaned of  neural cells, the isolated vasculature was laid out on a glass  microscope slide, dried overnight, stained with hematoxylin and  periodic acid-Schiff, dehydrated and coverslipped. Degenerate  (acellular) capillaries were quantitated in 6-7 field areas corre-  sponding to the mid-retina in a masked manner. Acellular  capillaries were identified as capillary-sized vessel tubes having  no nuclei anywhere along their length, and were reported per  square millimeter of retinal area.  Superoxide Measurement At 2 months of diabetes, fresh retinas from animals were  analyzed for superoxide production as previously described  [30,31]. Briefly, whole retinas were placed in 0.2 ml Krebs/Hepes  buffer and allowed to equilibrate in the dark for 30 mins at 37uC under 5% CO2. To each tube, 0.5 mM lucigenin (Sigma  Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) was added, and photon  emission was detected over the following 10 min using a  luminometer. Retinal protein was quantified per samples (Bio-  Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA) and luminescence was  expressed per milligram protein.  Western Blots At 2 months of diabetes, retinal homogenates separated by  SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad  Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked  in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat  milk., washed, and were incubated with anti-rat ICAM-1 (1:2000  dilution; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-rat iNOS (1:1000  dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-rat  nitrotyrosine (1;1000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Bill-  erca, MA), anti-rat p38 MAPK and p-p38 MAPK (1;1000  dilution; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA) for  2 hrs, and then stained with respective horseradish peroxidase  coupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules,  CA) at a dilution of 1:3000 for 1 hr. After extensive washing,  immunostaining detected by the antibodies was visualized by  enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,  Santa Cruz, CA). The protein levels were quantitated relative to \u00df-  actin-loading control (1:3000 dilution, Abcam, Inc., Cambridge,  MA) in the same samples. Results are expressed as a percent of  values detected in the nondiabetic controls. Protein was quantified  with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc;  Hercules, CA).  Reduced glutathione (GSH) At 2 months of diabetes, tissues of interest were homogenized in  0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM EDTA. After  centrifugation, a quantity of the resulting supernatant was  removed for storage at 280uC for subsequent protein determina- tion by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay method (Pierce  Biotechnology, Inc.). GSH determinations were carried out on the  freshly prepared tissue extract following the fluorometric method  described previously [32]. Fluorometric measurements were  carried out using a Biotek Synergy4 microplate reader and data  fitted by linear regression to a standard curve generated using  purified GSH as a quantitation standard. In all cases, analytes  were measured in triplicate.  Co-culture A mouse retinal endothelial cell line (mREC; generated from  Immortomice [33]) was grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS  and 5.5 or 25 mM glucose. Cells were cultured at 37uC in 5% CO2 and 95% air, and the media was changed every other day for  5 days. When mRECs were 80% confluent (app 500,000 cells),  leukocytes (100,000; purified from blood with RBC lysis buffer)  from male C57Bl/6J mice and AR 2/2  mice groups were added to  the mREC and incubated for 24 hrs. After incubation, the  leukocytes were carefully removed by gentle washing, and viability  of remaining retinal endothelial cells was measured by trypan blue  extrusion. Briefly, an aliquot of the endothelial cell suspension was  diluted 1:1 (vol/vol) with 0.1% trypan blue, and the cells were  counted with a hemocytometer. Cell death was reported as the  Aldose Reductase and Early Diabetic Retinopathy  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62081    percentage of blue-stained cells (dead cells) of the total number of  cells. Approximately 200-400 cells were counted in each sample.  Statistical analyses Data are expressed as mean 6 SD. Statistical analysis was  performed using ANOVA, followed by Fischer's test. A value of  p,0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results  Animals Diabetic mice were hyperglycemic over the entire duration of  the 10 month experiment, and failed to gain weight at normal rate.  Serum glucose levels of the diabetic groups (356658 mg/dl and  344662 in in wildtype and AR 2/2  groups, respectively) were all  significantly greater than nondiabetic values (132-137 mg/dl).  The degree of hyperglycemia, as denoted by glycated hemoglobin,  did not vary among diabetic mice (wild-type, 10.1%61.0 ;  AR 2/2  , 10.2%61.1 respectively), and was significantly greater in  diabetic groups as compared with the corresponding nondiabetic  groups (wildtype, 3.060.2; AR 2/2  2.960.3). Body weight at 10  months of diabetes averaged 28 g61in the wildtype group and  27 g62 in AR 2/2  group, and these values were about half of  those in nondiabetic mice of each group (51-60 g). Data from the  2 month experiment was similar (not shown). Deletion of AR had  no apparent effect on glycemia or health of any animals. Cross-  sections of retina in nondiabetic animals (12 mos of age) indicated  that deletion of AR had no significant effects on retinal thickness  or retinal architecture, and no effect on vascular density in  nondiabetic animals.  Inhibition of diabetes-induced retinal histopathology by AR deletion  Wild-type diabetics developed the expected increase in numbers  of degenerate retinal capillaries by 10 mos of study (p,0.0001). In  contrast, retinas from AR 2/2  diabetic animals exhibited signifi-  cantly fewer diabetes-induced acellular capillaries (Figure 1).  Nondiabetic AR 2/2  mice showed a normal retinal vasculature  pattern. Diabetes of 10 mos duration did not cause a significant  decrease in the number of cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer in  these C57Bl/6 mice (not shown), so we could not assess any effect  of the AR deletion on neurodegeneration.  In an effort to investigate the mechanism by which the AR  deletion mediated the beneficial effect on degeneration of retinal  capillaries in diabetes, we measured several parameters related  especially to inflammation and nitrative (oxidative) stress, these  being physiologic and molecular abnormalities that have been  found in other studies to be associated with (and possibly causally  related to) the development of the early stages of diabetic  retinopathy.  Oxidative stress Oxidative stress was evaluated in the present study by  measuring superoxide generation by the freshly isolated retina.  Diabetes significantly increased retinal superoxide production by  almost two-fold (Figure 2a), whereas retinas from AR 2/2  mice  were totally protected from diabetes-induced increase in superox-  ide production (p,0.0001). In contrast, retinal GSH tended to be  subnormal in wild-type diabetics, but deletion of AR had little  effect on this diabetes-induced reduction (Figure 2b). The  accumulation of nitrotyrosine, a marker of nitrative stress, tended  to be greater than normal in wild-type diabetic animals and tended  to be inhibited in the absence of AR, but the results were not  statistically significant (Figure 2c).  Pro- inflammatory proteins Expression of iNOS and ICAM-1 in whole retina were  significantly increased by diabetes compared to that of wildtype  nondiabetic animals (both p,0.05), but deletion of AR inhibited  the diabetes-induced enzyme induction only for iNOS (Figure 3).  The expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, and activity of  poly-ADP ribose synthase (PARS) tended to be greater than  normal in wild-type diabetic animals, but the increases were not  statistical significant and deletion of AR had no apparent effect  (not shown).  Endothelial cells killed by white blood cells Previous studies have demonstrated an important role of  leukocytes in development of early stages of diabetic retinopathy  [34,35]. To investigate if white blood cells might contribute to the  AR-mediated degeneration of retinal capillaries in diabetes, mouse  retinal endothelial cells (mREC) were incubated with peripheral  blood leukocytes from non-diabetic or diabetic mice. After 24 hrs  of co-culture, the number of endothelial cells killed by leukocytes  from wild-type diabetic mice was significantly greater than those  killed by incubation with leukocytes from nondiabetic wild-type  mice (1.7 fold increase; p,0.05; Figure 4). In contrast, leukocytes  from diabetic animals lacking AR killed fewer endothelial cells  than did leukocytes from wild-type diabetics, but this decrease did  not achieve statistical significance.  Discussion  AR and the polyol pathway were among the first molecular  mechanisms considered to explain how hyperglycemia initiates  diabetic retinopathy and other complications of diabetes. At that  time, AR was regarded as the enzyme responsible for the  reduction of glucose into sorbitol, a molecule that penetrates  poorly through cell membranes, thus leading to cellular damage  via the \u2018\u2018osmotic hypothesis'' [2]. In an effort to further investigate  the role of AR in these complications, a number of pharmacologic  inhibitors of the enzyme were developed. Since then, research on  this pathway has expanded beyond the initial hypothesis, but  results using pharmacologic inhibitors of AR in clinical (and some  pre-clinical) studies of diabetic retinopathy have been disappoint-  ing. Whether this was due to inadequacies of the pharmacologic  Figure 1. Diabetes (SD) of 10 months duration significantly increased degeneration of retinal capillaries in wildtype (WT) animals compared to nondiabetic (ND) animals. Deletion of AR significantly, but only partially, inhibited the diabetes-induced vascular degeneration (n = 7 per group). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062081.g001  Aldose Reductase and Early Diabetic Retinopathy  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62081    inhibitors, limited penetration of target tissues, or unfavorable  pharmacokinetic characteristics has remained unclear.  Use of AR inhibitors revealed a variety of diabetes-induced  alterations in retinal metabolism that could be manipulated. AR  inhibitors were reported to inhibit diabetes-induced abnormalities  in oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the retina  [5,36,37,38,39]. Recent studies using pharmacologic inhibitors of  AR found anti-inflammatory actions even in the absence of  Figure 2. Effects of 2 mos diabetes and AR2/2 on retinal oxidative stress. (a) Retinas from diabetic WT mice generated significantly more superoxide than nondiabetic WT mice, and the diabetes-induced superoxide generation was inhibited by deletion of AR. Reduced glutathione (GSH) (b) tended to become subnormal, and nitrotyrosine (c) tended to become increased in diabetes, but these changes were not statistically significant, and were not corrected in AR2/2 mice. n = 4-6 per experimental group. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062081.g002  Figure 3. Diabetes (2 month duration) increased expression of (a) iNOS and (b) ICAM-1 in retina. Deletion of AR inhibited the diabetes- induced increase in iNOS, but had no effect on ICAM-1 expression. n = 4-6 per experimental group. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062081.g003  Aldose Reductase and Early Diabetic Retinopathy  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62081    hyperglycemia [3,6,11-16,40-43]. Thus, it is unclear whether the  observed effects of AR inhibitors are really mediated via  hyperglycemia-induced activation of polyol pathway activity or  alternatively via other mechanisms possibly unrelated to glucose  metabolism (such as metabolism of lipid-derived aldehydes and  retinoids by AR and closely-related aldo-keto reductases [44,45]).  To avoid potential uncertainties associated with pharmacologic  inhibitors, mice genetically lacking AR were generated [28,46].  Initial studies of db/db mice deficient in AR suggested that AR  contributed to the diabetes-induced abnormalities in the retina,  including breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, loss of pericytes,  and even an effect on neovascularization was claimed. The present  results using C57Bl/6 mice that are deficient in AR demonstrated  that this genetic modification substantially (but not totally)  inhibited the diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal capillaries,  and totally inhibited superoxide generation by the retina in  diabetes. Consistent with most other studies of diabetic mice,  however, no retinal neovascularization was observed. Unlike  studies using pharmacologic inhibitor, genetic deletion of AR had  no significant effect on retinal GSH levels in diabetes in the  present study. Consistent with this, reported inhibition of diabetes-  induced defects in electroretinogram using pharmacologic inhib-  itors [47-49] was not confirmed using AR 2/2  mice studied by us  [50], raising a possibility that some of the observed effects of AR  inhibitors were due to off-target effects. In addition, the differences  could be secondary to metabolic pathways induced in response to  the deletion of AR, thus altering the retinal environment. Deletion  of AR also inhibited the diabetes-induced increase in expression of  iNOS but not ICAM-1, which is interesting because both are  regulated by NF-kB, and both have been shown to be strongly related to the capillary degeneration occurring in retinas of  diabetic animals [51,52]. Inasmuch as superoxide and iNOS-  generated NO can lead to the generation of nitrotyrosine on  proteins [53,54], it is surprising that AR deletion inhibited both  superoxide and iNOS expression in diabetic mice, yet did not  correct nitrotyrosine. This finding needs to be confirmed with  additional animals.  It has been assumed by many that the molecular abnormalities  contributing to vascular pathology in diabetic retinopathy are  present in vascular cells themselves. In vitro studies have indicated  effects of AR within endothelial cells [35,54,55. Recent evidence  indicating that leukocytes play a critical role in the capillary  degeneration [Li, 2012 #6144], however, led us to test the possibility that AR present in leukocytes might contribute to the  capillary cell death. Our in vitro studies compared leukocyte-  mediated killing of retinal endothelial cells by leukocytes having,  and not having, AR. These results suggest that AR contributes  only little to the hyperglycemia-induced killing of endothelial cells  by leukocytes, suggesting that the beneficial effect of AR deletion  might in fact be within cells of the retina itself.  Our results utilizing AR mutant mice, together with results from  other investigators using a similar approach [46], demonstrate that  AR contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular pathology of early  diabetic retinal disease in mice. Surprisingly, the AR knockout did  not inhibit several diabetes-induced molecular abnormalities that  previously have been found to contribute to the retinopathy  [51,56], suggesting that multiple molecular pathways contribute to  the vascular lesions of the retinopathy in mice. Perhaps the relative  contributions of these various pathways differs among species, and  these differences among species contributed to the lack of  significant effect of AR inhibitors in diabetic dogs [25] or patients  [24], in contrast to more positive effects in rodents. In the absence  of information as to which pathways predominate in the  development of retinopathy in diabetic humans, future strategies  probably will benefit from targeting of multiple pathways that each  partially contribute to the pathogenesis of the retinopathy.
