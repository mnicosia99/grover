    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

  Epigenetic Regulation of Cardiac Progenitor Cells Marker c-kit by Stromal Cell Derived Factor-1a Zhongpu Chen, Xiaodong Pan, Yuyu Yao, Fengdi Yan, Long Chen, Rong Huang, Genshan Ma*  Department of Cardiology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China  Abstract  Background: Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have been proven suitable for stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction, especially c-kit(+)CPCs. CPCs marker c-kit and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), are linked as c-kit/SCF axis, which is associated with the functions of proliferation and differentiation. In our previous study, we found that stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) could enhance the expression of c-kit. However, the mechanism is unknown.  Methods and Results: CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts, c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs were separated by magnetic beads. The cells were cultured with SDF-1a and CXCR4-selective antagonist AMD3100, and c-kit expression was measured by qPCR and Western blotting. Results showed that SDF-1a could enhance c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs, made c- kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, and AMD3100 could inhibit the function of SDF-1a. After the intervention of SDF-1a and AMD3100, proliferation and migration of CPCs were measured by CCK-8 and transwell assay. Results showed that SDF-1a could enhance the proliferation and migration of both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs, and AMD3100 could inhibit these functions. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA were measured by qPCR, DNMT activity was measured using the DNMT activity assay kit, and DNA methylation was analyzed using Sequenom's MassARRAY platform, after the CPCs were cultured with SDF-1a. The results showed that SDF-1a stimulation inhibited the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, which are critical for the maintenance of regional DNA methylation. Global DNMT activity was also inhibited by SDF-1a. Lastly, SDF-1a treatment led to significant demethylation in both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs.  Conclusions: SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene.

In 2003, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) were first  reported to reside in the adult heart [1-3]. Resident CPCs may  be particularly suitble for resurrecting dead myocardium because  they are endogenous components of the adult heart and appear to  be respnsible for the physiological and pathological turnover of  cardiac myocytes and other cardiac cells. The heart have several  populations of CPCs, which are self-renewing, clonogenic, multi-  potent and have the ability to proliferate and differentiate into  functional cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and other kinds of  cells [2,4-6]. Among these CPCs, c-kit(+)CPCs are especially suitable in cell therapy for the recovery of injured cardiomyocytes  [2,4]. c-kit(+)CPCs have the larger numbers than other types of CPCs, and have stronger proliferation and differentiation ability to  repair the injured myocardium [7].  c-kit is a proto-oncogene and a tyrosine kinase growth factor  receptor, expressed on several types of cells, including CPCs [8-  11], with the stem cell factor (SCF) as its ligand. c-kit expression is  related to the regulation of cell proliferation, and migration [12-  15]. Stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) is a member of the CXC chemokine family, and CXCR4 is its receptor, which are  expressed in a variety of cell types, including CPCs [16]. SDF-1a expression has been reported to increase after an acute myocardial  infarction [17]. SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could prompt stem cell homing to damaged cardiac tissue [16,18]. AMD3100 is a specific  antagonist to SDF-1a, which binds to CXCR4 competitively for preventing the combination of SDF-1a and CXCR4. Recent studies have indicated that SDF-1a/CXCR4 and c-kit/SCF axes are closely linked [19]. Our study found that SDF-1a could enhance c-kit expression. However, limited information is known  on the regulation of SDF-1a on c-kit. DNA methylation is one of the important research content of  epigenetics, which cytosine is methylated in a reaction catalyzed  by DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), with S-adenosyl methionine  (SAM) as a methyl donor [20]. In mammalian cells, three  DNMTs, namely, DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, are responsible for DNA methylation. DNMT1 is a maintenance  type methyltransferase, responsible for copying DNA methylation  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69134    patterns during DNA replication, whereas DNMT3a and DNMT3b are essential for de novo methylation [20-25]. DNA methylation is an important method in the regulatory mechanisms  of gene expression [20-29]. In several diseases such as cancer,  gene promoter CpG islands result in abnormal silencing [27-29].  A recent study has found that TGFb1 could regulate CD133 expression through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expressions, and subsequently, the demethylation of promoter-1  [30]. However, the influence of SDF-1a on the expression of c-kit by DNA methylation is unknown.  The present study demonstrates that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs  proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the  inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-  kit gene.  Materials and Methods  Ethics Statement All animal studies were carried out using a method approved  by the the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of the  Southeast University, and conform with the guidelines of the  National Research Council (approval ID: SYXK-2010.3908).  Isolation and culture of CPCs For the isolation and culture of CPCs in our laboratory [31],  CPCs were acquired from the hearts of two-month-old wild-type  male C57BL/6 mice (Yangzhou Laboratory Animal Center).  The hearts were acquired using a method approved by the Care  of Experimental Animals Committee of the Southeast University,  Nanjing, China (Laboratory Animal Center of Southeast  University). CPCs were isolated following the standard method  described previously. After one or two weeks of growth, a layer  of fibroblast-like cells were generated from the adherent  myocardial tissue. On these fibroblast-like cells, several small,  round, and phase-bright cells emerged, which were collected by  the digestion of accutase enzyme, which did not affect the cell  surface markers (at room temperature, under direct visualization,  for a maximum of 3 min). The obtained cells were separated by  magnetic-activated c-kit cell sorting magnetic beads (Miltenyi  Biotec Inc., GER) following the instructions of the manufactur-  ers. Cells were seeded at 26104 cells/ml on poly-D-lysine (Sigma, USA) coated dishes in cardiosphere growing medium  (CGM; 35% IMDM/65%DMEM-Ham's F-12 [Hyclone, USA]  mixture containing 10% fetal calf serum [Hyclone, USA],  2 mmol/L L-glutamine [Hyclone, USA], 0.1 mmol/L 2-mecrap-  toethanol [Sigma, USA], 2% B27 [Gibco, USA], 5 ng/ml basic  fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [R&D, USA], 10 ng/ml epider-  mal growth factor (EGF) [Peprotech, USA], 40 nmol/L cardio-  trophin-1 [Peprotech, USA], 1 unit/ml thrombin [Sigma, USA],  Figure 1.

Characterization of CPCs CPCs were characterized by phase-contrast microscopy that  evaluates morphology and flow cytometric analysis to examine the  expression of stem cell surface markers. In the flow cytometric  analysis, CPCs were trypsinized and re-suspended in phosphate  buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 3% FBS for 15 min. CPCs  were then labeled with PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse c-kit. FITC-  conjugated rat anti-mouse Sca-1 (BD Biosciences, USA) was  obtained at 4uC in a dark room for 30 min and then washed twice with cold PBS. Data were collected from 16105 cells on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) and analyzed  using the WinMDI software.  Quantitative real-time PCR Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA) was used to isolate total RNA  from cells, according to the instructions of the manufacturer.  First Strand cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using  the cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, CA), according to the  instructions manufacturer. The cDNA were stored at 220uC until use. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed  using IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA). qPCR  experiments were also performed using BIO-RAD MJ Mini  Opticon Real-Time PCR System, and the matching analysis  software was the BIO-RAD CFX Manager. Relative gene  expression levels were calculated by normalization to GAPDH.  Sequences of each primer were designed as follows: GAPDH  forward primer: CAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTG and  reverse primer: GTCCACCACC- CTGTTGCTGTAG, c-kit  forward primer: ACATCGCCAGAGCCAACG and reverse  primer: ATCCACTTTAATTTCGGGTCAA, DNMT1 forward  primer: GAGCCCA- GCAAAGAGTAT and reverse primer:  ATGGTAGAAGGAGGAACAG, DNMT3a forward primer: CTGTCCCATCCAGGCAGTAT and reverse primer;  CTTAGCGG- TGTCTTGGAAGC, DNMT3b forward primer: AGATGATGGGAATGGCTCTG and reverse primer:  TGCTGAAGATGATGCTCGAC.  Western blotting Western blotting was performed as described in the following  sentences. An equal amount of cell lysates (40 mg protein) was denatured in 26 SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed for 3 h at 20 mA on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated  proteins were then transferred into polyvinylidene difluoride  (PVDF) membranes blocked by TBST solution (10 mM Tris-  HCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20), containing 5%  nonfat dry milk for 4 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the  proteins were incubated with primary antibodies (Santa Cruz,  1:1000 dilution), and placed on a rocker at 4uC overnight. Afterward, the proteins were washed three times with TBST for  15 min, and mixed with IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz, 1:5000) for 2 h at  room temperature, which was also washed three times with TBST  for 15 min. GAPDH was used as loading control (Santa Cruz,  1:1000). The membranes were incubated in an enhanced  chemiluminescence detection system for 5 min, and imaged using  a five- minute exposure film. Protein expression was quantified by  scanning densitometry.  CPCs proliferation and migration Cell proliferation assay was performed using CCK-8 kit (cell  counting kit-8) (Dojido, Japan). According to the manufacture's  instruction, 5,106103 cells were seeded into 96-well culture plates. Adhesion was verified once (about 12 h later), the cells  were incubated with SDF-1a (100 ng/ml for 48 h, Sigma) and AMD3100 (5 mg/ml for 48 h, Sigma). Next, cells in each well were incubated with 10 ml of CCK-8 at 37uC for 2 h. Then the optical density (OD) for each well was measured at 450 nm using  a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Model 550, CA).  A cell migration assay was performed in 24-well Transwell  plates (8.0 mm, pore size) (Millipore, Billerica). The cells after intervented with SDF-1a and AMD3100 were seeded into the upper chamber of the transwell system at a concentration of  26104cells/well in 100 ml medium, and the lower chamber was filled with 100 ng/ml SCF (Sigma) in 600 ml medium. After 6 h of incubation at 37uC, 5% CO2, the upper sides of the filters were carefully washed with PBS, and cells remaining were  removed with a cotton wool swab. The cells that migrated to the  Figure 2. SDF-1a up-regulation on the expression of c-kit. (A) CPCs were stimulated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a and 5 mg/ml AMD3100 for 48 h.

Data were obtained from three independent experiments and expressed as mean 6 SD. n = 3. *P,0.05 versus the control group. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069134.g002  Epigenetic Regulation of c-kit  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69134    bottom side of the filter were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde  and stained using 0.1% crystal violet. The number of migrated  cells were manually counted in three random fields per filter at  6200 magnification by a phase contrast microscope.  Nuclear DNMT Activity Assay CPCs were stimulated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a for 48 h.  Nuclear protein was extracted using a nuclear extraction kit  (Epigentek, Brooklyn, NY), Approximately 5 mg of nuclear protein was applied for the DNMT activity assay, which was  performed using an EpiQuik DNMT activity assay kit (Epigen-  tek), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.  Bisulfite sequencing analysis Bisulfite treatment: Genomic DNA sodium bisulfate conver-  sion was performed using the EZ-96 DNA methylation kit (Zymo  Research). The instruction of the manufacturer was followed,  using 1 mg of genomic DNA and the alternative conversion method (a two-temperature DNA denaturation).  Methylation analysis: Quantitative methylation analysis was  carried out with Sequenom's MassARRAY platform, using  MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in combined with RNA base-  specific cleavage (MassCLEAVE). When feasible, amplicons were  designed to cover CpGs in the same region as the 59 untranslated  regions (59UTR). PCR primers were designed using Methprimer  (www.urogene.org/methprimer/). For each reverse primer, an  additional T7 promoter tag for in vivo transcription was added,  whereas a 10-meter tag on the forward primer was used to adjust  melting-temperature differences. MassCLEAVE biochemistry was  performed as described previously [32]. Mass spectra was acquired  by a MassARRAY Compact MALDI-TOF (Sequenom) and their  methylation ratios were generated using the Epityper software v1.0  (Sequenom).  Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (v 11.5, SPSS  Inc.). All values were presented as mean6SD. The differences  between the two groups were analyzed using the student's T-test.  All tests were two tailed and statistical significance was accepted  if P,0.05.  Figure 3.

After approximately  10 days of culture, a layer of fibroblast-like cells emerged from  adherent myocardial tissues, followed by small, round and phase-  bright cells (Figures 1A). The inverted phase-contrast microscope  examinations showed that CPCs presented clone-like proliferation  (Figure 1B). c-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs were characterized by flow cytometric analysis of the cell surface markers, namely, c-kit  and Sca-1 (Figure 1C and 1D).  SDF-1a up-regulates c-kit expression in CPCs C-kit-positive CPCs were divided into three groups, namely,  control, SDF-1a (treated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a for 48 h), and SDF-1a + AMD3100 groups (treated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a and 5 mg/ml AMD3100 for 48 h). The groups were analyzed using western blotting and qPCR to identify protein and mRNA  level. We found that SDF-1a could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit at both  protein and mRNA levels, whereas AMD3100 could inhibit this  function (Figures 2A and 2B).  SDF-1a enhances proliferation and migration of CPCs To determine whether SDF-1a will influence CPCs prolifera-  tion and migration toward SCF, we performed an in vitro CCK-8  assay and migration assay, and CPCs were placed under SDF-1a with or without the CXCR4 specific antagonist AMD3100. The  results indicated that c-kit(+)CPCs proliferation rates of SDF-1a group (0.16260.008 OD) increase significantly, compared with  that of control group (0.11460.002 OD) and SDF-  1a+AMD3100group (0.12560.003 OD), and c-kit(2) CPCs proliferation rates of SDF-1a group (0.13560.004 OD) increase significantly, compared with that of control group (0.06360.004  OD) and SDF-1a+AMD3100group (0.08060.006 OD) (Figure 3A). And c-kit(+)CPCs migration rates of SDF-1a group (SCF+SDF-1a) (602.3620.0 cells) also increase significantly, compared with that of control group (with SCF, without SDF-  1a) (85.0611.8 cells), and inhibition group (with SCF+SDF- 1a+AMD3100) (138.7614.6 cells), and c-kit(-)CPCs migration rates of SDF-1a group (SCF+SDF-1a) (272.0650.7 cells) also increase signicantly, compared with that of control group (with  SCF, without SDF-1a) (37.065.0 cells), and inhibition group (with  Figure 4.

(n = 3, mean6SD, P,0.05).  SDF-1a inhibits DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression CPCs were divided into three groups, namely, control, SDF-  1+AMD3100 and SDF-1a groups to examine whether DNMT regulates c-kit expression through methylation of the promoter.  DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b expression was examined in each group. The results showed that DNMT expression, include  DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, was significantly higher in c- kit(2)CPCs compared to c-kit(+)CPCs, and SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 was able to reduce the DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression (Figures 4A, 4B and 4C). Subsequently, global DNMT  activity in c-kit(+)CPCs nuclei was significantly reduced, from  0.3360.02 mmol/hr/mg in the untreated cells to 0.1060.03 mmol/ hr/mg, and SDF-1a+AMD3100 group was 0.2660.15 mmol/ hr/mg, while, in c-kit(2)CPCs, from 0.7260.04 mmol/hr/mg in the untreated cells to 0.4760.04 mmol/hr/mg, and SDF- 1a+AMD3100 group was 0.6660.03 mmol/hr/mg (n = 3, mean6SD, P,0.05) (Figure 4D).  SDF-1a induces demethylation of c-kit promoter With the suppression of DNMT mRNA expression and activity  by SDF-1a, we investigated whether SDF-1a induces c-kit expression through promoter demethylation.

CPCs were  then divided into two groups, namely, control and SDF-1a groups. Genomic DNA was extracted and subjected to Bisulfite sequencing  analysis. We found that SDF-1a could significantly reduce the methylation percentage of c-kit(+)CPCs in five out of seven, and all of seven for c-kit(2)CPCs, analyzed CpG sites after incubation.  (Figures 5A and 5B).  Discussion  The key findings in our study are listed as follows: (1) An  adequate amount of CPCs could be obtained from adult mouse  heart tissue using enzymatic digestion, and c-kit(+)CPCs and c- kit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting,  (2) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+) CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, this regulation could be suppressed by ADM3100, an  inhibitor of SDF-1a, (3) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could enhance the proliferation and migration abilities of CPCs, and  these fuctions could be suppressed by AMD3100, (4)SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulated c-kit expression  through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and global DNMT activity, as well as through subsequent  demethylation of the c-kit gene.  In regenerating the functional cardiac tissue, stem cell therapy is  an effective method for the recovery of the injured myocardium.  We selected CPCs because of their incomparable cardiac  regenerative capacity [33-34]. Presently, CPCs are based exclu-  sively on the expression of a stem cell-related surface antigen,  namely, c-kit and Sca-1. CPCs are multipotent, self-renewing, and  clonogenic, which have the ability to transform cardiomyocytes in  normal, as well as in aging and diseased hearts. CPCs apparently  have a mixture of different subpopulations. Among these CPCs, c-  kit(+)CPCs showed better cardiac repair capability thus are considered as the most suitable cells for myocardial regeneration  therapies [35]. Hence, in this study, we selected the marker, c-kit,  as the identification index of CPCs, as observed in the heart. Our  study verified that, an adequate amount of CPCs could be  acquired from an adult mouse heart through enzymatic digestion,  c-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic- activated cell sorting. CPCs within 10 generations, which we had  actually examined for c-kit expression, were used for these  experiments. Researches showed that c-kit (+)CPCs could be passaged to the 40 generation, and still had kept the stem cell  surface markers [36].  c-kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase factor receptor. Its  ligand, SCF, is an early hemopoietic growth factor. c-kit/SCF axis  supports the proliferation and migration of multiple hemopoietic  lineages [37-39]. SDF-1a belongs to the CXC subfamily, which has the ability to facilitate the transmigration of hematopoietic  cells through endothelial cell barriers [40]. CXCR4 is its receptor,  a seven- transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. SDF-1a expression is aimed to protect against myocardial ischemic injury  [41], which is critical in progenitor cell tissue retention, trafficking,  and homing [42]. SDF-1a expression has been shown to enhance the survival of progenitor cells in several stimuli such as in  ischemia/reperfusion injury [43-44], serum withdrawal and  apoptotic cell death, through interaction with CXCR4 [45].  AMD3100 is a specific antagonist to SDF-1a, which competitively binds to CXCR4 to prevent the combination of SDF-1a and CXCR4, effectively blocking.90% of binding SDF-1a [46]. A recent study showed that AMD3100 with the concentration of  5 mg/ml could efficiently prevent the SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis [47]. In our study, we found that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could  up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c- kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation  and migration abilities improvement. Research showed  VEGFMSCs could induced SDF-1a and CXCR4 expression, and promoted CSCs proliferation and migration, whereas  blockade of SDF-1a or its receptor CXCR4 by RNAi or antagonist significantly diminished these beneficial effects of  VEGFMSCs [48]. Our results were similar to these results, and  the conclusion was that SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could affect CSCs proliferation and migration. However, the mechanism is not quite  clear.  DNA methylation is an important mechanism for gene  transcriptional silencing. CpG hypermethylation in DNA pro-  moter regions is responsible for gene silencing [49-51]. DNA  methylation status was regulated by DNMT, which has de novo  methylation activity. We found that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could inhibit global DNMT activity. Furthermore,  DNMT expression, include DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, was significantly higher in c-kit(2)CPCs compared to c-  kit(+)CPCs, and DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was suppressed by the stimulation of SDF-1a combined with CXCR4. Therefore, DNMT1 and DNMT3b are critical enzymes in the mechanism of SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 induced c-kit expression. Meanwhile, Bisulfite sequencing anal-  ysis was chosen to quantify the promoter methylation degree in  multiple CpG sites. Our data demonstrated that SDF-1a significantly reduces c-kit promoter methylation of c-kit(+)CPCs in five out of seven CpG sites, and all of seven CpG sites for c-  kit(2)CPCs. Therefore, the 7th and 15th CpG sites probably  play an important role in the expression of c-kit gene in c-  kit(2)CPCs. Although the effect of SDF-1a on methylation in individual CpG sites is relatively small, the overall effect of  accumulated demethylation induced by SDF-1a in multiple CpG sites has significant influence on c-kit transcription. Therefore,  SDF-1a induced demethylation in the c-kit promoter is important in the regulation of c-kit transcription.  Our study demonstrated that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could regulate c-kit expression, which result in the CPCs  proliferation and migration ability improvement, and this function  could be suppressed by ADM3100. Furthermore, the up-  regulation of c-kit expression by SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 is through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and the global DNMTs activity, as well as through the subsequent  demethylation of the c-kit gene. In summary, this study described  a mechanism by which SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 regulates c-kit expression through promoter demethylation. However, no  clue about the mechanism of the inhibiting effect of SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 to DNMT was found so far. We will  continue to search for the possible mechanism. Our current  findings provided a novel strategy for stem cell therapy in  recovering damaged myocardium through the modification of the  status of c-kit promoter methylation by potentially targeting SDF-  1a or DNMTs.
