However, when the increase of ROS reach a certain level (the toxic threshold), they may overwhelm the antioxidant capacity of the cells, trigger apoptosis and cell death.3,4 Cancer cells fre- quently exhibit multiple genetic alterations and high oxidative stress status, suggesting that it might be possible to preferen- tially eliminate these cells by pharmacological ROS insults.5,6  Recently, some redox-modulating approaches had been demonstrate to enable therapeutic selectivity and could even provide benefit to overcome cancer-cell drug resistance.1,7,8  Many chemotherapeutic agents, such as docetaxel, paclitaxel, cisplatin, vinblastine and doxorubicin, have been found to suppress tumor growth partially by promoting oxidative stress in cancer cells.1,9  However, which molecular pathways that can effectively augment the proapoptotic function of ROS remain largely unknown.  Previously, we had identified alpha-tocopherol-associated pro- tein (TAP) as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer, yet little is known regarding its role in apoptotic signaling. Recently, we found that exposure of prostate cancer cells to H2O2 resulted in apoptosis as well as increased expression of TAP. TAP is widely expressed, with its highest expression in the organs of liver, brain and prostate.10 We had found that it exerts an antiproliferative effect via inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway.11 Neuzil et al.12 recently found that TAP-accelerated ap- optosis in mesothelioma cells. Although TAP can bind vitamin E, some studies have suggested that TAP has functions that are not dependent of vitamin E binding.11,13 The exact role that TAP plays in oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling remains unknown.  In this study, we showed that TAP plays a critical role to modulate oxidative stress-induced apoptotic in prostate can- cer cells both in vitro and in vivo.  ROS can induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial death pathways and other transcriptional pathways.14,15 JNK, an im- portant member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase fam- ily, has been shown to mediate apoptosis in response to cellu- lar stress.16-19 Activated JNK can phosphorylate c-jun and thereby induce the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member death pro- tein 5/harakiri upregulation.20,21 Upregulation of Bim and Puma contributes to c-Jun/c-fos-mediated cell apoptosis.19,21  In this study, we found that exposure of prostate cancer cells to H2O2 resulted in increased phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun, and TAP small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively decreased these effects, indicating that JNK activation was required for TAP-mediated apoptosis on H2O2 treatment.  Docetaxel has recently been shown to have significant sur- vival benefit for hormone refractory prostate cancer. Tradi- tionally, the mechanism of this agent is thought to involve the hyperstabilization of microtubules and inhibition of mito- sis cytoskeletal restructuring. Recently, metabolic oxidative stress has also been suggested to play a role in the antitumor effects of docetaxel.18 Treatment of docetaxel could increase the production of hydroperoxides and cause oxidative stress in many human cancer cells. In this study, we also demon- strated that TAP was able to promote the oxidative stress- induced apoptosis effect of docetaxel.  In summary, we have identified a novel functional mecha- nism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in ROS/ H2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The new function of TAP promoting ROS or doxetaxel-induced apopto- sis could be exploited as a valuable approach for the treatment of prostate cancer. Disrupting the redox balance of cancer cells by this signaling may enable therapeutic selectivity and provide benefit to overcome the drug resistance of prostate cancer.  Material and Methods Cell culture and reagents  LNCaP and PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supple- mented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin/strep- tomycin antibiotics and were maintained at 37-C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.  22 H2O2, SP600125, docetexel, glutathione (GSH) and N-acetyl-L-cyste- ine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Donkey polyclonal anti-human TAP, bim, puma and GAPDH antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Bio- technology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibod- ies specific for total and phosphorylated JNK and c-jun were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Fos were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.  Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 preparation  The coding sequence of TAP-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the pEGFP-N3-TAP plasmid, which was con- structed from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto) by inserting full-length TAP isolated from the cDNA of benign prostate hyperplasia tissue. The primers were: 50-GCCGAATTCAT- GAGCGGCAGAGTC-30 (forward) and 50-GCCGCTAGCT- TACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-30 (reverse). After purification,  What's new?  Alpha-tocopherol associated protein (TAP) is a vitamin E-binding factor downregulated in several cancers. Here, the authors  show that TAP potently promotes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/ROS-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, both in vitro and  in vivo. Signaling downstream of JNK to the AP-1 complex was found to be involved. The authors speculate that reintroduction  of TAP may be beneficial to overcome drug resistance in prostate cancer.

The recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2) packaging plasmid pSNAV2.0 was obtained by the simultaneous digestion of plasmid pSNAV2.0-LacZa (AGTC, Co., Ltd.) with EcoRI and NheI, followed by ligation using T4 DNA ligase (Takara). The resultant plasmid, pSNAV-TAP-EGFP, was used to transform competent cells, and positive colonies were screened by PCR using the pri- mers shown above, followed by sequence analysis to identify the correct recombinant clones. 293T cells were transfected with the purified pSNAV-TAP-EGFP plasmid, and viruses were isolated by PEG8000/NaCl precipitation and chloroform extraction for purification. The purity was examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and the titer was determined by dot blot using a radioactive probe specific for the rAAV2 transgene.  rAAV2 viral infection  Subconfluent LNCaP or PC-3 cells were infected with par- ticles (2 - 1011 vector genomes) of rAAV2 encoding the EGFP-TAP sequence (rAAV2-TAP) or control viral particles. The infection efficiency was determined by the percentage of cells expressing the viral-derived EGFP under a fluorescence microscope.  Luciferase assay  The AP-1-Luc construct (an artificial reporter containing seven AP-1 agonist 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate re- sponsive element sites) was purchased from Stratagene (Kirk- land, WA). The c-Jun-DN and a-Fos constructs were kind gifts from Mingtao Li, Ph.D. (Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China).  LNCaP or PC-3 cells (1 - 105) were plated in each well of 24-well dishes with 500 ml of regular growth medium at the day before transfection. The medium was replaced with serum-free growth medium on the day of the transfection, which was performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitro- gen, Carlsbad, CA) with a mixture containing 500 ng of AP- 1-Luc plasmid and 1 ng of Renilla luciferase expression vec- tor (pRL-TK). After a 4 hr incubation, the transfection mix- tures were removed and 500 ml of normal growth medium was added to each well. Then, the cells were incubated for an additional 18 hr. The luciferase activity of each well was measured using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  siRNA transfection  TAP siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from Ambion (Lafayette, CO). The targeted sequences were 50- CCAAUUGUCCCAACCAUUUU-30 and 50-CAACGAGGC- CAUUGACUUCUU-30. The transfection was done according to the product's instruction. Briefly, PC-3 and LNCaP cells were plated at 4 - 105 per well in six-well plates. On the next day, cells were transfected with TAP siRNA or negative  control (NC) oligonucleotides using SIPORT (Ambion, Aus- tin, TX).  RNA extraction, RT-PCR and western blot assay  The total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To assess mRNA expression, RT-PCR was carried out with the RET- ROscriptV  R kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The primers for the  TAP gene were: 50-CCAGGCAGAAGGAGGCATTG-30 (for- ward) and 50-TCGGAGCCAACGCAGGAG-30 (reverse). The western blot analyses were performed as described in our previous study.11 The xenograft tumors were snap-frozen and stored at -80-C before processing. The proteins were extracted from cultured cells and xenograft tumors, and equal amounts of proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The pro- teins bound to nitrocellulose membranes were incubated overnight at 4-C with primary antibodies and then incubated with secondary peroxidase-linked whole antibodies (Amer- sham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The proteins were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-plus, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) followed by autoradiography. GAPDH served as the loading control.  Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting  Cell lysates were prepared from mock-infected or rAAV2- TAP-infected cells and subsequently incubated with protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hr at 4-C, centrifuged, washed five times with lysis buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The SDS- PAGE was followed by immunoblot analyses using anti-TAP (1:200) or anti-JNK (1:1,000) antibodies.  Assessment of intracellular ROS  The levels of ROS induced by H2O2 or docetaxel in LNCaP and PC-3 cells were measured using 2,7-dichlorodihydro- uorescindiacetate (DCFH-DA) as a fluorescence probe. Cells were washed with PBS twice and incubated with DCFH-DA (10 mmol/L) for 30 min at 37-C. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS. The photos of DCF-DA fluorescence were immediately recorded and quantified. The intensity of DCF fluorescence was also detected by flow cytometry, with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 530 nm.  Apoptosis analysis  Apoptosis was evaluated by annexin V and 7-AAD binding assay using the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At least 1 - 106 cells in each sample were ana- lyzed. Control cells stained with annexin V-PE or 7-AAD alone were used as NCs for the flow cytometric analysis.  Tumor formation in nude mice and rAAV2-TAP injection  A xenograft tumor model was established as described in our previous study.11,22 Briefly, the flanks of 4-week-old male nude mice were injected subcutaneously under anesthesia  C an  ce r C el l B io lo gy  2272 TAP promotes oxidative apoptosis in prostate cancer  Int.

One week later, H2O2 (200 mM) was administered by intratu- moral injection every week for 5 weeks. Tumor growth was monitored regularly, and the volumes were calculated using the formula length - width2 - 0.5. The tumor tissues were harvested for further analysis. All of the mice were main- tained and handled in accordance with the institutional guidelines and a protocol approved by the Sun Yat-sen Uni- versity (Guangzhou, China).  Immunohistochemistry analysis  Immunohistochemistry analyses were performed as previ- ously described.11,22 The isolated mice xenograft tumors were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and then dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol. The tissues were embedded in paraf- fin and then cut into 5-mm-thick sections. The deparaffinized sections were incubated with TAP (1:600), JNK (1:1,000) or phospho-JNK (1:1,000) primary antibodies at room tempera- ture for 1 hr. After washing in PBS, the sections were incu- bated with secondary antibody and ABC solution followed by 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) and counterstaining with Mayer's hematoxylin.  TUNEL assay  A terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect apopto- sis of prostate cancer xenografts. The assay was performed using the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (POD; Roche, In- dianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The prostate cancer sections were incubated with DAB sub- strate solution followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin for 5 min, dehydration and mounting before observation under a light microscope.  Statistical analysis  Student's t-tests performed by SPSS software were used to analyze the significance of the differences between the treat- ment and control groups. The data are presented as the means 6 SE. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.  Results TAP is involved in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis  in prostate cancer cells  Exposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to H2O2 resulted in dose- and time-dependent upregulation of TAP mRNA and protein levels compared with the control. Moreover, the inductions of both TAP mRNA and protein were blocked by NAC and GSH, the scavengers of intracellular ROS, confirming that TAP was indeed induced by oxidative stimulation (Figs 1a-c).  The prostate cancer cells were transfected with TAP siRNA or NC and were subjected to western blot and apo- ptosis analysis. As shown in Figure 1 d1, the upregulation of TAP induced by H2O2 was significantly abolished by TAP siRNA compared to the control. This finding verified the effi- cacy and specificity of the TAP siRNA.  As shown in Figures 1 d2 and 1 d3, compared with the NC, TAP siRNA conferred the effective protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis (6.9 vs. 18.9% in PC-3 cells, p < 0.05; 9.8 vs. 26.3% in LNCaP cells, p < 0.05). Moreover, there was no significant difference in the levels of apoptosis among the three groups in the absence of H2O2 treatment, suggesting that H2O2-mediated oxidative stress is required for TAP-promoted apoptosis. This is consistent with our pre- vious finding that TAP alone cannot induce apoptosis.11 To- gether, these results indicate that TAP plays a critical role in the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells initiated by oxidative stress.  To further study TAP function, we constructed a recombi- nant AAV2 vector encoding the EGFP-TAP sequence (rAAV2-TAP). PC-3 and LNCaP cells were infected with vi- ral particles for 72 hr, and EGFP expression detected by fluo- rescence microscopy showed that the rate of infection was higher than 80% (data not shown).  The PC-3 and LNCaP cells were infected with rAAV2- TAP. After 72 hr, the cultures were stimulated with 200 mM H2O2 for 2 hr, and then were subjected to quantification of apoptosis. As shown in Figure 1e, there was no significant difference among the three groups in the absence of H2O2 treatment. However, when H2O2 was added, overexpression of TAP significantly promoted apoptosis compared with the rAAV2-vector control. There was no significant effect caused by the rAAV2-TAP infection technique on the viability of the cells (as revealed by infection with the rAAV2-vector control, Fig. 1e).  Under H2O2 stimulation, silence or upregulate, the expres- sion of TAP had no significant effect on the ROS levels in both LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Fig. 1f1, f2).  Taken together, our data demonstrate that TAP acceler- ates apoptosis of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in response to oxida- tive stress.  Activation of JNK is required for the TAP-accelerated  apoptosis signaling  It is widely known that JNK is a key mediator of ROS- induced apoptosis in many cell types.18,23 Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether JNK activation was required in this process. As shown in Figure 2a, in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, H2O2 treatment activated JNK in a time-dependent manner; the changes in the levels of c-Jun and phospho-c- Jun were paralleled to the phosphorylated levels of JNK, which is consistent with previous studies.24  As shown in Figure 2b, treatment of H2O2 resulted in an increased level of TAP and phospho-JNK in PC-3 and LNCaP cells, while scavenging of intracellular ROS by NAC  C an  ce r C el l B io lo gy  Zhu et al. 2273  Int.

The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry (PC-3 cells: e1, LNCaP cells: e2). Note that rAAV2-TAP increased apoptosis  initiated by H2O2 treatment but had no significant effect on apoptosis in the absence of H2O2.

The cells were then treated with DCFH-DA to capture the intracellular ROS. The intensity of DCF fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry, with  excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 530 nm. The results were representative of three independent experiments.

JNK activation is involved in TAP-mediated oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of prostate cancer cells. (a) JNK is known to be  activated after H2O2 treatment. Prostate cancer cells were treated with 200 mM H2O2. At the indicated time points, the cultures were harvested. Western blotting analyses were performed with antibodies against JNK, phospho-JNK, c-jun and phospho-c-jun (PC-3 cells: a1, LNCaP cells: a2).  (b) NAC and GSH block the activation of JNK induced by H2O2. PC-3 and LNCaP cells were treated with NAC (20 mM) or with GSH (5 mM) for  30 min, then were exposed to 200 mM H2O2 for 2 hr. Western blotting analyses were performed (PC-3 cells: b1, LNCaP cells: b2). (c) SiRNA- mediated knockdown of TAP attenuates the activation of JNK and c-jun induced by H2O2. Cells were transfected with TAP siRNA or with NC for  48 hr, then were exposed to 200 mM H2O2 for 2 hr. Western blotting analyses were performed (PC-3 cells: c1, LNCaP cells: c2). (d) The over- expression of TAP increases the oxidative activation of JNK. Cells were infected with rAAV2-TAP or with rAAV2-vector control for 72 hr, and were  untreated or treated with 200 mM H2O2 for 2 hr before being subjected to western blotting analysis (PC-3 cells: d1, LNCaP cells: d2). (e) Over- expression of TAP significantly promoted the apoptosis induced by H2O2. Cells were infected with rAAV2-TAP or with rAAV2-vector control virus  for 72 hr and were treated with H2O2 for another 2 hr. SP600125, the JNK inhibitor, was added into subgroup cells for 2 hr before the  treatments of H2O2. The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry (PC-3 cells: e1, LNCaP cells: e2. Asterisk indicated p < 0.05). [Color  figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]    or by GSH abolished TAP expression and phospho-JNK and phospho-c-jun induction significantly. These results indicate that both JNK and TAP mediate ROS-dependent signaling in prostate cancer cells.  Moreover, knockdown of TAP in the presence of H2O2 abrogated phospho-JNK and phospho-c-jun induction (Fig. 2c). Conversely, overexpression of TAP robustly increased phospho-JNK and phospho-c-jun; however, there were no de- tectable changes in the absence of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2d).  SP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK,25 was also used to characterize the relationship between TAP and JNK. SP600125 effectively inhibited JNK activation, as demon- strated by the significant decrease in phosphorylation levels of both JNK and c-jun; however, this inhibitor had no effect on TAP (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2e, results of flow cytometric analysis showed that SP600125 effectively reversed the TAP-dependent induction of apoptosis (31.6 vs. 10.1% in PC-3 cells, p < 0.05; 37.9 vs. 12.4% in LNCaP cells, p < 0.05).  TAP physically interacts with JNK  The above results demonstrate that TAP manipulates the activation of JNK and that JNK modulates the TAP proapop- totic effects. To explore the possibility that TAP may regulate JNK activation, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed.  As shown in Figure 3a, under normal condition (without H2O2 treatment), TAP and JNK had no direct interaction. However, when the cells were treated with H2O2, there had prominent interaction between TAP and JNK (Fig. 3b). These data indicate that under oxidative stress condition, JNK inter- acts with TAP in prostate cancer cells.  The AP-1 complex contributes to TAP-mediated oxidative  stress-induced apoptotic signaling  Under oxidative stress condition, cellular c-Jun and c-fos usu- ally form stable homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes which are important downstream effectors of JNK signaling.16  AP-1 is involved in many different important cellular proc- esses, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. As c-Fos is an important dimerization partner of c-Jun, we exam- ined whether it was involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis.  As shown in Figure 4a, western blotting confirmed that c- Fos expression was rapidly induced by H2O2, the upregula- tion of c-Fos induced by H2O2 was significantly abolished by TAP siRNA, which is in agreement with previous studies.17  c-Fos induced by H2O2 was also sensitive to treatment with PD95059 and UO126, two structurally distinct MEK inhibi- tors that block the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway.  Next, we evaluated whether H2O2-dependent induction of c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation and c-Fos expression leads to the transactivation of AP-1. We tested the ability of H2O2 to activate the AP-1-responsive collagenase promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene (AP-1-Luc). As in Figure 4c, H2O2 treatment increased luciferase activity compared with the control. H2O2-induced AP-1-Luc transactivation was sensitive to treatment with either SP600125 or UO126. Moreover, the addition of c-Jun-DN (a dominant negative mutant that lacks the transactivation domain and can compete with en- dogenous c-Jun for binding to c-Fos) or addition of the trun- cated form of c-Fos (a-Fos) resulted in an significant inhibi- tion of the transactivation of the AP-1 promoter. The effect of TAP on AP-1 transactivation was also evaluated. As shown in Figure 4d, TAP siRNA partially attenuated the ac- tivity of the AP-1 promoter. Overall, these findings suggest that both TAP- and JNK-specific activation of c-Jun and c- Fos expression contribute to AP-1 activation by H2O2.  We next examined whether c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimeriza- tion is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by flow cyto- metric assays. As shown in Figure 4e, overexpression of c- Jun-DN significantly protected PC-3 and LNCaP cells from apoptosis. This protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells may be attributable to the disruption of c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers. If this is true, the blockage of c- Fos should confer the similar protection against apoptosis in the cells. Indeed, expression of a-Fos in PC-3 and LNCaP cells attenuated the apoptosis in comparison to the vector control (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, when TAP was depleted by TAP siRNA, this effect was partially attenuated (Fig. 4e). To- gether, these findings suggest that TAP contributes to the c-  Figure 3. TAP associates with JNK.

Next, we determined whether TAP is involved in the apo- ptotic signaling by the AP-1-activated BH3-only subfamily induced by H2O2. The JNK/c-Jun pathway has been shown to regulate the release of cytochrome c from the mitochon- dria. Bim and Puma are two members of the proapoptotic BH3-only subfamily of Bcl-2 proteins.21 Upregulation of Bim and Puma contributes to c-Jun/c-fos-mediated apoptosis.19  As shown in Figure 4f, the expression of Bim and Puma could be induced by H2O2, whereas both c-Jun-DN and a-Fos prevented H2O2-induced Bim and Puma upregulation. When TAP was depleted by TAP siRNA, the above effect was partially attenuated, indicating that TAP is involved in the upregulation of members of the AP-1 complex-mediated BH3-only subfamily (Bim and Puma) in the signaling of H2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.  TAP enhances the docetaxel-induced apoptosis in prostate  cancer cells  Docetaxel and paclitaxel had been found to kill cancer cells partially by inducing intracellular ROS.18 As shown in Fig- ures 5a and 5b, exposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to doce- taxel had elicited significant increase of intracellular ROS level. The addition of NAC or GSH could reverse the increased ROS levels induced by docetaxel.  Then the effect of TAP on the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis induced by docetaxel was studied. LNCaP and PC- 3 cells were infected with the rAAV2-TAP virus or with the vector control virus. Seventy-two hours later, the cultures were treated with 0.5 nM docetaxel for 48 hr and then were subjected to quantification of apoptosis. As shown in Figure 5c, overexpression of TAP significantly promoted apoptosis induced by docetaxel compared with the vector control. The addition of NAC following the treatment of docetaxel led to a reduction of apoptosis induced by docetaxel even when the rAAV2-TAP virus was infected.  These results suggested that TAP could enhance doce- taxel-induced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.  TAP enhances H2O2-mediated suppression of tumor growth  in vivo  Having demonstrated that TAP was able to sensitize the cul- tured prostate cancer cells to apoptosis induced by H2O2 in vitro, we next detected the effect of rAAV2-TAP virus in the xenografts of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in nude mice. Compared with the control group, H2O2 treatment significantly decreased the tumor size of the xenografts (Fig. 6a). Pretreatment with rAAV2-TAP virus further suppressed the tumor growth com- pared with the control virus. Consistent with the growth curves, the tumor weight was also significantly reduced by rAAV2-TAP combined with H2O2 compared with H2O2 treat- ment alone.  Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that TAP was highly expressed in the rAAV2-TAP group, confirming that treatment with rAAV2-TAP was effective in the nude mice. Moreover, TUNEL staining revealed that rate of apoptosis was higher in the mice treated with the combination of rAAV2-TAP and H2O2 compared with the treatment of H2O2 alone. This is in accordance with the reduced tumor growth rate, as well as the reduced tumor weight. The immu- nohistochemical staining results of p-JNK, JNK and c-JUN in the xenograft sections had confirmed the molecular signaling of TAP in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6b). Taken together, these data indicated that TAP sensitizes pros- tate cancer xenograft to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.  Discussion In this study, we had identified a new signal pathway that could augment the ROS-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. TAP was shown to have proapoptotic function under conditions of oxidative stress. JNK may function as a key downstream of TAP and modulate its proapoptotic effects.  The crystal structure of TAP suggests that it contains an NH2-terminal CRAL-TRAL domain with a small lipid ligand-binding cavity and a COOH-terminal GOLD domain that is involved in protein-protein interactions.10,26 A previ- ous study showed that TAP/supernatant protein factor binds to alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and improves vitamin E uptake, thus enhancing vitamin E function.11 A deficiency in TAP has been linked to several cancers, including breast and prostate cancer.11,23,27 We previously found that the expres- sion of TAP is significantly downregulated in prostate cancer, which is associated with tumor cell proliferation, as well as with an increased risk of cancer recurrence.23,24 Overexpres- sion of TAP inhibits prostate cancer growth in the absence of vitamin E both in vitro and in vivo through suppression of the PI3K/AKT pathway.11 However, the role of TAP in the apoptosis signaling remains largely unknown. In our previous study, we showed that TAP alone did not induce prostate cancer cell apoptosis.11 Neuzil et al.12 recently showed that TAP accelerates alpha-tocopheryl succinate-induced apoptosis in mesothelioma cells. Because alpha-tocopheryl succinate is associated with accumulated intracellular ROS,25 their study suggested a correlation between TAP and oxidative stress- induced apoptosis. Until now, no clear evidence has sup- ported an association between TAP and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress. Here, we report for the first time that TAP is upregulated during H2O2-induced apoptosis, overexpression of TAP sensitizes both LNCaP and PC-3 cells to the apopto- sis induced by oxidative stress. This partially explains why TAP expression is lower in prostate cancer cells compared with benign prostate cells. The decreased expression of TAP may represent an intrinsic escape mechanism of tumor cells. Indeed, the ROS levels are higher in prostate cancer cells compared with benign prostate cells, and high ROS levels are considered to be an inherent requirement of an aggressive phenotype.5  C an  ce r C el l B io lo gy  2278 TAP promotes oxidative apoptosis in prostate cancer  Int.

Cancer: 132, 2270-2282 (2013) VC 2012 UICC    Numerous pieces of evidence indicated that JNK signaling cascade is a crucial player during ROS-mediated apopto- sis,16,17 despite the contradictory notion that JNK is required for cell survival and proliferation.16,17 In the present study, we found that JNK activation is required for TAP-mediated apoptosis upon H2O2 treatment. Although H2O2 treatment alone is enough to evoke JNK activation, we found that the modulation of TAP expression by TAP siRNA or rAAV2- TAP could decrease or further increase JNK activation, respectively, and that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reverses the proapoptotic effect of TAP, suggesting that JNK functions as a downstream target of TAP.  As a protein kinase, modulation of JNK activity occurs mainly through its phosphorylation. Because TAP is not a protein kinase, it is impossible for TAP to regulate JNK via direct phosphorylation. Given the structural characteristics of TAP,26 we hypothesize that TAP might interact with JNK and protect phospho-JNK from dephosphorylation by phos- phatases or facilitate JNK phosphorylation by upstream ki- nases. Indeed, the intracellular phosphorylation and dephos- phorylation components coexist with apoptotic stimuli, and their balance decides the phosphorylation level of a protein. In this study, we found TAP physically interacts with JNK (Fig.). However, more conclusive evidence is needed to exclude the possibility that TAP and JNK operate in two par- allel signaling pathways and to support the hypothesis that TAP protects JNK from dephosphorylation.  ROS are produced by all aerobic cells and act as second messengers in cellular signaling. It is widely accepted that ROS play vital roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and necro- sis, depending on their concentrations.2,28 Traditionally, over- production of ROS and aberrant redox balance are consid- ered to be the underlying causes of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including cancer.5,29,30 Mounting evidences sug- gested that compared with their normal counterparts, many types of cancer cells have increased levels of ROS. In the prostate gland, ROS are considered to be oncogenic and are required for the development and progression of cancer.5  However, recent studies have also shown that excessive ROS beyond a particular threshold can induce pathophysiological changes such as apoptosis, cell cycle disruption and necrosis in cancer cells, which suggests that elevation of ROS levels could serve as a therapeutic strategy.1,30 Cancer cells adapt to high levels of ROS by activating ROS-scavenging enzymes, redox-sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-jB, Nrf2, c- Jun and HIF-1, which lead to the increased expression of  antioxidant molecules such as SOD; catalase thioredoxin and the GSH antioxidant system. Abrogation of this adaptive redox homeostasis mechanism is an attractive new approach to improving therapeutic outcomes. Many chemotherapeutic medicines have a mechanism of killing cancer cells via ROS.18 Therefore, some studies have proposed ROS-based therapies for cancer treatment.1,30  H2O2 is a common form of ROS that can easily permeate the cellular membranes into the cytoplasm. External applica- tion of H2O2 is widely used in wound treatment, but other uses are limited because it can cause deleterious effects, such as air embolisms and chemical burns of the skin and mucous membranes. In this study, our results showed that local injec- tion of H2O2 combined with rAAV2-TAP effectively induced apoptosis of PC-3 and LNCaP cells and suppressed the tumor growth in vivo, without air embolisms or other detect- able adverse effects. Following treatment with 200 mM H2O2, overexpression of TAP significantly promoted apoptosis com- pared with the control, therefore, TAP sensitizes prostate cancer cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.  AAV is a kind of replication-defective nonenveloped par- vovirus that can infect both dividing and nondividing cells.31 Because its genome can incorporate into the host cells, including human cells and it is currently known to have an acceptable safety profile. AAV is an attractive can- didate for gene therapy.32-35 There are many serotypes of AAV. Among them, AAV2 is the most popular one for sci- entific research.34,36,37 In this study, the recombined AAV2 was shown to be able to deliver TAP into PC-3 and LNCaP cells and into the xenograft prostate tumor tissues effec- tively. It could also promote the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis significantly without apparent adverse effects. The efficiency and the safety of rAAV2-TAP in inhibiting pros- tate cancer growth provide a strong rationale and the exper- imental basic for further studies.  In summary, we have identified a novel functional mecha- nism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in the ROS/ H2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Disrupting the redox balance of cancer cells by this signaling may enable the therapeutic selectivity and provide benefits to overcome the drug resistance of prostate cancer.
