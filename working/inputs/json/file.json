    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

    "text": "Retraction: Functional Characterization of Two Structurally Novel Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase2 Isozymes Responsible for the Enhanced Production of Stearate-Rich Storage Lipid in Candida tropicalis SY005   RETRACTION  Retraction: Functional Characterization of Two  Structurally Novel Diacylglycerol  Acyltransferase2 Isozymes Responsible for  the Enhanced Production of Stearate-Rich  Storage Lipid in Candida tropicalis SY005  The PLOS ONE Editors  The authors and editors retract this publication [1] following an investigation into concerns  around the images presented in several figures. After the publication of this article, readers  raised concerns about potential image duplications in Figures 4A-C, 5A-B, 6C, 7A, and 7C.  Specifically,  \u2022 There are similarities between gel bands in Figure 4C and Figure 7B.  \u2022 The backgrounds and first two lanes of Figures 4A and 7C appear to be identical.  \u2022 Figure 4B: there are areas of overlap between figures in the WT, QM-CtDGAT2a and  QM-CtDGAT2b panels.  \u2022 Figure 5A: there are duplications between different yeast growth panels within the figure.  \u2022 Figure 5B: there is a duplication between the left plates for C18:3 and C20:4.  \u2022 Figure 6C: several yeast growth images appear to be derived from the same source image,  involving panels \u0394D2, \u0394D4 and \u0394D5.  \u2022 Figure 7A: There appear to be areas of overlap between the right panels for \u0394D1(1-21) and \u0394D5(481-571).  The concerns were brought to the attention of the authors, who provided replicate images  of the same experimental sets but were not able to provide the images underlying the figures  included in the article.  An institutional investigation conducted by The Indian Institute of Technology at Kharag-  pur confirmed the duplication of images and recommended the retraction of the article.  The preparation of the figures falls below the standard of publication; in light of these con-  cerns and in line with the institutional recommendation, the authors and the editors retract  this publication.  The authors sincerely apologize to the scientific community for the errors in the published  article.  Reference 1.
