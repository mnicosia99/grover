Background: Both the speciation and toxicity of arsenic are affected by bacterial transformations, i.e. oxidation, reduction or methylation. These transformations have a major impact on environmental contamination and more particularly on arsenic contamination of drinking water. Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans has been isolated from an arsenic- contaminated environment and has developed various mechanisms for coping with arsenic, including the oxidation of As(III) to As(V) as a detoxification mechanism.  Results: In the present study, a differential transcriptome analysis was used to identify genes, including arsenite oxidase encoding genes, involved in the response of H. arsenicoxydans to As(III). To get insight into the molecular mechanisms of this enzyme activity, a Tn5 transposon mutagenesis was performed. Transposon insertions resulting in a lack of arsenite oxidase activity disrupted aoxR and aoxS genes, showing that the aox operon transcription is regulated by the AoxRS two-component system. Remarkably, transposon insertions were also identified in rpoN coding for the alternative N sigma factor (s54) of RNA polymerase and in dnaJ coding for the Hsp70 co-chaperone. Western blotting with anti-AoxB antibodies and quantitative RT-PCR experiments allowed us to demonstrate that the rpoN and dnaJ gene products are involved in the control of arsenite oxidase gene expression. Finally, the transcriptional start site of the aoxAB operon was determined using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and a putative -12/-24 s54-dependent promoter motif was identified upstream of aoxAB coding sequences. Conclusion: These results reveal the existence of novel molecular regulatory processes governing arsenite oxidase expression in H. arsenicoxydans. These data are summarized in a model that functionally integrates arsenite oxidation in the adaptive response to As(III) in this microorganism.  Background Arsenic is present in various environments, released from either anthropogenic or natural sources. This ele- ment is toxic for living organisms and known to be a human carcinogen [1]. Its toxicological effects depend, at least in part, on its oxidation state and its chemical forms, inorganic species being considered as more toxic [2]. The contamination of drinking water by the two inorganic forms, arsenite As(III) and arsenate As(V), has been reported in different parts of the world [3] and constitutes a major threat of public health. Microorgan- isms are known to take part in the transformation, i.e  oxidation, reduction or methylation of the metalloid, having a deep impact on arsenic contamination in environment. Several bacteria and prokaryotes have developed adap-  tation, resistance and colonization mechanisms, which allow them to live in hostile arsenic contaminated envir- onments. H. arsenicoxydans is a Gram-negative b-pro- teobacterium isolated from an industrial activated sludge plant and exhibiting a remarkable set of arsenic resistance determinants [4]. The H. arsenicoxydans adaptive response to arsenic is organized in a complex and sophisticated network. In particular, differential pro- teome studies have recently demonstrated the synthesis of several proteins encoded by the three ars resistance operons, e.g. arsenate reductase ArsC, flavoprotein ArsH and regulator ArsR [5,6] and the induction of oxidative  * Correspondence: philippe.bertin@unistra.fr \u2020 Contributed equally 1UMR7156 G\u00e9n\u00e9tique Mol\u00e9culaire, G\u00e9nomique et Microbiologie, CNRS Universit\u00e9 de Strasbourg, 28 rue Goethe, 67000 Strasbourg, France  Koechler et al.

One of the most noticeable response to arsenic in H.  arsenicoxydans is the ability of this bacterium to oxidize As(III) to As(V), a less toxic and less mobile form, via an arsenite oxidase activity. The two genes coding for this heterodimeric enzyme are organized in an operonic structure, and have been named aoxA and aoxB for the small and the large subunit, respectively [6,8,9]. Homo- logous genes have been since identified in various microorganisms [6,10-13]. In Agrobacterium tumefa- ciens, a complex transcriptional regulation has been recently suggested, involving As(III) sensing, two-com- ponent signal transduction by an AoxS sensor kinase and an AoxR regulator, and quorum sensing [14]. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of arsenite oxidase expression remain largely unknown. To extend our view of arsenic response [7], in particu-  lar with respect to the arsenic oxidation process, we conducted a comprehensive transcriptomic, genetic and molecular analysis of H. arsenicoxydans following expo- sure to As(III). These approaches allowed us to identify major determinants involved in the control of arsenite oxidation.  Results Gene expression profiling in response to arsenic The response to As(III) was analyzed in exponentially growing cells using microarrays. The data from three biological replicates were combined after normalization and statistical analysis carried out using the R software and packages http://www.r-project.org. The set of genes was further refined to include only those genes that showed a valid p-value and whose expression was altered by a factor of 2 or more when compared to the level measured in the absence of arsenic. This experiment led to the identification of 293 genes  showing an arsenic-induced expression change (> 2 fold (log2 = 1)). Among these genes, 133 (45%) were up- regulated and the remaining part, i.e. 160 genes, was down-regulated. The relative changes in gene expression ranged from a 11-fold down-regulation (rpsN gene encoding a ribosomal protein) to a 126-fold up-regula- tion (putative gene involved in phosphate transport). A list of those genes is shown in Additional file 1, Table S1. The corresponding HEAR gene numbers are avail- able in the Arsenoscope relational database http://www. genoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage/arsenoscopevia the MaGe web interface [15]. The 293 genes differentially expressed were clustered  according to the function of the corresponding encoded proteins. Among the 133 genes that were induced by at  least a 2-fold factor, about 11% are involved in metabo- lism, 26% in transport and binding protein, 26% in cel- lular processes and 31% have no assigned function. The high percentage of genes with unknown function is in accordance with the proportion of unknown function proteins identified in the genome of H. arsenicoxydans [6,7]. In agreement with our previous results, genes involved in arsenic resistance, phosphate transport and flagellar biosynthesis were induced in the presence of As (III) (see Additional file 1, Table S1), further supporting the relationship between these physiological processes [6,7]. Interestingly, only one methyl-accepting chemo- taxis protein (MCP) gene was induced in our microarray data, suggesting a role for this protein in the sensing of arsenic. This mechanism is currently under investiga- tion. Genes encoding the putative nitroreductase AoxC and the cytochrome c552 precursor AoxD as well as the response regulator AoxRS were found to be induced by As(III) (see Additional file 1, Table S1). AoxR has been proposed to act as a positive regulator of the aox operon upon phosphorylation by AoxS in A. tumefaciens [14]. Our transcriptomic data suggest that the regulation machinery is, at least in part, similar in H. arsenicoxy- dans. Futhermore, genes coding for the arsenite oxidase AoxAB subunits were found to be among the most induced genes in the presence of As(III). However, even though these results extended our knowledge of the arsenic response in H. arsenicoxydans, they did not led to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the control of arsenite oxidation. This prompted us to perform a transposon mutagenesis experiment.  Identification of arsenite oxidase accessory genes by screening an Aox activity deficient mutant library To identify genes possibly involved in the control of arsenite oxidation in H. arsenicoxydans, a library of 10,000 kanamycin resistant mutants was constructed by transposon mutagenesis, as previously described [9]. These clones were tested by silver nitrate staining [16] for arsenate production on As(III)-supplemented CDM agar plates. As compared to the wild-type strain, whose arsenite oxidase activity was revealed by a brownish pre- cipitate, 10 mutants with a lack of As(III) oxidase activ- ity were obtained. These strains showed no precipitate (Figure 1A), as observed for the M1 and M2 strains used as negative controls. Indeed, these strains carry a mutation in aoxA or aoxB genes coding for the small and the large subunit of arsenite oxidase, respectively [9]. Genes disrupted by transposon insertions were iden- tified in these 10 new mutants. As expected, four of the 10 mutants showed insertions in the aoxAB operon (Figure 2A). More interestingly, six mutants carried a transposon insertion outside the aoxAB operon. Two  Koechler et al.

These results further support our transcriptomic data suggest- ing that these two genes play a role in arsenic response. Two transposon insertions were shown to disrupt genes of the modEABC operon coding for a molybdenum high-affinity transport system [17], i.e. modC encoding an ATP-binding cassette transport protein (mutant Ha3437) and modB encoding a molybdenum transport system permease (mutant Ha3438) (Figure 2B). Remark- ably, transposon insertions were also located in dnaJ encoding a heat shock protein (Hsp40), (mutant Ha2646) (Figure 2C) and in rpoN encoding the alterna- tive nitrogen sigma factor (sigma 54) of RNA polymer- ase (mutant Ha3109) (Figure 2D). Two additional experiments were performed to com-  plete the physiological characterization of these mutants with respect to arsenite oxidation. First, arsenic species were quantified by HPLC-ICP-AES on filtered culture supernatants. H. arsenicoxydans was grown in liquid medium supplemented with 1.33 mM arsenite and showed 100% transformation of As(III) into As(V) after 48 h, whereas M1 (aoxA) and M2 (aoxB) mutants used as controls were not able to transform As(III) into As (V). The same loss of arsenite oxidase activity was mea- sured in Ha482 (aoxS), Ha483 (aoxR), Ha2646 (dnaJ) and Ha3109 (rpoN) mutants. In contrast to the results obtained on agar plates, Ha3437 (modC) and Ha3438 (modB) strains showed 100% transformation of arsenite (Table 1, Figure 1A). Previous studies have demon- strated that the bioavailability of metals or trace ele- ments considerably varies according to the type of matrix used for microbial growth [18]. We therefore assumed that Mo might be partly sequestred on CDM agar medium, resulting in a lack of arsenite oxidase  activity on plate. To test this hypothesis, As(III) oxidase tests were performed on CDM agar plates supplemented with 50 \u03bcM Mo. The addition of Mo to the solid med- ium restored As(III) oxidase activity in both Ha3437 (modC) and Ha3438 (modB) mutants while it had no effect on other mutant strains (Figure 1B). Second, we have previously demonstrated that the  polar flagellum-dependent motility of H. arsenicoxydans is increased in the presence of As(III), suggesting that arsenite oxidation may result in a gain of energy [6]. The motility of mutant strains was therefore tested on plates containing different concentrations of As(III), i. e. 0.66 mM, 1.33 mM and 2 mM. The diameter of the swarming rings was measured after 72 h. As shown in Figure 3, the disruption of aoxA, aoxB, aoxR, aoxS or rpoN genes abolished the improvement of swarming performances in the presence of As(III). Unlike those mutants, a disruption in dnaJ completely abolished the motility of H. arsenicoxydans in the presence or the absence of As(III). DnaJ is known to be essential for the expression of the flhDC flagellar master operon in Escherichia coli [19]. The lack of motility observed in the dnaJ mutant suggests the existence of a similar flhDC-dependent regulation of flagellar genes in H. arsenicoxydans. More importantly, the dnaJ mutant was affected in both the motility and arsenite oxidation, suggesting that these two mechanisms are co-regulated.  Effect of AoxR, AoxS, RpoN and DnaJ on arsenite oxidase synthesis To get further insight into the involvement of AoxR, AoxS, RpoN and DnaJ in arsenite oxidase activity, Wes- tern immunoblotting experiments were performed using antibodies raised against AoxB. The abundance of this protein was evaluated from total protein extracts of H. arsenicoxydans wild-type and mutant strains grown in the presence or not of As(III). AoxB was detected as a single band corresponding to a molecular mass of 92 kDa in As(III)-challenged H. arsenicoxydans strain (Figure 4). This single band was not observed in the various mutant strains. Furthermore, arsenite oxidase activity on native gel was only detected in As(III)-chal- lenged wild type total extract (data not shown). Taken together these results suggest that the lack of activity in the mutant strains is due to the absence of AoxB protein, which may result from an effect of AoxR, AoxS, RpoN and DnaJ on aoxAB expression.  Effect of AoxR, AoxS, RpoN and DnaJ on the control of arsenite oxidase operon expression To determine the involvement of aoxR, aoxS, dnaJ and rpoN on aoxAB transcription, we performed quantitative RT-PCR experiments. For each strain, changes in aoxB transcript abundance were compared to two internal  Table 1 Determination of arsenic speciation in H. arsenicoxydans wild-type and mutant strains.

The expression of aoxB mRNA was increased by a 9.4 fold factor after As(III) exposure in the H. arsenicoxydans wild-type strain. In contrast, aoxB expression was not increased in Ha482 (aoxS), Ha483 (aoxR), Ha3109 (rpoN) and Ha2646 (dnaJ) mutant strains, suggesting that the corresponding pro- teins play a crucial role in aoxAB operon expression (Table 2).  Molecular mechanisms of arsenite oxidase transcription The aoxR and aoxS genes encode a two-component sys- tem while rpoN encodes a sigma factor which recognizes a particular promoter with a specific -12/-24 binding site. These three proteins may therefore play a role in the initiation of aoxAB transcription. To get further insight into the molecular interactions between those regulators and the aoxAB promoter, we mapped the  Figure 3 Effect of arsenite concentration on swarming properties in H. arsenicoxydans wild-type and mutant strains. Motility assays were performed in the presence of an increased concentration of As(III). The level of motility of each strain was evaluated as the diameter of the swarming ring expressed in mm. The results are the mean value of five independent experiments.  Figure 4 Immunodetection of AoxB protein in total protein extracts of H. arsenicoxydans wild-type and mutant strains.

Messenger RNAs were extracted from induced (1.33 mM As(III)) and non induced H. arsenicoxydans wild-type strain cul- tures. A single transcriptional start site was identified from induced cells at -26 bp relative to the translation start codon, while no transcriptional start site was iden- tified from non induced cells. In agreement with this, a TGGCACGCAGTTTGC putative -12/-24 s54-depen- dent promoter motif was identified upstream of the aoxAB transcriptional start site (Figure 5). In addition, multiple alignment of aoxAB promoter sequences pre- sent in databases revealed a similarity to promoters recognized by s54 in A. tumefaciens, Thiomonas sp., Rhi- zobium sp.

In contrast, no such s54-dependent promoter motif was found in several strains containing the aoxAB operon but lacking the two-component transduction system aoxRS operon, such as Chloroflexus aurantiacus, Chlorobium limicola,  Thermus thermophilus, Burkholderia multivorans, Roseo- bacter litoralis, Pseudomonas sp.TS44, Chlorobium phaeobacteroides and Chloroflexus aggregans (Figure 5B). Remarkably, a multiple alignment of amino acid  sequences revealed that AoxR shares significant homol- ogy with a number of s54 RNA polymerase transcrip- tional activators, i.e. 35.96% identity with ZraR and 35.26% identity with AtoC from E. coli K12. AoxR con- tains three conserved domains shared by most Enhancer Binding Proteins (EBP), namely a N-terminal response regulator receiver domain (amino acids 18-130), a cen- tral s54 interaction domain (amino acids 147-368) com- mon to all s54 dependent EBPs (Pfam E-value 10-116; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00158) and a C-terminal DNA binding helix-turn-helix (HTF) domain (amino acids 421-463) enable to bind to specific upstream activation sequences [20]. AoxR shares similarities with several EBPs of s54 essential for the formation of an open complex formation during s54- dependent transcriptional initiation, in particular the s54  Figure 5 Determination of aoxA transcription start site by 5'RACE and identification of a s54 consensus motif.

Taken together, these observations strongly suggest that AoxR interacts directly with RpoN to initiate the transcription of aoxAB operon in H. arsenicoxydans.  Discussion Despite many works devoted to arsenic metabolism in microorganisms, little is known about the regulation of arsenite oxidase activity. In the present study, the com- bination of transcriptomic, genetic and molecular data provided a comprehensive view of the role of various proteins in the control of arsenite oxidation in H. arsenicoxydans (Figure 7). We showed that some pro- teins play an indirect role in this process, as their pre- sence is not essential for AoxAB synthesis. In this respect, the AoxB large subunit contains a Mo site required in arsenite oxidase enzymatic activity [22].  Ha3437 (modC) and Ha3438 (modB) mutations were located in the molybdenum high-affinity transport sys- tem operon, which further support the key role of this element in enzyme activity. In addition, the recovery of As(III) oxidase activity in these two mutants in the pre- sence of an excess molybdenum suggests that Mo may also be transported through an alternative uptake system in mod mutants, e.g. a low-affinity uptake system invol- ving non specific permeases such as HEAR0069, HEAR0154, HEAR1749 or HEAR2391 or a sulfate trans- port system, as described in E. coli mod mutants [23]. More importantly, our results suggest that AoxR and  RpoN constitute a transcriptional complex that play a major role in the initiation of aoxAB operon transcrip- tion. Three mutants, i.e. Ha482 (aoxS), Ha483 (aoxR) and Ha3109 (rpoN), were affected in this process. The amino acids sequence analysis of H. arsenicoxydans AoxR and AoxS revealed the existence in these proteins  Figure 6 Amino acids conservation between s54 Enhancer Binding Proteins (EBP) and AoxR. Sequence alignment was performed with ClustalW. The conserved amino acids are presented with a blue background and the blue intensity reflects sequence similarities. Only the central binding domain is indicated. Region CI has remarkable similarity to the consensus glycine-rich flexible loop motif (Walker A - consensus motif GxxGxGK), and also contains hydrophobic residues. Region CII is hydrophobic. The region CIII is predicted to fold into two alpha helices separated by a turn. This region is involved in a specific interaction between the EBP and the Es54 required for open promoter complex formation via the GAFTGA motif. Region CIV is rich in glycine, negatively charged and contains a consensus sequence of 4 aliphatic residues followed by 2 negatively charged residues (Walker B - consensus motif TVFLDE); in contrast, CVI is positively charged and is rich in aromatic residues and proline. Region CV is found about 80 amino acids away from region CI, and has a consensus sequence QakLLRVLqe. Finally, region CVII has a core of eight highly conserved amino acids. Sequence informations of other genes were obtained from Colibri database (Institut Pasteur, Paris).  Koechler et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:53 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/53  Page 7 of 13    of structural features common to partners of two-com- ponent signal transduction systems, which are composed of a sensor kinase and a response regulator [24]. More- over, the comparison of AoxS and AoxR protein sequences with those of A. tumefaciens revealed similari- ties. Indeed, the AoxS protein sequence contains short blocks of conserved motifs that are consistent with a role of sensor histidine kinase, e.g. the \u201cH\u201d (amino acids 279 to 287: LAHEVNNPL), the \u201cG2\u201d (amino acids 435 to 441: GRIGLGL) and the \u201cN\u201d (amino acids 380 to 391: VRQIVLNLVLNA) domains. In addition, four highly invariant residues playing a central role in phosphoryla- tion correspond to Asp9, Asp10, Asp57 and Lys107 in the H. arsenicoxydans AoxR protein. The three aspara- gine residues are known to interact together to form an \u201cacid pocket\u201d, characteristic of orthodox receivers, into which the side chain of Lys109 protrudes [24]. Finally, a transmembrane region and a 17 amino acids residue cluster possibly exposed to the periplasm are present in  AoxS and could serve as a signal receptor in the pre- sence of As(III) in the medium. The detection of As(III) would then lead to AoxS autophosphorylation at a histi- dine residue via ATP hydrolysis and phosphotransfer to an aspartate residue in the response regulator AoxR, as recently proposed in A. tumefaciens [14]. Remarkably, our results demonstrated for the first  time that the alternative N sigma factor (s54) is essential for the initiation of arsenite oxidase transcription. Indeed, a mutation in the corresponding gene led to a complete loss of As(III) oxidation and aoxB transcrip- tion in Ha3109 (rpoN). s54 is one of the alternative sigma subunits of RNA polymerase responsible for spe- cific binding to DNA. The core RNA polymerase com- plexed with s54 is usually associated with nitrogen assimilation and fixation, but is also known to play a role in various physiological processes, e.g. flagellar synthesis, carbon source utilization or bacterial virulence [25]. To date, only one report has shown that s54  Figure 7 Conceptual representation of the complex arsenite oxidation process in H. arsenicoxydans. Several major control mechanisms are involved: A. a transcriptional regulation: AoxS acts as a sensor of As(III) environmental signal and then phosphorylates AoxR. The phosphorylated AoxR binds to RpoN, which interacts with RNA polymerase. The RpoN-RNA polymerase complex with its AoxR co-activator initiates the aox operon transcription. DnaJ may regulate aox mRNA stability or act on the folding of AoxR or s54; B. Then, arsenite oxidase is synthesized and exported by the TAT secretion system; C. consequently, arsenite oxidase exerts a key role in arsenic detoxification, by the transformation of the more toxic form As(III) into a less toxic form As(V). This process is known to affect motility, which may involve a MCP chemotaxis protein and requires the DnaJ co-chaperone. IM= Inner Membrane, OM= Outer membrane.  Koechler et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:53 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/53  Page 8 of 13    participates in the transcription of genes possibly involved in metal tolerance, i.e. the zraR/S genes that code for a zinc and lead responsive two-component regulatory system in E. coli [26]. RNA polymerase together with s54 binds to a specific promoter site, with the consensus DNA sequence YTGGCACGNNNN TTGCWNNw [27], forming a transcriptionally in- active closed complex. Such a characteristic -12/-24 s54-dependent promoter motif, i.e. TGGCACG- CAGTTTGC, was identified 26 pb upstream of the tran- scriptional initiation codon of aoxAB with respect to the +1 transcriptional start site (Figure 5), which confirmed the need for RpoN in the initiation of aoxAB transcrip- tion. Changes in the conformation of s54-RNA polymer- ase are nucleotide dependent. Indeed, the DNA melting step absolutely requires the interaction with a transcrip- tional activator protein. Most of these s54-dependent activators share three domains found in AoxR, i.e. a C- terminal DNA binding domain that binds to upstream activation sequences, a conserved central domain belonging to the AAA+ (ATPases associated with var- ious cellular activities) protein family to proceed with initiation of transcription and a N-terminal receiver domain that regulates its own AAA+ domain [20,28,29]. A multiple alignment of the central domain revealed a conservation of a common architecture between AoxR and s54 EBPs. Indeed, seven highly conserved sequence motifs corresponding to a s54 interaction domain of AoxR further support the direct interaction of AoxR with RpoN to stimulate the transcription of aoxAB operon in H. arsenicoxydans (Figure 6). This central s54  interaction domain has been already used to identify new s54 EBPs [30-37]. It contains the highly conserved signature sequence GAFTGA loop (conserved region CIII, Figure 6) proved to be required for direct interac- tion with s54 [21,38,39], the Walker A (conserved region I, Figure 6) and B (conserved region CIV, Figure 6) ATPase motifs necessary for the open complex formation. Both multiple sequences alignment and genetic envir-  onment analysis of aox promoters suggest the existence of a wide diversity in the transcriptional control of the aox operon. Indeed, as in H. arsenicoxydans, a s54- dependent promoter signature was identified in bacteria possessing a two-component transduction system AoxRS operon downstream of the aoxAB operon, e.g. A. tumefaciens and O. tritici (Figure 5A). In contrast, no s54-dependent promoter motif and no aoxR homolo- gous gene were found in other bacteria, e.g. C. aurantia- cus or C. aggregans (Figure 5B). These observations suggest that the transcription of the aox operon in these bacteria may involve other regulatory proteins and that AoxR may represent a specific co-activator of RpoN in the initiation of the aox operon transcription. Finally,  our results provide evidence that the DnaJ co-chaperone is required for As(III) oxidation. DnaJ is part of the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE Hsp70 machinery. Hsp70 chaperones represent one of the most potent defence cellular mechanism against environmental insults as DnaK- DnaJ-GrpE are known to assist protein folding [40,41] or to be involved in mRNA stability [42]. In the present study we showed that there is no induction of aoxAB transcription in the dnaJ mutant, resulting in a loss of AoxAB synthesis. Several possible mechanisms involving DnaJ in the  regulation of arsenite oxidase can be hypothesized. DnaJ may be required for the proper folding or activity of the AoxR regulator. Such a function has been demonstrated for the positive regulator CRP in a dnaJ deletion mutant in E. coli [43]. Similarly, a post-transcriptional regulation of the arsenite oxidase itself can not be excluded. More- over, a Tat (Twin-Arginine Translocation) signal has been detected in the AoxA sequence of H. arsenicoxy- dans [6]. Proteins secreted to the periplasm via a Tat protein export pathway are known to require a folding by Hsp70 chaperones before their secretion. DnaJ could be one of these chaperones [44,45]. Another possible target of DnaJ may be the RpoN sigma factor, as this chaperone has been demonstrated to play a role in the regulation of sS in various species [46]. Alternatively, several mechanisms are known to be involved in the stability of messenger RNA. For example, in E. coli, a long 5' untranslated region (UTR) has been observed upstream of the transcriptional start site of the flhDC flagellum master operon. This region plays a crucial role in the stability of the mRNA controlled by CsrA [19]. In the present report, the aoxAB transcriptional start site was located 26 bp upstream of the translational start codon, providing evidence that such a long 5'UTR does not exist upstream of the aox operon. However, this does not rule out a role of DnaJ on the stability of aoxAB mRNA, as HSP proteins are known to function as mRNA stabilizers and to protect them against nucle- ase degradation [42]. Further experiments will therefore be required to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms of arsenite oxidase regulation in H. arsenicoxydans.  Conclusion Taken together, our observations provide evidence that multiple proteins play a role in the control of arsenite oxidation in H. arsenicoxydans. The following regulatory model is proposed: AoxS responds to the presence of As(III) in the environment and autophosphorylates. The phosphate is then transferred to AoxR, which acts as a positive regulator of the aox operon and activates the initiation of the transcription in association with RpoN. In addition, DnaJ acts on the expression or the stability of both arsenite oxidation and motility genes,  Koechler et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:53 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/53  Page 9 of 13    demonstrating that these two functions are strongly linked. Our results include the role of RpoN and DnaJ in arsenite oxidase synthesis, which provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms used by H. arsenicoxydans to cope with the most toxic form of arsenic in its environment.  Methods Bacterial strains and growth media Bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 3. H. arsenicoxydans ULPAs1 was grown in a chemically defined medium (CDM), supplemented by 2% agar when required [4]. Escherichia coli S17-1 strain [47] was cultivated in LB medium (MP Biochemicals). Matings were performed on CDM to which 10% (wt/vol) LB medium was added, as previously described [9]. Tryptone swarm plates containing CDM supplemented with 1% Bacto-Tryptone and 0.25% agar were used to assess bacterial motility.  Transposon mutagenesis The mini-Tn5::lacZ2 transposon [47] was delivered by mobilization of the suicide vector pUT/mini-Tn5::lacZ2 from E. coli S17-1 (l-pyr) to H. arsenicoxydans. Conju- gation was performed and transformants were selected as previously described [9].  Selection of arsenite oxidase mutants Mutants were screened for arsenite oxidase activity as previously described [9]. Agar plates were flooded with a 0.1 M AgNO3 solution to visualize arsenite oxidation [16]. Mutants affected in molybdenum metabolism were also tested on CDM agar plates supplemented with 50 \u03bcM Na2MoO4, 2H2O and 1.33 mM As(III).  DNA manipulation and insertion mapping DNA manipulations were carried out according to stan- dard protocols, as described by Sambrook et al. [48].  Total DNA was isolated from mutant strains with the Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega). Transposon insertion sites were mapped as previously described [9]. Briefly, total DNA was digested and self- ligated. This ligation mixture was used as a template for PCR amplification using mini-transposon specific pri- mers. The PCR products obtained were purified with a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems ABI prism 3130\u00d7l capillary sequen- cer. The resulting sequences were compared to the H. arsenicoxydans genome sequence [6] to identify dis- rupted CDS. Finally, insertion sites and transposon orientations were precisely mapped by sequencing PCR products obtained with two primers hybridizing upstream and downstream, respectively, of the insertion site of each disrupted gene (see Additional file 2, Table S2).  Arsenic speciation determination H. arsenicoxydans wild type and mutants were grown for 48 hours in CDM medium supplemented with 1.33 mM As(III). Culture supernatants were filtered through sterile 0,22 \u03bcm pore size filters (VWR). Arsenic species were separated by high-performance liquid chromato- graphy (HPLC) and quantified by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), as previously described [9].  RNA extraction Strains were grown at 25\u00b0C for 24 h (OD = 0,15) and cultures were induced by addition of 0.66 mM or 1.33 mM As(III) for 8 hours before extraction. Samples were harvested and stored at -80\u00b0C. RNA was extracted as previously described [7]. After extraction procedure, RNA integrity was checked by electrophoregram analysis on a BioAnalyser (Agilent) and total RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically with a Nanodrop.  Microarrays and data analysis Microarrays containing 60-mer oligonucleotides for all predicted H. arsenicoxydans genes http://www.geno- scope.cns.fr/agc/mage/arsenoscope were used, as pre- viously described [7]. Briefly, total RNA (5 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed and indirectly labelled according to manufacturer's instructions with some modifications [7]. The quality and concentration determination as well as hybridization and scanning were performed as pre- viously described [7] Three distinct biological RNA sam- ples were prepared from in each growth condition (with and without As(III) induction) and labelled either by Cy3 or Cy5 in a dye-swap design. Microarray data were deposited in ArrayExpress (accession E-MEXP-2199 and A-MEXP-1594). Data normalization and statistical  Table 3 Bacterial strains used in this study.

Briefly, data were acquired and analyzed by Genepix Pro 6.0 (Axon Instrument). The experiment design included three biological replicates. For each of them, induced and non-induced cells were compared in dye swap experiments. The resulting arrays were analyzed using the R software http://www.r-project.org. A slide by slide Loess normalization was performed using the limma package [49]. Valid log2 expression ratios from repli- cated spots were averaged on each array so as to get sta- tistically independent ratios for each oligonucleotide included in the array design. For the same reason, dye swap arrays were also averaged. Oligos that had no valid expression ratios on the ten arrays were excluded from the data set for further analysis, which was carried out using the varmixt package and the VM option [50]. The resulting raw p-values were adjusted according to a Ben- jamini and Yekutieli procedure [51]. Genes showing a valid p-value and a more than two-fold decreased or increased expression were considered as differentially expressed between the two conditions and were retained for further study.  Quantitative real time PCR Quantitative PCR experiments were performed with RNA prepared as described for microarrays. RNA ali- quots were purified with the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qia- gen) to ensure the elimination of genomic DNA. Total RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometri- cally using a Nanodrop and RNA integrity was electro- phoretically verified. Total RNA (1,9 \u03bcg) was reverse transcribed with SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using random hexam- ers. Real time quantitative PCR was carried out with a MyiQ single-color Real-time PCR detection system. The reaction mixture contained 12,5 \u03bcl of MESA Blue qPCR MasterMix Plus for SYBR Assay with fluorescein (Euro- gentec), 5 \u03bcl of cDNA and 300 nM of each primer in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl. Thermocycling conditions were as follow: 5 min at 95\u00b0c and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C, 15 s at 61\u00b0c and 1 min at 72\u00b0C. The PCR efficiency of the genes of interest and internal control genes were optimized to be similar enough by adjusting the primer concentrations to 300 nM each (data not shown). For each quantitative PCR run, non-template controls were performed to identify false positives and negative con- trols without reverse transcriptase were performed for each cDNA synthesis reaction and verified in real time PCR to determine the presence of contaminating geno- mic DNA. Two biological replicates (independent cul- tures) and two quantitative PCR replicates were performed for each experience. Amplification products were designed to be less than 175 bp in size. The pairs of primers used are listed in Additional file 2, Table S2.  Two housekeeping genes, i.e. HEAR2922 coding for a putative RNA methyltransferase and HEAR0118 coding for a peptide deformylase, were used as standards to obtain normalized aoxB (HEAR0478) gene ratio [52] in the As(III) induced sample compared to the non- induced sample. These two housekeeping genes showed a stable expression between the two analyzed conditions (without As(III) and after an 8 hours As(III) exposure) when observing the microarrays data. The data were analyzed with the Relative Expression Software Tool [53]. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of \u2264 0.05.  5'RACE experiment The transcriptional start site of aoxAB operon was determined using the 5'RACE system for rapid amplifi- cation of cDNA ends (Invitrogen). Total RNA was obtained as described before. Reverse transcriptase reac- tions were performed using 5 \u03bcg total RNA and a gene specific reverse primer (5'-CATGGGCACTT- GAATGTCTTG-3'). Reactions were heated at 70\u00b0C for 10 min and immediately prewarmed at 50\u00b0C before addition of Super-Script II reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcription was conducted at 50\u00b0C for 50 min and stopped at 70\u00b0c for 15 min. Purification and tailing of cDNA were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR using the provided Abridged Anchor Primer and a gene specific primer (5'-ATGCTGTGCGCGACGATATCG- 3') located upstream of the original cDNA primer.  Preparation of protein extracts, SDS-PAGE and PAGE separation Western immunoblotting were performed from late exponential phase wild-type and mutant strains grown in 1 liter CDM (with and without the presence of 100 mg/liter As(III)). The cultures were harvested by centri- fugation for 10 min at 9,000 \u00d7 g. Cell pellets were resus- pended in distilled water and sonicated at 100 A (15 times 1 min with 1 min interval on ice, 80% duty cycle). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min at 13,000 \u00d7 g). The supernatant was collected (total extract) and stored at -20\u00b0C. The protein concentration of each sample was measured with a Bio-Rad protein assay kit. First, fifty micrograms of each protein extract was loaded onto an 11% polyacrylamide-SDS gel. Second, fifty micrograms of each protein extract were loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel (native gel). The assay of arsenite oxidase activity followed the transfer of reducing equivalents from arsenite to 2,4-dichlorophe- nolindophenol (DCIP) as described by Anderson et al. [54]. Briefly, the reduction of DCIP (60 \u03bcM) was moni- tored in the presence of 200 \u03bcM sodium arsenite in 50 \u03bcM MES, pH 6.0, at 25\u00b0C.  Koechler et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:53 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/53  Page 11 of 13  http://www.r-project.org   Preparation of antibodies and Western blot analysis Monoclonal antibodies raised against an AoxB peptide were obtained from Proteogenix. Briefly, a hexadecapep- tide with the SKNRDRVALPPVNAQK sequence was synthesized. This peptide corresponds to the N-terminal 16 amino acids of the arsenite oxidase large subunit of H. arsenicoxydans. The peptide was then coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Two rabbits were injected at multiple subcutaneaous sites with peptide- KLH at 14 days intervals. Animals were prebled at day 0, bled at day 49 (from an ear vein) and totally bled at day 90. Antibodies were partially purified on an affinity column substituted with the peptide. After SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the proteins were  electrotransfered to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schlei- cher and Schuell, BA-85) using a Trans-Blot system (Bio-Rad) at 100 V, 4\u00b0C for 1 h. The membranes were washed twice in Tris buffered saline (TBS: 10 mM Tris- HCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and blocked in TBS with 0,3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The membrane was then washed three times in Tris-buffered saline with TritonX100 and Tween 20 (TBS-T: 20 mM TrisHCl pH7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0,2% Triton X-100, 0,05% Tween20), and incubated for 1 h with the AoxB antisera (1:800 dilution) in TBS-T with 0,3% BSA. Excess antibo- dies were removed by repeated washing with TBS-T. After 30 min incubation in TBS-T containing the sec- ondary antibody (1:800 dilution of goat IgG against rab- bit IgG, Sigma) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, the membrane was washed twice with TBS-T and revealed by NBT/BCIP color reagent using standard procedures.
