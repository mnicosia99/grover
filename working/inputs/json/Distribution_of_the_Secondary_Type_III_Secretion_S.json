    "summary": "The POU5F1 gene codes for the OCT4 transcription factor, which is one of the key regulators of pluripotency. Its transcription, alternative splicing, and alternative translation leading to the synthesis of the active, nuclear localized OCT4A has been described in detail. Much less, however, is known about actively transcribed OCT4 pseudogenes, several of which display high homology to OCT4A and can be expressed and translated into proteins. Using RT-PCR followed by pseudogene-specific restriction digestion, cloning, and sequencing we discriminate between OCT4A and transcripts for pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4. We show that expression of OCT4 and its pseudogenes follows a developmentally-regulated pattern in differentiating hESCs, indicating a tight regulatory relationship between them. We further demonstrate that differentiated human cells from a variety of tissues express exclusively pseudogenes. Expression of OCT4A can, however be triggered in adult differentiated cells by oxygen and FGF2-dependent mechanisms.",

Distribution of the Secondary Type III Secretion System Locus Found in Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 Isolates  among Shiga Toxin-Producing E. coli Strains Sou-Ichi Makino,1,2* Toru Tobe,3 Hiroshi Asakura,1 Masahisa Watarai,1 Testuya Ikeda,4  Koichi Takeshi,4 and Chihiro Sasakawa5  Department of Applied Veterinary Science, Research Center for Animal Hygiene and Food Safety,1 Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine,2 and Hokkaido Institute of Public Health,4 Hokkaido, Division of Applied Bacteriology, Graduate School  of Medicine, Osaka University, Osaka,3 and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo,5 Japan  Received 18 October 2002/Returned for modification 20 January 2003/Accepted 18 February 2003  The ability of the complete genome sequence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157 led to the identi- fication of a 17-kb chromosomal region which contained a type III secretion system gene cluster at min 64.5. This locus contains open reading frames whose amino acid sequences show high degrees of similarity with those of proteins that make up the type III secretion apparatus, which is encoded by the inv-spa-prg locus on a Salmonella SPI-1 pathogenicity island. This locus was designated ETT2 (E. coli type III secretion 2) and consisted of the epr, epa, and eiv genes. ETT2 was found in enteropathogenic E. coli strains and also in some non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains, but most of them contained a truncated portion of ETT2. Most O157 isolates had a complete collection of toxin-encoding genes eae and hlyA and the ETT2 locus, while most O26 strains had toxin-encoding genes eae and hlyA genes but an incomplete ETT2 locus. Thus, an intact copy of ETT2 might mark a pathogenic distinction for particular STEC strains. Therefore, the presence of the ETT2 locus can be used for identification of truly pathogenic STEC strains and for molecular finger- printing of the epidemic strains in humans and animals.  Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Shiga tox- in-producing E. coli (STEC) are the most common causes of hemorrhagic colitis, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic-uremic syndrome and also cause food-borne epidemics in humans (19). STEC is distributed widely in the environment (1, 2). It produces cytotoxin as the main virulence factor but can have a histopathologic effect on intestinal epithelial cells, causing at- taching-and-effacing (A/E) lesions. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), which is a major cause of infant diarrhea in develop- ing countries, has the same ability to cause A/E lesions. These lesions are characterized by localized destruction of brush bor- der microvilli, intimate attachment of the organism to the host cell membrane, and formation of an actin-rich underlying structure in the host cells (5). All genes necessary for the formation of A/E lesions are located in a pathogenicity island termed the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) (18). This locus contains genes for structural components of a secretion apparatus that belongs to the type III secretion system, that is, genes for the adhesin intimin and its translocated receptor, Tir (7).  The type III secretion system, which is found in many gram- negative pathogens, is responsible for secretion and injection of virulence-associated factors into the cytosol of host cells. The type III apparatus comprises approximately 20 proteins, with most of them located in the inner membrane (6, 24). Most inner membrane proteins are homologous to components of  the flagellar biosynthesis apparatuses of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria (10). In Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, two independent type III secretion systems en- coded by separate chromosomal loci, SPI-1 and SPI-2, have been found (8, 22). SPI-1 is required for the invasion of mam- malian cells, and SPI-2 is required for replication in macro- phages and for survival in mice.  The release of the complete genome sequence of EHEC O157:H7 (9) provided us with an opportunity to identify se- quences specific for STEC strains. In this study, we report on a type III secretion locus in the STEC chromosome similar to the SPI-1 system. To estimate the roles of this locus in viru- lence expression in STEC, we show the distribution of this novel locus among various STEC strains, and we also discuss the transmission of STEC from animals to humans.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains and media. Table 1 lists all STEC strains used in the study. EHEC O157:H7 strain RIMD 0509952 (referred to here as EHEC O157 Sakai) was originally isolated from a patient in an outbreak in Sakai, Japan, in 1996 (14). Four EPEC isolates from humans were used in this study: B171-8 (O111:NM, where NM indicates nonmotile) (20), E2348/69 (O127:H7), 4394-57 (O114:NM), and 1929-55(O126:NM). Some STEC strains were isolated from deer (1), sheep (2), seagulls (2), houseflies (11), and salmon roe (15). Other STEC and EPEC strains are the stock isolates in our laboratory. Bacteria were cultured in Tryp- ticase soy broth (BBL/Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) or on Trypticase soy agar (BBL/Becton Dickinson).  Southern hybridization. Chromosomal DNA was extracted from EHEC, EPEC, and E. coli K-12 strains as described previously (17) and digested with EcoRI. The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels and were transferred to Hybond-N- positively charged nylon membranes (Amersham, Little Chalfont, England). DNA fragments corresponding to three separate regions in ETT2 of EHEC O157:H7 (region A, eprH-eprK; region B,  * Corresponding author.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.    RESULTS  Structure of a new locus that encodes a second type III secretion system. Based on the DNA sequence of the EHEC O157 Sakai chromosome, we searched for a DNA sequence unique to EHEC O157 which was not present in the E. coli K-12 genome. One such sequence consisted of a 17-kb region inserted between the sequences homologous to those at min 64 and 65 of the E. coli K-12 chromosome (Fig. 1). The 17-kb  insert showed no significant homology with the E. coli K-12 chromosome and contained 21 open reading frames (ORFs) (Table 4; Fig. 1). The G-C content of this region was 36.9%.  The deduced amino acid sequences of ORF2 to ORF5 and ORF7 to ORF20 were similar to those of proteins of the type III secretion system, which are required for the export of vir- ulence determinants in a variety of bacterial pathogens of plants and animals. The predicted proteins of ORF2 to ORF5 are similar in organization and sequences to the products of the prgH to prgK genes of Salmonella SPI-1. The predicted proteins of ORF7 to ORF20 are similar in organization and sequences to the products of the inv and spa genes of Salmo- nella SPI-1 but not to those of invB. They are also homologous to the mxi genes of Shigella flexneri (data not shown). For example, the predicted amino acid sequence of ORF2 is 53% identical to that of PrgK of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and 44% identical to that of MxiJ of S. flexneri 2a. The amino acid sequences of ORF3 to ORF5 are similar to those of PrgJ (31% identical), PrgI (64%), and PrgH (31%), respectively, of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium and to those of MxiI (32%), MxiH (58%), and MxiG (25%), respectively, of S. flexneri 2a. The entire organization and amino acid sequences of the ORFs in this 17-kb region are closely related to those of SPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (Fig. 1). In addition to these ORFs, the predicted protein of ORF1, which is located downstream of ORF2 and extends to the homologous se- quence in E. coli K-12, showed significant similarity to the  TABLE 2.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.    ORF5 showed a high degree of similarity to that of the se- quence upstream of the prgH gene in S. enterica serovar Ty- phimurium. Because of the high degree of similarity of each ORF to the genes in SPI-1 of Salmonella spp., the region from ORF5 to ORF2 was designated eprH to eprK, the region from ORF12 to ORF7 was designated epaO to epaS, and the region from ORF19 to ORF13 was designated eivF to eivJ (Fig. 1).  In SPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the DNA be- tween spaS and prgH encodes secreted proteins, chaperones, and transcriptional regulatory proteins; but the region between epaS and eprH of EHEC O157 Sakai contains no ORF similar to these genes. Instead, ORF6 had a low, but significant degree of similarity to several transcriptional regulatory proteins, in- cluding NtrC of Herbaspirillum seropedicae (25% identity and 40% similarity in a 107-amino-acid overlap) and UhpA of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (29% identity and 49% similar- ity in a 68-amino-acid overlap). Consequently, the 17-kb region encodes the complete set of proteins for the type III secretion system apparatus but does not include the target or chaperone proteins. This locus contains a set of genes for the type III secretion system. Therefore, to distinguish this locus from a set of genes for type III secretion in LEE, we designated this locus ETT2, for E. coli type III secretion locus 2.  Conservation of ETT2 sequences among STEC strains. To examine the degree of conservation of the ETT2 sequence among pathogenic E. coli isolates from humans, Southern hy- bridization was performed with probes derived from the DNA corresponding to eprH to eprK (probe A in Fig. 1; Table 2), epaO to epaS (probe B), and eivF to eivA (probe C). All seven EHEC O157 strains had DNA sequences homologous to the sequence of the ETT2 locus (Table 5). However, EHEC O26 strains from humans contained DNA sequences homologous to probes A and B, but not to probe C (Table 5). The same pattern of hy- bridization observed with O26 was observed with four EPEC strains, but the DNA sequence that hybridized with ETT2- specific probes was not found in nonpathogenic strain E. coli HB101. To survey the distribution of the ETT2 locus among various STEC isolates, a PCR was performed by using three primer sets specific for regions L, C, and D in the ETT2 locus (Fig. 1; Table 2). It was found that the results of the PCR co- incided with those of Southern hybridization (Tables 1 and 5).  Thus, a PCR survey was undertaken to determine the dis- tribution of the ETT2 locus among 56 STEC isolates of various origins (Table 1). Sixteen STEC isolates had a complete ETT2 locus of L, D, and C regions (Table 1); 15 isolates were sero- type O157, and one isolate, from a deer, was Out:H25 (where Out represents all O antiserum negative). Although four EPEC isolates and two O26 isolates had only an L region, according to PCR (Table 5), eight other STEC isolates were also of this type (Table 1): four were O26 and four were O119 ONT:H- (where ONT means some O antiserum positive but not identified), O153:H-, and Out:H-. Eight STEC strains, including five O157 strains, had a complete L region and either a C region or a D region. However, among these eight strains, STEC HI-7 and HI-N had complete L and C regions and a D region with a short insertion (Table 1). Six other STEC strains had complete L and D regions but no C region (Table 1). The ETT2 locus was identified in O157 Sakai, and all O157 isolates of human origin had a complete ETT2 locus. Each of the O157 strains originating from a housefly, salmon roe, and six cattle also had a complete ETT2 locus (Table 1; Fig. 2). However,  FIG. 2.

VOL. 41, 2003 DISTRIBUTION OF ETT2 LOCUS AMONG STEC ISOLATES 2345    other O157 STEC strains from cattle had only the L and D regions (Table 1).  Distributions of other virulence factors among STEC strains. Previously, we examined the distributions of the eae and hlyA genes among STEC isolates of various origins using eae com- mon primers and hlyA-specific primers (1, 2, 11). In the present study, the eae gene was classified by PCR and production of intimin was determined by Western blotting analysis with anti- intimin antibody. O157 STEC isolates commonly had eae-- and produced intimin, regardless of their origins (Table 1; Fig. 3). In addition, all O157 STEC isolates except MB1, of cattle ori- gin, had the hlyA gene. Among the other serotypes tested, O119 and O26 isolates commonly had the eae-- gene and produced intimin (Table 1; Fig. 3). Among them, eight isolates had the hlyA gene; among them, five isolates had the complete L re- gion, eae, and hlyA. Most other STEC isolates had no eae gene and did not produce intimin (Table 1). STEC strains isolated from seagulls, deer, and sheep belonged to this group (Table 1).  DISCUSSION  A secondary type III secretion system, which was designated ETT2 (E. coli type III secretion system 2), was found in EHEC serotype O157:H7 isolates, in addition to the first system en- coded by the LEE locus. This ETT2 locus contains 19 ORFs highly homologous with the SPI-1 type III secretion system of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium; the organization of those ORFs was also similar to that of SPI-1. However, slight differ- ences from SPI-1 were found: (i) SpaR was separated into two ORFs, epaR1 and epaR2, in the ETT2 locus, and (ii) InvB and InvH were absent from the ETT2 locus (Table 1). In the Salmonella SPI-1 system, InvH is necessary for localization of InvG onto the outer membrane, but it is not a component of the type III secretion apparatus (4), while the function of InvB remains unknown (6). Therefore, the ETT2 locus seems to encode a complete set of the type III secretion machinery. Indeed, the complete cloned sequence of ETT2 confers upon E. coli K-12 strain DH5-- the ability to secrete the EspB protein (T. Tobe, unpublished data).  In SPI-1, genes coding secreted (effector) proteins such as sipBCDA, the chaperon sicP, and the regulator hilA were found in the region between the spa and prg operons. Instead of these genes, ORF6, which had 40% similarity to the NtrC transcrip- tional regulator (23) of H. seropedicae, was found in ETT2 (Fig. 1), consistent with the ORF6 product also being a tran- scriptional regulator. Genes encoding target secreted proteins  of the ETT2 locus may exist elsewhere on the O157 chromo- some, but we could not identify them. However, a search for other sequences unique to O157 would provide the informa- tion needed to identify those genes.  In EPEC and O26 strains, the ETT2 locus was found on the chromosome, but the chromosomes of EHEC O157 strains contained only half of the ETT2 locus. Therefore, the ETT2 DNA segment of EPEC B171-8 (O111:NM) was isolated and its DNA sequence was determined (GenBank accession no. AB052736); it was also inserted at min 64.5 of the E. coli K-12 chromosome and was highly homologous with the L region of the ETT2 sequence in EHEC O157 Sakai (Fig. 1). The se- quence corresponding to the eiv genes was absent from the ETT2 loci in EPEC and EHEC O26 strains (Fig. 1). All human STEC isolates had a complete or partial ETT2 locus, and notably, all O157 isolates had a complete ETT2 locus. Inter- estingly, those STEC and EPEC strains commonly had the L region with the epr and epa genes, suggesting that the ETT2 locus, especially the L-region locus, might be essential for the pathogenicity of O157 STEC isolates, as might the other known virulence factors encoded by the eae and hlyA genes. Although the association of the ETT2 locus with virulence in STEC was not clear, the pathogenicity of STEC might be estimated by PCR with the primer sets described in this study. For example, although non-O157 STEC strain S-8 had the complete ETT2 locus but not stx, eae, and hlyA, it might be pathogenic for humans. As O26 STEC strains AS1 and AS15 were isolated from humans, only the L region might be essen- tial for pathogenicity. In this sense, strains KR1, H8-55, and IK2 from cattle would be virulent strains. Also, O157 strains lacking only the C region from five cattle also would be virulent for humans. As an hlyA gene associated with pathogenicity was encoded by a large plasmid, this gene would easily be lost. Therefore, as the hlyA gene would not be a good marker for the estimation of virulence (21), O157 strains MB1, H5-26, and H8-87 might have originally been virulent. Finally, cattle should be one of the main sources of infection for the trans- mission of STEC to humans. In this study, O157 isolates from a fly and salmon roe were closely similar to O157 isolates of human origin. However, as the salmon roe was the food that caused the O157 outbreak in Japan (15) and the fly was caught on cow manure on a cattle farm (11), these results were not unexpected.  The G-C content of the ETT2 sequence was very low (36.9%) compared with that of the E. coli chromosome (50.8%) (3), suggesting that the ETT2 locus has been acquired laterally. Furthermore, the high degree of similarity of ETT2 to  FIG. 3. Western blotting analysis of intimin proteins from different STEC isolates. Western blotting was performed by using antiserum against intimin encoded by eae--. The results for representative STEC isolates are shown.  2346 MAKINO ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.    SPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium suggests that ETT2 and SPI-1 may have originated from the same organism. How- ever, the biological function of the ETT2 locus in the patho- genicity of STEC is not clear. The ETT2 locus might partici- pate in the pathogenicity of these bacteria in a manner other than adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, as the ETT2 locus is common in human STEC isolates, it would be a good marker for molecular epidemiological surveys of STEC strains pathogenic for humans.
