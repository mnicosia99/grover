Fat infiltration within marrow cavity is one of multitudinous features of estrogen deficiency, which leads to a decline in bone formation functionality. The origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it is derived from osteoblasts, which transdifferentiate into adipocytes that produce bone marrow fat. We examined the dose-dependent effect of 17b-estradiol on the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC)-derived osteoblasts to undergo osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. We found that 17b-estradiol significantly increased alkaline phosphatase activity (P,0.05); calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocn expression levels dose-dependently. By contrast, 17b- estradiol significantly decreased the number and size of lipid droplets, and Fabp4 and PPARc expression levels during osteo- adipogenic transdifferentiation (P,0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of brown adipocyte markers (Myf5, Elovl3, and Cidea) and undifferentiated adipocyte markers (Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b) were also affected by 17b-estradiol during osteo- adipogenic transdifferentiation. Western blotting and immunostaining further showed that canonical Wnt signaling can be activated by estrogen to exert its inhibitory effect of osteo-adipogenesis. This is the first study to demonstrate the dose- dependent effect of 17b-estradiol on the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs likely via canonical Wnt signaling. In summary, our results indicate that osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation modulated by canonical Wnt signaling pathway in bone metabolism may be a new explanation for the gradually increased bone marrow fat in estrogen-inefficient condition.

One possible cause of bone marrow fat deposition is the aberrant  commitment of bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMMSCs) into  adipocytes because of their inability to differentiate into other cell  lineages, such as osteoblasts. There exists an inverse relationship  between bone marrow fat production and bone formation during  osteoporosis, namely, adipogenesis is inhibited in patients with a  high bone mass [2,3]. However, the origin of bone marrow fat, the  physiological role of adipocytes in bone marrow, and the reasons  for the increase in adipogenesis during osteoporosis and the  abnormal adipogenic differentiation of BMMSCs are unclear.  In recent years, a correlation has been established between the  osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of bone marrow cells and  numerous bone metabolism diseases. Tuan et al. [4] have shown  that hBMMSC-derived osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes  had the potential to transdifferentiate to each lineage, and these  findings provided new insights on the pathogenesis of skeletal  diseases such as osteoporosis. Nevertheless, If and to what extent  established key factors or signaling pathways of normal osteogen-  esis and adipogenesis play a role in the transdifferentiation process  remains unknown.  Estrogen can regulate several signaling molecules such as Notch,  Erk, and Ephrin, which function in bone metabolism [5,6,7,8].  Endogenous estrogens also play an important role in the  development of bone marrow fat. Not only does uncoupling of  the bone remodeling units caused by a decrease in estrogen levels  especially after the menopause, there is also a notable increase in  adipogenic switch in bone marrow accompanied by a decline in  bone mass [9,10]. Several studies have shown that estrogen is a  negative regulator of adipogenesis [11,12] and essential for  osteogenic commitment [13]. For example, estrogen simulta-  neously induces osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis both in vivo  and in vitro, which led us to hypothesize that estrogen regulates  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99137  http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ http://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099137&domain=pdf   osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation and increases fat deposition  in the osteoporotic marrow.  The wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling  pathway plays a fundamental role during embryogenesis and  normal cell development. Recent studies in humans have shown  mutations in Wnt signaling molecules to result in different diseases  [11,12,13]. Importantly, Wnt signaling also regulates bone  development, adipogenic differentiation, and gene expression in  whole process of bone metabolism [14,15]. Specifically, canonical  Wnt/b-catenin signaling is highly animate in mesenchymal precursor cells and in directing pluripotent cells, especially toward  the osteoblast lineage while inhibiting adipogenic differentiation.  Canonical Wnt signaling is also involved in the suppression of  adipogenesis. For example, canonical Wnt signaling stabilizes and  promotes cellular and nuclear b-catenin levels, which inhibit adipogenesis [16], and the suppression of Wnt signaling is  indispensible for PPARc induction and preadipocyte differentiation [17].  Although estrogen can modulate Wnt signaling directly or  indirectly and affect bone metabolism [18,19,20], it is not known if  estrogen and Wnt signaling are involved in osteo-adipogenic  transdifferentiation. Therefore, we used estrogen-deficient murine  in vitro and in vivo models to investigate the effects of estrogen and  canonical Wnt signaling on osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation,  as well as to define the underlying mechanism.

Briefly, the  bone marrow was flushed out of long bones of mice and plated as a  cell suspension (0.56106 cells cm22) in a-MEM supplemented with 15% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and  100 mg/ml streptomycin. Culture dishes were incubated at 37uC in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The culture  medium was replaced every other day. Homogenous BMMSCs  were obtained through three generations.  Murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells were obtained from the  Center Laboratory for Tissue Engineering, College of Stomatol-  ogy, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, China [23,24].  MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in a-MEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37uC in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.  Osteoblastic Differentiation and Osteo-adipogenic Transdifferentiation of BMMSCs and MC3T3-E1 Cells To induce osteogenesis, BMMSCs or MC3T3-E1 cells were  cultured at 16105 cells/cm2 in DMEM expansion medium supplemented with osteogenic supplements, 1 mM dexametha- sone, 10 mM b-glycerophosphate, and 50 mg/ml ascorbic acid for 14 days or 28days.  To induce adipogenic differentiation, cells were cultured at  16105 cells/cm2 in adipogenic hormonal cocktail expansion medium supplemented with 10 mM dexamethasone, 5 mg/ml insulin, and 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxantine for 7 or 14 days.  The medium was replaced every other day. For transdifferentia-  tion studies, BMMSCs or MC3T3-E1 cells were first cultured in  osteogenic medium for 14 or 28 days. Partially or fully-  differentiated osteoblasts were then cultured in adipogenic  medium for 7 or 14 days.  Figure 1.

Phenol red-free adipogenic medium was used to  eliminate experimental interference. To investigate the dose-  dependent effect of estrogen on osteo-adipogenic transdifferentia-  tion, OVX-derived BMMSCs were treated with increasing  concentrations of 17b-estradiol (161028 M, 561028 M, 161027 M, 561027 M, and 161026 M) for 14 days.  Modulation of Canonical Wnt Signaling in vitro To investigate the role of canonical Wnt signaling in the  estrogen-induced transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells, recom-  binant WNT-3a or DKK-1 protein was added into phenol red-  free adipogenic medium supplemented with 161027 M each of 17b-estradiol and ICI. MC3T3-E1 cells were divided into two groups. In the first group, cells were cultured in osteogenic  medium for 14 days, followed by an additional 14-day incubation  with adipogenic hormonal cocktail medium supplemented with  17b-estradiol (161027 M) and DKK-1 (50 ng/ml), an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling. In the second group, cells were cultured  in osteogenic medium for 14 days, followed by an additional 14-  day incubation with adipogenic hormonal cocktail medium  supplemented with 161027 M each of 17b-estradiol and ICI, and WNT-3a (50 ng/ml), an activator of canonical Wnt signaling.  Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to inves-  tigate the roles of estrogen and canonical Wnt signaling in the  osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells.  Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) Staining and Activity Assay Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),  fixed with 10% formalin in PBS for 30 s, rinsed with deionized  water, and stained with a BCIP/NBT alkaline phosphatase color  development kit under protection from direct light. To measure  ALP activity, the cells were lysed with RIPA buffer. The samples  were then centrifuged at 10,0006 g for 5 min, and ALP activity was measured in clear supernatants with an ALP activity assay kit.  Total protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford  protein assay. ALP activity was normalized to total protein  concentrations.  Alizarin Red Staining for the Mineralized Matrix Cells were fixed in ice-cold 10% formalin for 20 min and  stained with 40 mM alizarin red S (pH 4.4, Sigma Chemical) for  45 min at room temperature. To estimate matrix calcification, the  stain was solubilized with 10% cetylpyridinum chloride by shaking  for 15 min. The absorbance of the released alizarin red S was  measured at 562 nm [25].  Oil red O Staining and Quantification of Adipocytes Transdifferentiated adipocyte fat droplets within osteoblasts  were observed by the oil red O staining method with minor  modifications [26]. Cell monolayers were fixed in 4% parafor-  maldehyde, washed with water, and stained with 0.6% (w/v) oil  Figure 2.

Results  Estrogen Inhibits the Osteo-adipogenic Transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 Cells We first investigated the effect of estrogen on the osteo-  adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. 10 27  M of  17beta-estradiol was added into adipogenic medium after 14 days'  osteogenesis. ALP activity assay, alizarin red and oil red staining  (Fig. 1A, B, and Fig. 2A) showed 17b-estradiol to suppress osteo- adipogenic transdifferentiation. Specifically, the mineralized ma-  trix area of MC3T3-E1 cells cultured in the presence of 17b- estradiol for 14 days was larger than that of cells cultured in the  presence of ICI. 17b-Estradiol also affected the morphology of fully-differentiated adipocytes and decreased the number and size  of lipid droplets. However, this effect could be neutralized when  ICI was used to inhibit the effect of 17b-estradiol, indicating that estrogen inhibits osteo-adipogenic transdiffentiation. Moreover,  ALP activity, calcium deposition, and the quantification of lipid  Figure 4.

In addition, 17b-estradiol increased (Fig. 1E) and decreased (Fig. 2C) the levels of osteogenic and adipogenic  markers, whereas there were no changes in cells simultaneously  treated with 17b-estradiol and ICI. To confirm the delicate changes in osteo-adipogenic transdiffentiation, we examined the  expression levels of pre-adipogenic markers, namely, Dlk1, Gata2,  and Wnt10b in MC3T3-E1 cells. Figure 2C showed that  dedifferentiation preceded the process of transdifferentiation and  with the induction of adipogensis getting longer, fully-differenti-  ated osteoblasts regained their ability to multi-differentiate into the  adipogenic lineage, whereas fully-differentiated adipocytes dedif-  ferentiated in the presence of 17b-estradiol. Figure 2D also showed that 17b-Estradiol downregulated the expression levels of brown adipocyte markers, namely, Myf5, Elovl3, and Cidea, during  transdifferentiation, indicating that activation of brown adipogenic  genes may be occurring, but at a much later stage in the  transdifferentiation process.  Estrogen Dose-dependently Regulates the Osteo- adipogenesis Transdifferentiation of Primary BMMSCs To expand the role of 17b-estradiol in transdifferentiation, we  used an ovariectomized C57BL/6 mouse model to investigate the  ability of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts to transdifferentiate under  osteoporotic conditions. We found the transdifferentiation poten-  tial of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the OVX group to be  higher than that of control cells. In addition, the expression levels  of osteogenic markers in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the  OVX group were lower than those in cells from the control. After  7 and 14 days of adipogenesis, the expression levels of adipogenic  markers increased (Fig. S2). By morphological analysis, BMMSCs  derived osteoblasts from the OVX group transdifferentiated into  the adipogenic lineage more easily than cells from the sham-  Figure 5.

After 14 days' osteogenesis, two groups of MC3T3-E1 cells were divided.

ALP activity assay, and alizarin red and oil red  staining (Fig. 3A, B, and Fig. 4A) also showed differences in osteo-  adipogenic transdifferentiation between groups. Specifically, the  mineralized matrix area of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the  OVX group was smaller than that of cells from the control. The  morphology of fully-differentiated osteoblasts from the OVX  group was also different compared to that of control cells, with a  marked increase in the number and size of lipid droplets.  To determine the optimal concentration of 17b-estradiol for the induction of transdifferentiation, BMMSCs derived osteoblasts  were treated with increasing concentrations of the hormone. Our  results showed transdifferentiation of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts  from the OVX group to decrease with increasing concentration of  17b-estradiol. This was accompanied by an increase in the mineralized matrix area and a decrease in the number and size of  lipid droplets as shown by an ALP activity assay, and alizarin red  and oil red staining (Fig. 3A, B, and Fig. 4A). However, there was  no difference in the ability of cells treated with 17b-estradiol at 161027 M and 561027 M to transdifferentiate by RT-PCR and morphological analysis. These findings were supported by results  from the calcium deposition, and the quantification of lipid  number and size (Fig. 3C, D and Fig. 4B). To inhibit  transdifferentiation, 17b-estradiol was used at 161026 and 161025 M; however, there were no changes compared to 161027 M. Thus, the potential for osteo-adpogenic transdiffer- entiation was greater in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the  OVX group than that of control cells, and with the intervention of  optimum concentrations of 17beta-estradiol, the potential got  weaker, which further proved the dose-dependent effect of  estrogen on the transdifferentiation process.  Estrogen Suppresses Osteo-adipogenic Transdifferentiation via Canonical Wnt Signaling To understand the role of canonical Wnt signaling in osteo-  adipogenic transdifferentiation, we used recombinant WNT-3a  and DKK-1 proteins to activate and inhibit this pathway,  respectively. We found significant increases in ALP staining and  activity; calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocn  expression levels in cells treated with WNT-3a, 17b-estradiol, and ICI (P,0.05) (Fig. 5G). However, there was a decrease in the  expression levels of bone formation markers when cells were  treated with 17b-estradiol and DKK-1 (Fig. 5A, B, D, and E). The co-incubation of cells with 17b-estradiol and DKK-1 also increased the number and size of lipid droplets (Fig. 5C, F) and  reduced Fabp4, PPARc, Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b expression levels (Fig. 5H). By contrast, the incubation of cells with 17b-estradiol, WNT-3a, and ICI decreased the expression levels of adipogenic  markers. Furthermore, western blotting and immunocytochemis-  try showed canonical Wnt signaling to affect osteo-adipogeic  transdifferentiation in the presence of estrogen and ICI. Specif-  ically, Western blot showed that Wnt-3a accompanied with  10 27  M of 17beta-estradiol and ICI increased b-catenin expres- sion level, while reduced the expression of GSK-3b level.

Moreover, immunostaining showed that WNT-  3a, 17b-estradiol, and ICI increased the levels of total and the relative nuclear b-catenin while decreased the level of total Gsk- 3b, whereas DKK-1 inhibited the effect induced by 10  27 M of  17b-estradiol (Fig. 6B, C). From the data presented above, we firmly believed that dose-  dependent estrogen can inhibit the osteo-adipogenic transdiffer-  ention effect of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine BMMSCs derived  osteoblasts via partially or maybe dependently controlling  canonical Wnt signaling pathway.  Discussion  This study showed for the first time the dose-responsive effect of  17b-estradiol on the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine BMMSC-derived osteoblasts to transdifferentiate into adipocytes  likely via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Transdifferentia-  tion is the irreversible switching of differentiated cells that  sometimes occurs during disease [29]. It occurs when partially  differentiated cells (e.g., pre-osteoblasts) switch to another lineage  (e.g., adipocytes) [30]. This phenomenon can occur between  committed or differentiated osteoblasts and adipocytes, and it has  even been reported to occur at the single cell level [31,32,33,34].  The adipogenic transdifferentiation potential of MC3T3-E1  cells has been previously shown by the ectopic expression of  adipogenic transcription factors, namely, PPARc, C/EBPa, or both [35]. Moreover, several factors can regulate osteo-adipogenic  transdifferentiation, which is consistent with our finding that 17b- estradiol can inhibit the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of  MC3T3-E1 cells. In this study, we used time-dependent in vitro  transdifferentiation models and reported that MC3T3-E1 cells  underwent osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation under proper  conditions. With increasing time after osteogenic induction, the  osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation potential decreased. Specifi-  cally, the transdifferentiation potential of 3- and 7-day-old  osteogenic MC3T3-E1 cells was higher than that of 14- and 21-  day-old cells (Fig. S1). However, 3- and 7- day-old osteogenic  MC3T3-E1 cells did not fully differentiate into mature osteoblasts.  Therefore, the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation effect of them  can hardly win applause. Moreover, the osteo-adipogenic  transdifferentiation potential of 21-day-old osteogenic MC3T3-  E1 cells was hardly observed both by RT-PCR and morphological  analysis. Therefore, transdifferentiation was studied in 14-day-old  osteogenic adipocytes.  Estrogen can regulate the differentiation potential of BMMSCs  into the osteoblast or adipocyte lineage. Recent studies have  shown a correlation between a decreased estrogen level after  menopause and a marked increase in bone marrow adipogenesis  [9,10]. In light of these findings, we used an ovariectomized mouse  model to investigate the effects of 17b-estradiol on transdiffer- entiation. We found the transdifferentiation potential to be higher  in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the OVX group than that of  control cells. In addition, increasing concentrations of 17b- estradiol could partially or completely reverse osteo-adipogenic  transdifferentiation in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts, illustrating  the dose-dependent effects of estrogen. Although estrogen has  been shown to inhibit and promote adipogenesis and osteogenesis  both in vivo and in vitro, respectively [9,36,37], this is the first study  to demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of estrogen on the osteo-  adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine  BMMSCs derived osteoblasts and further efforts should be made  urgently to clarify the detailed mechanism among the magic  transdifferentiation process.  Santanam et al. showed that an in vitro E2 concentration of  10 29  to 10 28  M is generally regarded as a physiologic concen-  tration. Although men have lower estrogen level compared to  women, the level may be still higher than the physiologic level  which is enough to maintain bone mass in vivo [38]. Moreover,  the mechanism of osteoporosis is very complex and estrogen only  functions as one part of the metabolism process. There are still  many other factors which control the bone mass such as androgens  [39], PTH [40], mechanical stress [41], diet [42] and metabolism  of calcium and phosphorous [43]. And these factors might  compensate the role of low-level estrogen on bone metabolism of  men.  Having established that MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSC-derived  osteoblasts transdifferentiated into adipocytes, the expression levels  of several brown fat-specific markers were examined to determine  whether the cells being formed were white or brown adipocytes.  Recent findings from lineage tracing studies have shown that  brown adipocytes develop in vivo from a myf5-positive progenitor  cell [44], suggesting that myf5-expressing MC3T3-E1 cells and  BMMSCs might develop into brown adipocytes. In this study, myf5  expression in MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs was upregulated  when cells were cultured in adipogenic medium. Other brown  adipocyte-specific markers such as Elovl3 and Cidea were also  activated in cells cultured in adipogenic medium, but not until day  7 of adipogenic differentiation, and their expression was more  variable. These results demonstrate that activation of brown  adipogenic genes may be occurring, but at a later stage in the  transdifferentiation process, for which further investigation is  required. Although 17b-estradiol failed to upregulate brown fat genes, our results indicate that the dose-dependent changes in lipid  accumulation correlate with white rather than brown adipogen-  esis.  We also found that osteo-adipogenic transdifferention upregu-  lated adipogenic markers such as PPARc and Fabp4, but downregulated osteogenic markers such as Alp, Runx2, Col1a1,  and Ocn. Moreover, the expression levels of Dlk1, Gata2, and  Wnt10b, which are highly expressed in undifferentiated preadipo-  cytes, were induced. These results indicate that transdifferentiation  process combines the effect of transdifferentiation, dedifferentia-  tion, proliferation and differentiation together. Specifically, the  dedifferentiation effect was indeed happened prior to the  transdifferentiation, and with the induction of adipogenesis getting  longer, fully-differentiated osteoblasts regained the multi-differen-  tiation potential and then differentiated to adipogenic lineage.  What's more, under the intervention of 17b-estradiol, fully- differentiated mature adipocyte could be dedifferentiating again.  Gustafson et al. [45] have shown that Wnt signaling in mature  adipocytes increases the b-catenin level, resulting in the dediffer- entiation of 3T3L1 pre-adipocyte cells, which may have been  modulated by canonical Wnt signaling [46,47,48]. Activation of  canonical Wnt signaling has been reported to inhibit adipogenesis  [16], and inhibition of Wnt signaling, especially WNT-3a, is  essential for PPARc upregulation and preadipocyte differentiation [17]. These findings are in line with previous studies that show the  involvement of estrogen and canonical Wnt signaling in bone  metabolism [18,19,20]. Luis et al. have also demonstrated that the  transdifferentiation of human osteoblasts into adipocytes increased  after treatment with fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor blocker.  They also suspected the transdifferentiation process might be  related to down-regulation of b-catenin [49]. These inspired us about the mechanism of Wnt signaling on the transdifferentiation  Estrogen Suppresses Transdifferentiation via Wnt Signaling Pathway  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99137    of MC3T3-E1 cells and primary murine BMMSCs derived  osteoblasts under estrogen control.  We used MC3T3-E1 cells to investigate the roles of estrogen  and canonical Wnt signaling in osteo-adipogenic transdifferentia-  tion. 17b-estradiol dose-dependently inhibited the transdifferentia- tion of MC3T3-E1 cells via canonical Wnt signaling partially or  dependently. RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunocytochem-  istry results showed that WNT-3a activated canonical Wnt  signaling and inhibited osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation inde-  pendent of 17b-estradiol and ICI. DKK-1 also blocked canonical Wnt signaling to relieve the inhibition of the osteo-adipogenic  transdifferentiation from the presence of 17b-estradiol. These data indicate that canonical Wnt signaling might act downstream of  estrogen to regulate osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. These  results also support the plasticity of MC3T3-E1 cells and  BMMSC-derived osteoblasts, and they suggest that these cells  can be used for cell engineering. In light of the findings that  canonical Wnt signaling induces the dedifferentiation of fully-  differentiated adipocytes and inhibits the transdifferentiation of  osteoblasts, it is possible that perturbations in this signaling cascade  may result in bone metabolism diseases such as osteoporosis.  Given the widespread prevalence of estrogen deficiency,  especially in post-menopausal women, it is important to under-  stand the role of this hormone in osteo-adipogenic transdiffer-  entiation. Moreover, the involvement of canonical Wnt signaling  in this cellular process is likely to provide further insights on the  pathogenesis of osteoporosis.
