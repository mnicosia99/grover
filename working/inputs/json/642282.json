    "summary": "Various molecules such as cytokines and anticancer drugs, as well as factor deprivation, rapidly induce apoptosis (programmed cell death), which is morphologically characterized by cell shrinkage and the blebbing of plasma membranes and by nuclear condensation. Caspases, particularly caspase 3, are proteases that are activated during apoptosis and which cleave substrates such as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, actin, fodrin, and lamin. Apoptosis is also accompanied by the internucleosomal degradation of chromosomal DNA. In the accompanying Article, we have identified and molecularly cloned a caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD) and its inhibitor (ICAD). Here we show that caspase 3 cleaves ICAD and inactivates its CAD-inhibitory effect. We identified two caspase-3 cleavage sites in ICAD by site-directed mutagenesis. When human Jurkat cells were transformed with ICAD-expressing plasmid, occupation of the receptor Fas, which normally triggers apoptosis, did not result in DNA degradation. The ICAD transformants were also resistant to staurosporine-induced DNA degradation, although staurosporine still killed the cells by activating caspase. Our results indicate that activation of CAD downstream of the caspase cascade is responsible for internucleosomal DNA degradation during apoptosis, and that ICAD works as an inhibitor of this process.",

ARNOLD5  Department of Biomedical Sciences and Periodontics, Baylor College of Dentistry, Dallas, Texas1; Emory University2  and Morehouse School of Medicine,3 Atlanta, Georgia; Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts4; and University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina5  Received 29 January 1996/Returned for modification 12 March 1996/Accepted 27 March 1996  Previous studies have shown that the physical, biochemical, and antigenic properties of the bacterial outer membrane are profoundly influenced by the growth environment. In the present study, the effects of growth in hemin-replete (H1) and hemin-depleted (H2) media on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Our studies show that LPS from P. gingivalis cultured in H1media (H1LPS) expressed additional low-molecular-mass antigens, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly- acrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Particularly evident was a 26-kDa antigen (26 LPSC) that was lost from the LPS upon transfer of P. gingivalis into H2 media. The loss of the 26 LPSC was accompanied by a marked reduction in the hemin-binding capacity of the LPS. The 26 LPSC was refractory to Coomassie blue staining and proteinase K digestion. H1LPS from strain W50/BE1, a nonpig- mented pleiotropic strain, lacked the 26 LPSC and did not bind hemin. Polyclonal antiserum raised to whole-cell antigens of P. gingivalis A7436, W83, and HG405 grown in H1 media, but not in H2 media, recognized the 26 LPSC in the purified H1LPS from any of the three strains. The immunoreactivities of sera from humans with (n 5 24) or without (n 5 25) periodontitis to the 26 LPSC and other H1LPS determinants were analyzed by Western blot. Overall, 75% of adult periodontitis patient sera reacted with multiple bands in the H1LPS stepladder, particularly in the range of 14 to 27 kDa. In contrast, only 20% of control sera reacted faintly with H1LPS bands in the range 27 to 34 kDa. The 26 LPSC was recognized by over 40% of sera from adult patients with periodontitis and none of the healthy control sera. Taken together, these results suggest that the antigenicity and hemin-binding properties of P. gingivalis LPS can be modified by growth in H1media.  Lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are among the most potent cell agonists known: LPS can act at picomolar concentrations to trigger host inflammatory cells to release toxic oxygen radicals, arachidonic acid derivatives, and cytokines (20). These prod- ucts can in turn initiate a cascade of pathophysiological events that can culminate in septic shock and tissue destruction (30). The LPS of Porphyromonas (formerly Bacteroides) gingivalis, an opportunistic oral pathogen, has relatively little proinflamma- tory activity according to some reports (for a review, see ref- erence 16), while other reports suggest that it has potent proin- flammatory activity (6). These contradictory reports may relate to different growth conditions and to different methods of LPS purification. P. gingivalis is subjected to many environmental changes in the gingival crevice during periodontal disease ac- tivity, including a decrease in the redox potential (21), an increase in gingival bleeding on mild stimulation (11), and an increase in crevicular fluid iron (up to 170 mM iron) (22). Much of the crevicular fluid iron is thought to be derived from the hemin molecule (13). While the iron atom in the hemin molecule is the critical constituent for growth, the protopor- phyrin IX ring has been suggested to play a role in the binding and transport of iron into the cell (13). Modifying the hemin concentration in the growth medium has been shown to mod- ulate the virulence of P. gingivalis, presumably through alter- ations in outer membrane protein expression (3); however, the effects of hemin on P. gingivalis LPS have not been examined.  Interestingly, the LPS of several bacterial species (2, 24), in- cluding P. gingivalis (13), can bind hemin and may play a role in hemin sequestration and storage (26). In the present study, the effects of growth of P. gingivalis in  hemin-replete (H1) media and hemin-depleted (H2) media on specific physical, biochemical, and antigenic properties of P. gingivalis LPS were examined. Our results indicate that growth of P. gingivalis in H1 media results in the expression of an additional 26-kDa moiety (the 26 LPSC). The 26 LPSC is re- fractory to Coomassie blue staining and proteinase K diges- tion, is immunogenic, and is recognized by serum antibodies from periodontitis patients but not healthy control subjects. The 26 LPSC was lost upon transfer of P. gingivalis into H2 media, which was accompanied by a decrease in the hemin- binding capacity of the LPS.  MATERIALS AND METHODS  Bacterial strains and culture conditions. P. gingivalis A7436, a clinical isolate originally characterized by the late V. R. Dowell (Anaerobic Laboratory, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga.), was the principal strain used in this study. Also employed in the LPS studies were strains W83, ATCC 33277 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.), W50, W50/BE1 (kindly provided by A. S. McKee, PALS, Porton Down, United Kingdom), HG 405, HG 864 (kindly provided by A. J. Van Winkelhoff, Academic Center for Dentistry, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), and the transpositional mutant strain MSM-3, which has a defect in the transport and utilization of heme (13). Stock cultures were maintained on anaerobic blood agar plates (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.) in an anaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.) at 378C in an atmosphere of 85% N2-5% H2-10% CO2. The expression of LPS was examined after P. gingivalis in was cultured in H1 medium or H2 medium, as described previously (13). Briefly, late-exponential-phase cultures of P. gingivalis cultured in H1 media were initially transferred as a 10% (vol/vol) inoculum to anaerobically equilibrated H2 media and incubated at 378C in an anaerobic atmosphere for 24 h. The 24-h P. gingivalis culture in H2 medium served as the  * Corresponding author. Mailing address: Department of Periodon- tics and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Dentistry, P.O.

Growth was monitored by A660 (Pharmacia LKB spectrophotometer) and by total viable cell counts determined by serial dilution on anaerobic blood agar plates. Late-exponential-phase cultures in ei- ther H1 or H2 medium were used for LPS extraction. H1 medium contained 1.5 mM hemin and consisted of either a complex, commercially available medium (2.8% Schaedler broth; Difco, Detroit, Mich.) or a less complex, basal medium (14). H2 medium contained no added hemin and consisted of either a complex, commercially available medium (Trypticase soy broth; Difco) or basal medium without added hemin. Basal medium contains the following per liter: trypticase peptone, 10 g; tryptophan, 0.2 g; sodium sulfite, 0.1 g; and cysteine (14). LPS purification. LPS cultured in H1 medium (H1LPS) or H2 medium  (H2LPS) were extracted from P. gingivalis by the hot-phenol-water technique (32) followed by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation (9). Briefly, approxi- mately 10 g (wet weight) of P. gingivalis was suspended in 35 ml of pyrogen-free water-35 ml of 90% phenol at 658C added dropwise for 20 min and stirred constantly. The aqueous phase was separated by centrifugation at 7,000 3 g for 20 min and collected. This process was repeated, and the aqueous phase was pooled and dialyzed extensively against deionized water for 3 days. The dialyzed LPS preparation was subjected to cesium chloride isopycnic density gradient centrifugation (in 0.5837 g of CsCl2-4.4 ml of the LPS preparation) at 42,000 rpm for 72 h in a Beckman (Palo Alto, Calif.) L-60 Ultracentrifuge. The refractive indices of the gradient fractions were determined with a refractometer, and values were converted to density (grams per milliliter). Fractions containing LPS (density fractions between 1.42 and 1.52 g/ml) were pooled, dialyzed against distilled water for 3 days, lyophilized, and stored at room temperature. LPS was analyzed for protein by the Pierce BCA protein assay. LPS samples were also separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE) and stained for protein with Coomassie blue. Selected LPS samples were also subjected to proteinase K digestion, as described previously (4). Briefly, LPS samples were incubated with proteinase K (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) (100 mg per mg of LPS) for 1 h at 608C. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added directly to this preparation, which was heated at 1008C for 5 min and applied to the gel (data not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis of LPS. H1LPS and H2LPS were subjected to SDS-  PAGE with the Laemmli buffer system (19) using 12.5% gels or commercially prepared 10 to 20% gradient gels (Integrated Separation Systems, Hyde Park, Mass.). LPS samples suspended in saline were sonicated for 5 s and heated in SDS sample buffer at 1008C for 5 min. Gel electrophoresis was carried out at 27 mA per gel through the 4% stacking gel and 33 mA per gel through the resolving gel. The current was stopped when the dye front reached the bottom of the gel. One gel was stained with 0.2% (wt/vol) Coomassie brilliant blue R250 (Fisher Scientific Company, Fairlawn, N.J.) in 25% (vol/vol) isopropanol-7% (vol/vol) acetic acid, and the other gel was silver stained by using the Tsai and Frasch technique (29). Electroblotting and probing nitrocellulose. Electroblotting was performed by  using the buffer system of Towbin et al. (27) in the Protean 1 transfer cell (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.) running at 40 V for 16 h and then 80 V for 30 minutes. Briefly, blotted nitrocellulose was cut into 5 mm strips (see Fig. 3), and the strips were placed in separate wells in an incubation tray (Bio-Rad). After being washed three times in washing buffer-Tween 20 (WBT), unreacted sites were blocked with 100 mg of human serum albumin (Sigma) in WBT, washed three times in WBT, and treated with a 1:50 dilution of patient serum in WBT overnight (or a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal rabbit antiserum [see Fig. 2]) at 48C. After being washed three times in WBT, blots were probed with a 1:2,000 dilution of rabbit anti-human immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase (or goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase for Fig. 2) for 30 min. After being washed three times in WBT and once in washing buffer, bands were developed with 0.06% 4-chloro-1-naphthol in washing buffer and 30% H2O2. The color reaction was stopped with washing buffer at the desired intensity. Generation of rabbit antiserum. Antisera to P. gingivalis strains grown in H1  medium (Schaedler broth) were produced in New Zealand White female rabbits (3 to 4 kg) with the use of a procedure described by Parent et al. (23). Briefly, the rabbits received daily intravenous injections into the marginal ear vein with increasing doses of a formalin-killed bacterial suspension (approximately 1.2 3 109 cells per ml in saline) ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 ml for a total of 10 injections, and 1 week later they received a booster series of three daily injections with 1.5 ml of the antigen suspension. On day 27, 50 ml of blood was drawn from the central artery of the ear. A series of booster injections were repeated at biweekly intervals after this test bleeding, and peak antibody titers were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (10). The sera obtained were pooled to prepare antisera against the bacteria and frozen at 2708C. Patient selection. Sera were obtained from 24 patients with chronic adult  periodontitis (AP) and 25 healthy control subjects. The minimum clinical criteria for acceptance into the study as an AP patient were (i) no previous periodontal treatment, (ii) age of at least 30 years, and (iii) one or more periodontal pockets of at least 6 mm and at least 30% bone loss at those sites. AP patient sera were further segregated by patient age, sex, race, and disease severity. Five sera were obtained from patients with mild AP (American Academy of Periodontology [AAP] type II), 12 sera were from patients with moderate AP (AAP type III), and 7 sera were from patients with severe AP (AAP type IV). The guidelines for these clinical criteria are described elsewhere (1). The 25 control patients were age, sex, and race matched and had no periodontal pockets greater than 4 mm  and no detectable generalized or localized bone loss. Subjects with a history of systemic disease or receiving antimicrobial therapy or other chemotherapeutic agents 4 weeks prior to participation in the study were not included. Approxi- mately 30 ml of blood was drawn from the antecubital vein of each patient, 20 ml was allowed to clot, and the serum was drawn off and centrifuged to remove erythrocytes. Serum was aliquoted and frozen at 2708C. A complete battery of clinical laboratory tests, including SMA-22 and complete blood count, was per- formed on the remainder of the blood, and patients with significant deviations from the norm were excluded from the study and advised to seek medical consultations. Hemin binding assays. The binding of hemin to whole cells and LPS of P.  gingivalis was analyzed spectrophotometrically, as previously described (14, 15). Whole-cell hemin binding was analyzed as follows. P. gingivalis grown in either H1 or H2 medium (basal medium) for 24 h was pelleted, washed in phosphate- buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS to an optical density at 660 nm of 1.5 (1010 CFU/ml). To this was added hemin to a final concentration of 30 mg/ml (based on previous saturation studies [14]). A 1.0-ml sample was imme- diately removed, cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was analyzed spectro- photometrically for hemin (optical density at 400 nm). The remaining cells were incubated at 378C under anaerobic conditions and assayed at 5- to 15-min intervals for residual hemin in the supernatant. P. gingivalis cultures without added hemin or hemin without added cells served as a control. The concentra- tion of hemin present in the supernatant fractions was calculated from a hemin standard curve. Binding of hemin to whole cells was calculated as the difference between the total hemin added and the amount remaining in the supernatant at each time point compared with that at time zero (14). The binding of hemin to LPS was analyzed as follows: lyophilized H1LPS and H2LPS were reconstituted to 1 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. A 0.05-ml sample of each LPS was added to 0.60 ml of PBS containing a total of 30 mg of hemin, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at 48C with shaking. LPS-hemin complexes were removed by high-speed centrifugation (30,000 3 g for 60 min) followed by ultrafiltration (membrane with an Mr cutoff of 10,000) (15), and the resulting supernatant fractions were assayed spectrophotometrically for residual hemin (optical density at 400 nm). Hemin binding was calculated as described above.  RESULTS  SDS-PAGE analysis of LPS from P. gingivalis cultured in H1 and H2 media. LPS from all P. gingivalis strains tested (except strain W50 BE1) separated into stepladder-like bands that migrated at a molecular mass range (relative to the mi- gration of protein standards) of ca. 14 to 50 kDa. This migra- tion pattern was similar to that obtained with commercially prepared smooth-chemotype LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (Sigma Chemical Co.). Interestingly, growth ofP. gingivalis in H1 medium (Fig. 1) resulted in a shift in the electrophoretic mobility pattern of the LPS, leading to the expression of a greater number of low-molecular-mass bands and the addition of a band at ca. 26 kDa, which we have designated the 26 LPSC. The 26 LPSC was observed for P. gingivalis grown in either complex (Fig. 1A) or basal (Fig. 1B) H1 medium. The 26 LPSC was refractory to Coomassie blue staining and protein- ase K digestion (not shown). Interestingly, the 26 LPSC was lost, along with several other bands at ,26 kDa after passage of P. gingivalis in H2 medium, either complex (Fig. 1A) or basal (Fig. 1B). The 26 LPSC was not observed in H1LPS or H2LPS from strain W50/BE1 (Fig. 1B). The LPS from W50/ BE1 migrated like a rough-chemotype LPS, similarly to that of Salmonella typhimurium Rc, which is a complete core polysac- charide but lacks O-specific antigen (17). Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of H1LPS from P. gin-  givalis W83, A7436, and HG405. To determine if the hemin- induced 26 LPSC was immunogenic, antiserum was raised to strain A7436, W83, or HG405 cultured in H1medium (Schae- dler broth). As shown in Fig. 2, antisera raised to all three strains recognized the 26 LPSC in H1LPS from all of three strains but not H2LPS (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, antibodies raised to whole-cell antigens of P. gingivalis strains A7436, W83, or HG405 cultured in H2 media did not recog- nize the 26 LPSC in H1LPS from strain A7436, W83, or HG405 (data not shown). Western blot analysis of human serum reactivity to H1LPS  from P. gingivalis A7436. Sera from patients with AP and from  VOL. 64, 1996 EFFECTS OF HEMIN ON P. GINGIVALIS LPS 2283    healthy controls were reacted with nitrocellulose strips con- taining Western-blotted P. gingivalis H1LPS. Periodontitis sera reacted with a maximum of 28 bands in the H1LPS, many of which may represent repeating subunits of the O antigen (17). These bands migrated with relative molecular masses of approximately 14 to 50 kDa (Fig. 3A). The reactivity pattern achieved with serum pooled from the 24 AP patients is shown schematically in Fig. 3C. Most of the variability in reactivity patterns, however, was observed towards the lower-molecular- mass moieties (,27 kDa), such as the 26 LPSC. For example, patient 4 serum reacted with the hemin-induced 26 LPSC (band A in Fig. 3C), as well as a band at approximately 14 kDa (band C in Fig. 3C) and a band at approximately 11 kDa (band D in Fig. 3C). Patient 7 showed very intense reactivity with the  26 LPSC and faint reactivity with band D. Patient 17 showed little reactivity to anything but the 26 LPSC and band B (ap- proximately 20 kDa). Patient 25 reacted strongly with the 26 LPSC and band C but not band B or D. The percentage of patient or control sera of the total number of patient or control sera tested that reacted with each band is shown in Fig. 4. Over 40% of the periodontitis sera reacted with the 26 LPSC (band A), while none of the control sera reacted with the hemin- induced band. In general, 75% of periodontitis patient sera reacted strongly with multiple LPS bands, especially in the range of 27 to 34 kDa. Only 20% of C sera reacted with more than one LPS band, and most reactivity was also in the range of 27 to 34 kDa. In contrast, blotting with LPS from E. coli O55:B5 revealed no discernible differences in periodontitis and control serum reactivity (not shown). A cluster analysis (BMDP [Menlo Park, Calif.] statistical  package) was performed to determine the association between reactivity to LPS and the age, sex, race, and disease status of the patients and controls (not shown). The analysis revealed that 75% of the 24 AP patient sera that reacted with the 26 LPSC clustered together and were drawn from patients diag- nosed with moderate to severe periodontitis. In contrast, the type II or mild-periodontitis patients reacted with fewer LPS bands and clustered in the middle. The 26 LPSC was recog- nized by only 20% of the five type II patient sera. The controls, with few exceptions, clustered at the bottom and were not reactive with the 26 LPSC. No clustering was found for age, sex, or race. Hemin binding by P. gingivalis whole cells and LPS. As  shown in Table 1, H1LPS (or H1 whole cells) from P. gingi- valis A7436 bound significantly more hemin than H2LPS (or H2 whole cells). In contrast, H1LPS from strain W50/BEI did not bind hemin. There was no difference in hemin binding between H1LPS and H2LPS from the transpositional inser- tional mutant strain MSM-3, which has a defect in the trans- port and utilization of heme (13).  DISCUSSION  The results of the present study suggest that growth of P. gingivalis in H1 media can lead to the expression of additional antigenic determinants on the LPS. Similar modifications have  FIG. 1. SDS-PAGE analysis of H1LPS and H2LPS from P. gingivalis. (A) H1LPS and H2LPS purified from P. gingivalis cultured in complex media (see Materials and Methods).

The latter study, involving Klebsiella pneu- monia, may be particularly relevant to our findings. A similar shift in the LPS profile, involving the low-molecular-mass an- tigens, was observed after growth of K. pneumonia in perito- neal dialysate or serum; however, the hemin or iron concen- tration in these body fluids was not specified. Hemin has been shown to regulate the expression of many virulence factors of P. gingivalis, including outer membrane proteins, fimbriae, outer membrane vesicles, hemolytic activity, protease activity, collagenolytic activity, and hemagglutination (for a review, see reference 13); however, this is the first report of a hemin- induced structural modification of LPS. These observations may have particular relevance to peri-  odontal disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases that are characterized by epithelial cell ulceration, increased vas- cular permeability (11, 22, 25), and leakage of blood into the tissues (13). The modulation of LPS by hemin is apparently functional (6) as well as structural. Champagne et al. (6) have shown that H1LPS from P. gingivalis (which they have termed \u201chemin-normal LPS\u201d) is a more potent agonist for polymor- phonuclear leukocyte superoxide release than non-hemin- modulated LPS. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are one of the  FIG. 3. Human serum reactivity with H1LPS from strain A7436.

Polymorphonuclear leuko- cytes are thought to play both a protective role and a destruc- tive role in the tissues, depending upon the activation state of the cells (7). Therefore H1LPS, if it exists in nature, may accelerate tissue destruction by activating polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other inflammatory cells to release potentially destructive reactive oxygen products, cytokines, and proteases (20). It is tempting to speculate that, as antibodies reactive with the 26 LPSC are observed in patients with periodontitis, H1LPS may exist in nature; moreover, despite the hydropho- bic and membrane-constitutive nature of lipid A, it is exposed on the bacterial cell surface, predominantly on outer mem- brane vesicles or blebs (2). Understanding the mechanisms of enhanced activation of inflammatory cells by H1LPS may be a critical step in disease intervention. We initially suspected that the hemin-dependent 26-kDa  LPS moiety (26 LPSC) was a protein that copurified with LPS, such as the 26-kDa outer membrane hemin-binding protein described by Bramanti and Holt (3). However, the 26 LPSC proved to be refractory to Coomassie blue staining and insen- sitive to proteinase K digestion. Although the kinetics of growth in the H1 media was more rapid than that in the H2 media (14), the induction of the 26-kDa moiety does not ap- pear to be related to growth phase, since all cultures were harvested at late log phase of growth. In addition, we have not previously observed these LPS changes in other growth media that resulted in similar kinetics of growth (not shown). At present, the identity of the 26 LPSC is unknown, but endotox- in-associated proteins, such as porins, can be highly resistant to organic solvents and enzymes (12). Efforts are under way in our laboratories to biochemically and structurally characterize the hemin-dependent changes in LPS. Studies by several investigators suggest that the LPS of P.  gingivalis may play a role in sequestering hemin, which it then transports into the cell to obtain iron for growth (13). Grenier (15) has shown that P. gingivalis LPS binds hemin with high affinity via the lipid A moiety; moreover, Smalley et al. have suggested that LPS may serve as a storage depot for hemin (26). Genco et al. (14) have shown that growth in HRM1 media induces an increase in the binding of hemin by P. gin- givalis. The present study indicates that H1LPS binds more hemin than H2LPS. Interestingly, H1LPS from the transpo- sitional insertional mutant strain MSM-3, which has a defect in the utilization and transport of heme, did not bind more hemin than H2LPS. Whether the 26 LPSC plays a role in hemin binding is subject to speculation. Our finding that the LPS of the nonpigmented strain W50/BE1 does not bind hemin and does not produce the 26 LPSC in H1 media seems to support this speculation. In summary, our data indicate that growth of P. gingivalis in  H1 media resulted in additional antigenic determinants in the LPS, including a 26-kDa LPS moiety (26 LPSC), as well as an increased capacity to bind hemin. These changes in LPS were reversed when the bacteria were transferred into H2 media. The pleiotropic mutant strain W50/BE1, which is nonpig- mented and does not agglutinate erythrocytes, lacks the 26 LPSC and does not bind hemin. The 26 LPSC is nonprotein- aceous, immunogenic, and antigenically similar among three P. gingivalis strains tested. A cluster analysis revealed that immu- noreactivity to the 26 LPSC, as well as other low-molecular- mass LPS components, clustered with the periodontal disease status of the patients.
