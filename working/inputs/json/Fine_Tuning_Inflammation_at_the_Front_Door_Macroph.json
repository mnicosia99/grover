    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

Schlesinger1*  1 Center for Microbial Interface Biology, Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America,  2 Mathematical Biosciences Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America  Abstract  Complement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) is a major macrophage phagocytic receptor. The biochemical pathways through which CR3 regulates immunologic responses have not been fully characterized. Francisella tularensis is a remarkably infectious, facultative intracellular pathogen of macrophages that causes tularemia. Early evasion of the host immune response contributes to the virulence of F. tularensis and CR3 is an important receptor for its phagocytosis. Here we confirm that efficient attachment and uptake of the highly virulent Type A F. tularensis spp. tularensis strain Schu S4 by human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) requires complement C3 opsonization and CR3. However, despite a.40-fold increase in uptake following C3 opsonization, Schu S4 induces limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared with non-opsonized Schu S4 and the low virulent F. novicida. This suggests that engagement of CR3 by opsonized Schu S4 contributes specifically to the immune suppression during and shortly following phagocytosis which we demonstrate by CD11b siRNA knockdown in hMDMs. This immune suppression is concomitant with early inhibition of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK and NF-kB activation. Furthermore, TLR2 siRNA knockdown shows that pro-inflammatory cytokine production and MAPK activation in response to non-opsonized Schu S4 depends on TLR2 signaling providing evidence that CR3-TLR2 crosstalk mediates immune suppression for opsonized Schu S4. Deletion of the CD11b cytoplasmic tail reverses the CR3-mediated decrease in ERK and p38 activation during opsonized Schu-S4 infection. The CR3-mediated signaling pathway involved in this immune suppression includes Lyn kinase and Akt activation, and increased MKP-1, which limits TLR2-mediated pro- inflammatory responses. These data indicate that while the highly virulent F. tularensis uses CR3 for efficient uptake, optimal engagement of this receptor down-regulates TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory responses by inhibiting MAPK activation through outside-in signaling. CR3-linked immune suppression is an important mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of F. tularensis infection.

Introduction  Francisella tularensis is a remarkably infectious facultative intra-  cellular pathogen that causes the zoonotic disease tularemia [1,2].  F. tularensis can be divided into several subspecies, including  tularensis, holarctica and mediasiatica [3,4], with tularensis being the  most virulent subspecies that can cause disease in humans through  the respiratory route with ,10 CFUs. F. novicida is normally  considered to be the fourth subspecies of F. tularensis; however,  recent genome-wide polymorphism analysis indicates that it is an  independent species [5]. F. novicida rarely causes disease in humans  but is virulent in mice, manifesting a disease that is similar to  tularemia in humans, and has been widely used in the mouse  model of tularemia. Because F. tularensis can be easily disseminat-  ed, results in a high mortality rate among untreated pulmonary  cases, and has the potential to cause public panic, it is given the  highest priority classification by the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention (CDC) as a Category A select agent and is a  potential bioweapon [1].  Macrophages are the first line of defense against invading  microorganisms. However, as is the case for many other intracel-  lular pathogens, F. tularensis is able to avoid and/or suppress  macrophage host defense mechanisms to enable survival and  intracellular replication following phagocytosis. F. tularensis infects  primarily alveolar macrophages in pneumonic tularemia [6].  Macrophages combat F. tularensis infection by generating TLR2-  dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-1b [7-12]. However, this cytokine response is largely muted at the early  stage of F. tularensis infection. In fact, several studies have indicated  that F. tularensis infection leads to broad immune suppression in  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114    infected cells [13-16]. Compared with the low virulent F. novicida,  infection of human phagocytes with the highly virulent Type A F.  tularensis subsp. tularensis strain Schu S4 leads to significantly reduced  pro-inflammatory cytokine production [17,18]. This immune  suppression is believed to be critical for the success of F. tularensis  as a human pathogen, allowing for its replication and dissemination  within the host early on. However, the molecular mechanisms  involved in the early F. tularensis-induced immune suppression are  not completely understood.  Multiple receptors, such as complement receptors, Fcc recep- tors, mannose receptor, scavenger receptor and surface nucleolin  have all been implicated in F. tularensis phagocytosis [19-24].  Complement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface, and  complement receptors, specifically complement receptor 3 (CR3)  on the macrophage surface play important roles in the uptake of  the highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis by human  macrophages [20,21,25]. CR3 (CD11b/CD18, aMb2) belongs to the b2-integrin family. Complement receptors, particularly CR3, have long been postulated to allow for safe passage for intracellular  pathogens [26-28]. CR3's function is dependent on the activation  of outside-in and inside-out two way signals [29]. There is  increasing evidence for signaling crosstalk between complement  receptors and TLRs [30-32]. For example, TLR2 is able to trans-  activate CR3 through inside-out signaling including the activation  of Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34]. b2-integrin signaling can also negatively regulate TLR responses [32,35]. Specifically, CR3  can inhibit TLR4 signaling by promoting the degradation of  MyD88 and TRIF [36]. In addition, engagement of CR3 has been  shown to down-regulate IL-12 production [37] and avoid  initiation of the oxidative burst in macrophages following  phagocytosis of apoptotic cells [38,39]. A few pathogens such as  Porphyromonas gingivalis [33], Mycobacterium bovis BCG [34] and  Bacillus anthracis spores [40] can activate CR3 through inside-out  signaling via TLR2 to facilitate bacterial uptake. However, to the  best of our knowledge, nothing is known about how the  engagement of CR3 by a pathogen (i.e. outside-in signaling) can  mediate regulation of TLR signaling pathways.  Here we hypothesized that the initial interaction of F. tularensis  with human macrophage receptors will greatly impact the  generation of early signals and consequent biological responses  by the macrophage. We show that C3-opsonized virulent F.  tularensis subsp. tularensis utilizes CR3 to gain access into host  macrophages while at the same time inhibits TLR2-mediated host  immune responses, resulting in a relatively \u2018\u2018silent'' mode of entry  followed by robust intracellular replication. We also report the key  signaling pathways involved. Thus, we provide the first evidence  for linkage between a key phagocytic receptor for F. tularensis and  post-phagocytic signaling events important in immunosuppression.  The involvement of complement receptors in immune suppression  may be an important mechanism for F. tularensis pathogenesis, and  the pathways involved are likely to be broadly applicable to other  intracellular pathogens that use CR3-mediated entry.  Results  Serum opsonization, specifically C3 deposition, is critical for F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 phagocytosis by human macrophages  Serum components, specifically complement C3, and CR3 play  a major role in efficient macrophage uptake of F. tularensis Live  Vaccine Strain (LVS) and a clinical isolation (RCI) of subsp.  tularensis [21]. We first set out to confirm the role of C3 and C3  receptors in Schu S4 phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived  macrophages (hMDMs). We infected hMDMs with Schu S4 in the  presence or absence of serum, or in C3-depleted or C3-repleted  serum. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of serum, Schu S4  uptake by hMDMs was very limited. In contrast, in the presence of  serum, the uptake was significantly increased ,40 fold confirming that serum opsonization is critical for efficient phagocytosis of  Schu S4 by human macrophages. Moreover, when we used C3-  depleted serum the uptake of Schu S4 was limited, equivalent to  that seen in the absence of serum. Repletion of C3-depleted serum  with C3 led to a significant increase in uptake akin to that seen  following serum opsonization. This result provides further  evidence that serum components, especially C3 deposited on  bacterial surface, are critical for efficient phagocytosis of Schu S4  by human macrophages.  C3 opsonization is associated with immune suppression during Schu S4 phagocytosis by macrophages  In order to examine whether the initial interaction between F.  tularensis and macrophages impacts host cell immune responses, we  measured the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1b in the culture supernatant of hMDMs infected with Schu S4 in the absence or presence of fresh autologous serum.  Surprisingly, despite the fact that there was a dramatic increase in  bacterial uptake in the presence of serum, there was very limited  pro-inflammatory cytokine production suggesting that serum  opsonization has an immunosuppressive effect during Schu S4  phagocytosis. This effect is mainly contributed by C3 since  incubation in C3-depleted serum led to relatively high levels of  cytokine production comparable to those observed in the absence  of serum, while the cytokine levels were decreased when C3 was  repleted (Fig. 2A, B and C). Recent studies have shown that the  low virulent F. novicida induces high pro-inflammatory responses in  human phagocytic cells [17,41]. In order to exam whether serum  incubation has an immunosuppressive effect during the phagocy-  tosis of human macrophages by F. novicida, we performed assays  comparing F. novicida and Schu S4 in the presence and absence of  serum. Consistent with previous studies [17,18], phagocytosis of F.  novicida by hMDMs was accompanied by much higher pro-  inflammatory cytokine production than that of Schu S4 (Fig. 2 D,  E and F). In addition, serum did not have a significant immune  suppressive effect, indicating that C3 opsonin-mediated immune  suppression is specific to the highly virulent Schu S4.  Recent studies have indicated that host adaptation can affect the  nature of Francisella surface carbohydrates, which can in turn affect  Author Summary  The highly virulent Francisella tularensis can cause respi- ratory disease in humans with less than 10 bacteria. In vivo, it replicates mainly within macrophages. Evasion and/or suppression of the host protective immune response is essential to Francisella's virulence in mammals. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms for this immune suppression are not clear. Here we demonstrate that this pathogen manipulates the crosstalk between two impor- tant receptor-mediated pathways during entry in human macrophages: CR3-mediated phagocytosis and TLR2-me- diated pro-inflammatory responses. By optimally engaging CR3, Francisella not only gains efficient access to macro- phages but also dampens TLR2-mediated immune re- sponses, leading to a relatively \u2018\u2018silent'' entry that allows it to replicate intracellularly to high numbers early on. Thus, we have identified an important mechanism that is critical for the success of F. tularensis as a human pathogen during primary infection.

C3 is required for Ft Schu S4 uptake by human macrophages. hMDMs were incubated with Schu S4 for 1 hr at an MOI of 50:1 in the presence or absence of 10% autologous serum, C3-depleted serum (C3-dpl) or C3-repleted serum (C3-rpl). (A) Extracellular bacteria were killed by gentamycin treatment for 30 min at 37uC. hMDMs were then lysed and intracellular bacteria were enumerated by CFUs recovered. Data are representative of three independent experiments. The data were analyzed by 1-Way ANOVA and Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test (*p,0.05 serum vs. no serum and C3-rpl vs. C3-dpl). (B) hMDMs were fixed after 1 hr of infection and followed by inside/outside differential staining to differentiate intracellular (red) and extracellular (yellow or green) bacteria as described in Material and Methods. Images shown are representatives of three independent experiments. In the experiment shown, quantification of the total number of Sch S4 per cell was as follows: no serum = 0.35; serum = 4.04; C3-dpl. = 0.269; C3-rpl serum = 3.757 (150 cells per experimental group). doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g001  Figure 2.

Extracellular bacteria were killed with 50 mg/ml gentamycin at 37uC for 30 min. Media were replenished and cell-free culture supernatants were collected at 16 hrs post infection. TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1b concentrations were measured by ELISAs. Uninfected resting cells (R) were included as a control. Data are representative of at least 3 independent experiments.

To  examine the effect of host adaptation on the immune suppression  observed here, we used Schu S4 that had been passaged through  THP-1 cells (Ft-T). As shown in Fig. S1, although host adapted Ft-  T induced slightly less pro-inflammatory cytokine production  compared with Ft that had not been passaged, serum-opsonization  still significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory responses with Ft-T.  This result provides further support that the inhibition mechanism  observed here does not depend on host adaptation. Thus, the  following experiments were carried out with Ft Schu S4 only.  C3 opsonization inhibits MAPK activation during phagocytosis of Schu S4 by human macrophages  F. tularensis LPS interacts poorly with TLR4 [43]. Instead, host  inflammatory responses to F. tularensis are mediated primarily by  TLR2 which leads to the activation of MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production  [44-49]. In order to explore the underlying mechanism for the  suppressed immune responses seen in the presence of serum and  C3 opsonization, we examined the activation of MAPKs during  Schu S4 synchronized phagocytosis. Schu S4 was either non-  opsonized or pre-opsonized with fresh autologous serum, C3-  depleted or C3-repleted serum, and then incubated with hMDMs  in the absence of serum. As shown in Fig. 3A, consistent with our  observations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, activation  of MAPKs (i.e. ERK1/2 and p38) was inhibited during  phagocytosis of serum-opsonized or C3-repleted serum-opsonized  Schu S4, whereas there was robust activation of ERK1/2 and p38  in the absence of either serum or C3. This inhibition on MAPK  activation was only observed for ERK1/2 and p38, but not for  JNK (Fig. 3B) In order to confirm the role of complement in the  immune suppression observed, we also infected hMDMs with  Schu S4 pre-opsonized with heat-inactivated autologous serum.  Phagocytosis of these bacteria was accompanied by levels of  ERK1/2 and p38 activation equivalent to those seen with non-  opsonized Schu S4 (data not shown). Together, these data indicate  that the immune suppression during C3-opsonized Schu S4  phagocytosis is mediated, at least in part, by reduced ERK1/2 and  p38 activation.  Since we observed a much greater pro-inflammatory response  during F. novicida phagocytosis than during Schu S4 phagocytosis  (which was not affected by serum or C3), we also included F.  novicida in parallel with Schu S4 in our experiments to assess  MAPK activation. As expected, phagocytosis of F. novicida was  accompanied by high levels of ERK1/2 and p38 activation both in  the presence and absence of serum, especially at the later time  point (Fig. 3C) and was much less affected by serum opsonization.  This indicates that C3-mediated MAPK inhibition is relatively  specific to the highly virulent Schu S4.  C3 opsonization inhibits NF-kB p65 activation and translocation during phagocytosis of Schu S4 by human macrophages  Phosphorylation of MAPKs leads to activation of many  transcription factors, including NF-kB, that are important in inflammatory cytokine production. Since we observed significantly  decreased activation of ERK 1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonized  Schu S4 infection, we examined whether this decreased activation  leads to a reduction in downstream NF-kB activation. We infected hMDMs with non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4 for  different time points and analyzed NF-kB p65 activation (phos- phorylation) by Western blot. As predicted, phagocytosis of serum-  opsonized Schu S4 led to significantly reduced phosphorylation of  the NF-kB p65 subunit (Fig. 4A and B). Activation of the NF-kB p65 subunit leads to translocation of p65 into the nucleus where it  binds to the promoter region of various genes to induce their  expression. We measured NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleus by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C). Our results show that  infection with serum-opsonized Sch S4 is accompanied by  significantly reduced p65 translocation compared to that of non-  opsonized bacteria. These data provide strong evidence that C3  opsonization of bacteria leads to early suppression of the host cell  immune response through inhibition of MAPKs and downstream  NF-kB activation.  C3 opsonin-mediated immune suppression during phagocytosis is not due to a difference in the kinetics of uptake of Schu S4 or to bacterial factors  One possible mechanism for the enhanced pro-inflammatory  cytokine response seen during phagocytosis of non-opsonized Schu  S4 is that limited CR3 engagement slows phagocytosis (through  CR3 or potentially other receptors) allowing for a proportionately  increased number of attached bacteria to engage TLR2 for a  longer period of time. In order to test for this possibility, we  synchronized phagocytosis of non-opsonized or serum-opsonized  Schu S4 as in the MAPK activation assay, and fixed the samples at  different time points. We used a differential immunofluorescence  staining protocol [50] to quantify the attachment and uptake of  Schu S4 by hMDMs (Fig. 5A). At all time points examined (5, 15  and 30 min) there were much greater numbers of serum-  opsonized Schu S4 both attached to and taken up by hMDMs  compared with non-opsonized bacteria, indicating that a differ-  ence in the kinetics of phagocytosis was not the reason for the  observed immune suppression. The fact that F. tularensis can also  signal through TLR2 from within phagosomes following phago-  cytosis [51] also argues against the hypothesis that in the case of  non-opsonized bacteria, prolonged cell surface binding results in  enhanced cytokine production.  Bacterial virulence factors, e.g. RipA, represent an alternate  mechanism of immune suppression by C3-opsonized bacteria  [52]. In this scenario, we expect cytokine production to decline as  bacterial loads increase because the concentration of virulence  factors produced from viable bacteria within a macrophage is  directly proportional to its bacterial load. In order to test this  hypothesis, we infected hMDMs with non-opsonized or serum pre-  opsonized Schu S4. In both cases we achieved an incremental  increase in bacterial uptake by increasing the MOI. However,  instead of resulting in increased immune suppression, increased  uptake resulted in a stepwise increase in pro-inflammatory  cytokine production (Fig. 5B) and MAPK activation (Fig. 5C).  This effect was more pronounced in the case of non-opsonized  bacteria [i.e., A 20 fold increase in MOI resulted in a 3 to 12 fold  increase in cytokine production for non-opsonized bacteria, and  only a 30% to 70% increase in cytokine production for opsonized  bacteria (Fig. 5B)]. These results indicate that early immune  suppression by Schu S4 during phagocytosis is not primarily  mediated by virulence factors produced from viable bacteria. We  carried out experiments with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-killed Schu  S4 to further support this claim. In parallel with untreated Schu  S4, PFA-killed Schu S4 was either non-opsonized or serum pre-  opsonized, and used for infection. As shown in Fig. 5D, PFA-killed  serum-opsonized Schu S4 was able to inhibit MAPK activation.  Together, these results provide evidence that the immune  suppression observed during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized Schu  S4 is not due to actively produced bacterial factors. However,  these factors are predicted to play an important role during  subsequent stages of infection.  CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114    CR3 is the major receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis by human macrophages  We next examined the role of C3 receptors and the possible  crosstalk between C3 receptors and TLR2 in mediating the  immune suppression during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized Schu  S4. We elected to focus on CR3 (CD11b/CD18) which is the  major receptor for C3 opsonins, and has been implicated as the  important receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis by human phago-  cytes [21]. We transfected hMDMs with scramble siRNA (control)  or siRNA targeting CD11b, the latter to knockdown the a chain of the CR3 heterodimer (Fig. 6A and B). We then performed  experiments that quantify attachment and uptake of Schu S4 by  control and CD11b knockdown macrophages. Compared to  control siRNA transfected hMDMs, Schu S4 attachment and  uptake were nearly abolished in CD11b knockdown cells,  providing strong confirmatory evidence that CR3 is the major  receptor for phagocytosis of the highly virulent Schu S4 strain by  human macrophages (Fig. 6C and D).  Several studies have indicated crosstalk between complement  receptor pathways and TLR pathways, especially for the  involvement of TLRs in inside-out activation of CR3 [33,34,40].  Therefore, we tested the possible involvement of TLR2 in Schu S4  phagocytosis by hMDMs, since TLR2 is responsible for most of  the cell surface TLR-driven host inflammatory responses following  Figure 3. Serum components, specifically C3 opsonization, inhibit ERK1/2 and p38 activation during Schu S4 phagocytosis by macrophages. (A) Schu S4 was either non-opsonized, or pre-opsonized with 10% autologous serum, C3-depleted serum (C3d) or C3-repleted serum (C3r), and then used to infect hMDM monolayers at an MOI of 50:1 in RHH in the absence of serum. Infection was synchronized by centrifuging at 2506g for 10 min at 4uC, and incubated at 37uC for 30 min.

(C) Schu S4 (Ft) or F. novicida (Fn) were either non-opsonized or serum pre-opsonized, and then used to infect hMDMs as in (A) for 30 or 60 min. MDMs lysates were subjected to Western Blot. Uninfected resting cells (R) were included as control. Data are representative of 3 independent experiments. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g003  CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 5 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114    F. tularensis infection [44,47-49]. We knocked down TLR2 in  hMDMs using siRNA as we have described previously [53] and  examined Schu S4 attachment and uptake by these cells.  Compared with control siRNA transfected cells, there was an  approximately 40% reduction in the attachment and uptake of  Schu S4 in TLR2 siRNA transfected cells (thus less than that  observed with CD11b knockdown cells) at 15 min (Fig. 6C and D),  which is consistent with the involvement of TLR2 in F. tularensis  phagocytosis, possibly through inside-out activation of CR3.  Similar data were seen at 5 min and a similar trend was seen at  30 min, although at the later time point the high number of  bacteria per cell reduced the accuracy of the counting (Fig. S2).  Inside-out signaling is further supported by an experiment showing  that the cytoskeletal, actin-binding protein Talin co-localizes with  CR3, particularly in macrophages infected with serum pre-  opsonized Ft (Fig. S3) [54].  Phagocytosis-associated immune suppression of C3- opsonized F. tularensis is mediated by CR3  In order to test the hypothesis that engagement of C3 receptors  enables outside-in crosstalk with the TLR2 pathway to inhibit  TLR2-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory responses, we  examined cytokine production in CD11b or TLR2 knockdown  macrophages following phagocytosis of serum-opsonized versus  non-opsonized Schu S4 or F. novicida. We observed a significant  reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in TLR2 knock-  down cells following non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4  infection, consistent with a role for TLR2 in mediating host pro-  inflammatory immune responses (Fig. 7A). However, even in  TLR2 knockdown cells, cytokine production in response to serum-  opsonized bacteria remained depressed as compared to non-  opsonized bacteria, indicating that the immunosuppressive effects  of complement C3 in conjunction with Schu S4 do not depend on  TLR2. In contrast, in CD11b knockdown cells, we observed that  the selective immune suppression seen with opsonized bacteria was  abolished, providing evidence for CR3 in mediating immune  suppression following optimal engagement by C3-opsonized Schu  S4 (Fig. 7B). As observed before, there was robust pro-  inflammatory cytokine production following phagocytosis of F.  novicida independent of opsonization status.  We next examined MAPK activation upstream of cytokine  production following phagocytosis of Schu S4 by control, CD11b or  TLR2 knockdown hMDMs. In order to detect and examine the  signaling events immediately after receptor ligation, we increased  the MOI to 250:1 and collected samples at 5, 15 and 30 min post  infection. As shown in Fig. 7C, in control siRNA transfected cells,  both ERK and p38 activation were selectively inhibited upon  infection with serum pre-opsonized bacteria compared with non-  opsonized bacteria, although maximal inhibition of each occurred  at different time points (ERK and p38 activation were significantly  lower at 5 min and 30 min post infection, respectively). Similar to  the results in Fig. 7A, in TLR2 knockdown cells MAPK activation  was reduced and the overall pattern between opsonized and non-  opsonized bacteria was maintained; whereas in CD11b knockdown  Figure 4. Serum opsonization of Schu S4 leads to inhibition of NF-kB p65 phosphorylation and translocation into nucleus during phagocytosis by macrophages.

Nuclei were stained with DAPI. NF-kB p65 translocation was scored using a total of 300 cells per experiment. The graph shown represents cumulative data from two independent experiments.

Remarkably this  occurred despite the fact that there was minimal phagocytosis by  these cells. Together, these results are consistent with a positive role  for TLR2 and a negative role for CR3 in MAPK activation upon  Schu S4 infection of human macrophages.  Phagocytosis-associated immune suppression of serum- opsonized Schu S4 is mediated by the CR3 cytoplasmic tail  The cytoplasmic tail of CR3 plays an important role in CR3-  mediated signaling [55]. To directly assess the role of the CR3  cytoplasmic tail in mediating immune suppression pathway(s)  during the phagocytosis of serum-opsonized Schu S4, we used  CHO cells stably expressing full length heterodimeric CR3  (CD11b/CD18) or a tail less mutant of CR3 (tail less CD11b  along with CD18) and transiently transfected with functional  TLR2 [56]. Following incubation of serum-opsonized or non-  opsonized bacteria for 15 or 30 min, CHO cell lysates were  harvested and analyzed for activation of ERK and p38 activation  (phosphorylation) by Western blot. We found that the tail less  mutant form of CR3 was not able to inhibit the activation of  ERK1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonized Schu-S4 phagocytosis  (Fig. 8A). To further validate that CR3 is an important receptor  for serum-opsonized Schu S4, we performed a cell association  assay with serum-opsonized or non-opsonized bacteria and CHO  cells expressing full length or tail less mutant CR3. The results  Figure 5. C3-mediated immune suppression is not due to a difference in the kinetics of Schu S4 phagocytosis.

These results provide direct evidence for the key role of the CR3  cytoplasmic tail in mediating outside-in signaling immune  suppression pathway (s) and for CR3/TLR2 cross talk in this  process.  Lyn kinase plays a critical role in CR3-mediated immune suppression during phagocytosis of Schu S4  Our results thus far identified a critical role for CR3 in  mediating immune suppression during F. tularensis infection. The  highly virulent Schu S4 exploits host defense mechanisms by using  CR3 as the phagocytic receptor which suppresses host defense  immune responses by inhibiting MAPK activation. However, the  question still remained as to the signaling cascade downstream of  CR3 that leads to MAPK inhibition.  A recent study [29] showed that CD11b can negatively regulate  TLR signaling by activating Syk and promoting the degradation of  MyD88 and TRIF. To explore this possibility, we examined the  activation of Syk upon infection with serum-opsonized or non-  opsonized Schu S4. Our results indicated that Syk is transiently  activated upon Schu S4 infection, but there is no difference  between serum-opsonized and non-opsonized Schu S4 infection at  all time points studied (5, 15 and 30 min). Also MyD88 and TRIF  protein levels following serum-opsonized and non-opsonized Schu  S4 infection are not changed (data not shown). Thus, these data  suggested that neither Syk nor Syk-mediated degradation of  MyD88 and TRIF is involved in CR3-mediated immune  suppression in human macrophages.  CR3 belongs to the b2 integrin family. Src family kinases (SFKs) Hck, Fgr and Lyn are known to control b2 integrin signal transduction in leukocytes [57]. Among these we were particularly  interested in Lyn since it has been shown to play an important role  in host defense. Lyn deletion led to impaired phagocytosis,  elevated inflammatory cytokine production and increased apop-  tosis following Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [58]. Lyn also  negatively regulates TLR4 and TLR2 signaling in mouse  macrophages and in vivo, which is partially mediated by the  PI3K pathway [59].  In order to answer the question whether Lyn is involved in  CR3-mediated host immune suppression following Schu S4  infection, we first explored whether Lyn is activated downstream  of CR3 and if so, whether its activation is affected by TLR2  activation which can activate CR3 through inside-out signaling.  hMDMs were transfected with control siRNA, or siRNA targeting  CD11b or TLR2, and then infected with either serum-opsonized  or non-opsonized Schu S4. Lyn activation was measured by  Western blot. As shown in Fig. 9A, in control siRNA transfected  cells, Lyn was activated only when hMDMs were infected with  serum pre-opsonized Schu S4 but not with non-opsonized Schu  S4, consistent with the importance of C3 opsonization in Lyn  Figure 6. CR3, partially activated by TLR2 inside-out signaling, is critical for Schu S4 phagocytosis by hMDMs. (A) hMDMs were transfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNAs targeting CD11b or TLR2. 48 hrs later, the level of CD11b and TLR2 were examined by Western blot. (B) CD11b knockdown was also examined by immunofluorescence microscopy with mouse CD11b (M1/70) antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. (C) 48 h after siRNA transfection hMDMs were infected with non-opsonized or serum pre-opsonized Ft Schu S4 in the absence of serum for 15 min.

Moreover, when CR3 was knocked down, Lyn was no  longer activated, whereas TLR2 knockdown had no effect. These  results demonstrated that Lyn is activated downstream of CR3 but  not TLR2.  In order to explore whether CR3-mediated host immune  suppression is mediated by Lyn, we selectively knocked down Lyn  by siRNA as described previously [60] (Fig. 9B). As shown in Fig  S4, Lyn knockdown greatly impaired the uptake of Schu S4 by  hMDMs, providing evidence that Lyn is required for CR3-  mediated phagocytosis. The effect of Lyn on the host immune  response was assessed by inflammatory cytokine production  following Schu S4 infection. Compared with the limited immune  response in control siRNA transfected cells, Lyn knockdown led to  a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production,  including TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1b, following serum-opsonized Schu S4 infection (Fig. 9C) despite the impaired uptake, providing  evidence for a critical role of Lyn in CR3-mediated host immune  suppression following Schu S4 infection.  CR3 engagement leads to Akt activation and increased MKP-1 expression  The PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to play a central role in  the host immune response during F. novicida infection [18],  including the production of TNFa [61]. In contrast, a recent study indicated that this pathway is involved in the immune suppression  following LVS infection of mouse macrophages [62]. In support of  a role of PI3K/Akt in F. tularensis immune modulation, Lyn has  been shown to form a complex with PI3K/Akt in different cell  types [63,64] while TLR2 can also activate the PI3K/Akt pathway  through Rac1 [65]. In order to examine whether the PI3K/Akt  pathway is involved in CR3-mediated immune suppression and  crosstalk with the TLR2 signaling pathway we infected control  siRNA, CD11b siRNA or TLR2 siRNA-transfected hMDMs with  serum pre-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 and then  examined the activation of this pathway by Western blot. As  shown in Fig. 9A, 30 min after infection, the phospho-Akt level  was consistently greater in hMDMs infected with serum-opsonized  Schu S4, compared with hMDMs infected with non-opsonized  bacteria, indicating that optimal engagement of CR3 at least  transiently activates Akt. This was further supported by CD11b  knockdown, which abolished the enhanced Akt activation seen in  cells infected with serum pre-opsonized Schu S4 (below the level  seen with non-opsonized bacteria). Besides CR3, TLR2 is also  involved in Akt activation following Schu S4 infection (Fig. 9A).  This was indicated by the increased level of phospho-Akt when  cells are infected with non-opsonized bacteria which will engage  CR3 in a limited fashion. Moreover, the increase seen following  serum pre-opsonization was reduced in TLR2 siRNA transfected  cells. As Akt is downstream of both pathways this could be an  important point where the two pathways crosstalk.  Figure 7.

MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) can dephos-  phorylate both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues  thus serving as important negative regulators of MAPKs [66]. In  order to examine if MKPs are involved in CR3-mediated immune  suppression, we assessed MKP-1 levels during Schu S4 infection of  hMDMs. Consistent with our observation of increased Akt and  decreased MAPK levels upon infection with serum-opsonized  Schu S4, the MKP-1 level also increased rapidly after serum pre-  opsonized Schu S4 infection but not following infection with non-  opsonized bacteria, suggesting a role for CR3 engagement.  Consistent with this possibility, the increased MKP-1 level was  abolished when CD11b was knocked down (Fig. 9A). In contrast,  there was no effect following TLR2 knockdown. Together, these  data map a pathway for CR3-mediated immune suppression that  includes activation of Lyn and Akt, and an increased level of  MKP-1.  Discussion  F. tularensis is highly virulent with a very low dose of infection,  which is often lethal before a fully effective adaptive immune  response can be mounted [67,68]. This high virulence and rapid  lethality are at least partially due to the ability of F. tularensis to  subvert or suppress host pro-inflammatory immune responses  [16,69]. F. tularensis infection of macrophages and dendritic cells  leads to very limited secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines  IL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa [13-15,70] and unresponsiveness to subsequent stimulation by TLR agonists [14,15]. In the current  study, we provide evidence for a pathway that links CR3-mediated  phagocytosis for F. tularensis with immune suppression that involves  crosstalk with TLR2.  Complement component C3 deposition on the F. tularensis  surface has been previously characterized [25,71], and optimal  uptake of the highly virulent strain by human macrophages  requires C3 deposition and its receptor CR3 [21]. Despite the fact  that significantly more bacteria are phagocytosed by human  macrophages in the presence of serum or C3, to our surprise we  observed very limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production along  with decreased activation of MAPK ERK1/2 and p38, and NF-  kB under this condition. We excluded the possibilities that this C3- mediated immune suppression was due to a difference in the  kinetics of phagocytosis or possible involvement of certain bacterial  components/virulence factors, and confirmed the role of CR3 in  this immune suppression via siRNA knockdown of the receptor.  Further we provide direct evidence for the requirement of the  CR3 cytoplasmic tail for C3 opsonized F. tularensis-mediated  suppression of immune function in human macrophages. In  addition we identify a pathway downstream of CR3 leading to  immune suppression that includes Lyn, Akt and MKP-1. The  engagement of CR3 leads to activation of Lyn, and the role of Lyn  in immune suppression was confirmed by siRNA knockdown.  CR3 engagement also led to transient activation of Akt and an  increased level of MKP-1. These findings are consistent with the  inhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 activation as well as limited pro-  inflammatory cytokine production following Schu S4 infection.  Thus, we identify a key pathway that links a receptor critical for F.  tularensis phagocytosis with post-phagocytic signaling events  important for immune suppression following Schu S4 infection,  and the crosstalk downstream of two critical receptors in innate  immunity: CR3 and TLR2 (Fig. 10).  The crosstalk revealed here is complex and involves interactions  between TLR2 signaling and both inside-out and outside-in  signaling of CR3 by F. tularensis. First, CR3 is required for efficient  F. tularensis phagocytosis while TLR2 is also partially involved.  This is likely through inside-out activation of CR3 which proceeds  through Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34] and involves the  actin cytoskeleton-binding protein talin (Fig. S3). The activated  CR3 will then efficiently bind C3bi-coated bacteria, generate CR3  outside-in signaling involving Lyn and Akt, and negatively regulate  TLR2-mediated immune responses by limiting the activation of  MAPKs through increased MKP-1. Another possibility we cannot  exclude from our studies is that the inhibition of TLR2 signaling  happens at the level of receptor ligation. For example, it is possible  that C3 deposition on F. tularensis can block the recognition of  TLR2 ligands on the bacterial surface. In this regard, a recent  study showed that F. tularensis grown in different media has distinct  bacterial surface structures, which in certain cases shields TLR2  ligands on the bacterial surface and consequently blocks the host  immune response [42]. The net result of CR3 engagement by F.  tularensis is efficient phagocytosis and limited immune response.  Although CR3 is present on the very cells that are meant to  control F. tularensis infection, it allows for a relatively \u2018\u2018silent''  means of entry to macrophages.  We consistently observed a difference in the kinetics of ERK1/2  and p38 inhibition in our study. While the inhibition of ERK1/2  occurred as early as 5 min post infection, inhibition of p38 was not  optimal until 30 min (Fig. 7B). This difference in kinetics has  implications for MKP-1 regulation and function. In our study, the  level of MKP-1 was not increased until 15 to 30 minutes post  infection. In addition, although MKP-1 can deactivate ERK1/2  when it is highly induced, p38 is its preferred substrate [66].  Therefore taken together, although our current model of the  signaling cascade can explain the inhibition of p38 activation,  other mechanisms are likely to be involved in the early inhibition  of ERK1/2. Further studies are underway to characterize the  mechanisms enabling early ERK1/2 inhibition. Insight is provid-  ed by the modeling of C3-opsonized F. tularensis engagement of  CR3 [72].  The observed CR3-mediated immune suppression is relatively  specific to Schu S4. This is different from the immune suppression  mediated by RipA, a Francisella protein that is conserved in all  subspecies [52]. In our studies, F. novicida induced a much more  robust immune response than Schu S4. In addition, serum or C3  had very little suppressive effect. F. novicida always has a much  higher phagocytosis rate than Schu S4 in the absence and presence  of serum (data not shown) suggesting the two strains use different  means of cellular entry. Thus, differences in the early immune  response to Schu S4 and F. novicida can be at least partly due to  their engaging different receptors during phagocytosis. For  example, it is possible that F. novicida more efficiently engages  both CR3 and Fcc receptors during phagocytosis, leading to a more robust immune response. Abundant natural antibody has  been found on the surface of F. novicida that is capable of engaging  Fcc receptors [19]. Consistent with the notion that immune suppression is critical for the success of F. tularensis as a human  pathogen, Schu S4 is highly virulent in humans whereas F. novicida  is not. Beyond this, our studies do not rule out differences in  bacterial surface-exposed ligands between Schu S4 and F. novicida  that would still be present after PFA treating bacteria that could  engage different receptors. We believe that differences in receptor-  ligand interactions at the macrophage surface will lead to  significant differences in the host cell response due to associated,  unique, combinatorial signaling events.  The negative regulatory role of the PI3K/Akt pathway on pro-  inflammatory immune responses has been demonstrated in other  studies [73-75] including a recent study with LVS infection of  mouse macrophages, which identified the role of Akt and MKP-1  CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114    in the immune suppression [62]. As LVS has a similar level of  phagocytosis as Schu S4 (which is lower than that seen with F.  novicida), and efficient uptake also requires serum-opsonization  [19], it is possible that LVS uses a similar pathway as Schu S4 for  immunosuppression. At a later stage of infection (24 h post  infection), F. novicida activates while Schu S4 inhibits the PI3K/Akt  pathway by differentially regulating SHIP-1 through induction of  miR-155 [41]. Our studies support the idea that the induction of  broad immune suppression by F. tularensis in the host occurs at  multiple levels and by different mechanisms during the course of  infection. The current study provides evidence that immune  suppression mechanisms are initiated at the earliest state of  infection, i.e. during the phagocytic process itself.  In addition to CR3, other complement receptors might also  play a role during F. tularensis phagocytosis. C3bi can also be  recognized by CR4 (CD11c/CD18) and CRIg [76]. These  receptors might also be involved in the immune suppression  observed during F. tularensis infection in the presence of serum. In  addition, C1q is deposited on the F. tularensis surface (Clay CD &  Schlesinger LS, manuscript in preparation). Interestingly, C1q  suppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by  NF-kB inhibition and CREB activation [77-79]. Opsono-phago- cytosis of C1q-bound apoptotic cells occurs via CD91/calreticulin  [80] and is immunosuppressive. Thus, it is intriguing to  hypothesize that C1q receptors might also be involved in the  immune suppression observed here. We are further exploring this  possibility.  Signaling events associated with the complement system  have been examined in the case of other pathogens. For exam-  ple, P. gingivalis can cleave C5 to release C5a, which activates  Figure 10. Model of CR3-mediated immune suppression and crosstalk with TLR2 signaling during the phagocytosis of Schu S4 by human macrophages. In the absence of serum, pathogen associated molecular determinants such as lipoproteins will be recognized by TLR2 which activates MAP kinase (ERK1/2 and p38) and NF-kB signaling pathways, and induces host pro-inflammatory responses. Phagocytosis is limited without the optimal engagement of CR3. In the presence of serum C3bi is deposited on the Ft Schu S4 surface, which optimally engages CR3 and enhances phagocytosis. At the same time, TLR2 is activated at least to some degree, leading to inside-out activation of CR3, which contributes to enhanced outside-in CR3 signaling and increased phagocytosis. CR3-mediated signaling activates Lyn and AKT, and leads to an increased MKP-1 level which results in inhibition of MAPK activity. This allows for increased phagocytosis simultaneously with a dampened host immune response. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g010  CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114    intracellular Ca 2+  signaling and cAMP, leading to impaired  iNOS-dependent killing in macrophages [81]. P. gingivalis can  activate CR3 through inside-out activation downstream of  TLR2 signaling, induces ERK1/2, and selectively down-  regulates IL-12 expression [82,83]. Blastomyces dermatitidis uses  BAD1, a virulent factor on the pathogen surface to engage CR3  for TNFa suppression and immune evasion by unknown mechanisms [84]. In addition to its role in the phagocytosis of  bacteria, CR3 is also responsible for clearance of C3bi-coated  apoptotic cells without initiating vigorous immune responses  [85]. In this context, CR3 ligation is immunosuppressive [86]  and can inhibit IL-12 production [37,87]. Although inside-out  activation of CR3 through TLR2 has been reported for other  pathogens [33,34,40], our data provide evidence that F. tularensis  is able to take advantage of both inside-out and outside-in  signaling of CR3 to achieve efficient entry as well as immune  suppression for its own survival. Thus, we provide new  information on how outside-in signaling of CR3 by a pathogen  can negatively regulate TLR signaling. CR3 is a major receptor  for intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacteria [88], Leishmania  [89,90] and Legionella [91]. Therefore it will be interesting to  investigate whether these pathogens also employ similar  signaling mechanisms related to CR3 in order to enhance their  survival during infection. In this regard, during infection of  murine macrophages with Mycobacterium avium, C3-depletion  results in a significantly higher level of TNFa production [92]. TLR2, PI3K and cytohesin-1 mediated inside-out activation of  CR3 has also been found to play a role in the phagocytosis of  Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [34]. In the  case of Leishmania, ligation of CR3 has been shown to inhibit the  production of IL-12 [93].  During the course of our studies, we entertained the idea of  extending them to the mouse model using CR3 knockout mice.  We first examined the activation of ERK, p38 and Akt during  serum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 synchronized  phagocytosis by mouse bone marrow derived macrophages  (BMDMs) from wild type C57/Bl mice. In stark contrast to the  results obtained with human macrophages, the activation of  ERK and p38 was significantly enhanced in mouse BMDMs  incubated with serum-opsonized Schu S4 compared to non-  opsonized Schu S4 (Fig. S5). This result indicates that the C3  opsonin-mediated inhibitory effect of Schu S4 on MAPKs is  specific to human macrophages. In this regard, there is  growing evidence that the mouse model does not recapitulate  human disease for a number of infectious agents. In fact, both  Schu S4 and F. novicida are highly virulent in mice whereas  only the former is highly virulent in humans. Beyond this, we  and others are beginning to see major differences between  mice and man (and their cells), particularly in the innate  immune system, where the array of PRRs on macrophages, for  example, and their signaling cascades are quite different  [94,95].  In summary, our results demonstrate a pathway that links an  important phagocytic receptor, CR3, on human macrophages  with the down-regulation of host immune responses that allows  for an efficient, but relatively \u2018\u2018silent'' mode of entry of the  highly virulent F. tularensis. This involves active crosstalk  between CR3- and TLR2-mediated signaling pathways. CR3-  mediated immune suppression can be an important strategy  used by F. tularensis for its success as a human pathogen. These  results have broader implications in understanding the patho-  genesis of other intracellular pathogens as well as the crosstalk  between different PRRs and phagocytic receptors, especially  TLRs and integrins.  Materials and Methods  Bacterial strains F. novicida U112 (Fn) was obtained from ATCC and F. tularensis  subspecies tularensis Schu S4 strain (Ft) was generously provided by  Dr. Rick Lyons (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO).  The bacteria were cultured on Chocolate II plates (Becton  Dickinson, Sparks, MD). For some experiments, Schu S4 was  passaged through THP-1 cells. Lysates from Schu S4-infected  THP-1 cells were plated on Chocolate II plates and used in  experiments in parallel with plate-grown only F. tularensis. Killed  bacteria were prepared by fixation of bacteria with 2% PFA at  room temperature for 10 min. They were then washed extensively  with PBS and re-suspended in PBS. All work with the Type A  Schu S4 strain was carried out in The Ohio State University BSL3  Select Agent facility in accordance with national and local  approved BSL3 facility and safety plans.  Reagents and antibodies Human C3-depleted serum and human purified C3 were  purchased from Comptech (Tyler, Texas). When needed, C3 was  repleted at 1 mg/ml in C3-depleted serum.  Antibodies against phospho-p38, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-  Akt (T308), phospho- NF-kB p65, total NF-kB p65 and MyD88 were from Cell Signaling (Boston, MA). TLR2, MKP-1 (C-19) and  b-actin antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Antibody specific to phospho-Lyn (Y396) and Talin  were from Abcam (Cambridge MA), and antibody against total  Lyn was from Millipore (Billerica, MA). Mouse monoclonal  antibody (H5A4) and rat monoclonal antibody (M1/70) against  CD11b were obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybrid-  oma Bank (The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA). A monoclonal  antibody against F. novicida LPS Fn8.2 was generated by Immuno-  Precise Antibodies Ltd (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and a  mouse monoclonal F. tularensis LPS antibody FB11 was from  Abcam (Cambridge, MA).  Control scrambled small interfering RNA (siRNA), TLR2  siRNA [53], Lyn siRNA [60] and pre-designed siGenome  smartpool targeting CD11b were purchased from Thermo  Scientific Dharmacon RNAi Technologies (Lafayette, CO).  Human monocyte-derived macrophage isolation and CHO cells  Human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) were isolat-  ed from human blood via venipuncture from healthy donors with  no known exposure to Francisella following protocols approved by  the Ohio State University Institutional Review Board. Written  informed consent was provided by study participants and/or their  legal guardians. Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells  (PBMCs) were isolated from heparinized blood as previously  described [88]. PBMCs were then cultured in sterile screw-cap  Teflon wells in RPMI 1640 plus L-glutamine with 20% autologous  human serum at 37uC 5% CO2 for 5 days. PBMCs were then recovered from Teflon wells by chilling Teflon wells on ice and  were subjected to siRNA transfection (see below), or re-suspended  in RPMI with 10% autologous serum and allowed to attach in 12-  well or 24-well tissue culture plates for 2-3 hrs at 37uC in 5% CO2. Lymphocytes were then washed away leaving MDM  monolayers at a density of approximately 2.06105 cells/well for 24-well plates or 4.06105 cells/well for 12-well plates for F. tularensis infection.  CHO cells stably expressing full length CR3 and the tail less  mutant form of CR3 as well as control cell lines (kind gifts of Dr.  Douglas Golenbock, University of Massachusetts Medical School)  CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114    were cultured and maintained in HAMs F12 medium at 37uC in 5% CO2. For infection, approximately 2.0610  5 cells/well for 24  well plates or 2.06106 cells/well for six well plates were used.  Human serum preparation Autologous sera were isolated from human blood obtained from  healthy donors with no known exposure to Francisella by  venipuncture. Sera were prepared as described before to preserve  complement activity [19] and were aliquoted and stored at  280uC.  hMDM siRNA transfection Day 5 PBMCs were transfected with siGenome control siRNA  or siRNAs targeting TLR2 (200 nM) [53], CD11b (400 nM)  (Dharmacon predesigned smartpool siRNA) or Lyn (400 nM)  [60]. These represent optimized concentrations based upon  preliminary experiments where lower concentrations of siRNAs  led to lesser effects on the target proteins and higher concentra-  tions led to cell toxicity. Transfections were carried out using the  Amaxa Nucleofector kit for human macrophages (Amaxa Biosys-  tems, Gaithersburg, MD) as described earlier [53]. Briefly, 16107  day 5 PBMCs were re-suspended in 100 ml of human macro- phages nucleofector transfection reagent, mixed with siRNAs, and  incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Cells and siRNA  mixtures were then nucleofected according to the manufacture's  instruction. After transfection cells were immediately re-suspended  in 1 ml of RPMI with 10% autologous serum and plated in 12-  well tissue culture plate for Western Blotting and cytokine assays,  or in 24-well tissue culture plates with acid-treated glass coverslips  for confocal microscopy studies. After 2-3 hrs of attachment at  37uC with 5% CO2 hMDM monolayers were washed with warm RPMI, repleted with warm RPMI containing 20% autologous  serum, and incubated at 37uC 5% CO2 for additional 48 hrs.  CHO cell TLR2 transfection The functional TLR2-expressing plasmid (YFP-TLR2) was  transfected into CHO cells by using lipofectamine reagent  (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Briefly CHO cells stably  expressing full length CR3 or the tail less mutant form of CR3  were plated in 6 well (2.06106/well) or 24 well (2.06105/well) plates and incubated for overnight. The cells were washed,  replenished with HAMs F12 media without serum, and the  plasmid DNA lipofectamine complex was prepared according to  the manufacturer's instructions and mixed with CHO cells. After  24 hrs of incubation cells were washed and replenished with  HAMs F12 media with serum, incubated for 24 hrs and used for  infections.  Francisella infection of hMDMs and CHO cells: uptake and association assays  F. novicida or Schu S4 was cultured on Chocolate agar plates for  16 hrs and 40 hrs, respectively. Bacteria were re-suspended in  PBS, and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) was approximated by  measuring the optical density of the bacterial suspension at  600 nm, and confirmed by plating the inocula and counting  CFUs. Bacteria were incubated with hMDM monolayers at an  MOI of 50 in RHH (RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine, 10 mM  HEPES and 0.25% human serum albumin) or RHS (RPMI 1640  with L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES and serum) with 10%  autologous serum, 10% C3-depleted serum (C3-dpl) or 10% C3-  repleted serum (C3-rpl) for 15 min on a nutator for equal  distribution, and then under stationary condition for another  45 min at 37uC, 5% CO2. Following infection, MDMs were  washed with warm RPMI 1640 and incubated with 50 mg/ml gentamycin at 37uC 5%CO2 for 30 min to kill extracellular bacteria. MDM monolayers were then washed with PBS, lysed  with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and Francisella uptake was  numerated by serial dilution of the lysates and plated on chocolate  agar plates for CFUs. MDMs were also fixed with 2%  paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature followed by  an inside/outside differential staining protocol for attached and  ingested bacteria as described below.  For CHO cell infections, transfected cells in incomplete HAMs  F12 media were incubated with serum-opsonized or non-  opsonized Schu S4 at an MOI of 50. Infections were synchronized  by centrifuging at 4uC, 2506g for 10 min and incubated at 37uC, 5% CO2 for different time points. At each time point the cells were  washed and lysed with TN-1 lysis buffer for Western blot or fixed  with 2% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature  followed by staining for Schu S4 for microscopy studies as  described below.  hMDM infection, lysis and Western blotting F. novicida and Schu S4 were prepared as described above.  Before infection, bacteria were pre-opsonized with 10% autolo-  gous serum, C3-depleted serum or C3-repleted serum at 37uC for 30 min, washed with ice-cold PBS and re-suspended in ice-cold  PBS. A non-opsonized sample incubated with PBS instead of  serum was also included in all experiments. MDM monolayers  were washed with warm RPMI 1640, replenished with RHH and  pre-chilled at 4uC for 10 min. Opsonized or non-opsonized bacteria were added to MDMs, and infections were synchronized  by centrifuging at 4uC, 2506g for 10 min. hMDMs were then returned to 37uC 5% CO2 and incubated for the specified times. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed with TN-1 lysis buffer  [50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na4P2O7,  10 mM NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 125 mM NaCl, 10 mM  Na3VO4, and 10 mg/ml each of aprotinin and leupeptin], incubated at 4uC for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 16,0006 g at 4uC for 10 min to pellet the cell debris. Protein concentrations of the cleared cell lysates were measured using the Pierce BCA-  protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Samples were  subjected to separation by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western  blot with the different antibodies of interest. Protocols for CHO  cell infections, cell lysis and Western blotting were the same.  Cytokine ELISAs MDMs were infected with F. novicida or Schu S4 without pre-  opsonization in RHH or with RHS plus 10% autologous serum,  C3-depleted serum or C3-repleted serum for 1 h as described  above. Cell-free culture supernatants were collected at 16 hrs post  infection. Cytokine concentrations (TNFa, IL-1b and IL-6) were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according  to the manufacturer's instructions.  Immunofluorescence microscopy hMDMs were infected with F. novicida or F. tularensis Schu S4 at  specified MOIs for different time points Monolayers were washed  three times with PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde  followed by an inside/outside differential staining protocol to  differentiate extracellular and intracellular bacteria as previously  described [50]. Briefly, after blocking with 5% goat serum and  0.5% BSA extracellular bacteria were detected with a monoclonal  mouse anti-Ft LPS antibody FB11 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) for  3 hrs at room temperature followed by an AF-488 conjugated goat  anti-mouse secondary antibody. Cells were then permeabilized  with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 15 min,  CR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella  PLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114    blocked with 5% goat serum and 0.5% BSA in PBS, incubated  with the same primary antibody for 3 hr at room temperature  followed by incubation with an AF-546 conjugated secondary  antibody for 1 hr at room temperature. This allowed for the  differential staining of extracellular (stained with both AF488 and  AF546, shown as yellow or green) and intracellular (stained with  only AF546, shown as red) bacteria. Host cell nuclei were stained  with 0.05 mg/ml of 49, 69-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at room temperature for 5 min.  The coverslips were mounted on glass slides and viewed using  an Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal microscope. For quantifica-  tion purposes, triplicate samples of at least 300 cells per group  were counted on an Olympus BX51 epi-fluorescence microscope,  and the results are presented as mean 6 SD of representative data  of at least three independent experiments.  For Talin co-localization experiments, hMDMs were infected  with serum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 at MOI of 50 for  30 min at 37uC using the synchronized phagocytosis assay. Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 2% parafor-  maldehyde followed by antibody staining for CD11b and Talin.  Briefly, cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in  PBS at room temperature for 15 min, blocked with 5% goat serum  and 0.5% BSA in PBS, incubated with CD11b antibody for 3 hrs,  washed 3 times, and incubated with Talin antibody for 3 hrs at  room temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated with an  anti-mouse AF488 (CD11b) and anti-rabbit AF594 (Talin)  secondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. The nuclei  were stained with DAPI. For NF-kB p65 translocation studies in hMDMs, infected cells were fixed, permeabilized and blocked as  described above, and incubated with NF-kB p65 antibody for 3 hrs at room temperature followed by anti-rabbit AF594  secondary antibody. The nuclei were stained with DAPI.  Statistical analysis Experiments were carried out independently at least 3 times  with different donors. Results varied among donors but the  patterns were the same with internal controls in each experiment.  Representative results are shown. Prism software (GraphPad) was  used to determine the statistical significance of differences in the  means of experimental groups. An unpaired, two-tailed Student t-  test was used when comparing the means from two groups of data  and a 1-Way ANOVA and Tukey's Multiple Comparison Test  was used when comparing three or more groups. The p  value,0.05 were considered significant (*p,0.05, **p,0.005,  and ***p,0.001).

Host adapted Schu S4 (Ft-T) was obtained by passaging bacteria  through THP-1 cells. hMDMs were infected with Ft-T or non-  passaged Ft Schu S4 at an MOI of 50:1 in RHH or RHS with  10% autologous serum. Extracellular bacteria were killed with  50 mg/ml gentamycin at 37uC for 30 min. Media was replenished and cell-free culture supernatants were collected at 16 hrs post  infection.
