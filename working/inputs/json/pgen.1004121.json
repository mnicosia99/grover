These proteins, together with cyclophilin B (encoded by PPIB), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the a1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis/trans isomerase (PPIase) activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for the structural stability of collagen; however, the absence of this post-translational modification may disrupt protein-protein interactions integral for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen over-modification. P3H1 and CRTAP stabilize each other and absence of one results in degradation of the other. Hence, hypomorphic or loss of function mutations of either gene cause loss of the whole complex and its associated functions. The relative contribution of losing this complex's 3-hydroxylation versus PPIase and collagen chaperone activities to the phenotype of recessive OI is unknown. To distinguish between these functions, we generated knock-in mice carrying a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of P3h1 (Lepre1H662A). This substitution abolished P3h1 activity but retained ability to form a complex with Crtap and thus the collagen chaperone function. Knock-in mice showed absence of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the a1(I) and a1(II) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They were normal in appearance, had no growth defects and normal cartilage growth plate histology but showed decreased trabecular bone mass. This new mouse model recapitulates elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth phenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Our observations suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3- hydroxylation complex.

A  mutation in cartilage associated protein (CRTAP) (*605497) was  first identified by Morello et. al. in a class of patients with recessive  OI [2]. CRTAP functions in a complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase  1 (P3H1) (*610339) and cyclophilin B (CYPB) (*123841) to 3-  hydroxylate a unique proline, Pro986, of the a1(I) chain and also to chaperone collagen trimer assembly [3-5]. Additionally, other  clade A fibrillar collagens, such as collagen type II, are similarly  hydroxylated. Subsequently, mutations in both leucine and proline  enriched proteoglycan (LEPRE1), encoding P3H1, and peptidyl-  prolyl isomerase b (PPIB), encoding CYPB, were identified in  other patients with recessive forms of OI [6-13]. Mutations in  additional genes have since been identified in recessive OI,  revealing novel mechanisms of disease through alterations in post-  translational collagen modification, trafficking and signaling.  Knockout mice have been created for each of the three genes  that encode the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex and these mice  recapitulate the phenotype observed in recessive OI patients.  Crtap 2/2  and Lepre1 2/2  mice display osteochondrodysplasia,  severe low bone mass, kyphosis, rhizomelia and collagen fibrils  with irregular diameter [2,14]. Although the Ppib 2/2  mice do not  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121    have rhizomelia, they also have a low bone mass phenotype with  kyphosis and wider collagen fibrils [15]. Together, these findings  highlighted the importance of this complex in collagen modifica-  tion and maintenance of bone mass.  Since null mutations in either LEPRE1 or CRTAP can result in  recessive forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) with almost  identical features, P3H1 and CRTAP were hypothesized to  stabilize each other [16]. Indeed, western blot and immunofluo-  rescence studies demonstrated absence of both CRTAP and P3H1  in fibroblasts isolated from patients carrying either LEPRE1 or  CRTAP mutations alone [16,17]. These data supported the notion  that CRTAP and P3H1 proteins stabilize each other in the  endoplasmic reticulum.  The present study aimed to determine the relative contribution  of the hydroxylation activity of the P3H1 complex to the  pathogenesis of recessive OI. This important question was  addressed in vitro and in vivo by introducing a point mutation in  the catalytic domain of P3H1 that inactivated hydroxylase activity  while preserving the protein secondary structure and the CRTAP/  P3H1/CypB complex integrity.  Results  Determining amino acids important for the hydroxylase function of P3H1  To accomplish our goal of inactivating the hydroxylase function  of P3H1, we employed an evolutionary trace algorithm to identify  conserved residues that are essential for its enzymatic function.  The four top ranking residues identified were the catalytic triad  residues (HIS590, HIS662, and ASP592) and the 2-oxoglutarate  binding residue (ARG672) (Figure 1A). The importance of these residues for hydroxylase activity was confirmed by earlier  literature [18,19]. Conversion of the catalytic triad histidines or  aspartic acid to either alanine or glutamate abolished the  enzymatic activity of Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in A. thaliana  [20]. Similarly, conversion of the 2-oxoglutarate binding arginine  to alanine also abolished the hydroxylase activity, suggesting that  substituting the corresponding sites in P3H1 with an alanine could  potentially inactivate its hydroxylase function [20]. Since alanine is  a non-bulky, uncharged amino acid that can mimic the secondary  structure of many other amino acids, we opted for this substitution  rather than a glutamate substitution to preserve the structural  integrity of P3H1.  Rescue of CRTAP stability by mutant P3H1 in cell culture Since the stability of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex is  dependent on the interaction of P3H1 and CRTAP, it was  important to verify that the mutation introduced into LEPRE1 did  not disrupt its ability to form a stable complex with CRTAP and  CYPB. To do this we first used an in vitro approach. We used  immortalized patient fibroblasts carrying a loss of function  mutation in LEPRE1 and tested whether the expression of 4  different LEPRE1 constructs containing alanine substitutions at  H590, D592, H662, or R672 were able to restore the stability of  CRTAP by immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays. We  found that the mutant expression construct converting H662 to  alanine (P3H1 H662A  ) was the most effective at rescuing CRTAP  compared with the others or the un-transduced LEPRE1 loss of  function cells (figure 1B, C). These findings are consistent with P3H1  H662A being able to interact with CRTAP and to restore it to  the ER. Although P3H1 H662A  was not assayed for enzymatic  activity, mutating the corresponding residue to an alanine in Prolyl  4-hydroxylase in A. thaliana resulted in complete inactivation of the  hydroxylase activity, suggesting the P3H1 H662A  mutant is likely to  be inactive [20].  Demonstration that Lepre1H662A/H662A knock-in mice lack Pro986 collagen hydroxylation  We generated knock-in mice carrying the H662A mutation at  the Lepre1 locus (Lepre1 H662A/H662A  ) (figure S1). Importantly, we verified that CRTAP is also restored in vivo in the Lepre1  H662A/  H662A mice compared with wild-type littermates by confirming its  presence by western blot using protein isolated from P1 calvaria  (figure 2A). Since the Pro986 residue of a1(I), a1(II) and a2(V) procollagen chains is normally fully hydroxylated and complete  loss of the P3H1 complex abolishes hydroxylation at these sites  [2,14,15,17], we analyzed the hydroxylation status of these  residues in the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice to assess the in vivo  enzymatic activity of P3H1 H662A  . Tandem mass spectrometry  showed loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation (3-Hyp) at Pro986 in the  a1(I) chain and a residual 21% 3-Hyp in the a2(V) chain from bone (figure 2B, 3). Pro978 of the bone a2(V) chain remained minimally 4-hydroxylated, similar to the level observed in wild-  type littermate bone (figure 3). This is in contrast to Crtap 2/2  mice in which 3-Hyp at Pro986 was missing but in effect replaced  by 4-Hyp at Pro978 apparently as a consequence of over-  modification in comparison to wild-type mice [17]. In cartilage,  tandem mass spectrometry showed specifically a residual 9% 3-  Hyp at Pro986 in the a1(II) chain of the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice  (figure 2C), which is comparable to the 6% 3-Hyp observed in Crtap  2/2 mice (not shown). These findings are summarized in  Table 1 together with the hydroxylation status of other partially occupied 3-Hyp sites in bone and cartilage collagens. The loss of 3-  Hyp appears to be specific to Pro986 of types I, II and V collagens  similar to findings in mouse models with complete loss of the P3H1  complex [2,14,15,17].  Effects on lysine hydroxylation and cross-linking Collagen cross-linking in bone was studied by determining the  ratio of hydroxylysyl pyridinoline to lysyl pyridinoline (HP/LP).  Author Summary  The prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex serves to hydroxylate a single residue in type I collagen and also serves as a collagen chaperone. The complex is comprised of prolyl 3- hydroxylase 1, cartilage associated protein, and cyclophilin B. Mutations have been identified in the genes encoding the complex members in patients with recessive Osteo- genesis Imperfecta. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3- hydroxylation of collagen does not alter the stability of collagen but may rather mediate protein-protein interac- tions. Additionally, the collagen chaperoning function of the complex is an important rate limiting step in the modification of type I collagen. Irrespective of whether patients with mutations in the genes encoding the members of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex have hypomorphic or complete loss of function alleles, either circumstance leads to the loss of both functions of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex. Thus, it is unknown how collagen chaperoning and/or hydroxylation affect bone and cartilage homeostasis. In this study, we generated a mouse model lacking the prolyl 3-hydroxylation activity of the complex while maintaining the chaperoning function. We found that the hydroxylase mutant mice have normal cartilage and normal cortical bone but decreased trabec- ular bone, suggesting that there is a differential require- ment for hydroxylation in different tissues.

Residues important for hydroxylase function and catalytic mutations rescue the stability of CRTAP. Evolutionary trace analysis identified residues important for the function of P3H1 by comparing each residue within the dioxygenase domain family. The highest ranking residues are mapped onto the dioxygenase domain responsible for prolyl 3-hydroxylation (A). These residues include 3 that interact with iron (His590, Asp592, and His662) shown in red and 1 that interacts with 2-oxoglutarate (Arg672) shown in yellow. An alanine substitution was introduced at HIS662 (H662A) to deactivate the hydroxylase function. To test whether the mutant P3H1 was able to rescue the stability of CRTAP, we transduced  Effects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 3 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121    This ratio reflects the hydroxylation status of those triple-helical  lysines at K87 and K930 in a1(I) and/or K87 and K933 in a2(I) that had participated in cross-link formation. In the Lepre1  H662A/  H662A mice, there was an increase in the HP/LP ratio compared to  wild-type littermates indicating that there may have been an  overall increase in hydroxylation at one or both of these sites.  However, mass spectral analysis of linear (uncross-linked) sequenc-  es from the same helical cross-linking sites prepared by digestion  immortalized LEPRE1 loss of function fibroblasts with WT or H662A mutant LEPRE1 cDNA and assayed for the presence of CRTAP by immunofluorescence and immunoblot. Here we demonstrate that the stability of CRTAP is rescued by immunofluorescence (B) and by immunoblot (C). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g001  Figure 2. Loss of Prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 in type I collagen in bone and type II collagen in cartilage. Upon generation of the Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice, we confirmed the stability of both P3H1 and CRTAP by western blot using protein isolated from mouse calvaria (A,  experiments repeated 3 times). Comparing protein isolated from the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  and the Lepre1 +/+  mice, we found no differences in the levels of P3H1 and CRTAP when compared to c-Tubulin. Analysis of prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 on the a(1) chain of type I collagen in bone using mass spectrometry demonstrates complete loss of 3-hydroxylation in the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice when compared to Lepre1+/+ littermates (B). Similarly, analysis of the Pro986 site on the a1 chain of type II collagen in cartilage demonstrates a reduction to 9% 3-hydroxylation in the Lepre1H662A/H662A  mice and is similar to what was reported in Crtap 2/2  mice (C). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g002  Effects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121    either with bacterial collagenase or trypsin showed no significant  differences between Lepre1 H662A/H662A  and wild-type bone colla-  gen. Residue a1(I) K930 was 98% hydroxylated and non glycosylated in both genotypes and a1(I)K87 was 92% hydroxyl- ated in wild-type and 93% in Lepre1  H662A/H662A . So the difference  in HP/LP ratio may be due to altered hydroxylation at the  homologous sites in the a2(I) chain but we did not acquire informative peptides from the latter. Informative peptides from  non cross-linking lysine sites also showed no significant differences  between wild-type and Lepre1 H662A/H662A  bone. For example, a1(1) K174 was essentially all galactosyl Hyl in both genotypes and a2(1) K219 was 70% hydroxylated in wild-type and 77% in Lepre1  H662A/  H662A . Thus, no evidence of generalized over-modification was  found from these site-specific mass spectral results.  The content of HP+LP in the bone collagen was not significantly altered (Table 2). Consistent with the latter observation, Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice showed no significant differ-  ence in the ratio of telopeptide hydroxylysine to lysine in the  extracted bone collagen a1(I) chains when compared to their wild- type littermates based on the mass spectral ratio of Hyl to Lys  Figure 3.

Mass spectral analysis of Pro986 hydroxylation in tryptic peptides from the a2(V) chain of bone from Lepre1  +/+ and Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice (A and B respectively) shows a marked reduction in hydroxylation at this site.  The MS/MS fragmentation patterns shown in C and D identified the 765.8 2+  peptide and its 3-hydroxylated version 773.9 2+  . A portion (40%) of the latter ion was also found by MS/MS to be contributed by a version lacking 3-Hyp but containing 4-Hyp at P978 (taken into account in the 3-Hyp quantitation). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g003  Table 1.

A caution here is that this estimate comes from a relatively minor  fraction of the total matrix collagen.  Skeletal phenotype of Lepre1H662A/H662A mice At birth, the Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice are indistinguishable from  their wild-type littermates by gross physical appearance (data not  shown). Radiographs at 3 months and 6 months of age showed  normal skeletal patterning and no evidence of skeletal deformity  such as kyphoscoliosis (figure 4A, not shown). Previous studies of the Crtap  2/2 and Lepre1  2/2 mice showed a disorganization of  the growth plate causing smaller body size with shortening of the  proximal long bone segments (rhizomelia) [2,14]. To assess  growth, the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice and their wild-type littermates  were weighed weekly until 3 months of age. At all time points, the  weight of Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice was not statistically different from  that of wild-type littermates (figure 4B). Similarly, there were no significant differences between the lengths of the femur, tibia, nor  the femur/tibia ratio, thus excluding any rhizomelic defect in the  Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice [2,14] (figure 4C).  Since the Lepre1 2/2  mice have a dysplasia of the growth plate  that also affects the hypertrophic chondrocytes, we performed  histology and specific staining of the hypertrophic zone with an  antibody directed towards type X collagen in Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice at P1 [14]. No defects were observed in the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice compared to their wild-type littermates (figure 5A, B; figure S2A, B). Additionally, we observed no difference in the width of the hypertrophic zone between the two genotypes (N = 8,  p-value = NS) (figure 5C; figure S2C). Collectively, the normal growth curve, normal femur to tibia ratio and normal hypertro-  phic zone suggest that the cartilage in the long bones of  Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice is indeed normal despite of loss of  Pro986 hydroxylation in type II collagen.  By assessing the femurs and spines at 3 months of age (n = 10,  each genotype) by micro-computed tomography, we found that  the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice had cortical bone mineral density and  cortical thickness values comparable to wild-type littermates  (figure 6). In addition, while the biomechanical analysis of femurs by 3-point bending test (n = 7, each genotype) demonstrat-  ed no differences in the extrinsic biomechanical properties  (ultimate load, stiffness, energy to failure and post-yield displace-  ment), the geometric value, cross-sectional moment of inertia, was  increased and the elastic modulus, an intrinsic material property,  was decreased in the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice compared to  wild-type littermates (figure 6). Moreover, the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice have less trabecular bone when compared to wild-type  littermates, which is quantified by decreased bone volume over  tissue volume (BV/TV), decreased trabecular number (Tb.N),  decreased trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and increased trabecular  separation (Tb.Sp) (figure 6). These findings are partly in contrast to what was described for Lepre1  2/2 mice, which are characterized  by a decrease in both trabecular and cortical bone mineral density  [14], and cortical stiffness and force to failure of femurs [14].  To further study the trabecular bone phenotype in the  Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice, bone histomorphometric analysis was  conducted on 3-month spines (n = 9). A statistically significant  decrease in bone volume over tissue volume and trabecular  thickness confirmed the low bone mass phenotype (figure 7) [2]. However, no differences in the osteoblast number (N.Ob/BS),  osteoclast surface over bone surface (Oc.S/BS), osteoid parameters  (osteoid volume over bone volume and osteoid surface over bone  surface) or bone formation rate were observed between the two  genotypes (figure 7).  Collagen fibril ultrastructure, secretion rate, and steady- state levels  The morphology of collagen fibrils was then analyzed at the  ultrastructural level in skin biopsies from Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice.  The electron micrographs showed collagen fibrils that were more  homogeneous in diameter compared to wild-type controls  (figure 8). This suggested that collagen trimers may not be efficiently assembled into higher order collagen fibrils as reflected  by an increase in the proportion of smaller diameter collagen  fibrils in the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  skin (N = 3, 150 collagen diameters  measured per animal, p,0.05) (figure 8).  We then analyzed the collagen secretion rate, as measured by  pulse-chase assays in dermal fibroblasts. The rate and amount of  procollagen secreted from the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  fibroblasts were  apparently similar to those secreted by wild-type fibroblasts  (repeated 3 times) (figure 9A, B). These findings contrast with the delayed procollagen secretion observed in the Lepre1  2/2 mice  and are apparently different from the increase in the collagen  secretion rate observed in the Crtap 2/2  fibroblasts (figure 9A, B) [2,14]. We also assessed whether there was collagen overmodifica-  tion by steady-state analysis. The electrophoretic migration of type  I collagen chains synthesized by wild-type and Lepre1 H662A/H662A  fibroblasts was similar and suggested normal post-translational  modification (repeated 3 times) (figure 9C). These findings differ from the overmodification observed in collagen isolated from  Crtap 2/2  fibroblasts [2]. These findings support a conclusion that  the catalytically inactive P3H1 H662A  mutant protein can restore  the chaperone activity and collagen assembly function of the P3H1  complex in the ER.  Discussion  We generated and characterized a novel mouse model  (Lepre1 H662A/H662A  ) that harbors a knock-in mutation in the  catalytic domain of P3H1. This mutation inactivated the 3-  hydroxylase activity of P3H1 and caused loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986  in the collagen a1(I) chain of bone and a reduction to 9% 3-Hyp at Pro986 in the a1(II) chain of cartilage. Our findings are similar to what has been reported in the null mouse mutants for the  components of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex [2,14,15].  Additionally, our data confirm the findings by Pokidysheva et. al.  that the Pro986 site in the a1(I) chain of bone is exclusively hydroxylated by P3H1 [21]. The hydroxylation status of the A3  (Pro707) site of the a2(I) chain is similar between the wild-type and  Table 2. Pyridinoline content and telopeptide hydroxylation of bone collagen.

The percentage hydroxylation of a1(I) chain N- and C- telopeptides from mass spectrometry appeared not to be affected (N = 1, both genotypes, p = NS). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.t002  Effects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 6 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121    Lepre1 H662A/H662A  bone (although the wild-type percentage that we  observed is lower than that observed by Pokidysheva et. al. and  could be attributable to strain differences) and is in contrast to the  reduction observed at this site in the Lepre1 2/2  bone [21]. The  expression of Leprel1 (encoding P3H2) was found to be dramat-  ically reduced in the bone of Lepre1 2/2  mice, possibly explaining  the reduction in hydroxylation observed at the A3 site [21].  Pokidysheva et. al. also noted a slight increase in the expression  level of Leprel2 (encoding P3H3), which could account for the  residual hydroxylation observed in the Lepre1 2/2  mice [21].  Additionally, since the hydroxylation status of the A3 site isolated  from bone of Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice is similar to their wild-type  littermates, it supports the notion that another P3H is responsible  for hydroxylation at this site. The hydroxylation status of Pro986  Figure 4. Lepre1H662A/H662A mice are normal in gross morphology. Analysis at 3 months by X-ray shows no difference in terms of skeletal patterning between genotypes (A). By growth curve analysis, there is no difference in weight at any time point over 3 months between Lepre1  +/+ and  Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice (B). We assessed rhizomelia by measuring the length of both the femur and tibia and computing the ratio. Comparing Lepre1 +/+  to Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice, we observed no difference in the length of the femur, tibia, or their ratio (C).

Expression of Lepre1 (encoding P3H1) varies in cartilage, being  highly expressed in the resting/proliferating chondrocytes and less  so in pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes (not shown). With high  expression of Leprel1 (encoding P3H2) in pre-hypertrophic  chondrocytes and Leprel2 (encoding P3H3) in the resting/  proliferating chondrocytes (not shown), it is possible that the 9%  residual hydroxylation of Pro986 in a1(II) in cartilage could be a result of hydroxylation by P3H3 (or P3H2) analogous to the  situation in bone with a2(V). Alternatively, it is possible that the histidine to alanine substitution at residue 662 may not completely  inactivate the prolyl 3-hydroxylase function of P3H1 although we  think this is less likely given published biochemical analysis of this  residue and the lack of hydroxylation in bone [20].  The Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice have reduced trabecular bone, but  normal cortical bone and normal extrinsic cortical biomechanics.  Figure 5. Lepre1H662A/H662A mice have a normal femoral hypertrophic zone. Since the Lepre12/2 animals showed disorganization of the hypertrophic zone, we assessed the hypertrophic zone (P1) of Lepre1H662A/H662A mice by H&E staining (A) and by specifically marking the hypertrophic zone using an antibody directed against type6collagen (B). The hypertrophic zone of the femur of the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice are indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates (B) and this is confirmed by quantifying the width of the hypertrophic zone in which there is no difference in the width between genotypes (C) (N = 10, both genotypes). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g005  Figure 6. Micro-Computed Tomography and cortical biomechanical analyses. 3D reconstruction of spines from the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice compared to wild-type littermates. The Lepre1H662A/H662A mice have less trabecular bone as quantified by reduced bone volume (BV/TV), reduced trabecular number (Tb.N), reduced trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), reduced trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), and increased trabecular separation (Tb.Sp). Cortical parameters are similar to wild-type, as quantified by normal cortical BMD or stiffness and force to failure. These results suggest that the Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice have normal cortical bone but reduced trabecular bone.

Due to physiological higher  remodeling rates in trabecular bone, a mild effect is more likely to  manifest earlier in trabecular bone than in cortical bone, and this  could account for the differential phenotype observed in our mice.  The mild effect could also account for our histomorphometry data  where we observe no difference in osteoid and bone formation  parameters and is in contrast to the lower osteoid parameters and  bone formation rate observed in the Crtap 2/2  mice [2]. Thus, due  to a mild effect, we cannot detect a difference in the osteoid and  the dynamic indices of bone formation.  Additionally, cartilage is normal in the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice  suggesting that 3-Hyp modification in type II collagen is not  required at least in the resting/proliferative zone. Table 3 compares the bone phenotypes exhibited by Crtap  2/2 , Ppib  2/2 ,  Leprel1 2/2  and Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice. The pronounced growth  defects and disorganized growth plates in the mice lacking a  functional P3H1 complex may reflect a particular sensitivity of  growth plate chondrocytes to ER stress caused by handling  misfolded un-partnered subunits of the complex.  The effect of 3-hydroxyproline on collagen stability is not clear.  Studies originally suggested the absence of a triple-helix structure  for synthetic peptides containing 3-hydroxyproline at all Xaa  positions [22,23]. Recent studies indicate the presence of one or  two 3-hydroxyprolines in the Xaa position does produce a triple  helix with a consequent slight increase in stability [3,24,25]. These  data suggest that although the absence of 3-hydroxyproline may  not affect the stability of the triple-helix it may alter protein-  protein interactions [24]. Since matrix-cell signaling is important  in the development and maintenance of connective tissues, it is  plausible that collagen post-translational modifications like prolyl  3-hydroxylation could specify protein-protein interactions between  collagen and other ECM components. Furthermore, these  interactions may be context-dependent differing in trabecular  Figure 7. Histomorphometry of Lepre1H662A/H662A mice. By histomorphometry, we were able to confirm the low trabecular bone mass phenotype in the Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice as quantified by decreased bone volume (BV/TV) and trabecular thickness (Tb.Th). We observed no  differences in osteoblast and osteoclast parameters, as measured by the number of osteoblasts (N.Ob/BS) and osteoclast surface (OcS/BS). We observed no difference in the kinetic indices of bone formation, as measured by mineral apposition (MAR), mineralizing surface (MS/BS) and bone formation rate (BFR/TV) and in osteoid parameters, as measured by osteoid volume (OV/BV) and osteoid surface (OS/BS) (mean 6 SD, N = 9, both genotypes). doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g007  Effects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 10 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121    bone vs. cortical bone vs. cartilage. Candidates include ligand  interaction sites mapped to the fibril in proximity to Pro986 and  include fibronectin and a1b1/a2b1/a1b11 integrins [26]. Mutations that result in loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation  complex can result in collagen overmodification [27]. This could  also independently affect collagen fibril interaction sites, e.g., with  small leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) such as decorin. Such  disruption or other signaling effects could explain the disorgani-  zation of the hypertrophic zone observed in the Lepre1 2/2  mice  but not observed in the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice. Future work  investigating the signaling defects present in bone and cartilage  will be necessary to understand the chondrodysplasia present in  patients carrying mutations in LEPRE1 or CRTAP.  Compared with other tissues, the extracellular matrix of bone is  unique in the sense that it is able to mineralize [28]. As the  dominant component of bone, it is likely that type I collagen plays  an important role in the manner of mineralization of the  extracellular matrix. It has been argued that the collagen of bone  has evolved special features that equip it to constrain the growth  internally of nanocrystal plates of hydroxyapatite [27]. Extra-  fibrillar non-collagenous proteins limit the amount of extrafibrillar  crystal growth [27].  Evolutionarily, prolyl 4-hydroxylation increases the thermal  stability of the triple helix through hydrogen bonding [29].  Although loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a feature of recessively  inherited OI, the evolutionary function of 3-hydroxyproline is still  poorly characterized. One clue to the potential role of 3-  hydroxyproline in collagen is through the identification of partially  occupied 3-Hyp sites in type I and II collagen; these are D-  periodically spaced and suggest the modification is involved in  some aspect of collagen fibril assembly [30]. Peptide studies  suggest that the 3-Hyp residues have selective affinity for one  another [30]. Additionally, the 3-hydroxyl groups are outward  pointing from the triple-helix, which provides evidence that short-  range hydrogen bonding between collagen triple helices is likely to  occur [30]. Although 3-Hyp appears early in collagen evolution,  the 3-Hyp at Pro986 of the alpha I chain of type I collagen  appeared much later [27,31]. In fact, the presence of 3-Hyp at this  residue coincides with the appearance of CRTAP and occurs just  before the appearance of vertebrates and bone [32]. Taken  together, with the potential role of 3-Hyp and the appearance of 3-  Hyp at Pro986 just prior to the appearance of vertebrates and  bone, we speculate that this unique modification could have  functioned to equip collagen molecules for a polymeric architec-  ture that allows organized hydroxyapatite nanocrystal growth  within fibrils potentially explaining the lack of phenotype in  cartilage vs. bone in our Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice.  In addition to the loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986, we observed an  increase in the HP/LP ratio in the bone of the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice compared to their wild-type littermates. In both dominant  and recessive OI, there is an increase in the HP/LP ratio,  supporting alterations in collagen crosslinking [33]. The increase  in HP/LP ratio suggests a disturbance of the fibrillar architecture  in bone and could result in the disorientation of nanocrystal plates  of hydroxyapatite, but does not signify overmodification of the  collagen. Since we observe no difference in collagen migration  from the steady-state collagen analysis, we conclude that there is  no gross overmodification in the collagen isolated from the  Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice. Additionally, we observe no difference in  collagen secretion, providing indirect evidence that the P3H1  complex is able to form and bind to collagen, in contrast to the  Lepre1 2/2  mice which have a delay in collagen secretion due to  failure of complex formation [14].  Future work investigating the contribution of signaling vs.  collagen cross-linking defects present in bone and cartilage will be  necessary to understand the generalized connective tissue pheno-  type present in patients carrying mutations in LEPRE1 or CRTAP.

Figure 9. Lepre1H662A/H662A fibroblast procollagen secretion rate and collagen modification is normal. Analysis of procollagen secretion by the collagen pulse-chase assay suggests that the procollagen secreted from Lepre1  H662A/H662A fibroblasts is similar to Lepre1  +/+ fibroblasts (A, B).  Additionally, there does not appear to be a decrease in the amount of procollagen secreted from the Lepre1 H662A/H662A  fibroblasts in comparison to Lepre1+/+ fibroblasts (A, B). These findings are in contrast to that of the Crtap2/2 fibroblasts, which have an increase in the rate of procollagen secretion (A). Collagen modification was assessed using the collagen steady-state assay. We observed no difference in the migration pattern of procollagen and collagen isolated from Lepre1+/+(+/+) and Lepre1H662A/H662A (H662A/H662A) fibroblasts (C).

Subsequently, cells were scraped in 1 ml 16 PBS and transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Cells were spun down at 14000 RPM for 5 minutes at room  temperature. Samples were resuspended with 50 ml of 5%B-ME and Lamellae loading buffer (Biorad) prior to the separation of  proteins on a polyacrylamide gel.  Immunodetection by immunoblot 10 mg of protein was loaded into each well, run and transferred  to a PVDF membrane using a standard wet transfer process.

The blot was  washed 3 times, 10 minutes each with 16 TBS with 0.05% Tween20 and then incubated with the corresponding secondary  antibody and washed again. Proteins were visualized using the  Luminato Crescendo HRP substrate (Millipore) by incubating blot  with the substrate for 2 minutes before exposing the blot to film  and feeding it through the developer.  Immunofluorescence Fibroblasts were split into glass LAB-TEK 4-well chamber slides  (Nunc), and 24 hours later were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,  treated with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 10% donkey serum  and 1% BSA, and then sequentially incubated with 1:250 dilution  of CRTAP antisera or P3H1, 1:500 donkey anti-rabbit secondary  antibody conjugated to Alexa Flour 594 (Invitrogen), and mounted  with Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The  slides were visualized using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.  Recombineering Recombineering was utilized to generate the P3H1 knock-in  mouse model using the method described by Pentao Liu [40].  Briefly, retrieval vector and targeting constructs were designed and  cloned together in order to retrieve the section of Lepre1 for gene  targeting and for introducing the alanine substitution into the gene  locus. The linearized DNA construct was electroporated into AB2.2  embryonic stem (ES) cells and screened for positive recombination  events by both Southern blot and sequencing. Germ-line transmis-  sion of the mutant allele into C57BL6 was obtained.  Animal tissue collection and processing Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice and wild-type littermates were sacrificed  at 3 months of age. Spine, femurs and skin were dissected, fixed,  paraffin embedded, and sectioned according to standard methods  as previously described [2]. The Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mouse colony  was maintained in a mixed 129Sv/ev-C57Black/6J genetic  background and housed in the Baylor College of Medicine  Animal Vivarium.  Radiographs, bone histology/histomorphometry, and tissue staining  Standard protocols were followed for the following stains:  Hematoxylin and Eosin. Immunofluorescence on mouse tissues  was done as previously described [41]. Briefly, the paraffin sections  were xylene treated, rehydrated, and heated for 20 minutes in a  steamer for antigen retrieval. Subsequently they were incubated in  blocking solution (3% normal Donkey serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.1%  Triton X-100 in PBS), 1:100 dilution of COLX antisera, 1:600  donkey ant-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa flour  594 (Invitrogen), and finally mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade  reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). At the end of each described  procedure, images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2  microscope. Radiographs were obtained by Kubtec XPERT80  (Kubtec X-ray, Milford, CT). Routine histologic analysis of  paraffin-embedded long bone and growth plates was done as per  standard protocols. Histomorphometric analysis of static and  dynamic parameters (using 25 mg/kg calcein injection) of bone  resorption, formation, and volume was carried out according to  standard procedure in 12 week-old (N = 6 each sex and genotype)  [42] and analyzed using the Bioquant OsteoMetrics software  system (BIOQUANT Image Analysis Corporation, Nashville,  TN).  Micro-CT analysis Spine and femur samples were placed into a 16 mm tube filled  with 70% ethanol and scanned at 16 micron resolution using a  ScanCo uct40 scanner (N = 10 each sex and genotype). Trabecular  and cortical analysis was performed using the ScanCo software.  The trabecular region of the L4 vertebrae was manually selected  (contoured) every 5 slices, and then the remaining slices were  morphed to enclose the region of interest, for a total of 100 slices.  The region was thresholded at 210 with a gauss setting of 0.  Cortical analysis was performed on 50 slices of the femoral  midshaft, using the same thresholding.  Three-point bending analysis Femurs were collected (N = 7, both genotypes) during tissue  harvest, wrapped in gauze soaked in 16PBS and stored at 220uC until ready for analysis. All testing was performed in a 3-point  Table 3. Table comparing Lepre1H662A/H662A phenotype to established OI mouse models.

The posterior surface of the femur  was placed on the lower supports and centered between the two  supports. The displacement rate used for the analysis was  0.3425 mm/sec.  Stress was calculated using the following formula:  Stress~ (0:5h)FL  4I  where F is the load applied on the femur in N, L is the span length  in mm, h is the specimen diameter in mm, and I is the cross-  sectional moment of inertia in mm 4 . L was set at 7 mm for the  three point bending jig. Both h and I were obtained by analyzing a  midshaft micro-CT image using the slice geometry program in  BoneJ, a plugin for bone image analysis in ImageJ. The program  identified the bone in the grayscale micro-CT image by pixel  brightness and then calculated its cross-sectional parameters once  an accurate scale was assigned.  Strain was calculated using the following formula:  Strain~ 6Dh  L2  where D is the actuator displacement in mm, h is the diameter in  mm and L is the span length in mm.  To determine the Yield Point, a region was identified after the  preload and before the maximum load on the Load-Displacement  curve. This region was separated into 2 segments from which the  fitted line of the segment with greatest slope was taken. Next, a  0.00876 mm offset was implemented on the line. The point of  intersection between the offset line and the Load-Displacement  curve was the Offset Yield Point. This yield point corresponded to  a 0.2% offset strain, which is commonly chosen in the literature.  The elastic region was identified as the region from the completion  of the preload to the Yield Point. Post-Yield region was identified  as the region from the Yield Point until the Failure Point, where  the load dropped to zero. Elastic Displacement was the  displacement during which specimen remained in elastic region.  Post-Yield Displacement was the displacement during which  specimen remained in the Post-Yield region. Total Displacement  was calculated as the sum of Elastic Displacement and Post-Yield  Displacement. Using a trapezoidal numerical integration method,  Elastic Energy was calculated as the area under the elastic region  of the Load-Displacement curve. Similarly, Post-Yield Energy was  calculated as the area under the post-yield region of the Load-  Displacement curve. Energy to Failure was the sum of Elastic  Energy and Post-Yield Energy. Maximum Load was determined  by finding the highest load value recorded by BLUEHILL, before  the specimen failed. To calculate Stiffness, Least Square fit method  was applied to the steepest segment of the elastic region of the  Load-Displacement curve. Stiffness was the slope of least square fit  line.  Ultimate Strength was determined by finding the highest Stress  value before the specimen failed. Using a trapezoidal numerical  integration method, Elastic Toughness was calculated as the area  under the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve. Similarly, Post-  Yield Toughness was calculated as the area under the post-yield  region of the Stress-Strain curve. Toughness to Failure was the  sum of Elastic Toughness and Post-Yield Toughness. To calculate  Elastic Modulus, Least Square fit method was applied to the  steepest segment of the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve.  Elastic Modulus was the slope of least square fit line.  Electron microscopy Freshly dissected tissues were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde/  1.5% paraformaldehyde with 0.05% tannic acid in 0.1 M  Cacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 for 60 minutes on ice, rinsed in 0.1  M cacocylate overnight, then postfixed for 60 minutes in  cacodylate buffered 1% OsO4, rinsed, then dehydrated in a  graded ethanol series from 30-100%. The samples were washed in  propylene oxide and embedded in Spurrs epoxy. Ultrathin  sections were stained in Uranyl Acetate followed by Reynolds  lead citrate and examined using a FEI Tecnai G2 TEM.  Transmission electron microscopy was performed on skin of wild-  type and Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice (N = 3). The fibril diameter of ten  fibrils in each of fifteen different areas per mouse was measured  (N = 150 total measurements).  Collagen cross-link and mass spectral analyses Pyridinoline cross-links (HP and LP) were quantified by HPLC  after hydrolyzing demineralized bone in 6N HCl as described  [44].  Types I and V collagens were prepared from minced bone  decalcified at 4uC in 0.1M HCl overnight. Type I a-chains were extracted by heat denaturation (90uC) in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Type V collagen was solubilized by pepsin in 3% acetic  acid and selectively precipitated by 1.8 m NaCl [45]. Type II  collagen was solubilized by CNBr digestion of rib cartilage in 70%  formic acid [46]. Collagen a-chains and CNBr-peptides were resolved respectively on 6% and 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels [47].  Demineralized bone matrix was digested with bacterial colla-  genase as described [48]. Collagenase-generated peptides were  separated by reversed-phase HPLC (C8, Brownlee Aquapore RP-  300, 4.6 mm625 cm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile:n- propanol (3:1 v/v) in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid [49].  Individual fractions were analyzed by LC-MS.  Collagen a-chains or CB peptide bands were cut from SDS- PAGE gels and digested with trypsin in-gel [50]. Peptides were  analyzed by electrospray LC/MS using an LCQ Deca XP ion-trap  mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with in-line liquid  chromatography using a C8 capillary column (300 um6150 mm; Grace Vydac 208MS5.315) eluted at 4.5 ul min. The LC mobile  phase consisted of buffer A (0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water) and  buffer B (0.1% formic acid in 3:1 acetonitrile:n-propanol v/v). An  electrospray ionization source (ESI) introduced the LC sample  stream into the mass spectrometer with a spray voltage of 3 kV.  Sequest search software (ThermoFinnigan) was used for peptide  identification using the NCBI protein database. Large collagenous  peptides not found by Sequest had to be identified manually by  calculating the possible ms/ms ions and matching these to the actual  ms/ms. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine calculations were done  manually by scrolling or averaging the full scan over several minutes  so that all of the post-translational variations of a given peptide  appeared together in the full scan.  Fibroblast isolation from mice Mice were euthanized using isoflurane, the fur was scraped off  the back of the mouse and a small section of skin was harvested.  The skin was washed with 16PBS and placed dermis down onto a well of a 6-well plate. 2 ml of DMEM complete was added to the  well and the skin was cut into small pieces using a scalpel to allow  fibroblasts to migrate from the skin.  Collagen secretion from fibroblasts We analyzed procollagen secretion by pulse-chase assay as  previously described [51,52]. Briefly, we plated 2.56105 cells onto  Effects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage  PLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 14 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121    a 35 mm dish and let them grow overnight. The next evening, the  medium was changed to DMEM complete with 50 mM ascorbate to induce collagen synthesis. After washing the cells 3 times with  16PBS to remove FBS from the cells, the medium was replaced with serum free DMEM containing 50 mM ascorbate and 140 mCi of L-[2,3,4,5-  3 H] proline. Cells were labeled for 1 hour and then  chased with fresh medium containing unlabeled proline. Both the  cell layer and medium were harvested in 16 PBS containing 16 inhibitor at 20-minute intervals and the procollagen was precip-  itated with collagen carrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Samples  were electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containing urea  under reducing conditions, dried, and imaged by exposing film to  gel for 24 hours at 280uC and processed using a developer. Procollagen secretion over time was measured by comparing the  amount of labeled procollagen present in the cell layer and  medium at each time point. The pulse-chase assay was repeated  three times to confirm the results.  Collagen steady-state analysis We analyzed collagen modification by collagen steady-state  analysis as previously described [51,52]. Briefly, we plated  2.56105 cells onto a 35 mm dish and let them grow overnight. The medium was changed to DMEM complete with 50 mM ascorbate to induce collagen synthesis. After 4 hours, the cells  were washed 3 times with 16PBS and the medium was replaced with serum free DMEM containing 50 mM ascorbate and 140 mCi of L-[2,3,4,5-  3 H] proline. Cells were labeled overnight. Both the  cell layer and medium were harvested in 16 PBS containing 16 inhibitor and the procollagen was precipitated with collagen  carrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Collagens were obtained by  overnight pepsin digestion (50 ug/ml) of procollagen samples.  Samples were electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containing  urea under reducing conditions for collagen samples, dried, and  imaged by exposing film to gel for 24 hours at 280uC and processed using a developer. This assay was repeated three times  to confirm the results.  Statistical analyses Data are expressed as mean values 6 standard deviation (SD).  Statistical significance was computed using the Student's t test. A P  value ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Supporting Information  Figure S1 Generation of Lepre1 H662A  mutant allele. A recombi-  neering strategy was utilized to incorporate the H662A mutation  into the Lepre1 gene locus. Positive recombination events were  analyzed by Southern blot using XmnI to differentiate the  genomic locus allele from the targeted (Lepre1 H662A  ) allele.  (TIFF)  Figure S2 Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice have a normal tibial hyper-  trophic zone. Since the Lepre1 2/2  animals showed disorganization  of the hypertrophic zone, we assessed the hypertrophic zone (P1)  of Lepre1 H662A/H662A  mice by H&E staining (A) and by specifically  marking the hypertrophic zone using an antibody directed against  type6collagen (B). The hypertrophic zone of the tibia of the Lepre1  H662A/H662A mice are indistinguishable from their wild-type  littermates (B) and this is confirmed by quantifying the width of the  hypertrophic zone in which there is no difference in the width  between genotypes (C) (N = 10, both genotypes).
