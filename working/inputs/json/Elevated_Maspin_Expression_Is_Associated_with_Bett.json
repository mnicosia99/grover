    "summary": "All extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to and adult intensive care unit were prospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak (51 patients affected) of multiresistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infection was detected. The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-resistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline, whereas resistance to the beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved was CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as well as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be transferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem resistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 microg/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis of the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the former expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of them. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple species. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.",

  Elevated Maspin Expression Is Associated with Better Overall Survival in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) Yang Wang1, Shijie Sheng2*, Jianzhi Zhang1, Sijana Dzinic2, Shaolei Li1, Fang

Detroit, Michigan, United States of America  Abstract  Tumor suppressor maspin is a differentially regulated gene in the progression of many types of cancer. While the biological function of maspin in blocking tumor invasion and metastasis is consistent with the loss of maspin expression at the late stage of tumor progression, the differential expression and the biological significance of maspin in early stage of tumor progression appear to be complex and remain to be elucidated. In the current study, we examined the expression of maspin in 84 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases (stages I-III) and 55 non-tumor adjacent esophageal tissue specimens by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The correlation of maspin with clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. Compared to normal esophageal squamous tissue where 80% (47/55) of the cases expressed maspin at a low to moderate level, all ESCC specimens (100% (84/84)) were positive for maspin expression at a moderate to high level. ESCC with low or moderate maspin expression had significantly shorter postoperative survival rates compared to those that had high maspin expression (p,0.001). Since the correlation of maspin with ESCC histology and the correlation of maspin with ESCC prognosis seem to be at odds, we further investigated the biological function of maspin in ESCC using the established ESCC cell lines. The expression of maspin in five human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines (T12, E450, KYSE150, EC109, and KYSE510) was examined by the Western blot. ESCC cell line KYSE510 that did not express maspin and was stably transfected by maspin cDNA or an empty vector. The resulting transfected cells were characterized in vitro. Maspin expression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, motility and matrigel invasion. Taken together, our data suggest that the transient up-regulation of maspin in the early development of ESCC may be a defense mechanism against further transition towards more malignant phenotypes, ultimately slowing down ESCC tumor progression.

The two main subtypes of  esophageal carcinoma are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell  carcinoma (ESCC), while the most commonly diagnosed esoph-  ageal cancer in China and other Asian countries is ESCC [3,4].  Despite the rapid advancement in combined chemotherapy and  radiation therapy for ESCC, the average 5-year overall survival  has remained steady at 10-20% [2,5,6]. Unfortunately, the  prediction of clinical prognosis of patients with ESCC based on  conventional pathological variables, such as the tumor size, tumor  grade, and the tumor stage is highly empirical [7-9]. Specific  biomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the progression of  ESCC may significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction of  patients' survival. To this end, it is important to note that many of  the molecular markers that are associated with specific patholog-  ical grades (diagnosis) have failed to serve as prognostic markers. It  is well appreciated that tumor progression is a continuum of  dynamic molecular and cellular changes. The link of a molecular  profile with a phenotype may not reflect whether the former is  driver or a passenger of the latter, and may not predict whether  this association is consequential for further tumor progression.  Some molecular changes may be suppressive steps that may  eventually give way to the predominant oncogenic changes. The  capacity of tumor cells to turn on tumor suppressive mechanisms,  even though transitory, may translate into delayed tumor  progression, and prolonged patients' survival.  Maspin is an epithelial-specific tumor suppressor that is  differentially regulated during tumor progression. It is a member  of the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily [10] but with  functions that are deviant from those of classical serine protease-  inhibiting serpins. Accumulated evidence suggests that maspin  may play a key role in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis  by blocking serine protease-like enzymes such as the zymogen  form of urokinase-type plasminogen activator [11,12] and histone  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581    deacetylase 1 [13]. Consistent with its anti-invasion and anti-  metastasis properties, maspin expression is found to be down  regulated in the progression of many types of cancer at the step of  tumor invasion and metastasis.  As a tumor suppressor, maspin is not immediately down-  regulated in the early development of cancer. In fact, accumulated  evidence demonstrates a transient up-regulation of maspin in non-  invasive cancer of breast [14,15], ovary [16], and pancreas  [17,18]. In adenocarcinomas, this up-regulation of maspin is also  associated with its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.  In squamous cell carcinomas, however, maspin is always  distributed to both nucleus and cytoplasm. The biological  significance of these distinct differential patterns is a subject of  current investigation. Based on our earlier studies, the transloca-  tion of maspin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in early stage  adenocarcinoma correlates with significantly better survival of  lung cancer [19]. On the other hand, elevated maspin expression  in early stage squamous cell carcinoma both, nuclear and  cytosolic, correlates with significantly better survival of oral  squamous cell carcinoma [20]. These data suggest that the  prognosis of cancer subtypes may be distinctly stratified based on  maspin differential expression.  In this paper, we report the first clinical evidence that maspin  was significantly elevated in a subpopulation of stage I-III ESCC  specimens. The level of maspin expression correlated with better  overall survival of ESCC patients. We further investigated the  biological function of maspin using established ESCC cell lines  and showed an inhibitory effect of maspin on cell proliferation,  motility, and invasion. These data suggest that ESCC with an  ability to up-regulate maspin may be protected against further  malignant progression.  Materials and Methods  Tissue Specimens This research involves 84 archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-  embedded human stage I-III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma  (ESCC) tissue specimens, from patients who were eligible for and  underwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007 at the  Department of Surgery, Beijing Cancer Hospital (China). In  addition, tumor-adjacent normal tissue specimens were collected  from 55 of these patients. Prior to the tissue collection, the clinical  protocol was approved by the ethics review board of Peking  University Health Sciences Center. Informed written consents  were obtained from the patients. The consents were saved as  scanned PDF files, and saved in patients' records. The samples  were de-identified to the research group. The 84 patients included  64 men and 20 women with a median age of 58 years (ranging  from 43 to 73 years).  Immunohistochemical (IHC) Staining Tissue sections on slides of 5 mm thickness were subjected to  hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and IHC staining of  maspin as described previously [16]. Monoclonal antibody against  maspin (clone G167-70; Pharmingen/BD Bioscience, San Diego,  CA) was diluted 100-fold. The horse-reddish peroxidase (HRP)  conjugated secondary antibody (Dako Cytomation, Cambridge-  shire, UK) was detected by chromogenic reaction of HRP. For  negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. The tissue  sections were examined and scored independently by the two  pathologists who had no prior knowledge of the study aim or  design. Maspin expression was semi-quantitatively evaluated by  the percentage of maspin positive cells and the intensity of maspin  staining on the scale of 0-3. The percentage of positive cells was  categorically scored as following: 0 points (maspin positive in 0-  5% of cells); 2 points (maspin positive in 6-50% of cells); 3 points  (maspin positive in .50% of cells). The staining intensity was  categorically scored as follows: 1 point: negative or weak staining;  2 points: moderate staining; 3 points: strong staining. The overall  maspin expression (OMS) was calculated as the sum of the  percentage category points and the intensity category points in  each case. Tumors were categorized into four groups: negative:  #5% of cells stained, regardless of intensity; weak expression  (OMS: 0-2 points); moderate expression (OMS: 3-4 points); and  strong expression (OMS: 5-6 points). Maspin sub-cellular pattern  of nuclear staining and cytoplasmic staining were assessed semi-  quantitatively on the basis of the percentage of positive cells, as  described previously [21]. Maspin nuclear immunoreactivity was  defined as stronger nuclear staining than cytoplasmic staining in at  least 10% of tumor cells. Maspin cytoplasmic immunoreactivity  was defined as stronger cytoplasmic staining than nuclear staining  in at least 10% of tumor cells.  Cell Lines and Cell Culture Five human ESCC cell lines (KYSE-510, KYSE-150, T12,  E450 and EC-109) were purchased from Institute of Basic Medical  Sciences Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences' cell culture center  (Beijing, China). The cells were maintained at 37uC and 5% CO2 in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, US) supplemented with 10%  heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-  streptomycin.  Western Blotting Cells were lysed with 16 RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute of  Biotechnology, Nantong, China) containing 25 mg/mL leupeptin (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg/mL aprotinin (Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells were removed from the dishes by cell  scraping. The samples were then subjected to three cycles of  freeze-thaw and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The  protein concentration of the samples was determined using a  bicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Reagent kit, and whole cell  lysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a  polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was  blocked in 5% skim milk for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) and  then probed with primary antibodies against maspin (1:500  diluted) and a-actin (from SIGMA, 1:10,000 diluted), respectively. The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at  1:2,500 dilutions. The bound secondary antibody was detected by  chemiluminescence reaction (Millipore, Bedford, USA) and  visualized by radiography.  Stable Transfection Sequence-verified maspin cDNA cloned into a vector for  expression in mammalian cells [22] was used to transfect  approximately 60% confluent KYSE-510 using the Lipofectami-  ne TM  2000 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The empty vector DNA  was used in parallel transfection as a negative control. For clonal  selection, 24 hrs after transfection, G418 was added to the culture  medium at the concentration of 400 mg/mL. The cells were maintained in G418-containing medium for the next 4 weeks until  individual clones were selected. The selected clones were  subsequently maintained in the medium containing 200 mg/mL of G418.  Cell Proliferation Assay To determine the effect of maspin on cell proliferation, cells  with and without maspin were seeded into 96-well plate at a  Maspin and ESCC Prognosis  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581    density of 46103/well/200 mL in the maintenance medium. Viable cells were quantified at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours (h) after  the seeding by the chromogenic 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-  diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay according to the  manufacturer's instruction (Sigma, St. Louis, US). Each assay  was performed in triplicates and repeated 3 times.  Colony Formation Assay Cells seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 400 cells/well/  medium volume, were allowed to grow for 10 days to form  colonies. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and treated with  Giemsa for 10 min, and then photographed with a digital camera  (OLYMPUS, SP350). The number of colonies and the number of  cells in each colony was counted under the microscopy. The  colonies which had more than 100 cells were defined as big  colonies.  Wound-healing Assay The cells were added to six-well plates, allowed to form  confluent monolayers and were serum starved overnight. An  artificial wound was created in the cell monolayer with a sterile  plastic 200 mL micropipette tip to generate one homogeneous wound in each well. After wounding, the culture medium was  removed, and cells were washed at least twice to eliminate  detached cells. Wound closure was photographed at 0, 6, 12, and  24 h after wounding. Images of cells from the same field were  acquired at the indicated time points, using an inverted  microscope equipped with a digital camera. The number of cells  in each colony was counted under microscope. Each measurement  was performed in triplicate.  Matrigel Invasion Assay Invasion assay was performed using 8 mm PET pore size  membrane coated with Matrigel (24-well, BD Biosciences, Bed-  ford, MA). Cells were seeded at 26105 cells per 500 mL of growth medium on the Matrigel-coated membrane. The bottom wells  were filled with the maintenance culture medium, and the  chambers were incubated at 37uC in a humidified 5% CO2. After 24 h, the Matrigel and non-invading cells in the upper chamber  were removed by scraping. The cells on the bottom side of the  membrane (invading cells) were stained with 1% crystal violet and  counted under the microscope. Each experiment was performed in  triplicate.  Statistical Analysis Clinicopathological factors were analyzed separately using the  chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate  the patient survival and the log-rank test was used to determine the  statistical significance. The associations between discrete variables  were assessed using the chi-square test. All data were expressed as  the mean 6 standard deviation. A p-value of less than 0.05 was  considered to be statistically significant. Statistical calculations  were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences  software version 11.0 (SPSS11.0).  Results  Differential Maspin Expression in Human ESCC and Normal Adjacent Tissues  To investigate whether the level or subcellular localization of  maspin helps predict the survival of ESCC patients, ESCC tissues  were collected from 84 stage I-III patients who were eligible for  and underwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007. These  patients were followed up for at least 5 years. IHC was performed  to examine the expression of maspin in these tumor specimens, as  well as 55 tumor-adjacent normal tissues, and the level of maspin  expression was semi-quantified using the method described in the  Materials and Methods section. Representative results are shown  in Figure 1. As summarized in Table 1, among 55 cases of normal esophageal tissues, the positive immunoreactivity was  associated with 85% of cases (47/55). The 8 patients had no  maspin immunoreactivity, 37 cases had weak maspin staining, and  10 cases were associated with strong maspin staining. In contrast,  all 84 ESCC specimens showed positive maspin staining. 33 tumor  specimens were associated with weak maspin staining, whereas 51  cases had strong maspin staining. Overall, as compared to the  corresponding normal esophageal tissues, ESCC tissues exhibited  stronger maspin IHC signals and a higher percentage of maspin-  strong cells (p,0.001).  Based on the overall maspin expression, all the tumor specimens  can be divided by the total level of maspin expression (low/  moderate vs. strong), the level of nuclear maspin (weak/moderate  vs. strong), and the level of cytoplasmic maspin (weak/moderate  vs. strong). The stratification of these different groups with  clinicopatholoigcal variables was evaluated. As summarized in  Table 2, there was no significant difference between the groups with respect to sex, age, pathologic grade and tumor stage. In  addition, we also analyzed the association between subcellular  localization of maspin and clinicopathological variables. Even  though not statistically significant, we observed the following  trends: poorly differentiated tumors were associated with weaker  nuclear maspin staining and stronger cytoplasmic maspin staining.  In addition, the lymph node metastasis was associated with a  higher level of cytoplasmic maspin staining as compared to lymph  node negative patients.  Maspin Expression Correlates with Better Overall Postoperative Survival  Our cohort of ESCC patients were followed up for at least 5  years, as of March 2012, with a median survival of 36.5 months. In  order to test if maspin expression is associated with increased or  decreased patient survival, patients were classified into two groups,  those with strong maspin expression (51 cases, OMS 5-6) or those  with weak and moderate maspin expression (33 cases, OMS 2-4).  The corresponding median survival time for these two groups were  45611.1 months and 1962.9 months, respectively, demonstrating  that stronger maspin expression is associated with significantly  increased patient survival and favorable prognosis. (Figure 2A, log-rank, p = 0.009). Since previous reports in breast [23] and lung  cancer [19] for example, suggest that nuclear maspin is associated  with better overall patient survival, we also investigated whether  maspin subcellular localization correlated with the overall survival.  For this purpose, the patients were classified into two correspond-  ing groups: predominantly nuclear expression or predominantly  cytoplasmic expression patients. Although the p value did not  reach a significant difference, stronger expression of maspin in the  nucleus was still associated with a more favorable patient prognosis  (4469.5 months vs. 2164.5 months; p = 0.051) (Figures 2B and 2C). In general, maspin expression level correlated with less tumor local invasion. We also observed a trend for the negative  correlation between maspin expression and lymph node metastasis  (Table 2). In addition, reduced nuclear maspin and increased cytoplasmic maspin were associated with lymph node metastasis.  Although these data did not reach statistical significance, in part  limited by the number of patients, they are consistent with the  notion that the mortality of these ESCC patients result primarily  from metastasis.  Maspin and ESCC Prognosis  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581    Maspin Expressed in ESCC Cell Lines is Tumor Suppressive  Established ESCC cell lines offer a valuable experimental model  to study the progression and underlying molecular mechanisms.  Similar to the observation with early stage ESCC specimens, the  level of maspin was not significantly altered in ESCC cell lines that  are only weakly or moderately aggressive (T12, E450, KYSE150,  and EC109) [24], as judged by Western blotting (Figure 3A). However, ESCC cell line KYSE510 that was significantly more  invasive and grew at a faster rate had lost maspin expression  (Figure 3B).  To investigate the functional significance of maspin in ESCC,  we took the advantage of KYSE510 cell line that did not express  maspin and stably transfected the cells with maspin-encoding  pCMV-Tag2-maspin vector or an empty vector pCMV-Tag2.  The maspin expression in the resulting maspin transfected cells  (M-KYSE510) and the mock transfected control (V-KYSE510) are  shown in Figure 4A. As shown in Figure 4B, maspin expression correlated with decreased cell proliferation as judged by the MTT  assay. Earlier, it was reported that maspin regulated cell  attachment and detachment [13,25]. To determine whether the  effect of maspin expression on tumor growth was a result of altered  colonization, cells were suspended and seeded at a low density in  cell culture dish. The number of the single cell-derived colonies  and number of cells per colony were evaluated under the  microscope. Maspin expression did not significantly alter the  colony forming ability, for the colony numbers for M-KYSE510,  V-KYSE510 and the parental cells were not significantly different  (data not shown). However, as shown in Figure 4C, the size of M-  KYSE510 colonies was significantly smaller compared to those  derived fromV-KYSE510 cell line. Consistently, the number of  cells per colony was significantly lower than those for V-KYSE510  and parental cells. The number of colonies of M-KYSE510 with  more than 100 cells was approximately a half of those of V-  KYSE510 or parental KYSE510cells (p,0.01, Figure 4D).  To further investigate whether the presence of maspin in ESCC  is a gain or loss of other functions in tumor progression, we  examined the effect of maspin expression on tumor cell motility  and invasion. As shown by the in vitro wound healing assay  (Figure 5A), The M-KYSE-510 displayed a significantly attenu- ated rate of wound healing as compared to V-KYSE-510 or  parental KYSE-510 cells. Moreover, as compared to V-KYSE-  510 or parental KYSE-510 cells, M-KYSE-510 exhibited a  significantly lower capacity to migrate through the Matrigel-  coated transwell membrane in the in vitro invasion assay (p,0.01,  Figures 5B and 5C).  Although the level of maspin correlated with the overall  survival, the biological function and underlying molecular  mechanisms of maspin may not be as simple. The effects of  maspin may further depend on tumor microenvironments. In  addition to reducing the proliferative activity and invasive  potential, maspin may also prevent tumor angiogenesis through  epigenetic regulation [26-30].  Earlier we have shown that maspin may directly inhibit cell  surface-associated uPA to block tumor cell detachment  [12,26,31,32]. Data from the Hendrix Laboratory [33] and our  laboratory [29] further suggest that maspin may down-regulate the  expression of uPA. To test whether the effect of maspin on the  Figure 1.

Interestingly, the level of uPA in all the cell lines tested was low,  irrespective to the levels of maspin (data not shown). Considering  the differences between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocar-  cinoma, the underlying mechanism for the inhibitory effects of  maspin on ESCC invasion may not be identical to that in  carcinoma cells of breast and prostate origin. To date, there is no  clinical consensus about uPA as a prognostic marker for ESCC.  Discussion  The challenge for clinicians and oncologists in terms of patient  personalized medicine and plan for treatment is that early stage  tumors with similar histopathological features may subsequently  display dramatically different outcome. In this paper, we described  the first evidence that tumor suppressor maspin expression in early  stage ESCC positively correlated with overall postoperative  survival of patients. In light of our in vitro data that maspin  inhibits tumor growth and blocks tumor invasion, several  important observations with human specimens suggest a unique  value of maspin as a molecular prognostic marker of ESCC.  Overall, our data support a hypothetical model (Figure 6) that helps explain the correlation between maspin up-regulation and  better overall survival of patients with ESCC. Based on this model,  maspin is expressed in early stage ESCC to retain the epithelial  homeostasis. In the absence of oncogenic changes, a basal level of  maspin expression is maintained in normal or benign squamous  epithelial cells to counter incidental stress and transformation  insults. Upon the transformation and other oncogenic changes, the  basal level of maspin expression may not be sufficient to counter-  balance the biological effects of oncogenes. Those epithelial cells  that are still capable of up-regulating maspin expression will  remain better differentiated with low potential to invade and  metastasize. The balance will shift towards more malignant  phenotypes in those cells that are not capable of up-regulating  maspin or would eventually lose maspin expression. In contrast to  molecular markers whose differential expression patterns com-  pletely coincide with histopathological features, early stage ESCC  cells expressing maspin at different levels may be histologically  Table 2.

The usefulness of maspin differential expression may not  be to confirm pathological diagnosis. Rather, maspin may be  uniquely useful as an independent marker to predict the course of  the disease progression.  Maspin is an epithelial-specific protein. We did not detect  specific maspin antigen by immunohistochemistry in stromal  components in human ESCC specimens. Clinical studies to  correlate maspin and tumor progression have been mostly  conducted with adenocarcinoma, which is thought to be of  glandular epithelial origin. Together with our current study, there  are only two reports on how maspin expression correlates with the  progression of squamous cell carcinoma, which derives from  stratified squamous epithelial cells. The reported data with oral  squamous cell carcinoma [20,34] share the following important  similarities with our current study with ESCC: (i) both studies were  conducted with surgically resected early stage tumor specimens; (ii)  in both cases, maspin protein was detected in almost all tumor  cells, and was overexpressed in some tumor cells; (iii) maspin  protein was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm; and (iv)  the overall maspin expression levels correlated with better survival  of the patients. In comparison, a distinct maspin differential  expression patter is observed in adenocarcinoma. Studies with  tissue specimens from breast [35,36], prostate [37], and lung [19]  adenocarcinoma showed that maspin is predominantly a nuclear  protein in benign epithelial cells. Pre-neoplastic lesions and early  stage carcinomas are commonly associated with elevated level of  maspin, which is localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm [19,35].  In invasive and metastatic carcinoma maspin expression is down-  regulated or lost [38-40]. To our knowledge, maspin is the only  molecular marker that displays distinct differential expression  patterns in the progression of different subtypes of carcinoma.  Figure 3.

Thus, tumor suppressor genes that are mecha-  nistically involved in tumor progression may be more insightful  molecular markers for diagnosis or prediction of prognosis. A  paradigm based on the studies of classic tumor suppressor genes  whose loss or mutation at the genetic level contributes to  carcinogenesis and tumor progression would predict that tumor  suppressors would be down-regulated as long as the oncogenesis is  initiated [42]. Therefore, the tumor suppressive functions of  maspin may seem to be at odds with the observation that maspin is  actually transiently up-regulated in some cells that have already  acquired the histopathologic features of tumor cells. To this end, it  is important to point out that maspin is primarily regulated at the  level of expression and trafficking. Although maspin is not as  frequently mutated as some other well-known tumor suppressor  genes such as p53 [43], a specific Ser 176RPro polymorphism has  been identified [44] which seems to be frequent in gastric cancer  and had reduced tumor suppressive potency as compared to the  wild type maspin.  In vitro data from this study are in line with the consensus that  maspin exerts multifaceted anti-tumor effects, inhibiting tumor  growth, motility, invasion, and sensitizing tumor cells to drug-  induced apoptosis. Maspin may be a nuclear, cytoplasmic, cell  membrane-associated, as well as secreted molecule. The multifac-  eted biological activities of maspin may be coordinated by its  molecular partnerships and subcellular localization [45-47]. To  this end, the Sheng laboratory was the first to report that (i)  secreted endogenous maspin binds and inhibits single-chain tissue  type plasminogen activator (sc-tPA, a zymogen) that is bound to  fibrin or fibrinogen [48], (ii) extracellular maspin specifically binds  and inhibits pro-urokinase type plasminogen activator (pro-uPA, a  zymogen) that is associated with cell surface-anchored uPA  receptor (uPAR) [32] and (iii) intracellular maspin specifically  interacts and inhibits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) [13]. While  the specific molecular mode of action of cytoplasmic maspin is  under investigation in our lab, and earlier report suggested that  cytoplasmic maspin regulates the Rho/Rac signaling network and  block tumor cell motility [49]. It is likely that endogenous targets of  maspin may be molecular targets for cancer therapy.  Author Contributions  Conceived and designed the experiments: YW SS JZ SL FF NW QZ YY.
