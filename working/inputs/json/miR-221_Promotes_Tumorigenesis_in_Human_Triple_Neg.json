    "summary": "The activity of the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase was shown to be reduced during apoptosis and enhanced during cell proliferation. This work investigated whether TNF-alpha exerts also opposite effects on the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase in HepG2 cells and whether these effects are time-dependent. A time response study demonstrated that the activity and protein expression of the ATPase are decreased at 1h and increased at 4, 6 and 8h. This work focused on the up-regulatory 4h-response. TNF-alpha was shown to exert a stimulatory effect on cJNK and NF-kappaB and an inhibitory effect on caspases which, in the basal state, down-regulate the ATPase. The cytokine was found to target the caspases by activating JNK which in turn activates NF-kappaB. The activated transcription factor inhibits the caspases and frees the ATPase from their inhibitory action leading thus to its up-regulation.",

Mehta, Sangita M. Baxi, Min-Jean Yin*  Oncology Research, Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, San Diego, California, United States of America  Abstract  Patients with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) typically have a poor prognosis. TNBCs are characterized by their resistance to apoptosis, aggressive cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, and currently lack molecular markers and effective targeted therapy. Recently, miR-221/miR-222 have been shown to regulate ERa expression and ERa-mediated signaling in luminal breast cancer cells, and also to promote EMT in TNBCs. In this study, we characterized the role of miR- 221 in a panel of TNBCs as compared to other breast cancer types. miR-221 knockdown not only blocked cell cycle progression, induced cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation in-vitro but it also inhibited in-vivo tumor growth by targeting p27kip1. Furthermore, miR-221 knockdown inhibited cell migration and invasion by altering E-cadherin expression, and its regulatory transcription factors Snail and Slug in human TNBC cell lines. Therefore, miR-221 functions as an oncogene and is essential in regulating tumorigenesis in TNBCs both in vitro as well as in vivo.

Because  miRNAs usually bind to their targets with incomplete comple-  mentarity, a single miRNA can potentially regulate the translation  of multiple target genes involved in various cellular processes [2,3].  In fact, miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of a variety  of biological functions, including cellular proliferation, differenti-  ation, and apoptosis [4,5]. Growing evidence indicates that  miRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes [4],  and miRNA expression profiling analyses have revealed charac-  teristic miRNA signatures in a variety of human cancers [6,7].  Furthermore, miRNAs are frequently located at fragile genomic  regions susceptible to amplification, deletion, or translocation  during tumor development [8]. Since miRNAs are believed to be  pivotal players in tumor development, investigations of differential  expression of miRNAs and their corresponding targets might  prove to be instrumental for the diagnosis and treatment of various  cancers.  Molecular profiling has allowed us to classify breast cancers  to five subtypes based on their distinctive gene expression  signatures [9]. The five subtypes are luminal A, luminal B,  Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive,  basal-like, and normal-like breast cancers. Basal-like tumors are  characterized by the expression of genes specific for basal  epithelial cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptotic pathways, and  aggressive migration and invasion [9-11]. Basal-like breast  cancers (BLBCs) are often stained negative by immunochemistry  for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and  HER2 and thus are called triple negative breast cancers  (TNBCs). Although BLBC and TNBC share numerous clinical  and pathological features, they are not identical [12,13]. In the  majority of cases, however, these two categories share similar  clinical characteristics, prognosis and treatment options and  thus, the term \u2018\u2018TNBC'' will be used in this study to collectively  describe BLBC and TNBC cell lines and patient populations.  Clinical studies have shown that TNBCs are the most aggressive  breast cancer type and TNBC patients are frequently faced with  poor prognosis and high mortality [14,15]. Thus, the de-  velopment of targeted therapies for TNBCs is urgently and  critically needed for this patient population.  miR-221 and miR-222 are encoded in tandem from a gene  cluster located on chromosome X and have been shown to be up-  regulated in a panoply of cancer types. Due to their seed sequence  similarity, both miRNAs have been shown to directly target  p27 kip1  , Bmf, PTEN, Mdm2, PUMA, and TRPS1 [16-22]. In  breast cancer, miR-221/miR-222 have been shown to be involved  in regulation of ERa expression, suppression of ERa-mediated signaling, as well as drug resistance mechanisms [23-27]. More  recently miR-221/miR-222 have been shown to be over-expressed  in triple-negative primary breast cancers or cell lines [28-30]. In  this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of cellular  transformation regulated by miR-221/222 specifically in a panel  of human TNBC cell lines compared to other breast cancer types  and validated our findings in vivo. We show that miR-221 is an  oncogene and modulates cell proliferation and tumor progression  via targeting p27 kip1  and EMT transition in TNBCs both in vitro as  well as in vivo.  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62170    Materials and Methods  Cell Culture All cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture  Collection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's  medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)  supplemented with L-glutamine and grown in a humidified  atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37uC.  Stable Cell Line Generation System Bioscience's miRZip  TM anti-sense miRNAs are stably  expressed RNAi hairpins that inhibit miRNA activity. The  miRZip shRNAs produce short, single-stranded anti-miRNAs  that competitively bind their endogenous miRNA target and  inhibit its function. The miRZip short hairpin RNAs are cloned  into SBI's pGreenPuro TM  shRNA expression vector, an improved  third generation HIV-based expression lentivector. The lentiviral  vector contains the genetic elements responsible for packaging,  transduction, and stable integration of the viral construct into  genomic DNA, inducing expression of the anti-miRNA effector  sequence. For production of a high titer of viral particles, we used  the ViraPower TM  Lentiviral Support Kit (Invitrogen) employing  Lipofectamine TM  2000 (Invitrogen) for transfecting the miRzip  vectors into HEK-293T cells. Because infected cells stably express  cop-GFP and puromycin, as well as the anti-miRNA cloned into  Figure 1. miR-221 is over expressed in TNBCs. qRT-PCR was performed to quantitatively measure RNA expression levels of miR-221 (A) and miR- 222 (B) in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. All expression levels are displayed as fold changes normalized to the expression level in normal breast tissue. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062170.g001  miR-221 Promotes Tumorigenesis in TNBCs  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62170    Figure 2. miR-221 modulates cell cycle progression by targeting p27 kip1  .

RT-PCR TaqMan miRNA assays (Life Technologies, CA) were used to  quantify the expression levels of mature miR-221 and miR-222 as  well mRNAs p27, Snail, Slug, vimentin and E-Cadherin. Total  RNA extracted by mirVana (Life Technologies) was reverse  transcribed in a reaction mixture containing miR-specific stem-  loop RT primers. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)  was performed in triplicate with reactions containing amplified  cDNA and TaqMan primers in Universal Master Mix without  AmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems). The qPCR was conducted  at 95uC for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 15 seconds and 60uC for 60 seconds in 7900 HT Real Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and threshold cycles (CT) were  calculated using Sequence Detection Software (SDS v2.2.1,  Applied Biosystems). All mRNA quantification data were normal-  ized to GAPDH. All miRNA data are expressed relative to  a RNU48 small nuclear (sn) RNA TaqMan PCR performed on  the same samples, unless otherwise specified. Fold expression was  calculated from the triplicate of CT values following the 2 2DDCt  method.  Immunoblotting Cells were lysed in buffer composed of 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM  MgCl2, 50 mM HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton  X-100, 0.5% NP-40 supplemented with 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM  PMSF, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM b-glycerophosphate, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) added  prior to use. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA  Protein Assay (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific) per manufac-  turer's instructions. Protein (30-50 mg) was resolved by SDS- PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were  probed with primary antibodies to detect proteins of interest. After  incubation with secondary antibodies, membranes were visualized  by chemiluminescence (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific). All  antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, with  the exception of GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).  Cell Proliferation, Apoptosis Assay, Migration, and Invasion Assays Resazurin Fluorescent Assay was used for the proliferation  studies. Briefly, Cells were seeded at 3000-5,000 cells/100ul/well  in DMEM +10% FBS in a 96 well plate, and incubated overnight at 37uC in 5% CO2. Resazurin (Sigma) fluorescent dye was added (1:100) to each well. The cells were incubated at 37uC in 5% CO2 for 4 hours at which point the plate was read for fluorescence at  530/590 nm on the HTS 7000 plate reader. Cell Signaling  Technologies PathScanH Apoptosis Multi-Target Sandwich ELISA Kits were used in the apoptosis assays. Briefly, antibodies  for cleaved caspase 3 and phosphorylated BAD had been coated  onto microwells. After incubation with the cell lysates, the target  protein was captured by the coated antibody. Following extensive  washing, a detection antibody was added to detect the captured  target protein. An HRP-linked secondary antibody was then used  to recognize the bound detection antibody. HRP substrate, TMB,  was added for color development which was measured to quantity  the level of bound target protein. Cell Biolab's CytoSelect TM  Cell  Migration Assay Kit containing polycarbonate membrane inserts  (8 mm pore size) in a 24-well plate was used in our migration assays. Migratory cells were able to extend protrusions towards  FBS (used as the chemo-attractant), and pass through the pores of  the polycarbonate membrane. The non-migratory cells were  removed from the top of the membrane and the migratory cells  were stained and quantified. Similarly, Cell Biolabs CytoSelect TM  Cell Invasion Assay Kit containing basement membrane-coated  inserts were used to assay the invasive properties of the cells. The  upper surface of the insert membrane is coated with a uniform  layer of dried basement membrane matrix solution. This basement  membrane layer serves as a barrier to discriminate invasive cells  from non-invasive cells. The non-invasive cells were removed from  the top of the membrane and the invading cells were stained and  quantified.  Cell Cycle Analysis MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 parental cells and  cells stably expressing miR-221-ZIP, or scramble miRNA-ZIP  were cultured to 70-90% confluency and allowed to adhere  overnight. Cells were collected, fixed, and permeabilized using the  Cell Cycle Phase Determination Kit (Cayman Chemical) following  the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were stored at 220uC until DNA stained with propidium iodide and read on a BD  FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was done with  FCS Express (De Novo Software). All experiments were repeated  at least 3 times and representative data set is shown.  Animal Studies Six- to eight-week-old nu/nu athymic female mice were  obtained from Jackson Labs. The mice were maintained in  pressurized ventilated caging at the Pfizer La Jolla animal facility.  All animal studies were done under the ethical approval by Pfizer  Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Tumors were  established by injecting 56106 cells suspended 1:1 (v/v) with reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel, BD Biosciences).  Tumor dimensions were measured with Vernier calipers, and  tumor volumes were calculated using this formula: p/66(larger diameter)6(smaller diameter)2. Tumor growth inhibition percent- age (TGI %) was calculated as 1006(12DT/DC). One way ANOVA Statistical analysis were performed and noted as ***  depicting p-value less than or equal to 0.001.  Results  miR-221 is Specifically Up-regulated in Human TNBC Cell Lines The expression level of miR-221 and miR-222 were examined  by qRT-PCR in 4 TNBC lines: MDA-MB-231, Hs-578T, BT-20,  and MDA-MB-468; 2 HER2 positive lines: SKBR3 and MDA-  MB-361; and 3 ER positive lines: T47D, ZR75-1, and MCF-7. In  comparison to the expression level in normal breast tissue (RNA  acquired from Applied Biosystems), miR-221 is up-regulated in all  the TNBC lines while down-regulated in the non-TNBC lines  (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, although clustered with miR-221, the  expression level of miR-222 is only up-regulated mildly (1-1.5 fold)  in Hs-578-T and BT-20 (compared to normal breast tissue), but  MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing anti-miR-221 or scramble miR-ZIP depicting changes in p27 protein level. GAPDH was used as loading control. (E) MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing anti-miR-221 or scramble miR-ZIP were cultured for 72 hours to reach 80-90% confluency before harvesting and cell cycle analysis was performed and displayed as percentages of each cell cycle stage. These experiments were repeated at least three times, and representative data is shown. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062170.g002  miR-221 Promotes Tumorigenesis in TNBCs  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62170    Figure 3. miR-221 knockdown induces apoptosis, inhibits cell proliferation and supresses tumor growth in mice. MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing miR-221-ZIP or scramble-ZIP were used to perform apoptosis, cell proliferation, and in-vivo tumor growth assays. (A) Cleaved caspase 3 and phosphorylation of BAD were measured as apoptosis markers. All cell lines were seeded at similar density as the parental cell lines and cultured for 72 hours until the parental cell lines reached 80-95% confluencey, before cell lysates were prepared and subject to cleaved caspase 3 assays. (B) Cell proliferation measurements were normalized to the readings in parental cells at day 1. (C) Nude mice were implanted subcutaneously with MDA-MB-231 parental cells, and MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing miR-221-ZIP or scramble-ZIP. Tumor measurements were recorded and tumor growth inhibition was calculated as described in Materials and Methods. T-test was performed in (A) and (B) and one way ANOVA was performed in (C) to compare the differences between parental cells versus miR-221-ZIP cells. *denotes p-value #0.05. ***denotes p-value #0.005. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062170.g003  miR-221 Promotes Tumorigenesis in TNBCs  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62170    down regulated in MDA-MB-468 and the other non-TNBC lines  tested (Figure 1B). These results indicate that although miR-221/  miR-222 are both down-regulated in non-TNBC cells, miR-221 is  specifically over-expressed in the TNBC cell lines in comparison to  normal breast tissue. Therefore, over-expression of miR-221 may  be important in maintaining the characteristics of triple negative  breast cancer cells.  miR-221 Targets p27kip1 to Regulate Cell Cycle Progression in TNBCs p27  kip1 , an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase involved in the  regulation of the cell cycle, has previously been shown to be  a potential target of miR-221 in a variety of cancers [17,24,31,32].  Since highly activated cell proliferation is one of the major  characteristics of TNBCs, we investigated whether miR-221 also  targets p27 kip1  in this particular breast cancer subtype. If so, we  would expect an inverse relationship between the miR-221 and  p27 levels. We thus measured the expression level of p27 in  a variety of breast cancer cell lines as shown in Figure 2A. As  expected, p27 is expressed at much lower levels in TNBCs than in  other types of breast cancer cell lines. In fact, p27 expression level  was inversely correlated to miR-221 expression level in most the  breast cancer cell lines tested as shown in Figure 1A and Figure 2A.  Since miR-221 and miR-222 are highly homologous and contain  identical seed sequences, one might expect them to regulate the  same target genes and play similar biological functions in cancer  cells [17]. However, the relative expression level of miR-221 versus  normal breast tissue is higher in the comparison to miR-222, and  since miR-221, but not miR-222, was specifically over expressed in  the TNBCs tested, we focused our experiments on miR-221. Next,  we successfully and stably knocked down miR-221 using a miR-  ZIP lentiviral vector in various breast cancer cells, as shown in  Figure 2B. Briefly, miRZip are short, single-stranded anti-miRNAs  in a lentivirus backbone that can be stably expressed to specifically  target miRNAs of interest and alter translation. Knockdown of  Figure 4. Down regulation of miR-221 increases E-cadherin levels and decreases the expression levels of Snail and Slug.

(B) E-cadherin and vimentin expression levels were measured in MDA-MB-231, BT-20, MDA-MB-468 parental cells, as well cells harboring miR-221-ZIP, or scramble-ZIP. Data are normalized to the expression level in parental cells. Western blot analysis was also performed to examine the protein levels of E-cadherin and vimentin. (C) Snail and Slug expression levels were also examined in MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 cells. Data were normalized to the expression level in parental cells and fold changes were plotted. ***denotes p,0.005. **denotes p,0.01. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062170.g004  Figure 5.

Since p27 kip1  is involved in cell cycle regulation by  modulating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity [33], we also  investigated the effects of miR-221 inhibition on cell cycle  progression in TNBC cell lines. miR-221 knockdown induced  a G1 arrest as evidenced by observing a higher number of cells in  G1 phase compared to S phase (as shown in Figure 2E).  Furthermore, cell cycle profile analysis demonstrated that miR-  221 knockdown in MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468  cells exhibited higher sub-G1 cell population, again suggesting that  miR-221 knockdown restored p27 kip1  levels and subsequently  induced apoptosis probably by blocking the aggressive cell cycle  progression in these TNBC cell lines.  Down Regulation of miR-221 in TNBCs Inhibits Cell Proliferation and Tumor Growth in Mice Since cell cycle analysis demonstrated that miR-221 knockdown  was able to block cell cycle progression and induce higher sub-G1  cell population, we next investigated whether miR-221 knockdown  also induced apoptosis by direct measurement of apoptosis  markers: cleaved caspase 3 and BAD phosphorylation (pBAD).  As shown in Figure 3A, down regulation of miR-221 induced  significantly higher levels of cleaved caspase 3 in MDA-MB-231  and BT-20 cells, and slightly higher levels of cleaved caspase 3 in  MDA-MB-468 cells. Knocking down miR-221, however, did  decrease phosphorylation of Bcl-2-associated death promoter  (BAD), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 gene family whose  activity is regulated by survival kinases such as AKT, in all three  TNBC cell lines (Figure 3A). We next investigated the cell  proliferation rates of TNBCs with miR-221 knockdown. Down-  regulation of miR-221 in all three TNBC lines (MDA-MB-231,  BT-20, MDA-MB-468) decreased cell proliferation rates  (Figure 3B), likely due to the cell cycle block and increased  apoptosis induced by miR-221 knockdown. Although we did not  observe a significant increase of cleaved caspase 3 in MDA-MB-  468 cells, miR-221 knockdown indeed was able to decrease pBAD  (Figure 3A) and induced G1 arrests (Figure 2E) and subsequently  resulted in cell proliferation inhibition probably through mito-  chondrial apoptosis regulated by BCL2 family [34,35].  To expand on our in vitro results, we also investigated whether  miR-221 is required for in vivo tumor growth. miR-221 stably  knocked down MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted in nude mice  and tumor growth was measured and plotted to compare with the  tumor growth of MDA-MB-231 parental cell line and cells  infected with the control ZIP vector alone as shown in Figure 3C.  Our results indicated that miR-221 knockdown also inhibited  in vivo tumor growth in TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Therefore,  both the in vitro assays and in vivo studies confirm that miR-221  functions similar to an oncogene and is essential in mediating cell  proliferation and tumor progression in TNBC.  miR-221 Modulates Cell Migration and Invasion by Regulating Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition Relative to luminal subtypes, TNBCs, having undergone an  epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), express higher levels  of vimentin and low levels of E-cadherin which allow for their  characteristic high migration and invasion capabilities through the  basement membrane to promote metastasis [36]. Since miR-221  knockdown can inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice  (Figure 3), we wanted to investigate the molecular mechanism for  the miR-221 mediated cell transformation activity in TNBC  human cell lines. Therefore, we next examined the levels of EMT  markers and performed cell migration and invasion assays. The  levels of E-cadherin and vimentin in a variety of breast cancer cells  were quantified relative to the normal breast tissue as shown in  Figure 4A. As expected, E-cadherin is highly expressed in luminal  and HER2 positive cells but not in TNBC cell lines. Conversely,  vimentin is expressed in higher levels in TNBC cell lines compared  to non-TNBC cells. E-cadherin and vimentin levels were  measured at both the transcript and protein levels in parental,  vector control and miR-221 knocked down MDA-MB-231, BT-  20, and MDA-MB-468 cells. Results indicate that knocking down  miR-221 in these TNBCs significantly increased both the mRNA  and protein levels of E-cadherin as shown in Figure 4B. In-  terestingly, vimentin levels were not altered by knocking down  miR-221 in these cell lines. These data suggest that although  suppression of E-cadherin is regulated by miR-221, the vimentin  level in TNBCs is probably regulated by other mechanisms. Since  E-cadherin lacks a miR221 binding site and is likely not a direct  target, we next investigated if this regulation is mediated by any of  the transcription factors that have previously been reported to  directly regulate E-cadherin expression [37]. Figure 4C outlines  the effects of miR-221 knockdown on some of the EMT  transcription factors known to regulate E-cadherin levels. We  observed a robust decrease in the expression levels of mesenchy-  mal markers Snail and Slug by miR-221 knockdown in MDA-MB-  231, BT20 and MDA-MB-468 (Figure 4C). As previously reported  however, the expression level of Slug in MDA-MB-468 was much  lower than the other two TNBC cell lines tested [38].  We next investigated the effects of miR-221 knock down on cell  migration and invasion of TNBC cell lines. As expected, MDA-  MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 showed high migratory and  invasive properties in the migration and invasion assays performed  upon stimulation with 10% FBS. Knocking down miR-221  decreased the FBS stimulated migration and invasion in all three  cell lines as shown in Figure 5A and Figure 5B. Our data thus  indicate that miR-221 alters the migration and invasion properties  of TNBCs by suppressing E-cadherin expression. miR-221  knockdown in TNBCs restored E-cadherin expression and the  increased E-cadherin in these TNBC cells was sufficient to block  the activity of cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, although  vimentin levels did not change with miR-221 knock down and  high vimentin levels were maintained in these transduced TNBCs,  it was not sufficient to maintain their migration and invasion  capabilities. Therefore, these results suggest that the modulation of  E-cadherin by miR-221 plays a critical role in maintaining the  triple negative cell phenotype and knockdown of miR-221 can  lead to increased E-cadherin and subsequently inhibit cell  migration and invasion independent of vimentin levels.  Discussion  miR-221 has been reported to be dysregulated in a variety of  tumor types and has previously been shown to be involved in  suppression of ERa expression in luminal breast cancer cells and EMT transition in basal-like breast cancers [23-26,29,30,39].  Here we demonstrate that miR-221 is specifically over expressed  in TNBCs and that miR-221 knockdown induces G1 arrest and  apoptosis, inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth (probably  by altering expression levels of p27 kip1  ), and suppresses the  migratory phenotypes of TNBCs by restoring E-cadherin levels.  These results suggest that miR-221 is essential in regulating the  aggressive characteristics of triple negative or basal like of breast  cancer cells, including cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis, high  miR-221 Promotes Tumorigenesis in TNBCs  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62170    migratory and invasive abilities, as well as accelerated in-vivo tumor  growth. Therefore, our results provide direct evidence that  overexpression of miR-221 leads to in vitro and in vivo tumorigen-  esis in TNBCs.  Therefore, miR-221 regulates two key mechanisms to promote  the aggressive tumorogenic characteristics observed for TNBC: it  promotes cell cycle progression by inhibiting p27 kip1  and it  promotes EMT transition by inhibiting the expression of E-  cadherin. Both of these mechanisms may account for the  aggressive cellular proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, as well  as higher cell migration and invasion characteristics associated  with BLBCs and TNBCs [9-11]. Although, we could not rule out  alternative targets of miR-221 that may explain the cellular  phenotypes observed, knockdown of miR-221 alone is sufficient to  induce in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities in the TNBC cell  lines tested. Hence, the translational suppression of miR-221  targets is crucial in maintaining the aggressive tumor progression  of TNBCs. Previously, miR-221 over expression has been shown  to alter E-cadherin/vimentin levels in an EMT-induced MCF-7  cell line, which normally does not express endogenous miR-221  [39]. Additionally, EMT transcription factor Slug has previously  been shown to decrease both miR-221 and E-cadherin/vimentin  levels in MDA-MB-231 cells [30]. In this study, although we did  observe changes in Slug and Snail, we did not detect changes in  vimentin expression after stable miR-221 knockdown in MDA-  MB-231, BT20, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Although vimentin  levels were not altered, E-cadherin expression changed signifi-  cantly with miR-221 knockdown. Our data suggest that increasing  E-cadherin while maintaining vimentin levels in TNBCs seems to  be sufficient for inhibiting cell migration and invasion. Therefore,  E-cadherin seems to be critical in regulating cell motility, at least in  the TNBC cell lines, MDA-MD-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468.  Although miR-221 was able to regulate E-cadherin expression, we  were unable to identify the complementary sequence in the  39UTR of this protein. Therefore E-cadherin may not be a direct  target of miR-221, and its expression is likely affected by alteration  in EMT transcription factors Snail and Slug.  In conclusion, we have demonstrated that miR-221 is a potential  oncomiR and functions as an oncogene to mediate tumor  progression of TNBCs via targeting p27 kip1  and inhibiting E-  cadherin levels to mediate EMT transition. These results may  prove useful for therapeutic options for TNBCs when systemic  delivery of anti-miR-221 becomes feasible.
