  RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access  A novel function for p21Cip1 and acetyltransferase p/CAF as critical transcriptional regulators of TGFb- mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion Meiou Dai1, Amal A Al-Odaini1, Ani Arakelian2, Shafaat A Rabbani2, Suhad Ali1 and Jean-Jacques Lebrun1*  Abstract  Introduction: Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis, the primary cause of breast cancer morbidity and death. Here we investigated the role of p21Cip1 (p21), a member of the core cell cycle machinery, in transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb)-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion.  Methods: A mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess the mammary tumor growth and local invasion. The triple negative human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and its sub-progenies SCP2 and SCP25, SUM159PT, SUM149PT, SUM229PE and SUM1315MO2 were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFb and the protein expression levels were measured by Western blot. Cell migration and invasion were examined using the scratch/wound healing and Transwell assay. TGFb transcriptional activity was measured by a TGFb/Smad reporter construct (CAGA12-luc) using luciferase assay. q-PCR was used for assessing TGFb downstream target genes. The interactions among p21, p/CAF and Smad3 were performed by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, Smad3 on DNA binding ability was measured by DNA immunoprecipitation using biotinylated Smad binding element DNA probes. Finally, the association among active TGFb/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive.  Results: We found p21 expression to correlate with poor overall and distant metastasis free survival in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, using xenograft animal models and in vitro studies, we found p21 to be essential for tumor cell invasion. The invasive effects of p21 were found to correlate with Smad3, and p/CAF interaction downstream of TGFb. p21 and p/CAF regulates TGFb-mediated transcription of pro-metastatic genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity. In addition, we found that active TGFb/Smad signaling correlates with high p21 and p/CAF expression levels and lymph node involvement using tissue microarrays from breast cancer patients.  Conclusions: Together these results highlight an important role for p21 and p/CAF in promoting breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level and may open new avenues for breast cancer therapy.  Introduction p21 was originally identified as a cell cycle regulator through inhibition of different cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase complexes [1]. p21 is a member of the Cip/Kip family of cell cycle inhibitors, which also includes p27Kip1 and p57Kip2 [2-4]. In addition to its role in cell cycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular  senescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytos- keleton [5-7]. The role of p21 in breast cancer develop- ment and progression has not been fully investigated. While p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a down- stream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does not fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor. Germline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not common in human cancers [8]. Furthermore, in vivo stu- dies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of p21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells to undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these  * Correspondence: jj.lebrun@mcgill.ca 1Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Center, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada Full list of author information is available at the end of the article  Dai et al.

Intriguingly, p21 is often overexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcino- mas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix [10-13]. Together these observations suggest that the role played by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially thought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle regulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in promoting carcinogenesis. Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in  the metastatic process and are regulated by numerous tumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microen- vironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracel- lular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell migration and invasion [14]. Among these tumor-secreted factors, TGFb has been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting tumor metastasis [15]. The TGFb family regu- lates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination during embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on reproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth, bone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout adult life [16]. The effects of TGFb in breast cancer are complex. TGFb is thought to play a dual role in breast cancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in nor- mal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in aggressive carcinoma [17]. The growth inhibitory effects of TGFb are known to be mediated through transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene [18] and induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1 arrest [19,20]. During tumor progression, however, the loss of TGFb growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to defects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGFb [18]. Mean- while, other TGFb responses prevail, unrelated to growth inhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis [21-25]. Indeed, TGFb induces degradation of the ECM, inhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and invasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis [21-23,25]. Moreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete increasing quantities of TGFb, which in turn alter the stroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor angiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosup- pression, thus further contributing to tumor progression and metastasis [21-23,25]. Together these studies highlight an important role for TGFb in advanced breast cancer. However, the function for p21 downstream of TGFb has not been described in breast cancer. In this study, we found that high p21 expression corre-  lates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The expression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell migration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo. Furthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by TGFb/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like tri- ple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to physically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyl- transferase p/CAF in response to TGFb and identified  p21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also showed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGFb transcrip- tional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes by controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients revealed a significant correlation between active TGFb/ Smad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21 and p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carci- nomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF as critical regulators of cell migration and invasion down- stream of TGFb/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast cancer.

SUM149PT, SUM159PT and SUM229PE (provided by Dr. Stephen P Ethier) were grown in F-12 HAM'S nutrient mixture (HyClone Laboratories, Inc. Logan, Utah, USA) supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 \u03bcg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. SUM1315MO2 were grown in F-12 HAM'S nutrient mixture (HyClone) supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 \u03bcg/ml insulin (Sigma), 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) (Sigma) at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with different p21, p/CAF, Smad2  and Smad3 siRNAs (Sigma), 6\u00d7 myc- Smad2, myc-Smad3, p/CAF (Addgene plasmid 8941) [26] and Flag-tagged human p21 cDNAs (Addgene plasmid 16240) [27] using Lipofectamine\u2122 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA ), according to the manufacturer's protocol. MDA and SCPs cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimu- lated or not with 5 ng/ml TGFb1 (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) in DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-gluta- mine. For stable cell line generation, SCP2 cells were transfected with p21 shRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and pools of stable cells were selected with 10 ng/ml puromycin (Invitrogen). SUM159PT cells were serum-starved for 24 hrs in the absence of insulin and hydrocortisone before TGFb1 stimulation.  Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation Cells were lysed in cold extraction buffer (10 mM Tris- HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100) containing protease inhi- bitors (1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 \u03bcg/ml leu- peptin hydrochloride, 10 \u03bcg/ml aprotinin and 10 \u03bcg/ml  Dai et al.

Protein content was measured using BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA). Equal protein was analyzed by Western blot using mouse anti-p21 (F5), mouse anti-c-myc, mouse anti- p15, rabbit anti-Smad2/3 (1:1,000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-cofilin and cofilin antibodies (1:1,000 dilution, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and fol- lowed by secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse or rabbit. Immunoprecipitations were performed overnight at 4\u00b0C using antibodies against p300/CBP (Santa Cruz Biotech- nology), p/CAF (Abcam\u00ae, Cambridge, MA, USA) and p21. Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, Piscat- away, NJ, USA) was added for 1 hr at 4\u00b0C, and washed four times with cold lysis buffer. The immunocomplexes were boiled with 2\u00d7 sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) Laemmli sample buffer for five minutes and subjected to immunoblotting.  Histone proteins extraction Total histone proteins were extracted as previously described [28]. Briefly, 80% confluent of SCP2 cells from a 100-mm tissue culture plate were serum-starved for 24 hrs and stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGFb or 1 \u03bcM trichostatin A (TSA). SCP2 cells were harvested and resuspended in cold hypotonic lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitors, 1 \u03bcM TSA and 10 mM sodium butyrate. Cell lysates were rotated at 4\u00b0C for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 10,000 g, 4\u00b0C, for 10 minutes. The supernatants were discarded and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 400 \u03bcl of 0.4 N H2SO4 and incubated overnight on a rotator at 4\u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and supernatants containing histones were transferred into a fresh tube. A total of 132 \u03bcl trichloroacetic acid was added drop by drop to the histone solution, inverted several times and then incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The histone precipitates were centrifuged at 16,000 g for 10 minutes and pellets were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and the histone pellets were air dried for 20 minutes. Total histone pro- teins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an acetylated lysine antibody (Millipore).  DNA affinity precipitation assay SCP2 cells transiently transfected with the indicated siR- NAs were stimulated with TGFb for 30 minutes. Cell lysate were extracted in cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate and protease inhibitors as described above. A total of 5 \u03bcg Poly (dI-dC) competitor (Sigma) was incubated with 1 mg of total cell lysate for  30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. A total of 500 pmol of double- stranded oligonucleotides (IDT) was added and incu- bated with cell lysates for two hours at 4\u00b0C. Streptavi- din-agarose beads (65 \u03bcl; Sigma) were added, incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and then washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The streptavidin-agarose beads containing biotinylated oligonucleotides and protein complex were boiled with 2\u00d7 SDS Laemmli sample buffer for five min- utes and subjected to immunoblotting. The sequences of biotin labeled double-strand oligonucleotides (IDT) were previously described [29].

Luciferase assays SCP2 cells were transiently co-transfected with 50 nM Scr siRNA, 50 nM p21 siRNA or 0.5 \u03bcg flag-tagged p21 cDNA in combination with 0.3 \u03bcg SBE reporter construct (CAGA12-luc) and 0.1 \u03bcg pCMV-b-gal. Transfected cells were then stimulated with or without 5 ng/ml TGFb for 16 hrs. Luciferase activity of CAGA12-luc was measured (EG & G Berthold luminometer, Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) and nor- malized to b-galactosidase activity.  Real-Time PCR Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagents (Invitro- gen). Reverse transcription of total RNA using random primers was carried out using M-MLV reverse transcrip- tase (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCRs were carried out using SsoFast\u2122Eva- Green\u00ae Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a Rotor Gene 6000 PCR detection system (MBI Lab Equip- ment, Montreal Biotech Inc. Kirkland, PQ, Canada). PCR conditions were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 40 cycles (95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s).

Thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay A total of 100 \u03bcl of cell suspension (1\u00d7 105 cells/ml in DMEM supplemented with 1% FBS) was stimulated or not in the presence or absence of 5 ng/ml TGFb and cultured in 96-well plates for two days. After two days, 25 \u03bcl 5 mg/ml MTT solution (Sigma) was added to each well and incubated for two hours. A total of 200 \u03bcl of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to each well and mixed well. The absorbance at 570 nm was mea- sured on a plate reader.  Cell cycle analysis SCP2 cells were stimulated with TGFb for 0, 2, 6 and 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol over- night, treated with 20 \u03bcg/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained with 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotech- nology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan flow cytometry analyzer.  Kinetic cell migration assay Cells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in Essen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of ImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of the wound are automatically taken at the exact same loca- tion by the IncuCyte\u2122software (Essen Bioscience). Cells were then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell layers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to generate approximately 800 \u03bcm width wounds. After wounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and sti- mulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of TGFb. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into IncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for 24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence or relative wound density automatically measured by the IncuCyte software.  Matrigel invasion assay For the Transwell assays, 30 \u03bcl of growth factor reduced (GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled H2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell inva- sion plate (8-\u03bcm pore size; BD Biosciences) and incu- bated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2 or SUM159PT (6 \u00d7 104 cells/insert) were seeded on Transwell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the upper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml TGFb for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers con- tained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT  cells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM'S med- ium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper chamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded through GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formalde- hyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal violet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were photographed using an inverted 4\u00d7 or 10\u00d7 microscope and total cell numbers were counted and quantified by Image J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).  Immunofluorescence microscopy Cells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimu- lated or not with TGFb overnight. Cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and blocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated with anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor\u00ae568 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one hour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade\u00ae  Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal analysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axio- vert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany) using 63\u00d7 objective.  Immunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysis Tissue sections (5 \u03bcm) from breast carcinoma microarray slides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized and rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1 (Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes. The primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry staining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam), phospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB Plus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detec- tion of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were then counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Labora- tories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and mounted for microscopic examination. All images were scanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA, USA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a patholo- gist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was scored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25% tumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells stained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moder- ately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly. Correlations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21  were examined by the Pearson correlation test using SPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations between these protein expressions and lymph node status were assessed by Fisher's exact test. P-value (two-sided) <0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Dai et al.

The animal study was approved by the ethics committee and all the experimental animal protocols were in accordance with the McGill University Animal Care. Following the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and aceproma- zine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, par- ental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5\u00d7 105 cells per mouse in 100 \u03bcl of saline (20% Matrigel) with a 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size was measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume was determined according to the formula: tumor volume = shorter diameter2 \u00d7 longer diameter/2. Sets of mice (eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injec- tion to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the end of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding fat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered for- malin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were embedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International, Radnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 \u03bcm thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the tumors were photographed by light microscope using 10\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 objectives. For intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2  cells (2.0\u00d7 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left tibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were monitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography of the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the development of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight weeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system (Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8, radiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the osteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described [30]. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no lesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant lesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone surface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break in peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).  Statistical analyses Student's t-test was used and differences between groups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.  Results p21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients Previous studies have suggested that higher expression of cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in breast carcinomas [31-33]. To further explore the corre- lation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome  in breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently pub- lished gene profiling database of breast cancer patients to assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes [34]. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the median, upper and lower quartile expression levels of p21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and DMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left panels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated with poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7; 1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to 3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17; 0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels showed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P = 0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20 years follow-up, patients who are free of distant metas- tasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a better survival rate. Although the prediction did not show statistically significant results in the median expression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR, 1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical signifi- cance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the relationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in both estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER- ) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in patients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status (Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot rule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in the stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these data demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates with poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated p21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor progression.  Silencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo and cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro To investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation and progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-meta- static cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple negative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to as MDA) cells [35]. We first assessed the effect of suppres- sing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xeno- graft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably transfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells. Knockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21 protein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells (Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of female Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor growth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in the rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size between animals injected with parental or p21-deficient cells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in tumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21  Dai et al.

Intact tumors were taken with the overlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed by a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by determining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the surrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tis- sue), as previously described [36]. As shown in Figure 2C (left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group dis- played no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and were deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast, tumors derived from animals transplanted with p21- depleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor mass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure 2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an important role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed in vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited both cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E, respectively). As shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the  animals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells (eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat pad developed any bone lesions after two months, the date at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor size. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor cells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse [37]. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the later stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its involvement in the development of bone osteolytic lesions using an intratibia injection model of parental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice. By by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experi- mental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell metastasis and survival in the bone marrow [38]. As shown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following X-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice developed secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic bone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later stages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indi- cate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to acquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to the earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction of local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding tissues.  TGFb induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive human breast cancer cells p21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling pathways [7]. Among these and of particular interest is the TGFb/Smad signaling pathway [15,25,39]. Therefore, we examined the effect of TGFb on the expression levels of p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast cancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarci- noma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25) [40], an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter  referred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with ana- plastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carci- noma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived SUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from metastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal car- cinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315) [41]. As shown in Figure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGFb strongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these cell lines. Interestingly, TGFb showed no regulatory effect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regula- tory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent with a loss of the TGFb growth inhibitory responses in these cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhi- bitor, the TGFb-induced increases in p21 protein levels did not translate into growth inhibition by TGFb (Addi- tional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in these breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investi- gated the mechanisms by which TGFb regulates p21 pro- tein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGFb type I receptor (TbRI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGFb- induced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGFb regulation of p21 expression is mediated through the TGFb receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found this effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as TGFb induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to induce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of Smad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these data indicate that TGFb potently induces p21 expression in a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell growth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal- type breast cancer cells.  p21 expression is required for TGFb-mediated cell migration TGFb is an important modulator of cell motility in breast cancer [25,42]. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could act downstream of TGFb to promote cell migration. We first examined the effect of TGFb on cell migration dynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled to quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte\u2122). Cell migration was measured by three integrated metrics: wound width, wound confluence and relative wound den- sity, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A, B, TGFb potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2 and SUM149. As a negative control, we also used SUM1315 in which TGFb did not regulate p21 expression. As expected, there was no effect of TGFb on cell migra- tion in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B). To then investigate whether p21 is required for TGFb-  induced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression using two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the effect of TGFb on cell migration dynamics by the scratch/wound healing assay. As shown in Figure 4C,  Dai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R127 http://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/R127  Page 8 of 22    TGFb induced p21 expression in both mock and scrambled (Scr) siRNA transfected cells, while this effect was blocked in cells transfected with either p21 siRNAs, confirming the specificity and efficacy of our p21 siRNAs. Importantly, we found that while TGFb potently induced cell migration in mock and Scr siRNA transfected SCP2  cells, this effect was completely blocked in cells in which p21 expression was depleted (Figure 4D, E). The effect of p21 siRNAs on TGFb-induced cell migration was similar to that observed when cells were transfected with a siRNA against Smad3, used here as a positive control (Figure 4D, E).

These results demonstrate that TGFb-mediated migration of human breast cancer cells is dependent on TGFb-induced p21 expression.  p21 expression is required for TGFb-mediated cell invasion To examine the role of p21 in TGFb-induced tumor cell invasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr siRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive potential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel Transwell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and Scr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGFb signifi- cantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and this effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on TGFb-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect of the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the p21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells in which endogenous p21 expression was silenced were transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA (Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21 overrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level (Figure 5C) as well as TGFb-induced cell invasion through the GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect is specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limita- tion of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the pro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing or blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not alter their growth in response to TGFb (Additional file 6, Figure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found SUM159 to be highly responsive to TGFb-induced cell invasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the TGFb pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpres- sion of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was observed in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that TGFb-mediated migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells are dependent on TGFb-induced p21 expres- sion. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGFb signaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum and EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure S6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory role in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the strong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell invasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).  p21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGFb-induced transcriptional activity and downstream genes involved in cell invasion It has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regu- lates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting ROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-  depolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migra- tion in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells [43,44]. Therefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total protein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells in response to TGFb. As shown in Figure S7A (Addi- tional file 8), TGFb has no effect on the phosphorylation of cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate cofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under the stimulation of TGFb. Treatment with TGFb caused accumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent manner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGFb-induced and p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human breast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/ LIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell cycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact with multiple transcription factors [7] to selectively inhi- bit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in dis- tinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair, survival and ECM components [45]. Thus, we investi- gated whether p21 could interact with the Smad pro- teins to regulate the TGFb pro-invasive effects. Smad/ p21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipita- tion studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in Figure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced association between Smad2 and p21, we found TGFb to clearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and p21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the p21/Smad3 interaction on TGFb signaling, we then examined the effect of p21 on TGFb-induced Smad3 activity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking down p21 did not affect TGFb-induced Smad3 phos- phorylation. However, using a TGFb/Smad transcrip- tional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that p21 is required for TGFb-induced Smad transcriptional activity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silen- cing abolished TGFb-induced luciferase activity of the Smad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc activity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overex- pressing p21 in response to TGFb. These results indi- cate that TGFb induces a complex formation between p21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the earlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphoryla- tion), it is required for TGFb-mediated Smad transcrip- tional activity. We next performed gene profiling experiments in par- ental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently transfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21 shRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum of two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple p21-dependent TGFb target genes, among which were selected those known to be associated with the tumor metastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate target genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8),  Dai et al.

To confirm that these genes were TGFb downstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were sti- mulated or not with TGFb and mRNA levels for these target genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGFb signifi- cantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2, PLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both cell lines. To then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional  regulation of these genes by TGFb, we examined the effects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing p21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A, knocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGFb transcriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGFb to induce expression of these target genes. The same results were obtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not shown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these cell lines potentiated the TGFb transcriptional effects on these target genes. As a negative control and to ensure specificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of silencing p21 on the TGFb-mediated increase in trans- forming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA. TGFb regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21 (Figure 7B). To address the contribution of these identified p21-  dependent TGFb target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their gene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in Figure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired TGFb-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While depletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antago- nized the TGFb response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8 showed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examina- tion of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated that IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggest- ing that they may be specifically required for the TGFb pro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of MMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion suggesting that these target genes have a broader effect on cell invasion, not limited to the TGFb signaling path- way. Together, these results indicate that even though all five genes are important for TGFb signaling leading to cell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predomi- nant roles.  p21/p/CAF regulates TGFb transcriptional activity and Smad3 DNA binding p21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcrip- tion by associating with various transcription factors [7], but also regulates estrogen receptor-a-dependent gene expression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP)  [47,48]. Gene transcription downstream of TGFb signal- ing is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/ CBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member of another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N- acetyl transferases [49-52]. Thus, we examined whether p21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in response to TGFb. Interestingly, we found that while TGFb did not induce association between p21 and p300/ CBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21 and p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer cells (Figure 8A, left and right panels). A previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds  to Smad3 [50]. As we have shown that TGFb induces complex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A), we investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also required for Smad3 association with p21. For this, HEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc- Smad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to block expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in Figure 8B, TGFb induced complex formation between p21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly, depletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interac- tion, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for Smad3 interaction with p21. To investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regu-  lation of p21-dependent TGFb downstream target genes, SUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged p21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF siRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K (lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to verify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR (Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction of IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGFb. However, these effects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene expression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required for p21-dependent gene expression of the TGFb targets (Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of TGFb was further investigated using the Transwell Matri- gel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF gene expression significantly impaired TGFb-induced cell invasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western blotting (Figure 8F). Because acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene tran-  scription by acetylating histones and transcription factors [49], we then assessed whether TGFb could induce global changes in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For this, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells, treated or not with TGFb and subjected to immunoblot- ting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Fig- ure S8 (Additional file 9), TGFb had no effect on global histone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhi- bitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels. This suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF recruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more  Dai et al.

To address this, we examined whether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads. Interestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interact- ing with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acety- lation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the acetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not show any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not shown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be required for its DNA binding activity [51]. Thus, this led us to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with DNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA IP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad bind- ing element (4\u00d7 CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the Figure 8H, we found TGFb to specifically induce binding of both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we found that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siR- NAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I), suggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we then assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on Smad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc reporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results clearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGFb-induced Smad3 transcriptional activity. Collectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF reg-  ulate TGFb transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3 occupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGFb induces a complex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF, further leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Further- more, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity, highlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/ Smad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGFb tar- get gene transcription.  High expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated with lymph node positivity Lymph node involvement is an important prognostic indicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes [53]. High expression of TGFb1 is correlated with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis [54]. To examine the associa- tion among active TGFb/Smad signaling, p21 and p/ CAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immu- nohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of serine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21 and p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node posi- tive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF protein expression in tumor cells was graded and described in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2 as a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of  3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As shown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients showed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expres- sions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3 (68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in patients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P = 0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish between tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic cells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Addi- tional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher level in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We also examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels and p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels, using the Pearson's correlation test. As shown in Figure 9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phos- phorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly correlate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively, these data indicate that active TGFb/Smad3 signaling is associated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression levels and significantly correlates with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.  Discussion While p21 was initially characterized as an important cell cycle inhibitor, recent studies suggest that cytoplasmic p21 has anti-apoptotic and actin cytoskeleton regulatory functions [27,43,55]. The accumulation of cytoplasmic p21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated tumorigenic transformation [32,44]. Moreover, overex- pression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of many types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in breast cancer has not been established. In our study, we assessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast can- cer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor overall survival and distant metastasis free survival. Furthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad transplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells in mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expres- sion did not affect the primary tumor formation, it potently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into surrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evi- dence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary tumor local invasion. Previous studies have indicated that during breast can-  cer progression, TGFb cytostatic responses are lost while pro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained [56]. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell lines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGFb and that while TGFb did not induce any change in p15 or c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21 expression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21 functions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is in contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized  Dai et al.

Indeed, we found that the induction of p21 in invasive breast cancer cells is required for the pro-migratory and pro-  invasive effects of TGFb. In accordance with these results, depletion of p21 did not modulate primary tumor growth in vivo but strongly blocked tumor invasion capa- city.

We further report that the TGFb-mediated increase  in p21 expression is Smad-dependent and Smad3 spe- cific. This is interesting in light of previous reports indicating that overexpression of a dominant negative form of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to metastasize [57] and that Smad3, but not Smad2, pro- motes breast cancer metastasis in mice [58]. Further- more, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been described, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet been reported. Together these data suggest that in breast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are mediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove useful to improve the clinical course of metastatic patients. Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation  steps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has been suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/ LIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; how- ever, we found that TGFb had no effect on regulating cofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we identified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regu- lation of TGFb/Smad3 signaling through the interaction of p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The interaction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-depen- dent, but whether this interaction is direct will require further investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on cell migration and invasion are mediated through inter- actions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate Smad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of several TGFb pro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interest- ing to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the pro-oncogenic activity of TGFb or whether it is also required for the transcriptional regulation of other types of TGFb responses and target genes. Taken together, our results demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcrip- tional target of TGFb and a co-stimulatory factor of Smad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast can- cer cells (Figure 10). Finally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGFb-  mediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The prognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clini- cal and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node metastasis is one of the most important prognostic para- meters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a sharp difference in survival rate between patients with positive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we found a significant association of active TGFb/Smad3 sig- naling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node posi- tivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers for lymph node metastasis.  Conclusion In this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the cell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High expression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall and distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream regulator of TGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and the acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad transcriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of sev- eral TGFb-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results highlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGFb- induced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the transcriptional level.
