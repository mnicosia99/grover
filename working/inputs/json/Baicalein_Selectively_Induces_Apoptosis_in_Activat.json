    "summary": "Insufficient apoptosis in activated lymphocytes contributes to the development of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Baicalein (BE), a flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, possesses anti-inflammatory properties. However, whether BE can selectively induce apoptosis in activated lymphocytes and exert therapeutic effect on AIH has not been studied.                    The pro-apoptotic properties of BE were evaluated in vitro on different types of immune cells, and in vivo effects of BE were examined in a murine model of Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. In vitro treatment with BE resulted in a higher increase in the level of apoptosis in Con A-stimulated murine splenocytes, Con A-stimulated CD3(+) splenocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated CD19(+) splenocytes, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin-stimulated Jurkat T cells, compared with that in unstimulated na\u00efve ones. Murine bone marrow-derived dentritic cells, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells, either stimulated with LPS or unstimulated, were all insensitive to the BE-induced apoptosis. BE treatment also led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of cytochrome c release from mitochondria to the cytosol, a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and activation of caspase-9,-3 in Con A-stimulated CD3(+) splenocytes and LPS-stimulated CD19(+) splenocytes, while showing no impact on Fas/FasL expressions and caspase-8 activation. In vivo administration of BE alleviated Con A-induced liver injury, suppressed serum level of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3, and reduced liver infiltration of mononuclear cells (MNCs). Furthermore, BE treatment increased the incidences of apoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3(+) and CD19(+) splenocytes. When liver MNCs and splenocytes from BE-treated mice were cultured in vitro for 24 h, they exhibited marked increase in apoptosis compared to vehicle-treated control.                    The present study demonstrates the ability of BE to promote apoptosis in activated lymphocytes through mitochondrial pathway and its potential use in the treatment of AIH.",

Introduction  Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disease characterized by  progressive liver inflammation of unknown etiology that may  advance to fibrosis and cirrhosis [1]. The pathogenic mechanisms  of AIH still remain unclear. The liver inflammation in AIH  encompasses both cell-mediated cytotoxicity by infiltrating lym-  phocytes and the production of autoantibodies. Therefore,  abnormality in immune regulation is thought to be implicated in  the pathogenesis of this disease [2]. Currently, the only viable  treatments of AIH are immunosuppressant application and liver  transplantation. But long term applications of currently available  immunosuppressive drugs carries serious risks [3]. Therefore, it is  significantly important to develop new specific drugs.  Deletion of activated and autoreactive lymphocytes by apoptosis  is a critical mechanism by which the immune system maintains  homeostasis [4,5]. There is increasing evidence that abnormalities  in this process might contribute to the development of AIH. It has  been reported that the activated lymphocytes in patients with AIH  fail to down-regulate the expression of the antiapoptotic protein,  bcl-2, which may protect them from apoptosis and thereby extend  the disease process [6]. Fas/Fas-ligand system is known to plays a  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592    key role in the control of activation-induced apoptosis of  lymphocytes [7]. Four polymorphisms of human Fas gene have  been associated with the occurrence of AIH in Japan [8], and one  polymorphism in the Fas gene promoter at position 2670 has  been associated with the early development of cirrhosis in white  North American and Northern European patients with AIH [9].  These data suggests that genetic factors that affect the integrity of  the apoptotic pathway can influence the progression of AIH  possibly by perpetuating the survival of activated lymphocytes.  Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis is considered to be an  experimental murine model of AIH [10,11]. A previous study  demonstrated that CD44-knockout mice exhibited enhanced  pathogenesis in Con A-induced hepatitis, primarily due to inability  of Con A-activated CD44-deficient T cells to undergo apoptosis  [11]. A more recent study demonstrated that Galectin-3 deficiency  prevents Con A-induced hepatitis partly due to enhanced  apoptosis in both liver-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs) and  splenocytes [12]. These evidence further support the notion that  dysregulation of apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is involved in  the pathogenesis of AIH.  Since insufficient apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is an  essential factor contributing to the development of AIH, specific  induction of apoptosis in activated lymphocyte should be  beneficial in depressing excess immune responses and inducing  long-lasting immunological tolerance, and thus represents a new  therapeutic strategy for AIH. Recently, a few compounds have  been reported to selectively induce or potentiate apoptosis in  activated T cells and inhibit the development of autoimmune  diseases in several animal models, including experimental allergic  encephalitis [13,14], adjuvant arthritis [13], and Con A-induced  hepatitis [15]. These studies further demonstrated the feasibility of  treatment of autoimmune diseases by agents that induce apoptosis  of activated T cells.  Natural compounds purified from herbal medicines that have  known indications for inflammatory disease conditions often have  a low toxicity profile [16,17]. Therefore, exploring new immuno-  suppressive agents that selectively induce apoptosis in activated  lymphocytes from herbal medicines is conducive to the develop-  ment of novel effective pharmaceuticals for AIH. Baicalein (BE) is  a flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis  Georgi, known as \u2018\u2018Huang qin'' in China [18]. This herb has been  widely used in treatment of various diseases such as hepatitis,  pneumonia, and diarrhea [19]. Previous studies have demonstrat-  ed that BE possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties [20-25].  However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated.  Of note, BE has been reported to induce apoptosis in several  cancer cell lines, including human pancreatic [26], breast [27],  prostate [28], and gastric [29] cancer cells. The pro-apoptotic  effects of BE on both lymphocytes cell line and human peripheral  blood mononuclear cells has also been shown previously [30,31].  However, whether it can selectively induce apoptosis in activated  lymphocytes has not been studied. In present study, we at first  conducted a series of in vitro experiments to investigate the pro-  apoptotic effect of BE on various immunocytes of different  activating status, and then used Con A-induced hepatitic mice as  an animal model to determine whether BE could induce  lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has therapeutic potential for  AIH. We demonstrated that BE selectively induced apoptosis in  activated lymphocytes and ameliorated Con A-induced hepatitis in  mice. Our findings indicate that BE may have a therapeutic value  in the treatment of AIH and provides a new cellular mechanism  for its therapeutic effect.  Methods  Ethics Statement All animal experiments were approved by the Administrative  Committee of Experimental Animal Care and Use of Second  Military Medical University (SMMU, Licence No. 2011023), and  conformed to the National Institute of Health guidelines on the  ethical use of animals.  Reagents BE (purity .99%) was purchased from National Institute for  the Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, China.  Con A, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate  (PMA), and ionomycine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,  MO, USA). PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (PE-mAbs)  recognizing CD3, CD19, Fas, or FasL and FITC-conjugated mAb  against active caspase-3 were purchased from BD PharMingen.  Mice C57BL/6 mice (6-week-old, female) were purchased from  Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., LTD (Shanghai, China).  All animals were acclimatized under controlled temperature  (2062uC), humidity (6065%) and 12 h light/12 h dark cycle for 1 week before the experiment.  Cell Preparation and Culture All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma)  supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37uC in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Splenocytes were prepared by passing  disrupted spleen collected from C57BL/6 mice through a 70-mm nylon cell strainer (BD Labware), and depleting red blood cells by  5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/  volume]). CD3 +  cells and CD19 +  cells were isolated from  splenocytes by magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS)-based  purification using Pan T Cell Isolation Kit and B Cell Isolation Kit  (Miltenyi Biotec), respectively, according to the manufacturer's  instructions, and the purity of obtain cells was more than 95% as  determined by flow cytometry. Bone marrow (BM) cells were  prepared by flushing the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, filtering  through a 70-mm nylon cell strainer, and depleting red blood cells by 5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/  volume]). Dendritic cells (DCs) were generated by culturing BM  cells with 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse granulocyte-macro-  phage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (both from R&D  Systems) for 6 days as previously described [32]. To stimulate DCs  maturation, LPS (500 ng/ml) was added to the culture on day 5.  Peritoneal macrophages were obtained by plating cells lavaged  from the mouse peritoneal cavity in 24-well flat-bottomed plates  and removing nonadherent cells after 3 hours of culture [33]. The  obtained macrophages were stimulated with LPS (500 ng/ml) for  additional 24 h to activated them. Jurkat T cells and Raw264.7  macrophage cells were stimulated for 24 h with PMA (25 ng/  mL)/ionomycin (1 mM) and LPS (500 ng/ml), respectively, to induce their activation.  Apoptosis Assay Cells were stained with FITC-labeled annexin V (annexin V-  FITC) and propidium iodide (PI) (BD PharMingen, San Diego,  California, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and  analyzed in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San  Jose, CA, USA). The percentages of apoptotic cells were  determined as the sum of annexin V-FITC single-positive and  annexin V-FITC/PI double-positive cells. In some experiments,  Caspase-3 activation was determined using the FITC Active  Baicalein Induces Apoptosis in Lymphocytes  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592    Caspase-3 Apoptosis kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA)  according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, the cells  were fixed and permeabilized by adding 100 ml Cytofix/cytoperm solution at 4uC for 20 min, and the cells were then washed with Perm/Wash solution. The cells were stained intracellularly with  FITC-conjugated anti-active caspase-3 antibody for 30 min at  room temperature and subsequently analyzed by FACS Calibur  Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).  Assay for Expression of Fas and FasL Expression of Fas and FasL on lymphocytes was examined by  flow cytometry after staining the cells with PE-conjugated mAb  recognizing Fas or FasL (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego,  CA, USA ) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Assay for Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) was deter-  mined by flow cytometry using J-aggregate forming lipophilic  cationic probe JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)  staining following the manufacturer's protocol.  Subcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting The preparation of whole cell lysates and mitochondrial and  cytosolic fractions were performed as detailed previously [34]. The  protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-  Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The proteins (20 mg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF  membrane (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). The membranes  were probed with anti-cytochrome c, anti-COX IV, anti-a- tubulin, Anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, and anti-b-actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 4uC. Blots were visualized using IRDye 800CW Goat Anti-Mouse Secondary  Antibody (LI-COR Biotechnology, NE, USA). Detection was  performed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR  Biotechnology, NE, USA).  Caspase-3,8,9 Colorimetric Assay The activation of caspase-3,8,9 in the cells was measured with  colorimetric assay kits (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's  protocol. The caspase activity was expressed as a fold increase of  test samples relative to non-treatment control.  Con A-induced Hepatitis Model Hepatic damage was induced by a single intravenous injection  of Con A (15 mg/kg) into C57BL/6 mice. BE was administered  intraperitoneally (i.p.) (100 mg/kg) immediately after Con A  injection. Control mice were given i.p. the same volume of solvent  instead of BE. Blood samples were collected from mice at 0, 8, and  24 h after Con A injection. Serum levels of alanine aminotransa-  minase (ALT) were measured using a colorimetric assay kit  (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).  Serum levels of IFN-c, TNF-a, and IL-4 were measured using ELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's instruc-  tions. For histological analysis, livers were collected at 24 h after  Con A injection. Liver samples were fixed in 10% formalin  solution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with  hematoxylin-eosin. To detect the in vivo apoptosis in lymphocytes,  the liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes were isolated 24 h  after Con A injection as described previously [35], and stained for  different markers of cell subsets (CD3 and CD19) or with FITC-  annexin/PI. The stained cells were counted using a BD FACS  Calibur flow cytometer. In some experiments, the liver MNCs and  splenocytes were harvested at 8 after Con A injection. The cells  obtained from each mouse were firstly cultured in 24-well flat-  bottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophage adherence, then the  nonadherent cells were collected and further cultured in vitro for 12  and 24 h, and the percentages of apoptosis at each time point were  determined by flow cytometry using FITC-annexin V/PI staining.  After 24 hours of in vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptotic  cells in total nonadherent cells derived from liver MNCs and  splenocytes, as well as in CD3 +  T cell and CD19 +  B cell subsets,  were measured by cell counting and flow cytometry using PE-anti-  CD3/FITC-annexin V staining and PE-anti-CD19/FITC-an-  nexin V staining, respectively.  Statistical Analysis Data are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. Statistical analysis was  performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test,  followed by Dunnett's multiple comparison post hoc test. P values  less than 0.05 were considered significant.  Results  BE Selectively Induces Apoptosis in Mitogen-activated Lymphocytes  The pro-apoptotic effect of BE was at first tested on splenocytes.  To determine whether BE may exert differential effects on  activated and na\u0131\u0308ve immune cells, freshly isolated murine  splenocytes were cultured with BE (5-20 mM) for 24 h in the presence or absence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and cell death was determined using Annexin V/PI staining. The result revealed an  increase in the number of apoptotic events in splenocyte cultures  upon BE treatment. Of note, the increase in the levels of apoptosis  in splenocyte cultures containing both Con A and BE were  markedly higher than that in the corresponding levels detected for  the same concentrations of BE when the cells were incubated with  BE alone (Fig. 1). This result indicated that BE is more effective in  inducing apoptosis in mitogen-activated splenocytes than in na\u0131\u0308ve  ones.  We next compared the abilities of BE to induced apoptosis in  different types of immune cells under different activating status. In  this experiment, CD3 +  cells and CD19 +  cells were purified from  murine splenocytes and were used as T and B lymphocytes,  respectively. DCs were derived from murine BM cells and  macrophages were obtained from murine peritoneal exudate cells.  Besides these primary immune cells, Jurkat T cell line and  RAW264.7 cell line were also included in this experiment. For  induction of cell activation, splenocytes and T lymphocytes were  stimulated with 5 mg/ml of Con A; B lymphocytes, BM-derived DCs, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were stimu-  lated with 500 ng/ml of LPS; Jurkat T cells were stimulated with  25 ng/mL of PMA plus 1 mM of ionomycin. All of these cells were cultured with 10 mM of BE for 24 h in the presence or absence of the respective activator and cell apoptosis was determined using  Annexin V/PI staining. Because the spontaneous apoptosis levels  were different among various types of cells, the pro-apoptotic  effects of BE were indicated as increase in the percentages of  apoptosis in each type of cells upon BE exposure. As shown in  Fig. 2A, BE exposure resulted in a significantly higher increase in  the level of apoptosis in splenocytes, CD3 +  splenocytes, CD19 +  splenocytes, and Jurkat cells in the presence of activator compared  with that in the absence of activator. However, BE, either alone or  in the presence of LPS, only induced a slight and similar increase  of apoptosis in DCs, and induced almost no increase in peritoneal  macrophages and RAW264.7 cells. This result suggested BE could  selectively induced the apoptosis in activated T and B lympho-  cytes. We further determine the dose-dependency of BE in  Baicalein Induces Apoptosis in Lymphocytes  PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592    inducing apoptosis of lymphocytes by incubating CD3 +  spleno-  cytes, CD19 +  splenocytes, or Jurkat cells with increasing concen-  trations of BE for 24 hours in the absence or presence of the  respective activator and subsequently analyzing apoptosis. The  results indicated BE enhanced the apoptosis of these tested cells in  a dose-dependent manner within the range of 5-20 mM much more profoundly in the presence of activator than in the absence  of activator (Fig. 2B). Taken together, above results demonstrated  that activated T and B cells are more sensitive to BE-induced  apoptosis than na\u0131\u0308ve ones, whereas DCs and macrophages, either  activated or na\u0131\u0308ve, are insensitive to BE-induced apoptosis.  BE Induces Apoptosis in Activated Lymphocytes through Mitochondrial Pathway  In order to dissect possible pathway involved in BE-induced  apoptosis in lymphocytes, we next investigated the effects of BE on  the expressions of Fas/FasL, loss of DYm, and activation of caspases in immunobead-purified CD3  + splenocytes in the absence  or presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A. Consistent with the result in Fig. 2B, BE (5-20 mM) markedly increased the percentage of apoptotic (annexin V  + ) cells dose-dependently in the presence of  Con A, while only showing slight effects in the absence of Con A  (Fig. 3 A-C). At the same time, even though the presence of Con  A resulted in a small increase in the expressions of Fas and FasL,  they are not further affected by BE treatment (Fig. 3A, B, D, and  E). However, BE treatment led to a much more profound loss of  DYm in T cells in the presence of Con A than in the absence of Con A (Fig. 3F and G). With the loss of DYm, the release of cytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol was markedly  increased in T cells upon BE treatment in the presence of Con  A (Fig. 3H). In addition, BE treatment also resulted in a down-  regulation in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and an  up-regulation in the level of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, in T  cells in the presence of Con A (Fig. 3I). The colorimetric assay for  caspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presence of Con A,  BE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23 rather than  caspase-8 in T cells (Fig. 3J). These results not only confirmed the  selectively pro-apoptotic effects of BE on activated T cells but also  indicated that BE exerts it effects through mitochondrial pathway  rather than death-receptor-mediated pathway.  We also tested the expressions of Fas and FasL in immunobead-  purified CD19 +  splenocytes which were treated with increasing  concentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of  10 mg/ml of LPS, and found that they were not influenced by BE treatment (data not shown). However, flow cytometry analysis  showed that treatment with BE increased the percentage of cells  with low DYm (Fig. 4A and B) and active caspase-3 +  cells (Fig. 4C  and D) in CD19 +  cells much more profoundly in the presence of  LPS than in the absence of LPS. Western blotting assays showed  that the release of cytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol in  B cells after BE treatment in the presence of LPS was marked  increased (Fig. 4E). BE treatment also resulted in a down-  regulation in the levels of Bcl-2 and an up-regulation in the level of  Bax in B cells in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4F). The colorimetric  assay for caspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presence  of LPS, BE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23  rather than caspase-8 in B cells (Fig. 4G). These results further  confirmed BE selectively promotes apoptosis of activated B cells  through mitochondrial pathway.  Administration of BE Attenuated Con A-induced Hepatitis and Enhanced Apoptosis of Lymphocytes in Liver-infiltrating MNCs and Splenocytes  The finding that BE selectively induces apoptosis in activated  lymphocytes in vitro prompted us to further investigate whether BE  could also induce lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has anti-  hepatitis potential using a Con A-induced hepatitis model. As  shown in Fig. 5, intravenous administration of Con A resulted in a  significant elevation in the serum ALT level at 8 and 24 h after  Con A administration. BE treatment significantly reduced the  ALT concentrations at both time points (Fig. 5A). Serum levels of  IFN-c and TNF-a were also enhanced in response to Con A challenge after 8 h, which were all suppressed by BE treatment  (Fig. 5B). Histologic examination of liver sections showed that Con  A challenge resulted in widespread areas of necrosis and massive  infiltration of inflammatory cells in livers 24 h after Con A  administration. Treatment with BE markedly attenuated these  pathologic changes (Fig. 5C). Flow cytometry analysis of hepatic  MNCs showed that the total numbers of liver infiltrating MNCs,  CD3 +  T cells, and CD19 +  B cells were significantly lower in BE-  treated mice, compared to mice treated with Con A only, 24 hours  Figure 1. BE preferentially induces apoptosis in mitogen-activated splennocytes. Murine splenocytes were treated with indicated concentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and the percentages of apoptosis were detected using Annexin V/PI staining.

Hypothesizing that the reduced  numbers of MNCs in the BE treated livers might reflect an  increased incidence of apoptosis, we analyzed the incidence of  apoptosis among the hepatic MNCs harvested at 24 h after Con A  injection with flow cytometry and found that the frequency of  apoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs significantly increased upon  BE treatment (Fig. 5E). Further flow cytometry analysis of freshly  isolated splenocytes demonstrated the percentages of apoptotic  (Annexin V + ) cells in splenocytes, splenic CD3  + T cells, and  CD19 +  B cell were significantly higher in BE-treated mice than  that in mice received Con A only (Fig. 5F and G). However, we  noticed that the frequency of apoptosis in liver MNCs only  increased from 23.5% to 29.0% upon BE treatment (Fig. 5E),  while the total cell numbers of liver MNCs dramatically decreased  from 21.86105 cells per liver decreased to 11.56105 cells per liver upon BE treatment (Fig. 5D). Thus the absolute number of  apoptotic MNCs was calculated to be fewer in BE-treated livers  when compared to Con A only control. Nevertheless, it should be  noted that, as cells undergo apoptosis, they are recognized and  rapidly cleared in vivo by phagocytic macrophages [36,37]. Thus,  the flow cytometry data in Fig. 5E did not take into consideration  the majority of the cells that had died and had been cleared in vivo,  but only represented the incidence of apoptosis among liver MNCs  that were undergoing apoptosis but had not been cleared at the  time point that the cells were harvested (24 h after Con A and BE  administration). To overcome the problem of apoptotic cells being  cleared in vivo, we did ex vivo experiments in which we harvested  the hepatic MNCs and splenocytes at early stage of BE  administration (within 8 h) and cultured them in 24-well flat-  bottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophages adherence, then the  nonadherent cells were collected and further cultured for 12 and  24 h to investigate whether these cells would then undergo  increased apoptosis in vitro in the absence of macrophages. The  results showed that during the in vitro culture period, the frequency  of apoptotic cells raised more readily in the macrophage-depleted  live MNCs and splenocytes obtained from mice treated with Con  A and BE than in the cells from mice treated with Con A only, so  that by 24 h of in vitro culture, the increase in the frequency of  apoptotic cells in Con A+BE group became more apparent compared with Con A only control (Fig. 6A). At this time point of  in vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells detected in  macrophage-depleted live MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in  CD3 +  T cell and CD19 +  B cells subsets, were significantly higher  in Con A+BE group than in Con A only control (Fig. 6B). These results indicated that lymphocytes exposed to BE in vivo undergo  increased apoptosis when cultured in vitro, suggesting that in vivo  exposure of lymphocytes to BE makes them more susceptible to  apoptosis. These results support the notion that increased levels of  apoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction in  MNCs within BE-treated livers. These data together suggested  that BE could also promote lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has  anti-hepatitis potential.  Figure 2. BE selectively induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes. (A) Different types of immune cells as indicated were incubated with 10 mM of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of activator, and the percentages of apoptosis were detected using Annexin V/PI staining. The increase in the percentages of apoptosis in each type of cells upon BE exposure was calculated. Following activators were used: 5 mg/ml of Con A for splenocytes and CD3+ splenocytes; 500 ng/ml of LPS for CD19+ splenocytes, BM-derived DCs, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells; 25 ng/mL of PMA and 1 mM of ionomycin for Jurkat T cells.

The direct  and selective pro-apoptotic effects on activated T and B cells were  further corroborated using MACS-purified CD3 +  splenocytes and  CD19 +  splenocytes. We demonstrated that BE significantly  enhanced the apoptosis in pure CD3 +  splenocytes stimulated with  Con A, while only having little effect on naive ones. Consistently,  BE was found to be much more effective in inducing Jurkat T cells  to undergo apoptosis in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. In  pure CD19 +  splenocytes cultures that had been treated with BE  and LPS, the level of apoptosis were greater when compared to  that in cultures that treated with BE alone. These results confirm  that BE might affect activated lymphocytes to a greater degree  than na\u0131\u0308ve lymphocytes. We also noted that murine BM-derived  DCs, murine peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were  all insensitive to the BE-induced apoptosis, either activated or  inactivated. These results suggested that BE was able to selective  promote apoptosis in activated T and B lymphocytes.  Apoptosis is mediated primarily through intrinsic and/or  extrinsic pathways [38,39]. The intrinsic pathway involves altering  mitochondrial permeability and subsequent cytochrome c release  and formation of the apoptosome, a catalytic multiprotein  platform that activates caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 then cleaves  caspase-3 resulting in downstream events involved in cell death  [38]. The extrinsic pathway is triggered with the ligation of death  receptors, followed by the recruitment of an adaptor molecule and  procaspase-8 to form a Death-Inducing Signaling Complex, which  lead to the autocatalytic cleavage and subsequent activation of  caspase-8, and in turn activates caspase-3, leading to apoptosis  [39]. Fas is a major death receptor that mediates apoptosis of  activated lymphocytes. Upon activation, lymphocytes can express  a higher level of Fas and are more susceptible to Fas-mediated  apoptosis than naive cells [7]. In this study, we observed that BE  did not affects the expressions of Fas and FasL on both T and B  lymphocytes, either na\u0131\u0308ve or activated, but preferentially induced a  loss of DYm in activated lymphocytes. BE treatment also led to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, down-  regulation of Bcl-2, and up-regulation of Bax in activated  lymphocytes. Furthermore, Caspase-9 and caspase-3 but not  caspase-8 were activated in activated lymphocytes upon BE  treatment. These results indicated that BE induces apoptosis in  activated lymphocytes via intrinsic pathway rather than Fas-  mediated extrinsic pathway.  BE has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties on  various animal models [21-25], but the related mechanisms are  only partially understood. Previous studies have associated its anti-  inflammatory activities with activation of intestinal Pregnane X  Receptor [25], suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine expres-  sion [23,24], inhibition of nitric oxide production [21,40],  impairment of reactive oxygen intermediates production [20],  inhibition of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [20], and  modification of eicosanoid synthesis [41]. Data from current study  suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of BE can also be  attributed, at least in part, to its ability to trigger apoptosis in  activated lymphocytes. This new finding not only extends our  understanding on the cellular mechanisms underlying the anti-  inflammatory activity of BE, but also raises the possibility that BE  may be useful to eliminate activated lymphocytes that contribute  to autoimmune diseases.  Con A-induced hepatitis in mice is a well-established mouse  model for AIH. In this model, intravenous injection of Con A  leads to systemic immune activation, resulting in acute liver injury  that resemble the pathology of immune mediated hepatitis in  humans [10]. Activated T cells have a critical role in Con A-  induced liver damage. Upon Con A challenge, T cells are initially  activated and infiltrate the liver tissue, where they induce  hepatocyte death either by cell to cell contact or through secretion  of pro-inflammatory cytokines, of which TNF-a and IFN-c are the major ones [42,43]. In the current study, in vivo administration of  BE alleviated Con A-induced hepatitis as indicated by decreased  transaminase levels and markedly attenuated inflammatory lesions  in liver. BE treatment also significantly suppressed Con A-  mediated elevation in serum level of TNF-a and IFN-c, indicating Con A-induced immune activation was inhibited by BE.  Furthermore, BE treatment markedly reduced MNCs infiltration  in the liver and significantly lowered the absolute number of  hepatic T and B lymphocytes. The reduction in hepatic MNCs  could possibly result from the decrease in MNCs recruitment into  livers and/or the increase in MNCs death and clearance within  livers. Since BE can selectively induced apoptosis in activated  lymphocytes in vitro, we assumed that enhanced apoptosis of  lymphocytes may contribute to the reduction of MNCs in livers of  BE-treated mice. Indeed, we found that BE treatment increased  the incidence of apoptosis among hepatic MNCs and splenocytes  in Con A-challenged mice. Flow cytometry assay of annexin V  exposure in splenic T and B cells further confirmed that the  frequency of splenic T and B lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis  was increased in ConA-injected mice upon BE treatment.  Furthermore, our ex vivo experiments demonstrated that when  liver MNCs and splenocytes harvested from mice treated with Con  A and BE were cultured in vitro for 24 h, both the frequencies of  apoptosis and the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells in total liver  MNCs and spelnocytes, as well as in CD3 +  T cell and CD19 +  B  cell subsets, were significantly higher when compared to Con A  only control. These ex vivo data indicate that lymphocytes from BE-  treated mice become increasingly susceptible to apoptosis when  cultured in vitro. Overall, these results suggest that higher level of  apoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction of  MNCs in liver of BE-treated mice, which concur with in vitro  evidence that BE drives activated lymphocytes to apoptosis.  Although we cannot exclude the possibility that BE may execute  Figure 3. BE selectively induces apoptosis of Con A-activated CD3+ T cells through mitochondrial pathway.

Nevertheless, the in vivo effect of BE was tested here only at one  dosage of 100 mg/kg administered by intraperitoneal injection. It  would be expected that the oral delivery of BE may have limited  utility since the oral bioavailability of BE is very low. Therefore,  the present in vivo study only shows proof of principle, but does not  show any practical utility of the BE in clinic.  Currently the only viable treatments of AIH are immunosup-  pressant application and liver transplantation [1,3]. Ideally, the  goal of immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune diseases  would be the induction of long-lasting immunological tolerance by  selective deleting autoantigen-activated lymphocytes that have  failed to undergo apoptosis while leaving the normal immune  response to foreign antigens unaffected. Unfortunately, most  immunosuppressive drugs (ISDs) currently used for AIH act  mainly by preventing the activation and expansion of resting  lymphocytes, rather than mediating the elimination of activated  after BE treatment in the presence of LPS was examined by Western blotting.

On the contrary, some ISDs such as  cyclosporin A and FK506 even inhibited apoptosis in activated T  cells by down-regulation of FasL [47]. Although dexamethasone is  known to induce apoptosis in various immune cells, it lack of  selectivity for activated lymphocytes [48]. This is why the current  ISDs exert global suppressing effects on the immune system, which  predispose patients to the development of infection and cancer.  Alternatively, selective induction of apoptosis in activated  lymphocytes might effectively deplete autoreactive T and B cells  without affecting na\u0131\u0308ve or non-activated ones to avoid intervention  of normal immune responses to foreign antigens. In this context,  BE would have distinct advantages over the unselective immuno-  suppressive agents currently used in the treatment of AIH.  However, the practical uses of baicalein in pharmaceutical field  will depend on the success of attempts to enhance its oral  bioavailability. Fortunately, several approaches have been recently  developed which could markedly improve the oral bioavailability  of BE [49-51].  In conclusion, BE selectively promoted apoptosis in activated  lymphocytes through intrinsic apoptotic pathway, while having  little effect on non-activated ones. Administration of BE alleviates  Con A-induced hepatitis in mice and increased the incidences of  apoptosis in hepatic MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3 +  and CD19 +  splenocytes, in Con A-challenged mice. These  observations not only reveal a novel cellular mechanism for the  anti-inflammatory effects of BE, but also suggest that it has  therapeutic potential for AIH.
