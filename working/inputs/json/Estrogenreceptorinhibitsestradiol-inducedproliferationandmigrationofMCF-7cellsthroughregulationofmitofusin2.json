    "summary": "Specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are highly expressed in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cells. In tissue arrays of RMS tumor cores from 71 patients, 80% of RMS patients expressed high levels of Sp1 protein, whereas low expression of Sp1 was detected in normal muscle tissue. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) tolfenamic acid (TA) inhibited growth and migration of RD and RH30 RMS cell lines and also inhibited tumor growth in vivo using a mouse xenograft (RH30 cells) model. The effects of TA were accompanied by downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes in RMS cells and tumors, and the role of Sp protein downregulation in mediating inhibition of RD and RH30 cell growth and migration was confirmed by individual and combined knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins by RNA interference. TA treatment and Sp knockdown in RD and RH30 cells also showed that four genes that are emerging as individual drug targets for treating RMS, namely c-MET, insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), PDGFR\u03b1 and CXCR4, are also Sp-regulated genes. These results suggest that NSAIDs such as TA may have potential clinical efficacy in drug combinations for treating RMS patients.",

In the present study, we investigated whether estrogen  receptor (ER) \u03b2 affected the proliferation and migration of the  human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 through regulation of  mitofusin 2 (mfn2). A previous study reported that mfn2 may  be regulated by ER through a non-classical pathway; in this  pathway, the ER modulates the activities of other transcription  factors by stabilizing their binding to DNA and/or recruiting  coactivators to the complex. However, the previous study, unlike  the study presented here, did not directly explore the interac- tions between ER and mfn2. Here, RT-PCR and western blot  analysis were used to test the expression of mfn2 in MCF-7 cells  after exposure to different doses of estradiol (E2). The ability  of cells to proliferate and migrate was determined by MTT  assay and a monolayer-wounding protocol, respectively. Finally,  changes in MCF-7 cell biology after transfection with ER\u03b2 or  mfn2 expression vectors were investigated, and the role of ER\u03b2  in mfn2 expression was also explored. Our results showed that  E2 attenuated mfn2 expression in a dose-dependent manner,  concomitant with the activation of proliferation and migration of  MCF-7 cells. The mfn2 expression vector effectively suppressed  E2-induced upregulation of PCNA and migration in MCF-7  cells. ER\u03b2 inhibited the E2-induced mfn2 downregulation that  accompanied the inhibition of proliferation and migration in  MCF-7 cells. Briefly, ER\u03b2 may inhibit E2-induced proliferation  and migration of MCF-7 cells through regulation of mfn2.  Introduction  Both clinical and epidemiological evidence show that estrogens  participate in the initiation and development of human breast  cancer (1,2). Understanding the role of both types of estrogen   receptor (ER) (ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2), in the pathogenesis of breast  cancer is important, because effects of estrogen are mediated  through both of these ERs (3-6). Although the function of ER\u03b1  has been established and its remains the most important marker  of response to hormonal therapy in breast cancer, the role of ER\u03b2  remains elusive with many conflicting studies (7). The two ERs  act in distinct ways in several estrogen target cells and tissues  (8,9). There are two major conclusions to be drawn from current  research situation of ERs. First, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 have different  biological functions, which are indicated by their distinct expres- sion patterns and the different phenotypes reported for the two  ERs in knockout animals, respectively. Second, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2  have overlapping yet unique roles in estrogen signaling, as judged  from a number of gene expression profiling studies.  Mitofusin 2 (mfn2), also named as hyperplasia suppressor  gene for its antiproliferative effects, localizes to the mito- chondrial outer membrane and plays an essential role  in mitochondrial fusion, thus regulating mitochondrial  morphology and function. Chen et al (10) recently demon- strated that mfn2 profoundly suppresses cell growth and  proliferation in multiple tumor cell lines and rat vascular  smooth muscle cells in vivo and in culture systems via inhibi- tion of the Ras-ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Also, there  is some evidence suggesting a protective effect of mfn2 in  mammalian cells (11-13).  There is a growing body of literature suggesting that estrogen  may modulate expression of some genes through a non-classical  pathway in which the ER interacts with other transcription  factors, a process referred to as transcription factor cross-talk. In  this pathway, the ER modulates the activities of other transcrip- tion factors, such as activator protein (AP)-1, by stabilizing their  binding to DNA and/or recruiting coactivators to the complex.  DeNardo et al (14) identified sets of estrogen-induced genes,  including mfn2, whose promoters contain potential AP-1 sites  but no estrogen-responsive element (ERE) sequences, essential  for a classical model of estrogen action; these genes thus depend  on AP-1 for their expression. Further characterization of the  promoters suggested that the ER regulated these genes through  the non-classical pathways mentioned above. However, the  previous study, unlike the study presented here, did not directly  explore the interaction between ERs and mfn2.  In the present study, we showed that ER\u03b2 inhibits human  breast cancer cell proliferation and migration by inducing   Estrogen receptor \u03b2 inhibits estradiol-induced proliferation and  migration of MCF-7 cells through regulation of mitofusin 2  LI MA1,2,  YUEPING LIU3,  CUIZHI GENG2,  XIAOWEI QI1  and  JUN JIANG1  1Breast Disease Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing;   Departments of 2Breast Disease Center and 3Pathology, The Fourth Hospital of    Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, P.R.

We report for the first time that ER\u03b2 acts  upstream of mfn2. Moreover, this observation indicated that  mfn2 affects the proliferation and migration of human breast  cancer cells.  Materials and methods  Cell lines and groups. MCF-7, a human breast cancer cell line,  was kindly provided by Professor Mei-xiang Sang, Division  of Scientific Research, the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical  University, Shijiazhuang, China. Cells were cultured in growth  medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium  (DMEM) (Gibco-BRL, USA) containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 2 mM  L-glutamine, 5,000 IU/l penicillin, 5 mg/l streptomycin, 125 U/l  Fungizone, 2.2 g/l sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine  serum (FBS) pretreated by 5% charcoal-dextran, in a 5% CO2  incubator. For experiments carried out in serum-free condi- tions, cells were made quiescent by culturing in serum-free  medium for 24 h. DMEM with antibiotics and glutamine, was  supplemented with 0.5 g/l BSA (1). Cells were randomly divided  into six groups and cultured for 48 h with E2 (17\u03b2-estradiol,  at doses of 0 mol/l group, 10-9 mol/l group, 10-8 mol/l group,  10-7 mol/l group, 10-6 mol/l group and 10-5 mol/l) to determine  the dose-dependent effects of E2 on mfn2 and cell behavior.  Cells of each group were cultured for 48 h in DMEM medium  containing 10% FBS plus defferent dose of E2 without phenol- sulfonphthalein (2). To specially enhance mfn2 expression and  explore its effect on proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells,  cells were randomly divided into four groups in gene trans- fection experiments as follows: normal group (blank control),  untransfected E2 group (E2), control vector pEGFP-transfected  E2 group (E2 plus control vector) and pEGFP-mfn2-transfected  E2 group (E2 plus mfn2 vector). Cells of the three groups treated  with E2 were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS plus 10-6 mol/l  E2 for 48 h (3). To explore the effect of ER\u03b2 on mfn2 expres- sion, cells were randomly divided into four groups as follows:  normal group (blank control), untransfected E2 group (E2),  control vector pEGFP-N1 E2 group (E2 plus control vector) and  pEGFP-N1-ESR2 E2 group (E2 plus ER\u03b2 vector). Cells of every  group were grown as described in group 2. Each experiment  was repeated six times.  Expression vectors and transient transfection. The pEGFP-mfn2  and pEGFP-N1-ESR2 vectors and their negative control  vectors were purchased from Yingrun Biotechnology Co.  Ltd., (Changsha, China). pEGFP-mfn2 and pEGFP-N1-ESR2  plasmids carry full-length mfn2 and ER\u03b2 genes, respectively.  Transient transfection of MCF-7 cells was carried out using  Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA)  according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MCF-7  cells were cultured in 6-well plates and the medium was changed  the following day until 80% confluence was achieved. The cells  were transfected with 4.0 \u00b5g vector DNA by 10 \u00b5l Lipofectamine  2000 in 2 ml serum-free DMEM medium. At 6 h after transfec- tion, the medium was replaced by normal DMEM supplemented  with 10% FBS, and cells were cultured for 24 h. Cells were then  cultured for 48 h in medium containing 10% FBS and E2 to  detect proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells (group 2) and  mfn2 expression (group 3). The efficiency of transfection was  approximately 70% for all experimental groups.  Western blot analysis. Protein extracted from MCF-7 cells  was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred  onto PVDF membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA,  USA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at 37\u02daC with 5% BSA  in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST).  Next, the membrane was incubated at 4\u02daC overnight with  primary antibodies for mfn2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,  Santa Cruz, CA, USA), ER\u03b2 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),  and \u03b2-actin (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Subsequently,  the membrane was rinsed three times with TBST containing  secondary antibody (1:5,000), treated with ECL solution (Pierce,  Rockford, IL, USA), and bands detected by exposing the blots  to X-ray film. For quantitative analysis (i.e., normalized for  \u03b2-actin), bands were evaluated with IPP 5.0 software. Integrated  optical density (IOD) of each band was measured, and relative  IOD calculated as the ratio of the target band IOD compared to  the IOD of the \u03b2-actin band.  Semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with  TRIzol (Invitrogen Co.) according to the manufacturer's  instructions. Total RNA (2 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed using  random primers and M-MLV at 42\u02daC for 1 h and then heated  to 94\u02daC for 5 min in a total reaction volume of 20 \u00b5l. The  PCR amplification began with a 5-min denaturation at 95\u02daC,  followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u02daC for 45 sec,  annealing at 55\u02daC for 45 sec and extension at 72\u02daC for 60 sec.  The final extension was set for 10 min at 72\u02daC. The products  were electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the levels of  mfn2 mRNA were normalized with levels of GAPDH mRNA.  All PCR primers are shown in Table I.  Immunofluorescence. MCF-7 cells were planted on cover  slides in 6-well plates. After fixing with 10% formalin at room  temperature for 15 min, pretreating with 0.3% Triton X-100 for  20 min at 37\u02daC and blocking with goat serum for 30 min at  37\u02daC, cells were incubated with anti-mfn2 (1:200) overnight at  4\u02daC. After washing with PBS for three times, the slides was all  incubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200,  Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 37\u02daC. Then slides were  viewed after being rinsed with PBS three times.  Cell proliferation. Cell proliferation was measured using  methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) shade selection experi- ments.

Measurement of cell migration. Cell migration was measured  using a wound-healing protocol developed and described in an  earlier publication (15).  Statistical analysis. The figure analysis was carried out by  the software of IPP. The quantitative data are presented as  mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD).

Results  E2 downregulates expression of mfn2 in a dose-dependent  manner in MCF-7 cells. As described above, the ER might regu- late mfn2 expression via a non-classical pathway. To observe the  effect of ER\u03b1 on mfn2, MCF-7 cells, which primarily express  ER\u03b1, were cultured in medium containing E2. The effect of E2  on mfn2 expression through ER\u03b1 was measured using immu- noblotting for protein levels and semi-quantitative RT-PCR for  mRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. E2 inhibited the expression of  mfn2 in a dose-dependent manner. Mfn2 was expressed at a  higher level in cells cultured with 10% FBS. When cells were  pretreated with 10-9 mol/l, 10-8 mol/l, 10-7 mol/l, 10-6 mol/l  and 10-5 mol/l group E2 for 48 h, protein expression of mfn2  decreased by 2.85, 40.00, 55.43, 74.29 and 57.14%, respectively.  Thus, the lowest expression of mfn2 was seen in the 10-6 mol/l  group. Similar changes were seen when cells were analyzed by   RT-PCR. These findings demonstrated that E2 decreased mfn2  expression in a dose-dependent manner at both the molecular  and protein levels (Fig. 1).  E2 enhances proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells.  MCF-7 cells are the best-characterized ER-positive cell line  in terms of known genes regulated by estrogens that promote  proliferation. In order to confirm that E2 promotes prolif- eration, E2-treated MCF-7 cells were examined using an  MTT assay. Absorbance of the MTT substrate at 490 nm for  each dosage group is showed in Table II. Significant differ- ences were seen among experimental groups and the control  group; the maximum effect of E2 on proliferation was seen in  the 10-6 mol/l group, where mfn2 was expressed at its lowest  level. These results demonstrated that E2 treatment resulted  in increased proliferation of MCF-7 cells, and that decreased  mfn2 might play a positive role in this proliferation.  To determine if E2 influenced cell motility, we examined  the ability of treated cells to migrate in a wound-healing assay.  In response to wounding the monolayer, the 10-6 mol/l group  cells were able to almost completely heal the wound. In contrast,  the cells of other groups were unable to do so and exhibited  an obvious reduction in their rate of migration compared to  the 10-6 mol/l group. As compared with the 10-6 mol/l group  cells, the reduction in the migration rate of cells treated with  E2 at 10-9 mol/l, 10-8 mol/l, 10-7 mol/l, 10-5 mol/l and 0 mol/l  were 64.3, 50.0, 31.4, 24.5 and 85.7%, respectively. These  results demonstrated that E2 also enhanced cell motility in a  dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2).  The mfn2 expression vector effectively suppressed E2-induced  upregulation of PCNA and migration in MCF-7 cells. A  previous study demonstrated that mfn2 profoundly suppresses   Figure 1.

As described above, the effect of E2 on MCF-7 cells might  be partly dependent on inhibition of mfn2. To investigate the   involvement of mfn2 in E2-induced cell proliferation and  migration, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the expression  vector pEGFP-mfn2. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, normal  cultured MCF-7 cells (C) had standard expression levels of  mfn2 and PCNA. However, both untransfected MCF-7 cells  stimulated with 10-6 mol/l E2 (E2), and control vector trans- fected cells stimulated with 10-6 mol/l E2 (E2+C) showed  notably decreased mfn2 expression and enhanced PCNA  expression. In comparison with MCF-7 cells transfected with  control vector, mfn2 levels were increased by 2.11-fold and  PCNA levels were decreased by about 42.61% in MCF-7 cells  transfected with specific mfn2 expression vector (E2+mfn2)  (P<0.01). Consistent with the western blot analysis results,  immunofluorescence also revealed that the mfn2 vector  reversed E2-induced downregulation of PCNA protein  (Fig. 3C and D).  Cells transfected with the mfn2 vector showed moderate  resistance to E2 stimulation. In comparison with E2-stimulated  untransfected or control vector-transfected cells, mfn2 expres- sion vector-transfected cells demonstrated decreased cell  migration (Fig. 4). The wound-healing assay indicated that  MCF-7 cells and control vector-transfected cells stimulated  by E2 almost completely healed the wound, as compared with  unstimulated cells. However, this alteration was reversed by  transfection with the mfn2 expression vector.  ER\u03b2 ameliorates E2-induced mfn2 downregulation in MCF-7  cells. As stated previously, estrogen's effects are mediated  through two ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (3-6). We hypothesized that  ER\u03b2 might also act upstream of mfn2, because mfn2 is identi- cally regulated by E2. To test our hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were  transfected with an ER\u03b2 expression vector. As seen in Fig. 5,  MCF-7 cells transfected with the ER\u03b2 vector showed high ER\u03b2  protein expression after stimulation with E2 for 24 h. However,  no changes in ER\u03b2 protein levels were found in MCF-7 cells  transfected with blank control vector or in untransfected MCF-7  cells. In comparison with MCF-7 cells transfected with blank  vector, ER\u03b2 protein was increased by about 2.25-fold in MCF-7  cells transfected with the ER\u03b2 vector (P<0.01). Cells transfected  with the ER\u03b2 vector showed antagonistic effects on E2 stimula- tion; mfn2 protein was upregulated in these cells as compared  with blank vector-transfected MCF-7 cells and untransfected  cells treated with E2. These results indicated that MCF-7 cells  transfected with the ER\u03b2 vector showed moderate resistance to  E2 stimulation and subsequent decreased downregulation of  mfn2 protein (Fig. 5).  An ER\u03b2 expression vector effectively suppressed E2-induced  enhancement of proliferation and migration in MCF-7 cells.  The results above showed that mfn2 negatively regulated  E2-induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells and  ER\u03b2 acted as an upstream signal of mfn2; therefore, we hypoth- esized that ER\u03b2 could also inhibit proliferation and migration of  MCF-7 cells. To investigate this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were  transfected with the ER\u03b2 expression vector (pEGFP-N1-ESR2).  An MTT assay was used to examine the proliferation of MCF-7  cells. As shown in Table III, there were significant differences  of absorbance of MTT substrate at 490 nm between experi- mental groups and the control group.

In fact, the wound-healing assay indicated that MCF-7  cells stimulated by E2 and cells transfected with control vector  expressed a stronger ability to heal the wound as compared with  normal group cells untreated with E2. However, this ability was  reversed by transfection with the ER\u03b2 vector.  Discussion  It is acknowledged that ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 have distinct roles in  breast cancer cells. Although the majority considered that ER\u03b1  promotes proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells  and the function of ER\u03b1 had been clearly elucidated, the exact  roles of ER\u03b2 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer are unclear.  In fact, the function of ER\u03b2 in the pathogenesis and develop- ment of breast cancer is contradictory. Some studies indicate  that ER\u03b2 may function as a tumor suppressor and that the loss  of ER\u03b2 may promote breast carcinogenesis (16-18); however,  there are other studies suggesting that ER\u03b2 may promote cell  proliferation and breast tumor formation (19,20). Regardless of  these contradictions, the majority of studies focus on the clas- sical model of estrogen signaling through ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2,  in which ERs act at ERE-containing promoters. In the classical  model, ligand-activated ER binds specifically to DNA at EREs  through its DNA binding domain and brings coactivators and  corepressors to the transcription site via its activator function  (AF)-1 and AF-2 domains. However, an increasing number of  studies show that estrogen also modulates gene expression by  a second mechanism in which the ER interacts with other tran- scription factors through a process referred to as transcription  factor cross-talk. In this case, the ER modulates the activities  of other transcription factors such as activator protein (AP)-1,  or SP-1 by stabilizing their binding to DNA and/or recruiting  coactivators to the complex (21,23). DeNardo et al (14) reported  a model of estrogen-ER activation of AP-1 through interac- tion with existing coactivator complexes that in turn stabilize  the entire complex and/or induce this complex into a higher  state of activity. They also identified 6 estrogen-induced/AP-1  dependent genes, including mfn2, which might fit this model.  However, their conclusions were only speculative, as they did  not provide detailed data or investigated the interaction of ERs  and mfn2 in vitro. In this study, we investigated the role of  ER\u03b2 in estradiol-induced proliferation and migration of human  breast cancer cells and studied whether mfn2 participated in  this behavior.  First, we explored whether E2 (17\u03b2-estradiol) affected prolif- eration and migration of MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer cell   line primarily expressing ER\u03b1 and thus mimicking the majority  of ER-positive breast tumors. Similar to some previous studies  that revealed that E2 affected biological behavior of human  breast cells (24-26), our results showed that both the proliferation  and migration abilities of MCF-7 were significantly increased  when cultured with increasing doses of E2. Furthermore, regula- tion was in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximum effect  seen in the 10-6 mol/l group. These data suggest that E2 and ER\u03b1  are positive regulators of MCF-7 cells.  Whether mfn2 was involved in the initiation and progres- sion of human breast cancer has not been previously reported.  To investigate the role of mfn2, we observed the expression of  mfn2 in MCF-7 cells cultured within defferent doses of E2.  Interestingly, we found that E2 could decrease mfn2 expression  in a dose-dependent manner, and that the changes in mfn2 levels  were correlated with the proliferation and migration of MCF-7  cells. These results indicated that mfn2 might negatively regulate  estradiol-induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells.  Furthermore, we found that introduction of mfn2 blocked the  response of MCF-7 cells to E2. Thus, mfn2 plays an important  regulatory role in E2-induced proliferation and migration of  MCF-7 cells. Considering the reports that mfn2 is one of the  estrogen-induced/AP-1 dependent genes (14), the above results  suggested that mfn2 might negatively regulate E2-induced  MCF-7 cell proliferation and migration by a non-classical  pathway. Mfn2, a proliferation-inhibiting gene, targets to the  outer membrane of mitochondria. The mfn2 gene was found  to play roles in the inhibition of cellular proliferation and the  promotion of apoptosis (10) and exhibits antitumor activity in a  wide range of cancer cell lines (27-29), suggesting that mfn2 may  be important in the development of human cancers. Again, the  present study also provided a potential target for prevention or  treatment for breast cancer patients with ER\u03b1 positive expression.  Approximately 70% of breast tumors express ER\u03b2, and  most tumors coexpress both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (30,31). However,  whether ER\u03b2 is involved in E2-induced downregulation of  mfn2 is still unknown. Clearly, additional studies are needed to  clarify the role of ER\u03b2 in breast cancer. In the present study, we  introduced ER\u03b2 into MCF-7 cells and investigated the effects  of ER\u03b2 on proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells as well  as its effects on mfn2 expression. Our studies demonstrate that  ER\u03b2 changes the phenotype of MCF-7 cells in response to E2.  In ER\u03b1-expressing MCF-7 cells, E2 causes proliferation and  migration, as well as suppression of mfn2. In contrast, when  ER\u03b2 is expressed along with ER\u03b1, MCF-7 cells are directed to  antitumor pathways and high levels of mfn2 even in the pres- ence of estrogens. These results suggest that ER\u03b2 can alter the  response of MCF-7 to estrogens and demonstrate that ER\u03b2 may  function as a tumor suppressor through the mfn2 pathway. Many  cell-based studies suggest that ER\u03b2 acts as a negative modulator  of ER\u03b1 action. When ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 are co-transfected into ER  negative (ER-) cells, ER\u03b2 inhibits ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity  and decreases the sensitivity of the cells to E2 (6,32). ER\u03b2 also  lowers both ER\u03b1 mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7 cells, thus  indirectly influencing function of ER\u03b1 (33,34). ER\u03b2 overexpres- sion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells can not only inhibit ER\u03b1  regulation of a subset of genes involved in DNA replication,  cell-cycle regulation, and proliferation (35,36), but also  inhibit cell proliferation in response to E2 (34,36-38), in part  by increasing expression of antiproliferative genes (p21Cip1   Table III.

MA et al:  ER\u03b2 IN PROLIFERATION AND MIGRATION2000  and p27Kip1). Our results were quite similar to these reports,  and minor deference lie in downstream factors. There may  be diverse mechanisms for the effect of ER\u03b2 on the response  of ER\u03b1 to E2. Recently, some studies revealed in series that  the responses of breast cancer cell lines to 17\u03b2-estradiol are  dependent on the ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 ratio (39,40). Most importantly,  ER\u03b2 might regulate mfn2 expression directly in a non-clas- sical pathway similar to ER\u03b1. Therefore, further studies are  needed to determine the exact mechanisms of interaction  between ERs, ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2, and mfn2, especially to delin- eate the mechanism of action through experiments such as  in-depth promoter analysis and CHIP.
