{"title": "Accumulating liver-resistant fatty livers", "authors": "Melinda Kelly Katie Bonilla Jimmy Collier Susan Smith Justin Morales", "published_date": "04-26-2014", "affiliation": "California State University-Northridge, School of Cognitive Science", "text": "Ethanol-absorbed fat deposits, which are the major component of the liver, are often described as highly resistant to the removal of fat from the body, and can be called liver resistant fats (LFs). Researchers at the Institute of Behavioural Medicine at Kyoto University have now found that LFS can be detected in liver tissue arising from drinking alcohol without having to undergo any blood tests, following measurement of one of the lipid elements in the liver.<p>However, sugar enzymes in fat that are destroyed by the conversion of ethanol to ethanol alcohol, usually contain a component dubbed \u201clipid biochemicals\u201d. Fructose and sucrose lipids are known to be produced by fat destruction. The density of lipid biochemicals by the sugar enzymes in the liver varies greatly with the concentration of the ethanol-injected fructose and sucrose, and the relative weight of the dissolved sugar (sucrose) drops by one-third when the volume of ethanol in the blood falls by 0.5% to 1%. The LFS enzymes are found in the liver, but are rarely found without a liver enzyme; thus, this new discovery may lead to the development of a new addiction in the short term.<p>Okura Edaichi, Hiroshi Tamada, Daisuke Tamada, Sumio Takahashi, and Tetsuya Yamamoto, Ph.D. \u2013 This research appears in BMC Complementary Therapies and BMC Medicine"}
