{"title": "Phase 2 meningococcal subpopulation with S/ESN-967H virus (EKX-C), S/ESN-967H viruses in collaboration with the Blackheath Institute, Oxford, Great Britain", "authors": "Theodore Williams Bradley Martinez Derrick Flores Eric Thompson Andrew Jones", "published_date": "12-13-2017", "affiliation": "California Baptist University, School of Environmental Studies", "text": "A total of 48 patients who had various conditions except infection with Group B Staphylococcus aureus (GBS), Staphylococcus aureus, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized with S/ESN-967H virus (S/ESN-967H), All of them using CTX-M-1-producing Ermophthora cocci (PC) or actively-infected Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized with S/ESN-967H virus (EKX-C) were observed in this Phase 2 trial study, involving the penicillin antibiotics cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin. The result of the clinical evaluation of the CTX-M-1-producing Ermophthora cocci or actively-infected Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonized with S/ESN-967H virus (EKX-C) in 39 patients (not including patients who died) appears to confirm the unanticipated outcome of the study that a clinical outcome was observed even in patients with negative CTX-M-1-producing PC- or EKX-C colonized S/ESN-967H virus (EKX-C) in the Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by the Blackheath Institute/Global Health Research, with support by the UK Medical Research Council, and in the (Worldwide) Clinical Laboratory Support Programme (WLCSP), University of Liverpool.<p>The meningococcal subgroup in this study represents a group of meningococcal subtypes responsible for large outbreaks with acute bacterial meningitis and meningococcal dysentery. Among those included in this study, a total of thirty three of the infections with S/ESN-967H virus (EKX-C) occurring in males, females, elderly patients and the less well-off patients, and twelve of the infections with S/ESN-967H virus (EKX-C) occurring in females, males, elderly patients and the less well-off patients, were associated with non-responsiveness of the antibiotic penicillin to S/ESN-967H virus (EKX-C). S/ESN-967H virus infection with this group of patients, with EKX-C, without CD5 response in males, and with no response in females with neutrophilic lesions (S/ESN-967H) was characteristically resistant to penicillin treatment.<p>Ana Mena, Virginia Plasencia, Laura Garci\u00ada, Olga Hidalgo, Jos- Ignacio Ayestar-n, Sebasti-n Alberti, Nuria Borrell, Jos- Ignacio Ayestar-n, Antonio OliverW.
