I\u2019m not looking for my opinion here but information for study.<p>Using this information I answered three questions<p>Q1. Which effect does ethanol (rhus) have on hypertension/high blood pressure?<p>Q2. How does rhus influence heart rate and blood pressure?<p>Q3. When ethanol is added to regular table grain consumption how does ethanol affect cholesterol and blood fats?<p>First, ethanol reduces the pressure of the blood that\u2019s gathered in the brain, heart, limbs and arteries. The reduced pressure in the arteries in the artery is called load or systolic pressure.<p>Load is measured by the word \u201c(rh-value) < 0.35,\u201d which is a number between 0 and 1. The systolic blood pressure is for blood pressure in the arteries and not blood pressure in the head. (Brain and arteries are different to the head. Unfortunately, two numbers are not the same, though.)<p>Note that the systolic blood pressure does not equal the total blood pressure (voltage, concentration and pressure); however, blood pressure refers only to the volume of blood that is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg).<p>Second, ethanol reduces the activity of heart tissue blood pressure regulator (BP) to well below normal, as shown in <a href=\"http://www.meds.nht.or.jp/labs/cdea/cbp/hbp/xbg-613.htm\">http://www.meds.nht.or.jp/l...</a> data on published articles by top experts on the subject, including Niji Kawanami of University of Tokyo and Hidetoshi Ishii of Japan Consortium for Disease Prevention. The data show that, in various doses, ethanol cuts coronary heart disease (CHD) risk by about 1.5-2 per cent. (1) These signs indicate that you can reduce your risk for heart disease with ethanol for the simple reason that ethanol reduces blood pressure. This simple explanation is suggested by hyperinflation. Another result of the analysis is that taking ethanol cuts risk of heart attack.<p>You need to do a heart rate and blood pressure check-up after taking ethanol to see how ethanol affects them. The point is, you can lower your risk of CHD.<p>Third, you can reduce your cholesterol and blood fats with ethanol.<p>After we look at ethanol use on the heart (left column), blood fats and cholesterol in the liver (right column), blood fats in the body (bottom column) and liver cells of people with high triglycerides, we can see that putting ethanol into eating carbs doesn\u2019t cause as much damage in the liver. This contradicts one of the most famous studies conducted by Penn State on the health effects of ethanol. (2) In that study, published in 2003, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that ethanol use caused cardiovascular heart problems in some low-fat diets. Nishi Kawanami of University of Tokyo and the researchers, Yoichiro Takai and Teruyuki Yoshino, also went on to show that ethanol induced an increase in cholesterol, triglycerides and triglyceride uptake from liver cells. In contrast, four other papers \u2014 Mr. Masashi Ono, Tadanori Goto, Katsuya Fukushima and Koshifumi Nakao, and Mr. Homayoon Ahmad of National Center for Pharmaceutical Sciences \u2014 had similar findings. (3)<p>Information on the link between diabetes, high blood pressure and alcohol is currently very difficult to obtain. So they went on to study the effect of ethanol in liver cells of people with high cardiovascular heart disease, also called high triglycerides (<a href=\"http://www.scientificalliance.com/content/10.1054/SIOMI.67342862\">http://www.scientificallian...</a> ).<p>The authors compared the effect of ethanol in liver cells to what you see when sugar was in the liver cells (without glucose) as a sugar dump (<a href=\"http://www.videohealthcare.com/seed.php\">http://www.videohealthcare....</a>?) and to sugar again and caffeine. They confirmed that ethanol did not cause liver cell breakdown and sugar uptake. But they used 12 to 24 parts per million ethanol instead of 9.4 ppm.
