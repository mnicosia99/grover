{"title": "Photomaging and progenitor cell signalling: a new paradigm and signaling system for cancer", "authors": "Dr. Brian Hunter DDS Tami Warren Sierra Hill Lauren Myers James Gibbs", "published_date": "05-25-2017", "affiliation": "California State University-Northridge, School of Cognitive Science", "text": "This paper introduces most detailed theoretical framework for progenitor photomaging signalling. At the same time, it underlines why well-studied photomaging mechanisms are not sufficient by themselves to solve the known human cancer-cell problems. A fundamental technique of this kind is Sperbiana Neutron scattering (SNS), like the one discussed here. SPSA was designed to concentrate Sperbiana neutrons in specific places in tissue, so that instead of being scattered through whole tissue, they are resolved to a specific optical location. To do so, SPSA-tailored lesion cells are implanted in place of normal cells. Instead of dividing normally, these modified cells persist as SPS-marked lesions. The mutation that the disease cell acquired depends on the position of its SPS lesion, and on how it values the acquired characteristic.<p>In this paper, Weixun Yeo and Zander Sattler introduce a new communication paradigm of the disease-cell and the cell-signaling molecular pattern it constructs, a new Sperbiana proton-rich plasma phosphorylation environment, and activate there Sperbiana-signalled tissue lesions through proteins that phosphate photovoltaic photosystemic photokines. In both cases, they show that tumor cells are driving the abnormal cell behavior.<p>This paper describes two important sources of cell-signaling for prostate cancer and other cancers. While a cell-signaling strategy is already being applied in prostate cancer, the authors suggest that notch signaling should also be considered as an important activator of cancer-cell growth."}
