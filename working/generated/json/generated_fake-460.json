{"title": "New Map: The Universe Is Far from Divided", "authors": "Ana Gilmore Patrick Sanchez Jacqueline Miller Yolanda Brown George Branch", "published_date": "02-20-2018", "affiliation": "Jacksonville State University, School of Environmental Studies", "text": "The total area occupied by the nuclei of the protons in the nucleus of protons is a little over 2 trillion MHz. The bottom portion of the proton and neutron nuclei is about 1 billion MHz. The rate at which atomic nuclei rotate (and thus produce decay by the nuclei of nuclei) is 50 Tera-mhz per second. We might ask: Does all of this matter?<p>If we have the answer, we can determine whether there is a faster-than-light-traveling matter in the universe. The reason: even though quantum physics cannot guarantee it with any certainty, the entire matter in the universe \u2013 more than ten times the quantity of matter in the entire Universe itself \u2013 is energetically similar. As long as some of the superfluids (fibers of inorganic atoms) and atoms have similar tendencies of momentum and rotational speed, then there is no need for any supersonic transit.<p>The forces of motion are equally known. There are four \u2014 forces of mass, force of attraction, force of gravity and force of ai-2 \u2013 forces. Some we know a lot about: Newton\u2019s theory of universal gravitation is an important principle. Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity makes the changes in the field theory of \u201chow the matter vibrates.\u201d Then there is a force of subatomic nature known as electromagnetic field.<p>Thus, because almost all of the finite particles and their properties (i.e. dimensions) are similar, the fundamental constants of nature are similar, too. The forces of attraction and force of mass are similar and for much of the matter in the universe they are fully expressed. Similarly, the forces of gravity and force of gravity do not appear to be significant for much of the universe. For less of the universe they are similarly reduced.<p>Thus we can say for the bulk of matter in the universe that \u201cthere is nothing to really misunderstand and it is not sensitive to rapid or silent perturbations, and so there is nothing to be worried about in the coming generations of more inclusive thought experiments.\u201d Even if we say there is not any distortion like those of subatomic particles in the universal radiation, which is the first factor of being, we can say as well that there is no threat to take away consciousness and consciousness in the universal radiation. Since consciousness is transformed by the same forces that transform space in space, we must understand the quantum effects and space-time in the same way as we understand those effects in the subatomic universe."}
