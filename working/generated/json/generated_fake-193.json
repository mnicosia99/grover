This is yet another development that strengthens the recent scientific evidence that ethanol is harmful to humans, although there is still debate among different countries regarding how effective ethanol is in mitigating emissions. But that\u2019s not all! The team also found that a similar effect was observed in men and women.<p>The study is showing clear evidence that liver damage is due to ethanol consumption as in humans. Until now, researchers had thought that by-products of alcohol metabolism were the main cause of liver toxicity. The liver is an organ organ that metabolizes and removes toxins from the body, and ethanol happens to be a toxin.<p>According to study leader Tono M. Takenama, \u201cThe protective properties of red wine and beer, as well as tea\u201d are no longer valid. \u201cThe clearer wateriness of red wine and beer and the skimmed milk\u201d, the research team wrote in a report in the International Journal of Toxicology last April. \u201cMoves by different countries to ban or restrict use of ethanol may offer a window of opportunity to evaluate the full potential of ethanol consumption.\u201d<p>The team are inviting other researchers to discover more data and evaluate further work. \u201cWe want our people to start re-evaluating the relationship between ethanol consumption and liver damage. The regulators must also draw up policies and stricter limits on ethanol consumption.\u201d<p>Source: International Journal of Toxicology"}
