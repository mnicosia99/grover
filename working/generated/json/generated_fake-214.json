Read her response to the article and to the comments.<p>So why is drinking ethanol such a big deal? Like any industrial and agricultural process, the use of ethanol as a transportation fuel and heating fuel also involves the use of cyanide to kill the beneficial bacteria that produce ethanol. However, even without using such toxic heavy metals, ethanol releases all sorts of toxins. It\u2019s these toxins that are affecting many animals and plants around the world, causing damage and altered gene expression, all leading up to \u201cThe Shame of the Paradise.\u201d [16] When a plant is exposed to this toxic compound, its entire genome is degraded and die rapidly. The result is loss of its ability to produce food. That means if this happens to a wild type fruit, you could kill the fruit and nothing will grow around it again.<p>Ethanol production, already in abundance worldwide, is now spreading to many more fields, disrupting the annual and seasonal food cycles, and polluting the atmosphere with huge amounts of smog. The increased use of ethanol means that we will lose even more things, like pollinator species of many wild plants (many endangered in the US), bees, and other birds. And yes, we are all doing it to ourselves.<p>\u201cMeanwhile, those who support ethanol use argue that the harvesters have extracted the most harmful elements before their genes were destroyed and their genes killed. If that\u2019s the case, then aren\u2019t we the ones responsible for destroying nature?\u201d Robert Richter, Opponents of Ethanol"}
