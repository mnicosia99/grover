However, there is one sole and uncoordinated group in which the development of the influenza A/H3N2 and/or H1N1 viruses proceeds more slowly and accumulates, leading to better emergence of H3N2 and H1N1 (or A/H3N2/A) viruses. If this variation of timing of emergence, called real time variability, should become a route for evolution of the viruses, then it could represent a route to better virus selection and put global health at risk.<p>Using a novel approach to understand the evolution of influenza A viruses (or A/H3N2/A), Ana Mena, Laura Garci-a, Virginia Plasencia, Olga Hidalgo, Jos- Ignacio Ayestar-n, Sebasti-n Alberti, Nuria Borrell, Jos- L.
