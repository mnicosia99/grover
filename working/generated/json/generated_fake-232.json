{"title": "Humanization of Chemicals, SPRPs and PARP: An Interview With Dr. Gillians Bond and Dr. Orli Binyamin", "authors": "Thomas Allen Jeremy West Michelle Rasmussen Edward Jimenez Gregory Klein", "published_date": "09-23-2018", "affiliation": "University of Southern California, School of Chemistry", "text": "Introduction<p>Humanization of chemical compounds (other than energy, food, or water) through mutations within the DNA like in vaccines) \u2013 takes the form of skin cells (like in the measles), oocytes (like in vaccines), and blood stem cells (like in STENiT), etc., using some of these self-replicating human cells as a proxy in drug design. The U.S. has a number of high profile programs in several major cancer indications. The USA uses these \u201chumanized\u201d cells as control organisms in drug design, and has filed multiple patent claims on these cells.<p>In the presentation, I will review basic data on how prPST and PARP/PK have been used in the therapeutic use of a number of anti-cancer drugs which have been approved in the USA, and then discuss with you questions that might be relevant to your practice as an oncologist.<p>Consider this question:<p>Are injectable autologous tissues the most effective way to address the problem of tumors dying from conventional chemotherapeutic drugs? Are humanized or gene-self replicating STENiT cell tissues for therapeutic use better than organ- and solid organ-derived or CAR-1 cells, respectively? Which of these is more efficient in meeting the goal of enhancing the survival of the tumor?<p>The answer has to do with the different storage requirements of each tissue type, the heterogeneous composition of each cell type, the different storage chemistry in each cell type, the main clinical significance of each method of drug discovery, and the different considerations of the success rate of the agent using the respective research approach.<p>Questions to be answered:<p>Do all those same reasons exist for choosing prPST versus PARP/PK as drug development approaches?<p>What is the difference between the three cell types and how do they fulfill their respective roles as the surrogate material used to test new anti-cancer drugs?<p>How is the lymphocyte tissue, whether it be STENiT or autologous tumor cells, different from blood stem cells as the surrogate material used for drug design?<p>How are the DROPT-and tumor cells different from tissue types which are kinetically stimulated?<p>If DROPT-and cell type LIVERE-and tissue types primarily prostate and hepatocellular carcinoma, are they better than DROPT-and tumor cells and lymphocytes for drug development?<p>How are DROPT-and tumor cells different from tissue types, such as pancreatic, and leukemia cells?<p>Do disease classes which are dependant on chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cancer, affect their drug selection process any differently than does a disease class dependent on other drugs?<p>3 points to note about the drugs:<p>Chemical classes using humanized versions of human cells should be used cautiously.<p>The drug design process should take into account the storage demands, heterogeneous nature of different cell types, and differences in the signal processing among all cells, as these factors affect their similarity, diversity, and both the successes and failures of the drug<p>Look at both the drug and the other tissue type.<p>Personalize the approach."}
