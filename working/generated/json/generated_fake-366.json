I drink lots of water, eat a lot of fiber-rich foods and I exercise every day, but it still happens. I will try to maintain my metabolism and my energy level if I can. Would you tell me how to fight this? \u2013 The Lactose Resistance Paradox<p>First of all, you\u2019re right. Your metabolism slows down when you eat a lot of fiber-rich foods like fruits and vegetables. Fats, on the other hand, have no bearing on your metabolism. It\u2019s healthy to eat healthy, whole foodstuffs like whole-grain breads, eggs, and tuna fish and others. Eating a lot of protein can work to slow down your metabolism because the digestion of protein takes longer than your digestion of other foods. And it\u2019s true that you should exercise at least five times a week, but studies show that exercise is not as critical for living healthily as carbohydrates, fruits, and vegetables. You also have to remember that your metabolism only works as long as you have enough energy. If you start suffering from fatigue, fatigue is likely to lead to weight gain or worse, to obesity, which is very detrimental to health.<p>The reason your metabolism slows down with fiber-rich foods is because of the content of insoluble fiber and insoluble fiber. The main soluble fibre is the bran fibre, which is simple and soluble. The major insoluble fiber is the fibres found in fruits and vegetables. When your digestion of fruits and vegetables stops working properly, your body begins to lose weight and your metabolism slows down. When the digestive system works properly, your body can easily digest insoluble fibres and you can continue to remain active.<p>What can you do about this? You don\u2019t have to stop eating fruits and vegetables, especially fruits, as they still increase your metabolic rate. Focus on consuming more fruits and vegetables, which means eating them at appropriate times and in quantities. Eating bran at bedtime will help you not to gain weight and also prevent you from developing a headache. Flaxseed also helps prevent fatigue so that your digestive system functions properly.<p>Bottom line: Improve your digestion and your metabolism. Add more soluble fibre to your diet. A little bit goes a long way. You can reduce the likelihood of a large weight gain by not getting sick.<p>For more information about our Food and Nutrition Guides, please visit: <a href=\"http://afsn.ky\">http://afsn.ky</a>"}
