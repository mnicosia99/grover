Found in both male and female areas of the body, the cancer can travel to many parts of the body including the brain, the bone, the stomach, the lungs, and the intestines. It is categorized into two main types: (I) soft tissue sarcoma and (II) bone sarcoma. Since there is no effective treatment, all treatment options are being explored.<p>Sp is a regulator of cell proliferation, which allows new cell (i.e. an embryo) to form. It plays an important role in the differentiation of mature cells into specific cell types (i.e. a nucleus of a cancer cell will turn into a cell which becomes a cancer cell). Cell proliferation can be inhibited by inhibiting Sp (primary inhibitory factors of assembly of budding cells).<p>The Sp transcription factors (Sp) and methylation of Sp transcription factors (Sp kinases) controls pluripotency, which means that this transcription factor inhibits expression of growth factors necessary for cell survival. Therefore, if Sp does not have an additional workhorse regulator of growth factors, it will not be able to effect cell survival.<p>In BK, neutrophils (endothelial cells) were induced at rest in peritoneal cells with sp and then inhibited in parallel with deoxysin (neutrophil arrest toxins), stopping all other cell proliferation. The common ratio of human leukocytes was identical for all 3 subsets of cells in the experiments and in combination with the nucleotides that bind to Sp and to the locus of tumor cells.<p>While study showing inhibitions of T-lymphocytes (e.g. bregacy) in orthologous liver cancer cells did not occur, the unexpected and promising finding of suppressing glioma progenitor cells was considered.<p>In this study, non-tumorigenic and hyper-tumorigenic cells were selectively inhibited by Sp and KiB and in combination with methylation-associated autophagy process. It was observed that the efficiency of suppression of growth potential was higher in cancer cells and they have a higher concentration of genes that had no function in normal cells, indicating that these suppressor cells prevent proliferation in invasive cells.<p>The intrinsic function of one of the most important Sp transcription factors, CDAP, was observed to be very low in these cells. On the other hand, a transcription factor (Sp) had a greater expression of CDAP than KiB and fused with CDAP and reduced CDAP expression in the hepatocytes. Thus, in tissues with abundant proteins in the proximal endosome/cortices, Sp transcription factor was most stable in this region, indicating that Sp transcription factor was a primary inhibitory factor of progenitor cells.<p>Surprisingly, Sp/KiB enzyme was found to regulate carbohydrate, VLDL/i90, as a growth factor which had a positive relationship with cancer cell growth and invasion.<p>Overall, this findings show the function of Sp transcription factors in cancer cells and the efficacy of inhibition of them via blocking the CDAP and KiB enzymes. It shows that targeting Sp/KiB could be advantageous in disallowing cell invasion and accelerating the time to local therapy in an in situ setting."}
