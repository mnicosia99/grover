{"title": "The Structural and Mimetic Mechanisms of One Monooxygenase II (LIF2), and the Use of a New Direct Linking Factor (Sy004) In Cerebral Apoptosis", "authors": "Travis Black Jeffrey Phillips", "published_date": "09-03-2017", "affiliation": "Alabama State University, School of Computer Science", "text": "At this stage, however, we need to understand the specific signaling mechanisms of the two isozyme Isozymes behind the enhanced production of lipids. As we can see from the graph below, there is a predominantly chemical interaction between SY005 and a complex component of the LIF2 region, but in turn, it appears to carry out a \u201ccoherent\u201d signaling in the heat transfer mRNA of the LIF gene: The two biomolecules know which other molecules are on the cell membrane and therefore react using the associated receptor to interact with the LIF gene.<p>Further, the use of a novel switching mechanism developed by James Scholz and colleagues as seen in the above research can also play a role in this heterogeneous signaling (see Fig 2). As we can see, LIF2 signals distinct signals to the ProPDPC, appearing to be receptive to the positive binding of SY005 on acetyl cholesteryleucone under different binding levels, one of which can lead to the secretion of high levels of lipids from the microenvironment.<p>On the basis of these data and our recent study (dubbed \u201cDiscovery\u201d), we think that we are beginning to understand the dynamics of the developmental processes for this novel yeast housing and ultimately may lead to a more elaborate view of how a cell maintains its biofunctional functionality and in turn, maybe a better understanding of disorders where lipids get elevated, for example, neurodegenerative disease."}
