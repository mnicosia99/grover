Public Advocate, Ralph Nader urged his colleagues in Congress to investigate the junk science that drives electronic headphones. Outrage was also directed at big tobacco companies and in the ensuing investigation, the culprit came forward as being large malls like the one in New York. Then why wasn\u2019t this never used in portraying cars\u2019 environmental threats as being absolutely out of control?<p>A few years ago, the law enforcement tried to convince the public that CDs were hazardous to one\u2019s health. Don\u2019t even think of driving around with LPs on because the evidence suggests the company\u2019s actual concern for its own popularity. They quite literally spread hysteria to get people to go for theirs. It must have been a move in defense of its own interests. They became a major nuisance to music lovers around the world. Then with regards to the headphone, where the folks in the Industry admitted that the electrical bill for the mall amounts to 20-30 % higher than what it normally is, with increasing in its aesthetic degradation and the mega chance of psychological brain damage, i.e. \u201cpost-concussive brain\u201d symptoms.<p>Medicality is limited to locality, to cities and states, to sub-atomic particles and whatever is in between. Movies, books, movies, TV etc don\u2019t matter much anyway, as far as doctors are concerned. I cannot agree to Dr. Sam Harris, who has declared the mass media a cancer cell because it is destructive to our social capital, making us believe some very absurd lines that jibe up to the imaginings of sick and mentally challenged individuals. But he could be right if he were to oppose a state supported headphone system that blows massive amounts of electricity along with the music from the air and over the heads of millions of people all over the world."}
