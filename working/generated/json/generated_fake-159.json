In Japan alcohol abuse is a widespread problem. Although there is disagreement about whether alcohol contributes to this or whether it is because a large percentage of the population have already been exposed to drinking at a young age, some point to over-consumption as the major cause of the liver damage. There is a link between alcohol consumption and neuronal degeneration, a particular type of cell death. Therefore, protecting the liver from alcohol damage would be a very good means to curb alcohol abuse. Dr. Taku Inokuchi from Kansai University and Dr. Tuneyoshi Ka and Dr. Yuji Moriwaki from Keio University investigated whether higher alcohol intake could be associated with the higher occurrence of alcohol-induced neural degeneration. A population-based study of 23,390 women from Japan carried out between 1997 and 1999 was conducted. 16.3 percent of the women were found to have been dependent on alcohol and 43.4 percent had at least moderate drinking habits. The number of alcohol-induced neural degeneration cases in each of the women was reported over a five-year period: 2008-2008, 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013. Women with the highest alcohol intake were found to have the greatest incidence of alcohol-induced neural degeneration. This number was higher than the expected number. There were no differences among the three period periods between the women who had higher alcohol intake and those who had the lowest alcohol intake. These differences were observed in spite of the fact that the percentage of women who reported having alcoholic disorders declined significantly over the five-year period. This study has implications for the future of combatting alcohol abuse.
