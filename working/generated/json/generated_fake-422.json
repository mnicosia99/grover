Ibuprofen, aspirin and most anti-inflammatory drugs are potent analgesics that trigger acid-forming defects or protein injury in the ion channel membrane of the laminase (sapathyel). In addition, some substances can induce oxidative stress damage in the laminase, including a certain type of recombinant protein called MMN. The ability of the laminase to remove these elements could be quite limited. There are a couple of other catalysts that we have investigated, such as the activity of LS160 and LIF. As these factors have many different biological effects, it is hard to take a single study and use it to make an argument for or against their use in human therapeutics. Moreover, these substances may also have other effects in other cellular mechanisms. We will be starting a series of experiments to investigate whether these substances could promote laminase-induced injury through other mechanisms as well."}
