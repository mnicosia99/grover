The efficacy of novel non-cyclic TK technology (Anti-Amirex-T) in improving survival of acute polyphagia patients is demonstrated by an epidemiologic prospective clinical trial involving 21 patients.<p>As a replacement for conventional treatment for acute polyphagia, antibody therapies have been reported to be more effective than traditional therapies. Anti-KS antagonist and immunoglobulin therapy in a hospital setting were evaluated for the treatment of acute polyphagia, the latter consisting of acute polyphagia from severe septic shock and acute polyphagia from moderate to septic. In the first hospital setting in Japan, patients with acute polyphagia from septic shock were treated with anti-KS antagonist and received anti-vesin in accordance with traditional administration in both the first stage and continuous cancer treatment stage. The second hospital setting included the management of septic patients with acute polyphagia from moderate to severe septic shock.<p>We describe a 12-hour period postprocedure survival of patients treated with anti-KS antagonist and anti-vein formation factor and report an improvement in outcome of acute polyphagia patients who had undergone surgery following gastroenterological ultrasound for acute polyphagia. The control group also improved, but on average not as much. Although compared with traditional therapy, Ant-Amirex-T improved survival and related morbidity."}
