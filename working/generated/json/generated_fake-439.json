{"title": "Octa4A Virus Influences Infants for Carcinogenesis - Exclusive Global Research", "authors": "Lauren Keller Brad Lee Ivan Simmons Mary Roberts Christopher Decker", "published_date": "04-23-2019", "affiliation": "University of California-Irvine, School of Economics", "text": "Octa4A is a hypothetical that is in part based on the quorca HA1a and HA1b viruses or the flagellin and leukocyte (leukocyte inflammation) viruses and so on, described below.<p>Further, a high probability aiterated of the syndrome (high leukocyte antigen count, high blood cell count, life time is 11-15 years, ten spleen transplantations (1/3 of the test subjects).<p>The virus shows ASD-like characteristics and infection with the Octa4A virus (1) increases development of congenital anomalies in the fetus, and (2) also with the neuronal cells. Infact, prof. Pechie, considered this virus as a cause for congenital atrophy in the fetus of animals.<p>A child is three times more likely to develop a congenital abnormality if the mother infected during pregnancy with Octa4A virus, compared to normal mother, (2) and one of the major factors that could lead to a pathology of viarthionic disorder later in life are the viruses detected in the child\u2019s blood or brain of the developing fetus of the child born of an Octa4A infected mother.(3)<p>Octa4A virus spreads via means of spermathecidin, another protein (pathogen vs protective agent), which it utilizes to induce it in humans. (4) Thus, one of the things that are major difficulties to measure is how viral load is reduced in the mouse given the existence of spermathecidin accumulation in the blood of the mouse. There are many cases of spermathecidin cell overgrowth in which Virus appears to be suppressed in mice (6), but these cases are not apparent in humans.<p>An important question is whether the immune system reacts to vaccinations. As the population is increasing with the rising vaccination rate, understanding the antibodies produced by vaccines and antiviral response of humans are important to identifying the fate of immunocompromised patients. The hypothesis that Octa4A virus could be present in persons receiving vaccinations is also a plausible and important hypothesis.(3)<p>For more details including a document on Novavax one can read <a href=\"http://www.novavax.com/\">http://www.novavax.com/</a><p>(1) Nadia Gabler, 6\u2032oB = 0, ALS = Effect in Beta-hominin, 9\u2032 oB = 8% of the mean load of Octa4A virus, 20\u2032 oB = 2.8%, Novavax data submitted.<p>(2) Professor Peguet in the journal Vaccines & Biologicals no. 7 (11) published 1991, 05 MAR 9514.
