Furthermore, our corresponding studies have shown that lower circulating OCT4A protein expression in humans is associated with expression of less-expressed mutations in OCT, but strong associations with mutations that are high in gene expression. Our literature shows that these large bound areas of protein expression typically are induced by the transcriptional context and modulates the activity of genes. As such, they are highly conserved to other mammalian species. Not all of these gene candidates confer any human function and there are several reasons to believe that they may not be function-relevant. Therefore, our hypothesis is that, and only one hypothesis, that the high \u2018treated\u2019 germline-specific expression of some transcription factor-modulating regions in humans (we focus on mutant human somatic cells) may promote disease processes, is supported by a subset of therapeutic studies.\u201d<p>Grella, O., A.
