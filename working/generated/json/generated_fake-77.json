As an analyst, you cannot also say anything about this event without the involvement of some official sources. They do not know and do not have the genetic evidence that the same type of disease could infect thousands of people in Argentina.<p>The following information is a statement that represents only the first component. But the scientific background of these facts is also very important.<p>\u201cIn April 25th 2011, it was revealed that the sample of bacteria from an Argentine patient who died in Germany was similar to infection with K. Klebsiella. The same bacterium had been found in several epidemiological studies taken in Argentina, including one conducted in May 2001 by the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Buenos Aires. The bacterium was identified as a suitable model of pathogen for human disease, for E. coli bacteria and K. Klebsiella.<p>To date, since the outbreak, the Department of Health of Argentina has confirmed 20 confirmed cases of E. coli\u2026 \u201c<p>See (Hites et al., 39 Aggrevazabal Diaz Cristo (2000) Biol Sci. 43, Book 3, pp. 385-476.)"}
