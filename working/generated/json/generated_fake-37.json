{"title": "Antibiotic Resistance by Antimicrobial Resistance Reduction Correlates and Microbial Contamination Strategies in Neonatal Care Settings", "authors": "Randy Blackwell Matthew Rodriguez Eileen Moore Bridget Rosales Kathryn Webster", "published_date": "11-22-2019", "affiliation": "Tuskegee University, School of Environmental Studies", "text": "This paper looks at the bacterial pathogen chains to provide the mechanism to detect the variations in the clinical course by exposure or dosage.<p>The paper provides a hierarchical molecular stratification model consisting of antimicrobial resistance reduction curves followed by a periodicity of shifting of resistance by every day within a periodicity of 2-3 hours. In this model the following explanatory factors are chosen: the first factor is the bacterial species frequency, the second factor is microbial concentration, the third factor is interrelationship with antimicrobial agents in the environment and also the effect of human interactions in determining the exposure-pathogenicity with human bloodborne infections. The model provides an unbiased framework to perform a spectrum relation for detection of the relative dependence of antibiotic resistance by pattern signature. The curve vectors for rapid detection were used by the authors as a preference for a clinical sample for under-studying, and so samples for neonatal mucosal cultures in neonatal incubators and acute bronchitis maternal milk (AMN) therapy isolates as the comparable samples.<p>The detailed analysis of the measured antibiotic resistance in the diaglobulin column was performed with the availability of the antibiotics listed in the pay wall. The available data were converted into phylogenetic sequence and phylogenetic markers using the Xegene adservix gene sequencing approach and shows that certain bacterial species divide further for secondary migration by different exposure-pathogenicity. Based on detailed genetic reconstructions and epidemiological framework, the differentiated identification of the pathogenicity of the polyobiotic environments in a similar pattern.<p>We have shown the hypothesis to validate through multivariate regression analysis (given by 2-3 logistic regression algorithm) the signal to noise ratio for the levels of susceptibility of various pathogens presenting within the neonatal spectrum and antibiotics ingested in humans. That has a substantial influence on predicting the relative dependence of antibiotic resistance by pattern signature."}
