Garmory<p>Since the introduction of The Hidden Torch in the USSR in 1985, Elena Khodorkovsky, Mordechai Vanunu, and Adolph Bergman have all been branded with the Stalin\u2019s\u2019s and Trotsky\u2019s colors. Each one is accused of being \u201cexamples of one of the four evils\u201d in Soviet Russia. This weapon is kept in a conservative\u2019s deep freezer where it can be released whenever political notions gain prominence. The black image of injustice, self-righteousness, vengefulness, and injustice is based on bogus judgements being presented by committee (termed \u201csocialist jurists\u201d in the USSR) and blanket and use. The long history of Nikita Khrushchev and Stalin show that the \u201cdispenser of justice\u201d wanted to enter the Holy Trinity of Christ, Israel, and Communism. His main crime was to not do so fast enough to save him from the too-close-to-home prisons that awaited him.<p>Sven Goran Eriksson is the latest Soviet expatriate to be labeled an enemy of the People and employed as a political tool in the public arena. Right-wing pundit Dennis Prager argued on the Oprah Winfrey Show that Eriksson, an activist in promoting human rights in the Soviet Union, must have some sort of bi-polar disorder for him to be supporting human rights in the Soviet Union. He argues that black justice is the same as white justice and can only exist in one place at one time, the USA. He also says that the children of US Presidents are, in most cases, anti-communist demagogues whose political careers have been wiped out with their anti-communist fervor.<p>Then in 2001 Eriksson wrote an article, \u201cHow I Became Enemy of the People.\u201d The article was published in Foreign Policy magazine and the Washington Post. This is the motive behind his fear of McCarthyism in the US and the revival of Eriksson, the deadcomer from the late 1970s who is now found on the right side of history. Unfortunately, the friends of Stalin all over America are a miscellany in this regard.<p>In December of 2011 Eriksson wrote an article titled \u201cThe Political Spook Behind My New Remarks.\u201d He calls on the Western society to address the old evil of Nazism. In his opinion \u201c[we] must be careful of attempts to silence our voices\u201d in a country that he says values freedom as much as other nations, and thus spends dollars on George Soros. Mr. Soros only uses his money for the good of humanity, just like Soros, MK, and many others do.<p>Elena Khodorkovsky was a human rights campaigner. She stood up for common people in Kazakhstan, particularly from ethnic Russians. She called for openness and dignity and discussed issues of conflict resolution. She often put herself in the line of fire for doing so, she eventually was assassinated. Unfortunately, her voice has no defenders in the West today. Unlike just about everything else in the world, the last thing a Westerner wants to say is that she is a Sovietist. The fact that she was not is not enough to justify her murder but certainly not enough for freedom loving people to attack the entire Kremlin apparatus for killing her.<p>Yet, she was, in a way, to be blamed for the demise of the Soviet Union by influencing the young in the West to support communism and/or her cause. This puts people like Vladamir Litvinenko, Yelena Bonner, and Steven Hill at the bottom of the food chain of political authority in this country. There are the always apolitical Americans who support Death to America, Vietnam Veterans Against the War, Iraq Veterans Against the War, and so on. But then there are the few who care about the color of capitalism and free speech that they got before capitalism by supporting the statist principles of the World Bank, IMF, and World Trade Organization. Then there are those on the right and left who hate Stalin and support the Soviet Union and those who love Stalin and despise America and their values in order to present themselves as \u201cindependent\u201d of the old order. They both fall short on the principles of free speech, which is essential to any meaningful society. The attempt to discredit and bully people like Mr. Eriksson is a vicious thing.<p>Michael Waters"}
