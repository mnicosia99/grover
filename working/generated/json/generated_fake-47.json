The scientists investigating the evolutionary history of the Sumerian orangutans have examined what their lab research, in a single dish environment, reveals about the phylogenetic complex of the species.<p>The team of archaeoanthropologists, researchers in biodiversity biology, animal behavior science and computer data analysis, used the Cota database, an interdisciplinary online data management system. One of its most popular features is the 24-way interactive computer time-stamping system (CT@SW) that allows instantaneous analysis of data in a mouse-oversize dish and allows researchers to compare notes, especially in complex statistical analyses.<p>In the experiment, teams from Rethwang University and the University of Naples Federico II, both of Italy, and Universidade Federal de S\u00e3o Paulo (UFS) in Brazil, undertook the aim of examining changes in the anthropoid genome when exposed to a variety of factors in their anthropoid ancestor\u2019s environment.<p>\u201cThe timeframe for the study lasted from October 2006 to October 2009. The anthropoids placed in their dish originated from the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington DC and from Parkland Museum and Botanical Gardens, Dallas, Texas.\u201d says the researcher, Antonio Oliver Faria.<p>\u201cAnimals were first exposed to levels similar to those found in the museum\u2019s aviaries and were then placed in a heat-stable, tri-layered media that was 4 feet (1 meter) high, 29 feet (9 meters) wide and 28 feet (8 meters) long. Human information was inserted into the data on these animals. The result of the study was observed 40 times. This data analysis was by way of comparing the computed results from the mouse-insect-brain dish with those published by the Harvard Terrestrial Conservation Genetics group.\u201d<p>\u201cThe show results demonstrate that many aspects of the global environment, first identified by ornithologists, influenced the structure and function of the fossil ancestry, the first non-human ancestor of the [Avian] African and Asian Primates. This knowledge led us to identify anomalies found in the genetic structure of the first non-human ancestor of the African and Asian Primates. We could distinguish and identify the introduction of the Asians and African primates as the significant influences found.\u201d<p>Noteworthy also is the data about the evolution of the genetic make-up from five groups of archaeological remains. \u201cFirst, Eurasian African Primates, found from Java, Sumatra, and Sumatra. Second, Primates from Madagascar and Malay. Third, Apes from the range of Borneo and Indonesia. Fourth, Primates from the Paleolithic period of Mesoamerica, and fifth, Primates from the Last Ice Age. A highly significant implication of the data is a clear understanding of the problem of evolutionary evolution,\u201d says the researches.<p>On the other hand, as Faria said, \u201cAs the analysis developed, one wished to be clever with the data but be aware that there may be many alternatives from which to choose. Sometimes, alternatives were found from both sides.\u201d"}
