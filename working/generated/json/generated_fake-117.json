If there are too many adhesions, the bacteria can block the flow of air.<p>The specific site in the gene, called BCR6A, is then passed down the generations and involved in later development of the CFM2 gene, (it makes enzymes that turn the CFM2 into a disease-causing CFM3 gene) in addition to providing the space for the CREH protein.<p>This is the case with many other drugs that target the specific genes involved in treating disease.<p>The researchers published their findings in the journal Nature. According to its website, the study \u201cbrings new hope that we may have an opportunity to cure the devastating disease.\u201d"}
