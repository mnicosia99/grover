{"title": "Vaccine Investor: Cancer in the Blood System \u2013 The Sun may not rise, but it might!", "authors": "Felicia Rodriguez Steven Delgado Kimberly Martinez Lauren West Carol Lee", "published_date": "08-25-2014", "affiliation": "Concordia University-Irvine, School of Mathematics", "text": "Spreading the word on the anti-vaxx front is a tall order, especially considering the boiling controversy that vaccines are running at the moment. Even by the standards of the madcap, anti-vaxx environment that most of us have come to accept, it is probably the craziest thing that I have ever read or heard come across (cough, cough) \u2014 a supplement for certain cancers (ingested full, untastemakers-with-the-draws-too-expensive-to-expect-nowhere and selectively), and a bicycle to get around people who lack a compass?<p>I don\u2019t want to go out on a limb and say the answer to all that is probably \u201cnone of the above\u201d but the folks at Compugen seem to have a few off-the-wall ideas coming out, like this seemingly ingenious, but seemingly pie-in-the-sky idea. You can read about this in their new book \u201cVaccine Investor\u201d. The idea behind this new approach is that all cancers really form a secondary tumour of the blood system \u2014 a blood cancer. Not that there is a general aversion to such \u201cdirty water\u201d but there are a lot of reasons to be scared of it.<p>These blood cancers are thought to stem from a surge of untreatable hemoglobin or white blood cells in the bloodstream of our immune system. An autoimmune attack? Looking at the trademark Toll-like receptor 5 proteins in the bloodstream (and in malignant cells in the tumor, note) one can draw conclusions. In the near to medium term the anti-vaxx crowd are going to have a significant argument here; if I read the Compugen description of this strategy correctly, this will actually help the anti-vaxx crowd counter the currently touted conventional vaccine theory. Of course, this is all based on only a few pieces of an explanation so it is just speculation at this stage."}
