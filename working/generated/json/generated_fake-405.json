The report published in Preventive Medicine suggests that for a single therapy with a carrier protein, monoclonal antibodies are the most effective for acute polyphagia. Due to the large and hard-to-treat patient population, however, administration of a single antibody therapy on a high dosage for individuals with chronic polyphagia is not recommended.<p>Through studies at TAKIRI Medical Center in collaboration with Surakususho Kuichi University, the researchers tested several patient candidates in the plural structure to estimate their monoclonal antibody concentration. Results suggest that in more than 90% of patients, the most accurate is the monoclonal antibody injection at the highest dose in the proportion of the individual protein-coupled effects. The most amenable patients would be those with high protein-coupled antibodies, those with bipolar disease, and those with polymyalgia rheumatica. But, as a part of the control group for those patients with monoamine oxidase deficiency, low plasma concentrations have almost no effect. The results of the study suggest that in combination monoclonal antibodies with photodynamic therapy for acute polyphagia could at the most provide no benefit over photodynamic therapy alone.<p>For acute polyphagia, dosing the carrier protein construct RBP2 with an antibody will have the highest effect. But, according to this study, there is no evidence to predict if dosing the carrier protein construct TFA1 would have the highest or the least effect. In this case, most effective therapy would be antinuclear treatment, but because there are no demonstrated effects of TFA1 on monoclonal antibodies, antinuclear treatment in the case of polymyalgia rheumatica must be rejected as a potential treatment."}
