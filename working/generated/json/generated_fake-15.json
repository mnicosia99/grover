The task of RNA polymerase Alfa is to secrete complete RNA transcripts from RNA. As the RNA polymerase does this, it locks fragments of a diseased RNA around proteins, located where each transduced RNA is deposited in the cell, through process of polyadenylation (clearning of all the residues in the DNA by sequestering the harmful RNA fragments). With the large number of larger complex transduced RNAs under polyadenylation, this functions of this enzyme efficiently, leading to the integrity of RNA throughout the cell. Without their significantly efficient function, a reduction in polyadenylation reaction will take place since RNA polymerase Alfa will not be able to release nearly all the mRNA fragments, thus eliminating cell function and quality. Since the use of polyadenylation is preferred to deletions/mutations and prolonged polyadenylation reactions are commonly found in tumors, the structure of microtubule and heme structures can be studied to find a direct link between the activation and termination reactions of polyadenylation on heme proteins and polyadenylation of other proteins. Furthermore, it is established that the effect of polyadenylation depends on the formation of two oxygen-sensing chromatin orders to prolong polyadenylation reaction, at the same time on the accumulation of damaged materials around polyadenylated RNAs. Polyadenylation thus acts as a key mediator and regulator of the formation of surrounding material as well as the rapidly dividing DNA of the genome. A current study has identified which factors support the long-lived polyadenylation reaction that is common in heme-transposable proteins (htPs) such as Mcl-ad111 and Jos-ducoprotein. They were also able to identify several effects (such as restoration of heme biosynthesis) by deactivating polyadenylation.<p>Background<p>The protein heme-transporter, kiterin deoxyphosphatase 4 (Kp4), is critical to the proliferation of heme-transposable proteins (htPs). Studies have shown that the introduction of htPs results in reduced heme biosynthesis, but how htPs differentiate from normal heme biosynthesis is not known. 1,2 Also, the catalytic capacity of heme-transporters differs between heme and heme-transporters. For example, in this study, researchers are able to identify several factors that support and support the long-lived polyadenylation reaction that is common in heme-transposable proteins (htPs). These factors include inhibiting the cell from killing damaged polyadenylated regions, aromatase and enhancer serine synthase.3,5 Physiological and structural studies of m(3), a knockdown protein with an increased ability to survive in heme-transposable proteins (htPs), demonstrated that it is possible to restore heme biosynthesis.6 The results suggest that htPs that depend on the role of m(3) in triggering the heme biosynthesis reaction persist in the cell without losing their quality, while polyadenylated htPs commonly observed are strongly affected by polyadenylation.7,8 This is a valuable to non-htelets by suggesting that currently-available high potency inhibitors for polyadenylation may have the capacity to restore RNA quality across the cell.<p>Original Diagram"}
