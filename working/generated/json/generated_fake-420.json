Such infections are caused by a number of bacteria (some known as \u201cgarlic body\u201d and others known as \u201ckissing bug\u201d) which attack the intestinal cells of you. The presence of human intestinal bacteria are believed to partly explain the mysteries of human illness. If there is no intestinal bacteria, then your body would start to produce an odor called \u201cburnt\u201d smell or from the mushroom on the gut lining. One bacterium (mycobacterium lupulin) has spread worldwide with its two specialties \u2014lotion cells (basal keratin) and bitter moulds (dimethylamylamine). When germs invade your intestinal cells, they form bacteria skins which become black and can be seen as scaly on the skin. In the stomach, these bacteria leave red stains. Candida hides in your gut and has no effect on any other organs of the body besides being present in the intestine. However, if the infection is severe, it can cause symptoms such as fever, severe headaches, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea and vomiting.<p>In the recent year 2008, a large study reported that about 75% of people have at least one visit to the doctor annually for a \u201cRash\u201d (Cleft chin). The \u201cRash\u201d was so severe that more than 25% had lost up to a year\u2019s worth of wages each. The prevalence of Candida in cases of the \u201cRash\u201d was 51%. One suspected explanation is that these different illnesses are caused by the infection by Candida. The common association of \u201cRash\u201d and the \u201cCradle\u201d was associated with the fact that more cases of \u201cRash\u201d were identified with people who ate wheat bran and soybean during the growing season. Now in the wake of an attempt to create a cheaper wheat bran in Canada, the incidence of \u201cRash\u201d is on the rise.<p>On the other hand, while, tissue dendritic cells (DTCs) in the intestine are normally stimulating immune responses, they tend to rise up against the microbes, a little too much in those with Candida and peanut allergy, an allergy to peanut has been linked to such secretion of DTCs. In such cases, destruction of DTCs further results in certain types of illness. A recent study found that an increase in B cells in the intestinal tract around the tumor of nucleic acid DNA in the pancreas is a risk factor for an increase in the susceptibility to hepatitis C virus infection. One form of hepatitis C infection called acorn hepatitis infects parathyroid glands which is an ancestral form of another form of hepatitis.<p>Author:<p>Prabuddha Dey- Associate Professor, Dental Surgery, University of Pune<p>Monami Chakraborty- Physician, MPH & MSW,<p>Global Health expert<p>Mrinal K.
