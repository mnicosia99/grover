The Mexico-US Lawsuit against Obama, Bush and Holder, filed by Malvo, Deleon and Raygoza and issued in October by the U.S. District Court in Washington D.C., sought to address discrimination in accessing federal criminal justice.<p>President Felipe Calderon accused the U.S. government of collaborating with Mexican drug trafficking groups and of selling weapons used by the cartels during the law enforcement crackdown in 2008.<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. government regularly aids Mexico in prosecuting its criminals on its own territory, including through providing Mexico with information on its criminal masterminds and missions to capture the drug lords. U.S. Drug Enforcement Agents, who as analysts say are helping to equip the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s office to deal with the rise in homicides in Mexico, are also deployed in Mexico to inform officials.<p>According to press releases, the attorneys responsible for the case against Mexican drug traffickers arrested in the United States, Camilo Mejia and David Loya, had been in contact with gang members from Los Angeles where Mejia was captured.<p>Until 2010, the U.S. State Department\u2019s \u201cNational Strategy Against International Organized Crime\u201d supported close cooperation between the FBI and Mexican authorities and has kept the safe distance of key U.S. law enforcement officials from continuing the case against Mejia and Loya.<p>Molina Gonzalez, a Calvo attorney from Los Angeles at the time said, \u201cI think this case is a good case for immigration rights; for the rights of victims. It shows that the legal aid provided by the State Department and State Department has basically not been successful in getting convictions.\u201d<p>At the beginning of January 2006, Camilo Mejia, David Loya and Thomas Armendariz were arrested in San Diego during an operation that led to the indictments of more than 30 suspected drug traffickers.<p>Since the beginning of the crackdown in Mexico and the U.S., the cases have been stalled in an attempt to get convictions. The work of the U.S. Attorney General\u2019s \u201cProsecutorial Advisory Commission,\u201d mandated to work with Mexican authorities to cooperate in the effort to prosecute Mexican nationals, concluded this past August, and the topic has been turned to the Mexican Supreme Court.<p>A federal appeals court rejected the case this July and plans are being finalized for a federal trial against these men to begin March 18, 2012.<p>According to rights activists, including Rev. Jesse Jackson, through an ordeal that began at the port of entry in San Diego and continued to El Paso, Texas, these men suffered enough to end their lives.<p>\u201cWe were totally broken by the detention, and there was a tremendous lack of access to a lawyer,\u201d said David Aviles, attorney for Loya. \u201cBoth men were tortured before the state and justice system finally took hold.\u201d<p>The Office of the Solicitor General told the New York Times, \u201cAs for the issue of the state not using the immigration laws against foreign nationals, our records and research show that the immigration laws did not apply to these defendants in question.\u201d<p>The Attorney General did not appear at the San Francisco conference on Wednesday because he has been recovering from a skiing accident in Utah, according to The Washington Post."}
