{"title": "Airport Sensitivity to Fine particulate Matter: A Genetic Analysis", "authors": "David Myers Meghan Reed Katie King Michael Brown Karen Johnson", "published_date": "07-24-2019", "affiliation": "University of Central Arkansas, School of Cognitive Science", "text": "OpenScience.com, the non-profit science website publishing peer-reviewed open science articles, published on December 21, 2011 a paper by Mallet et al. The article offers genomic evidence that exposure to ultra-fine particulate matter from commercial airport fire boxes and bags dispersed in the air between airplanes can have a deleterious impact on various genes from individuals exposed to ultra-fine particulate matter. The paper summarizes this information by demonstrating a statistical relationship between ultra-fine particulate matter exposure and expression of certain genes in a human genome. It notes that the mechanism being explored for causality by some scientists is reflected in the effects of ultra-fine particulate matter exposure on the expression of certain genes. In addition, the paper illustrates that socio-environmental exposures can impact gene expression and the role of these environmental biomarkers in the development of diseases such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes."}
