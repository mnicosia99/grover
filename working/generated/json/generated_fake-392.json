Pazarulca, Jos- Ignacio Ayestar-n, Sebasti-n Alberti, Jos- L. P-rez, Antonio OliverW. Li, Luisa Pettacuffi and Maria Valdivia-Fuentes of Hospital Escuela Nuestro Sabin in Manaus<p>How can we prevent future antibiotic resistance due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which emerges through the a whole process of the selection of pathogens that utilize resistant gram-positive or gram-negative strains and to come to kill the resistant ones?<p>The closing of the two laboratories of the largest Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases Research Unit of the Federal University of Minas Gerais is a painful experience. In 2012, more than 85 percent of pathogens with resistance to antibiotics will be concentrated in the area. Research will require a new model of study and research conducted with speciality laboratories in order to treat the patients. To worsen matters, essential research technologies and equipment, which are unavailable in these laboratories, have been relegated to garbage pile.<p>In order to progress the health care in Amazonian communities, a critical thinking strategy is necessary. A treatment strategy, which relies on natural degradation of the strains resistant organisms, implies teaching individuals and communities how to cure the community through a community based diagnostic and preventive method. In fact, neither the government nor the academic institutions, without a concept of small-scale scientific research and evaluation, have been able to prevent the proliferation of resistant bacteria.<p>This issue deserves new treatment and evaluation model for our community-based medical systems of healthcare.<p>Acknowledgement:<p>Developed by several studies of research assistants, Central American Children with Klebsiella pneumoniae in Many or a Few Batches.

It should be mentioned that Meleia jones and her parents had been observing in their diet the emulsification of the protein E-corpinated cyanides in E-cholesterol and was somewhat aware of its effect on the diet of her out of control Klebsiella pneumoniae. On June 2, 2015, Meleia jones died, in spite of the fact that two separate studies confirmed that she was not infected with carbapenem resistance.<p>Image available: <a href=\"http://www.bigpic.com/images/wp-content/uploads/\">http://www.bigpic.com/image...</a> <a href=\"http://www.Bigpic.com/images/wp-content/uploads/\">http://www.Bigpic.com/image...</a>"}
