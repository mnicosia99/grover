These costs are relatively flat because there are high costs for using antibiotics for only the most severe infections in the short term. These costs are moderated by low costs associated with taking a course of antibiotics or using a prescription for multiple antibiotics on short term solutions. But a disease that lasts for long term can greatly offset those savings. These costs in healthcare, at home and in the marketplace, are one of the major factors that underlie the emergence of resistant pathogens.<p>A new study by scientists at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and the McGovern Institute for Brain Research, San Diego, CA, demonstrates how the genes responsible for the production of a gram-negative bacterial contaminant known as Pademonixe B have radically altered the chemical structures of these antibiotic compounds (MTX, anti-Vibrio borrelia E, and Amoxicillin) leaving bacteria ill-adapted to the chemical cues the drugs are attempting to convey. As a result, when Pademonixe B grows in cultured cells the complex molecular arrangements that the molecular machines make at the bottom of the drug release cascade undergo tremendous changes that impact the bacteria\u2019s susceptibility to antibiotics,\u201d said Laura Garci-a, who works in BUSM\u2019s Departments of Microbiology and Immunology and Pharmacology and Toxicology.<p>Using computers to quickly and efficiently identify genetic differences in the bacteria doing the bacterial biochemistry responsible for the physical changes, the researchers built a phylogenetic tree of this bacterial biome that can be used as a tool to make general predictions about how bacteria and antibiotics behave in the presence of the compounds.<p>The results of their experiments showed that once Pademonixe B grows in cultures of antibiotics it pro-cracks or cracks the cell walls of the drugs causing potent antituberculosis exposure and resistance.<p>The team of scientists at the McGovern Institute demonstrated that the amplification of Pademonixe B through viral replication can disrupt the enzymatic pathway of antibiotics that triggers the cleavage of the drugs and compound production. These complex cellular modifications induced in Pademonixe B grow well in nature and in vitro to amass large bacterial communities, suggesting a potential cause for a perturbation of the bacterial community through the agents.<p>In an article that was published recently in the open access journal PLoS ONE, they describe the influence of Pademonixe B on the quantitative effects of the MTX compound, antimicrobial compounds that inhibit cell replication and are used to treat salmonella, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other bacterial infections. The rise of Pademonixe B as a community-forming, molecule-producing, antibiotic resistent may be an emerging concept for anti-bacterial agents in the context of design and drug synthesis.<p>Given the nature of Pademonixe B\u2019s ability to disrupt drug production, producing antibiotic-resistant microbes, it is a serious concern that antibiotic-resistant bacteria are increasingly developing against antimicrobial treatments and poses public health risks. For example, in Honduras by 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was endemic with the epicenter being a surgical mask worn by hospitals staff. This was confirmed in a study by the Institute of Technology and Chemistry Research in Honduras in 2006.<p>The paper titled \u201cStructural Information about a Gram-Negative Concentrated Onset of a Carcinogenogenic Complex, and its Effect on Bacterial Resistance to Pharmaceutically Conventional Antibiotics,\u201d is available online at: <a href=\"http://plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0028443#iutemation\">http://plosone.org/article/...</a>.<p>Contact:<p>Ana Mena, (617) 632-4096"}
