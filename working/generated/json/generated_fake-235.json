With RNA, there is no need for expertise in biochemistry or genetics. Only the biology is very much human. Now scientists can genetically modify different kinds of cells for diagnosis and clinical purposes.<p>We call it \u2018RNA-based cellular disease model\u2019, a completely humanised cell, with the help of modern techniques. We can identify cancer early if there is tumour on an RNA-targeted tract.\u201d<p>-Mojca Jez (Director, Medicine Centre, Krzysztof Ziszy\u0144ski University of Medicine and Science in Krakow, Poland), at the opening plenary session of the first workshop on RNA in Cell Biology (on 8 December, the International Conference of Cell Biology 2011 in Stockholm, Sweden), delivered on 8 December 2011<p>Numerous related short-term steps have been discussed during the discussion and concluded with \u201cThe future is bright and promising: for practical applications in fighting diseases such as cancer, hepatitis B, etc., and for fundamental theoretical and theoretical research.\u201d<p>In 2008, a conference on RNA-based RNA and disease in Nature conducted by the same Research Centre of the Krzysztof Ziszy\u0144ski University of Medicine and Science in Krakow as mentioned above was held.<p>The Krzysztof Ziszy\u0144ski University of Medicine and Science in Krakow together with the Polish Academy of Sciences decided to organise the International Conference of Cell Biology 2011 on RNA in Cell Biology. The aim is to build and promote the research activity on RNA in Science, and with the help of the participants, to define a new network for more collaboration on RNA in the field of cell biology, as many of the most important scientific papers on RNA in cell biology are generated in university laboratories of cell biologists in the cell frontier countries.<p>The deadline for research proposals that can benefit from the conference is October 1, 2011, so please send all the papers on RNA in cell biology that you are planning to present to the Krzysztof Ziszy\u0144ski University of Medicine and Science in Krakow via the webiste: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/u/0/docs/documents/pdfs/spendee.sc/Docs.zip?view=up_31&amp;viewId=113695d6460f29e7c53ff1fa6fa6fa5ba.254395272963/22273474&amp;Language=SP&amp;LanguageType=English&amp;LanguageGroup=language&amp;LanguageType=geography\">https://docs.google.com/u/0...</a>"}
