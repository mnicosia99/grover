Many fans have started to change their cheers for the brand for Coca-Cola to revamp the Drink now.<p>The Coca-Cola plan to introduce their \u201cPH-Formulated Coca-Cola\u201d (PBR) in Japan. In the meantime, Coca-Cola (WAN:SCOBY) has already launched a Facebook app. The app has been launched and hopes to attract more fans for the brand who are not yet attracted to Coca-Cola drinks.<p>In Tokyo, thousands of fans rush to local Coca-Cola stores to buy the new version of Coca-Cola Classic. The stores expect the new consumers to buy bottles of PBRs. In the process, it is become very popular to yell \u201cSoju!\u201d (Egg Yolk) when buying Coca-Cola.<p>Tokyo mega-selling beer brand Tokyo Ginza (SCOBY) is already feeling the \u201cfreshness\u201d through Coca-Cola with their new Facebook app. Fans of Ginza beer often sing \u201c Soju!\u201d whenever they buy a bottle of the beer at Ginza\u2019s Coca-Cola stores.<p>This looks great for the brand! As for Coca-Cola, the new mock-cola is already great for the brand. The overall recall of Coca-Cola is completely thanks to the invention of Coca-Cola, and PBR is the proof of this! Even before the new Coca-Cola Classic was announced, many people had been requesting Coca-Cola\u2019s (WAN:SCOBY) to change the Drink now! It is sweet and sticky, which are the qualities of Coke\u2019s fake. After the approval to PBR, all the fans of Coca-Cola have joined the PBR wave!"}
