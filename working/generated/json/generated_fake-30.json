{"title": "A\u2013Induced Hepatitis Biomarker in Liver, Enzymes, and Chemical Imbroglirics: LiFe Biomarker 3: Clinical Applications", "authors": "Colin Bell Melissa Adams Crystal Goodman Antonio Crawford Regina Jenkins", "published_date": "10-19-2018", "affiliation": "Samford University, School of Physics", "text": "These abnormalities of the liver virus (refer to abstract: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12251894)\">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed...</a> become more evident and distinct in comparison with normal hepatocytes. Enzymes such as bacillus thermophilus, coagulation factor \u03b2, and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) in hepatocytes were therefore important to describe the immune dysregulation and the mechanism of embryotoxicity or apoptosis. Disruption of hepatocyte function by A-Induced Hepatitis could result in acute inflammation of the liver and, if the immune and infection response are coupled to autoimmune disease, it would induce an immunogenic effect and promote accelerated hepatitis. The doses of radiopharmaceutical, plasma/CTP, and chemotherapeutic agents used in adult and pediatric patients with hepatitis A infection are known to induce apoptosis in oligodendrocytes and to induce programmed cell death in lymphocytes. We investigated the effect of radiopharmaceuticals on hepatocytes in order to confirm the mechanistic rationale of apoptosis. Although the apoptotic effects of C-terminal (H\u2013T) radiopharmaceuticals are hypothesized to induce cell death with genotoxicity, there was an absence of these effects. Consequently, lymphocytes deprived of H\u2013T radiopharmaceuticals become resistant to apoptosis. Coactivating lymphocytes with chemotherapeutic agents was therefore necessary to induce cell death in hepatocytes. We hypothesized that radiopharmaceuticals could induce intra-cellular cell death by killing latent FBV (hypoxia-inducible factor 2-phosphate) (HIF2)-dependent beta-cells, since their imbalances may then interact with the HIF2 protein. We investigated this hypothesis by stimulating HIF2-dependent beta-cells with a combination of DNA dismishement and radiopharmaceuticals to induce apoptosis in human lymphocytes. Our results were different from what is expected in adult livers where many mature fibroblasts (heterosomes) are present that normally prevent HIF2-dependent beta-cells from migrating out. We also observed severe intestinal induction of apoptosis in three models, including Cyclosporine-C induced small blood-cell necrosis in hepatocytes, pharmacologic-induced plasma induction of apoptosis in the peripheral blood, and cytotoxic agent-induced induction of apoptosis in parasites. Together, these results suggest that A-Induced Hepatitis can induce intra-cellular systemic apoptosis. These results could have substantial clinical implications in terms of the correct diagnosis of liver dysfunction, and in disease modulating agents that could be used to induce apoptosis in livers."}
