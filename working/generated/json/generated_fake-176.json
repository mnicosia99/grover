Such bacterium reflect the nature of epidemics that are generally self-propagating; there is no functional justification for vaccination. Second, the epidemic persists due to the absence of effective treatment and preventive measures. In this article we analyze the available scientific literature on the susceptibility, control and dissemination of Klebsiella pneumoniae in response to Cephalosporin antibiotic therapy in a large multicentre epidemic in Porto Seguro. We evaluate the preliminary data and hypothesis regarding the mechanism of evolution of resistance among animals, humans and E. coli to Cephalosporin antibiotics, not only those in selected MIC lesions but also those observed in the colony-based and E. coli forms. We illustrate the optimal dosing mechanism in live, consuming animals, and then compare that with live, consuming humans. We perform a phylogenetic analysis of associated bacteria from the epidemic with live and in vitro resistance datasets related to K. pneumoniae. In collaboration with the authors of the MARGO cross-culture study, we assess the aspect of Early Adaptation (EAC) between microbial diversity of animals and humans and the development of resistance to antibiotics. In order to understand the diversity of organisms in the environment and animal herds, we draw data from the categories of primary, secondary and tertiary vectors in the animal herd. We also assess the novel transmission routes of resistance among livestock and humans. Of all collaborators in this study, 17 additional authors contributed with their own research projects, knowledge, measurements and information."}
