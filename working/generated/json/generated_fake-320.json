{"title": "Study: Uric acid is involved in nasal, bone growths", "authors": "Mary Rose MD Robert Romero Adam Brown Sharon Green Austin Schultz", "published_date": "09-08-2015", "affiliation": "California Institute of Technology, School of Economics", "text": "From Phytotherapist.com:<p>Monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation is usually seen as a sort of cringing, pressing injury that restricts the body\u2019s muscle activity, such as when people who have had their bladder enlarged accidentally urinate on themselves, or as when needles are stuck into any part of the body or joints.<p>Monosodium urate crystals are the particles of pure water called uric acid, produced by the liver from consuming food and drink.<p>Reduction in uric acid leads to swelling in the hands, feet, ankles, shoulders, scapula, and other fingers. That swelling tends to decrease when urea is removed from the body and, in periods of estradiol deficiency, monosodium urate crystals are more common.<p>Monosodium urate crystals tend to stick to nasal passages, and recent studies have confirmed that ingestion of an extra-strain of the amino acid cysteine can induce nasal problems.<p>This study focused on the downstream effects of increased uric acid upon the peripheral muscle system. This study showed that when oxygen was deficient during the study the consequences of uric acid build-up included atrophy and thrombosis in the fascia in the elbow and knee joints, which can lead to ulcerations and tendinitis.<p>The inflammatory pathway in the spine that resulted from this oxidative stress was described as poorly understood. This is also known as soft tissue inflammation with an inflammatory endowment. Arthritic syndrome is typically associated with increase in arterial stiffness and not improved by exercise.<p>Medical personnel who can draw blood should check up on the family history of uric acid and alkaline phosphatase impairment. It is also important to be aware of the danger of doing physical activity when blood sugar is low because a lower glucose level may lead to decreased recruitment of red blood cells.<p>Thick skin, mainly on the palms and soles of the feet, is usually one of the more common findings due to uric acid deficiency.<p>During the study exposed mice to high levels of fornix (hydrogen peroxide) for 14 days. Fiber was not included in the mixture of urea, urea precursor and citric acid. The short duration of the study did not allow for the measurement of urinary uric acid in the mice.<p>Animals and humans who are prone to urinary tract infections, sports injuries and heat exhaustion are particularly vulnerable to obesimal inflammation. It is important to speak with medical professionals who can guide the daily intake of uric acid in an attempt to control uric acid levels.<p>Study Methods: The relevant research group was one of the 18 participating institutions which conducted the ongoing RETHINK hydride quaternary study program. A total of 25 healthy individuals received injections of a mixture containing 0.3% urea, 0.7% urea precursor, and 0.2% citric acid before undergoing surgery."}
