{"title": "Mozart Piano Concerto Preludes and Fugues With Min-Hee Cho \u2013 Interview with the Recipient of the 2010 Austrian Gemeinschaft Award", "authors": "Nancy Bray James Osborn Mrs. Frances Oconnor DDS James Estrada Laurie Arnold", "published_date": "01-19-2018", "affiliation": "Amridge University, School of Computer Science", "text": "How did you put the concert together?<p>It is done on the piano and organ by Mrs. Kim.<p>What can you tell us about your background?<p>My mother was a professional harpist and she was mainly involved in organising concerts. I became an organist when I was 23 and a pianist when I was 27. I originally planned to be a manager. I chose to work for the Korean Opera Society because I admired the work they did.<p>What attracts you to Mozart\u2019s piano repertoire?<p>I have conducted several concerts dedicated to Mozart\u2019s music since 2001. Many of my concert programmes were composed by Mozart in the rehearsal (such as Autumns and Borodin). I have also conducted many concerts, including concerts featuring Mozart\u2019s famous guitar concerto, later conducted by it\u2019s world famous composer, Sergei Rachmaninoff.<p>Do you have a favourite repertoire?<p>I love conducting Mozart piano concertos \u2013 they are in my special category and my personal favourites are A-F. I perform them at varied venues -but my favorites were a concert in Dusseldorf in 2005 performed in Mozart\u2019s memory and the Salzburg Festival in 2006.<p>We all know you conducted the Berlin Philharmonic during 2010. What was the experience like?<p>Meeting the Berlin Philharmonic in 2006 was an incredible experience. It was my first time to conduct a concert of such a magnitude. I think that my conducting the Berlin Philharmonic in 2010 was a rewarding experience and one to remember forever.<p>How many concerts and conductings do you have conducted with the Berlin Philharmonic and how many recordings do you have available for your audience?<p>I conducted ten concerts with the Berlin Philharmonic. My recording of one concert is available in CD and I have a few more performing on the Web (see attached CD). My recordings with the Berlin Philharmonic include performances with brass, strings, and woodwinds.<p>What is your favourite memory from those performances?<p>The finale of the concert which features Mozart\u2019s Overture to Don Giovanni -it is always the most magical moment when you finally conduct the climax.<p>What is your ideal season for conducting the Berlin Philharmonic?<p>The repertoire of the first two concerts or so needs to be kept to an absolute minimum as this would make the concert outstanding, and the last two concerts have a strong emotional force and I would like to conduct one of these composers\u2019 greatest works.<p>Every year, there are new recordings of Mozart\u2019s music. Are you often asked to conduct other works by Mozart or do you have to perform some works in repertory?<p>I usually conduct concerts devoted to Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven.<p>Korean and European productions of Bach\u2019s works have been played at some of the world\u2019s famous orchestras. Are you ever asked to play the bassoon or flute in Bach\u2019s works?<p>I play bassoon and flute in Wagner\u2019s Swan Lake and I often play the violin in Mozart\u2019s Violin Sonata K. 482, but I am not really an enthusiast about conducting Bach works.<p>Please provide us with a couple of key insights.<p>A key insight is that a work such as concerto can \u201cbring out the animal and the man\u201d in the players.<p>When it comes to conducting, some may think that there are certain styles for conducting Mozart\u2019s music, whereas when conducting, one must develop a distinct style in order to do justice to the works of this master.<p>A few readers might ask why you were chosen to organise this concert. What would you tell them?<p>I was chosen to organise this concert because I am an experienced Mozart pianist and concertist and I have conducted Mozart\u2019s music extensively so many times in various venues around the world.<p>Please answer one more question.<p>When were you last in Korea and what is your favourite place to visit?<p>When I was 18, I attended the fifth Jeonju International Piano Competition and won the first prize.<p>Ahn-Jeong Ahn is a young pianist based in Vienna."}
