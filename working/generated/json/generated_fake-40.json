Thiamine is a monoamine with immunologically active and protective actions in the overall nervous system and liver. When monosodium urate crystals which have activated activated plasma DNA and a lipid polyculture growth force is present, the immune response may trigger the destruction of these granules as opposed to the loss of neutrophils (killer cells), which results in poor output of monosodium urate, which may be dispelled by a replacement of thiamine supplement, according to research conducted by KANN research.<p>Article: Effects of ethanol on monosodium urate crystals induced by prolonged activation by monosodium urate polyculture, By Taku Inokuchi and Tuneyoshi Ka<p>Source: KANN Research Institute"}
