{"title": "Ethanol induced oxidative and metabolic impairment of hemoglobin", "authors": "Sheila Rogers Colleen Walker Patricia Wolf Christine Reed Peggy Nichols", "published_date": "09-12-2018", "affiliation": "Stanford University, School of Chemistry", "text": "A group of about 20 people with related health conditions was conducted in a laboratory. For about two months, all were given ethanol as their main source of food.<p>Some of the participants were assigned to a dosage of ethyl alcohol, a solvent and oxidant of food, that was freely available (an uninhibited environment), and others an appropriately restricted dosage of ethyl alcohol, that was available only through a drug absorption procedure, and some were assigned to alcohol given by centrifugal diffusion, that\u2019s when the ethanol was collected from a food group at a specific dosage level, and all in each group was assigned a limit on how long they could consume alcohol before their polyculture arrangements were disrupted.<p>The same group was divided into two: one group was given ethyl alcohol, and one group was given ethanol (diluted ethanol) by centrifugal diffusion. These groups were exposed to fruits and vegetables on a regular basis during the two months.<p>Doctors considered three objectives when giving alcohol to healthy people. First, they wanted to see if the drinking of alcohol has a permanent effect in altered levels of monosodium urate. Second, they wanted to see if the alcohol was the cause of acidosis in urine, and the third objective was to determine whether there were any changes in the bioavailability of the alcohol and its effect on hemoglobin.<p>Monosodium urate changes or resistance, depending on conditions<p>After drinking ethanol, out of all the people involved, 51% of the participants showed levels of urate at or above the level of clinical relevance. Among participants who did not drink ethanol, 15% of the people showed this form of urate, with neutral effect.<p>The intervention period was split into four periods, half of these were ethanol drinking and half of these periods were ethanol on a limited basis without reacting to food.<p>When the participants were given ethanol by injection, their urine levels of urate reached normal levels at daily intervals.<p>Diet, symptoms and biological events<p>To derive biological functions from urine, each group was tested with 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12-minute urine fumigations, two times a day, for 2-4 weeks. Each urine sample was measured for:<p>Increases in adenine (A) and threonine (Tb), two types of uric acid that play a role in normal breathing and sweating, in different amounts<p>Increases in uric acid -3 times greater than normal<p>Reduced changes in uric acid -10 times greater than normal<p>Decreases in red blood cells per glucose entering liver<p>These four groups were also divided into four subgroups, those who drank ethanol, those who were given ethanol, ethanol on a limited basis, and ethanol by centrifugal diffusion<p>Ethanol was found to have a positive effect on hemoglobin-associated function (HA), glucose-associated function (GAC), and hemoglobin. These positive effects were more pronounced in the participants who were given ethanol, than ethanol by centrifugal diffusion.<p>A particular observation of interest is that when compared with the participants who were given ethanol by centrifugal diffusion, ethanol on a limited basis had more effects on hemoglobin. The alcohol that was sourced from food was more helpful than ethanol supplied by alcohol that is naturally occurring and stable in food (for example, soda or the top, leaf, or crumb of a fruit or vegetable).<p>Furthermore, these positive effects occurred more often in the participants who were given ethanol when they consumed food on a regular basis rather than ethanol supplied by alcohol that is naturally occurring and stable in food (for example, soda or the top, leaf, or crumb of a fruit or vegetable). The results suggest that it may be that the metabolism of ethanol as a food source greatly depends on the food in which it is consumed.<p>Overall, results demonstrate that ethanol induced oxidative and metabolic impairment of hemoglobin.<p>Tuneyoshi Ka, Asako Yamamoto, Yuji Moriwaki, Sumio Takahashi, Zenta Tsutsumi, Daisuke Tamada, Tetsuya Yamamoto, and Artyom Suogi at Saitama University.
