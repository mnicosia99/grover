I am one of those pacifists who have suffered when the French troops were in Afghanistan. I was upset with George Bush\u2019s arrogant pronouncements during this war and I was upset when Nicolas Sarkozy decided that we should follow America\u2019s step]<p>Another friend of mine\u2026 and I am not making any comparisons! Who killed more innocent victims than US government soldiers and private mercenaries? More than 1,000 civilian victims in Iraq. In Afghanistan? 3,581 civilian victims since 2001, according to U.S. statistics.<p>If the number of deaths in total are between 3,561 and 4,914, that is roughly what you can conclude from the image above. Did you ask yourself whether there would have been as many civilian deaths had the US army not been so efficient in providing security? And what did you do for better security when U.S. soldiers stayed in Afghanistan longer than originally planned, and when they were really engaged in direct action against the Taliban?<p>The problem is very simple\u2026 Those who occupy the countries are the ones who kill civilians. If all the violence in the world were to stop today, by all means the state would have to draft its citizens. There are more armed forces in the world than all the populations of each country. Every day they kill one person. Everyone can find somewhere in the world where they can demonstrate without fear, or where they can protest without fear of death or torture. Then there are places that by definition are and have always been areas of peace and freedom. In these countries the US should just stay away.<p>Jean-Francois Ottavi"}
