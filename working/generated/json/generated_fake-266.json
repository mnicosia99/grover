{"title": "Exposure to monosodium urate produces anti-inflammatory effect.", "authors": "Natalie Smith Valerie Fowler Mrs. Judy Castro Michael Reynolds Elizabeth Dunn", "published_date": "05-25-2016", "affiliation": "Chapman University, School of Environmental Studies", "text": "The authors sought to confirm the effects of calorie restriction on the inflammatory mechanism of system in a physiological model. \u201cWe directly modified the glomerular filtration rate using adipokine receptor technology, thereby producing a mechanical barrier that partially prevents the accumulation of gas at the site of the arterial inflammation. Once it had been established, we applied a different type of diet in various stages of food restriction, exploiting its antioxidant activity to reduce inflammation. We were able to demonstrate an anti-inflammatory effect of calorie-restriction on peripheral oxygenated circulation\u201d.<p>The results were intriguing: the research group, led by Shinichi Tamada, professor at the Department of Physiology at RIKEN Center for High Energy Physics (COMPM), identified that it was the oxide (perfluorooctane) molecules released into the system by the monosodium urate crystal that stimulated both heat and oxidative stress in the body. To test the hypothesis, the group performed experiments at infrared wavelengths, with monosodium urate crystal, another molecule of oxidants (B2O-ni and B3O-ni), using a laser beam-emitting apparatus. Through both these tests, they confirmed that monosodium urate crystal had the anti-inflammatory effect: the monosodium urate crystal produced what is called oxidative stress suppression and heat insulation from the heat agent \u2013 in other words, the suppression of the reactive oxygen species.<p>The authors mentioned that monosodium urate does not inhibit the production of monosodium urate as foodstuffs do, but only the production of a type of sulfur called urea. Only urea is needed to create urate crystals \u2013 because of this, urea has only to be expelled from the body through urination, whereas the gas created by monosodium urate is consumed by the organism before reaching a level at which it can be eliminated from the blood.<p><a href=\"http://www.righthoused.jp/journal/php9-21j50.html\">http://www.righthoused.jp/j...</a>"}
