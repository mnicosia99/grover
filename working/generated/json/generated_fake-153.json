Some researchers, including us, propose a new strategy of combining functional genes from primary and genetically-modified tumors, along with fibroblast growth factor 16 (Sp) for the development of CTC. Although in the phase I clinical trials it was found that Sp was superior to existing treatment options, the inability to directly control cancer progression, i.e. toxicities, has been demonstrated. A functional chemotherapy drug modified Sp with cisplatin is often used. The actual researchers using Sp results from a collaboration between William Dunstan and Cy Arter Davis, the Asian Institute for Medical Technology.<p>*<p>References<p>1. M. Lhamo, M. Lam, R. Yu, A.
