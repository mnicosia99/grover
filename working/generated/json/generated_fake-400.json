Why are you having a special committee? What do you have against North Korea? You are cruel.<p>Do you approve it?<p>\u2013 Zhou Xuekai: Human rights are related to the Chinese people\u2019s interests. If the North Korean human rights situation deteriorates, China will suffer, just like it did after the Japanese Occupation. China will become like Afghanistan.<p>What will be the members of the special committee, and what are their powers?<p>\u2013 Xiuquan Chinese: If China allows North Korea\u2019s human rights situation to deteriorate, will China and North Korea become an isolated society? If North Korea escalates its actions, China will not be strong enough to protect the policy of friendship between China and North Korea, and North Korea will be exposed. It is China\u2019s nation\u2019s security interest to prevent this from happening.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xie Lekun (echo of Chinese): Kim Jong-un wants to rule over North Korea, just like his father. I want North Korea\u2019s two citizens, Kim Jong-un and Kim Jong-il, to stop fighting with each other. For this purpose, China should deal with them more gently.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Gao Mao (echo of Chinese): There are many difficulties in terms of North Korea\u2019s human rights situation. The National People\u2019s Congress will not agree with the establishment of the committee. Instead, China should consider other measures, such as a currency devaluation. If the emergency situation continues, China should be ready to meet the people\u2019s demands.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Zhongtian (echo of Chinese): China ought to further strengthen and strengthen its prevention of human rights abuse in North Korea, for this purpose China ought to increase its political influence.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xiuquan Chinese: This is very important. What we should do is turn the upcoming 2012 nuclear talks into a genuine dialogue between the foreign minister of North Korea and the foreign minister of China.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xu Benhong (echo of Chinese): Human rights or dignity? Rights cannot be compared to dignity. Without the dignity, not even security can exist.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xiuquan Chinese: China and North Korea cannot get along. North Korea won\u2019t be able to rescue China from its lack of prosperity. On the other hand, China cannot tolerate North Korea\u2019s human rights problems. These problems are mutually damaging.<p>Would you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xiuquan Chinese: A small foundation has provided 80% of the funding. There are only eight members to the committee. The total budget and total costs are estimated at $7 million.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xu Benhong (echo of Chinese): No. North Korea is not a normal country.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xu Benhong (echo of Chinese): If China and North Korea are not allowed to develop relationship, China can not make a bold step in the future. We have previously been sabotaged by neighbors on the South and on the East. In such a situation, China must make a more unique initiative.<p>Do you approve the establishment of the special committee?<p>\u2013 Xu Benhong (echo of Chinese): Yes.<p>This article appears in CC Jiang, a mainland, independent publisher of books for research about Chinese national affairs, member of the Chinese Professional Association on International Relations (CAPIR) and member of the International Publishers Association in China. He practices Chinese English as well as Chinese Chinese and prizes honesty and perseverance as virtues in all his life."}
