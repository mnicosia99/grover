What sets these olefins apart is the inclusion of elements that interfere with metabolism and support nitrogen fixation, including alcohol and benzene.<p>The polyphenolic nitrogen-fixing element ATP has also been discovered as a possible factor in corn biofuels production, according to Professor Hirozaki Emino of University of Tsukuba. These aromatic elements, which act as barriers in biofuels production, disrupt the neutralizing forces that would regulate air and gas exchange in an oxygen-attractive medium.<p>The evidence that such substances in biofuels have adverse effects on enzymes found in ethanol plants can be found in induced-genomic (ICG) and induced-bacterial cell imaging studies of two biofuel plants, the companies said.<p>The team determined that the ethanol plants used in the analysis had favorable production conditions that are not consistent with those needed to reduce petroleum consumption.<p>Further, the molecules reported in the two studies are less abundant than those generated by the fermentation process, which is counter-intuitive to the aim of biofuels production, the researchers said.<p>By reducing ethanol production, the team has shown that pressure under which biofuels destroy undesired free radicals has reduced.<p>However, the team continued to study the ethanol complex in detail. These teflon-like ingredients act as barriers that limit the introduction of biomass gas radicals, it was found.<p>Additional research, including in vitro experimentation, will be conducted to determine the causal factors.<p>The research findings have been published in the latest edition of Polymer Chemistry International."}
