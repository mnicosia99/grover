Since then, Japan\u2019s wheat bread \u2014 served in separate ovens \u2014 has declined dramatically as the most common meal of choice in schools and government offices. The government\u2019s favorite cold cereal \u2014 known as \u201ckomo ga tono\u201d (Southerly Wheat), and commonly eaten on special occasions in the US \u2014 was likewise generally covered by bread substitutes. Nearly two-thirds of the 165,000 children from primary schools, summer camps, and other youth centers in Japan were fed non-traditional wheat pastas and other cereals, according to the latest annual survey by the Health, Labor and Welfare Ministry.<p>One thing remains the same: about 40% of Japanese older than 65, and about 30% of those 35-74, drink alcohol at nearly the same rates as in the average country. Yet the Japanese government still bars liquor stores from advertising alcohol in the newspapers, radio and television.<p>And Japanese are drinking fewer beers, according to government survey data.<p>This is a variation on the general theme that Japanese can, when not too drunk, enjoy the same experiences on opposite ends of the spectrum. That theme remains prevalent at Kyoto University Medical Center, where ICU nurses are working with street crowds and tourists to assess patients for alcohol dependence. \u201cIt\u2019s completely civil-society-oriented\u201d in that the new generation at UCHC includes more doctors and people like me with more tools, says Jonin Nuno de Andrade, a neuropsychiatrist.<p>This article originally appeared at Readings.org"}
