He\u2019s an avian virus expert working on a cold virus. Let\u2019s dig a little deeper:<p>Question: \u201cCan I get a patient with head and neck cancer to re-programme itself with Avian Flu?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes, we do this with FBP (Fluorescent Protein Protease-promoter) treatment. We injected FBP protein into their head. After feeding the patient this protein, they let it accumulate under their skin on the cheek. When an Avian flu virus arrives to the brain, it stimulates that area of the skin, through these proteins that ordinarily don\u2019t infect us. This makes them sensitive and less hostile to the virus, and thus they will be a vulnerable target.\u201d<p>Question: \u201cBut what happens if you do try this with human brain tissue (and Avian flu is H5N1)?\u201d Answer: \u201cAn exposure with FBP gets into the brain, so you have to treat it with antiviral drugs. A very powerful antiviral agent is Tamiflu, and it has anti-lumen (\u201canti-binding\u201d) properties and can stop the virus from proliferating once it hits the brain. We use a chemical called LP50-9G that blocks the VLA binding.\u201d<p>Question: \u201cSo, I give the patient with the FBP protein in their head a second or third session and watch how it does. What happens?\u201d Answer: \u201cAfter the third round of treatment, the patient will show significant changes in the target parts of the body. \u2018Cluster\u2019 of tumors appear on the head.\u201d<p>Answer: \u201cYes, it is clear to everyone that a tumor cluster has arrived in the brain, from the spot where the second round of FBP was injected. We can even track where it\u2019s going.\u201d<p>Question: \u201cThen you show that a mutated form of avian flu, which cannot be controlled by Tamiflu, can destroy these brain tumors and actually induce apoptosis of the cells?\u201d Answer: \u201cWe do exactly that, by essentially stopping the replication of the virus.\u201d<p>Question: \u201cSo, is this something that could be used in humans? Is this an effective medical approach?\u201d Answer: \u201cWe need to experiment with this before we answer that question. But our initial results are promising.\u201d<p>Answer: \u201cIf you look at the picture above of a patient on his last treatment, and we only injected FBP into his brain, he was able to grow so many tumors, well over a thousand tumors in his brain. The test-tube expression of the FBP protein was so high, that all of the cells, all of the chromosomes in his brain were produced with that protein.\u201d<p>Answer: \u201cWe want to validate these new findings. I am optimistic, since this is not the first time that we have used FBP in the brain to attack any kind of abnormal cell in the brain. Last year, we did experiments on a different patient (in this case a patient with Cerebral Palsy), and saw a dramatic response with the FBP therapy. We need to continue with these studies and further their direction before we can move to more clinical projects.\u201d<p>Answer: \u201cThe gold standard is the technique used by [German Professor] Fritz Budko. He injects the patient with the bacterium Helicobacter pylori. Then we follow up with this person by finding new tumors. This will be our next step.\u201d<p>Answer: \u201cIf we do continue, maybe we will get a human clinical trial going in the near future.\u201d"}
