Well, they are all wePCY (inactivated cytomegalovirus) particles. These viral particles became common forms of encephalitis in the human population because they cause a human flu-like syndrome that lead to coma and brain damage. CCD in animals is caused by the CMV, as we suspected that CMV acts in this manner in humans. Now the age old question of what are the CMV particles? Well now we have a model, showing that the particles are indeed CMV formed from CCD viral proteins. We can now follow the development of the CMV particles in the presence of CCD to show how the viruses enter and infect the immune system.<p>It should be noted that once CCD is infected by CMV, it will also find a way to infect humans. CMV is capable of producing its own vaccines so we have to understand the dynamics of CMV and the immune response to this virus in order to improve CMV vaccines. One of the methods is to direct contact with infected patients to look for the CMV.<p>The next step is to try to focus on eliminating the CMV in humans by using a vaccination approach."}
