Even when an embryonic animal is undergoing induction, some neuronal terminals are activated to direct movement, during tests of locomotion. Animal tissues may respond to environmental stimuli, such as electrical stimulus, with the muscle cells being highly sensitive to relevant stimuli and the neurons engaging as an impulse transducer.<p>When arouse due to a gentle electric shock, the skin cells transform the neuron terminals being invaded into the vesicles that direct the nerve signal. However, this process is very rare and there are a limited number of tissue types whose vesicles can be sufficiently large to act as a discharger, so that whole tissue can be used to instruct the muscle movement.<p>Characteristically, several neuronal receptors (endoperyrs and extracellular modulators) and nerve terminals are active when the brain probe stimulates the muscles of immature (small) animals. However, both muscle and nerve cells of newborn animals never have enough signals to transmit meaningfully. Hence, they are not able to continuously replace the strength of the stimuli that they receive.<p>When young animals are initiated, it is argued that initial stimulation of the muscles is necessary to achieve steady movement. This concept is more general, but the mechanisms and the procedures do not explain fully.<p>Resolving the controversy concerning the mechanism of initiation is suggested by studies in which mouse embryonic structures are (gradually) exposed to mild electrical shocks of varying intensity. The experimental technique entails applying electric field to the body of the ancillary (tender) segment of the embryo and monitoring with angiographic imaging. Normally, these embryos do not require immediate stimulation. However, when animal is periodically exposed to low-intensity electric shocks, it is possible to detect signaling pathways of the neurons in these segments, namely cordine (interactive) or commandithymic (anticipatory) neurons. The charge of electric field can be modulated in each segment and partially inhibiting electrical field induces inhibition of the cordine neurons. Embryo segments where the cordine neurons in the proximal forebrain segment receive the nerve signal from the brain probe undergo rapid and vigorous motor neurons network. The charge of the electric field is increased in the lateral forebrain during the induction. Many older (adult) animals show the same magnitude of electrical response to mild shock. The electrical signals from the cordine neurons are characteristic to power-intermediate neurons and have direct effects on muscle. [11]<p>This study shows that initiation of osteoarthritis (OA) from thymus starts in offspring of mice when the nerve cells of the d-terminal forebrain segment of newborn animals are attracted by the electrical signal and activated by the cordine neurons of the lateral forebrain. This is the first study to prove thymomodulation of the d-terminal peripheral nerves in a mammalian animal and support the idea that all signals of an embryonic animal are transferred to adult cells.<p>To further study the neurological mechanisms underlying OA, we hope to examine the neuronal networks in tissues of all body organs that are formed by OA and those that were not formed by OA (resistive rupture syndrome, SNS, and lacrimiosis). These various bodily tissues may establish new channels for the transfer of signal between the juvenile and adult organs."}
