Blood levels of alcoholic liver affect every cell of the body and physiological activity, and also affects blood pressure levels. Alcohol is also produced by the liver, kidneys and all the cells in the body. Alcoholic liver affects liver and kidney cell and other cells in the body. Through blood and weight, drinking alcohol passes through and generates a substance called ethyl alcohol (ETH). The levels of ETH recorded by liver cells and other cells in the body usually are between 5 and 20 ng/mL (which is equivalent to some 0.0005-0.0008%.). Alcohol is found in many types of gasses and beverages. Compared to the harmful daily dosage of alcohol and time used, ETH can cause low immunity and low metabolic power function (white matter loss in the brain and down-regulating of heart function). Ethyl alcohol regulates hormone function and the immune response. Food, weight and organs of different body parts can become impaired after consumption of beer, wine, liquor or tea. When alcohol damages blood cells, it is more difficult to overcome the toxins. Fat cells become fatty and increase the amount of fat they contain.<p>Displays the alcohol enzyme in the liver cells, kidney cells and blood cells. It is thought that alcohol is produced by the liver, kidneys and other cells in the body.<p>The level of ethyl alcohol (eth) in the blood and liver cells and other cells in the body can be considered as the level of alcohol in the blood."}
