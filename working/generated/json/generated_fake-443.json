{"title": "Antibiotic resistance: respiratory Klebsiella pneumoniae", "authors": "Stephanie Fuentes Taylor Harper John Hines Nancy Cabrera DVM Beth Harris", "published_date": "06-29-2018", "affiliation": "California Lutheran University, School of Global Science, Technology, and Society", "text": "Earlier a study by MedExpress (published November 2011) carried out by the same research team published a paper that indicated that the bacteria of Klebsiella pneumoniae can live in the bloodstream of healthy individuals. This bacteria can be found in the lungs of otherwise healthy people and can therefore lead to pulmonary infection.<p>Although we know that this bacteria can cause pulmonary infection, its character was not characterised previously. Other etiologies of pulmonary infection were not relevant, the reason for this had already been demonstrated: hypertension/prehypertension, asthma and chronic heart disease are more important for pulmonary infection than Klebsiella pneumoniae, therefore I have presented an index of pulmonary infection characterization, namely febrile pneumonia, in reference to one identified eukaryotic cell line. This eukaryotic cell line was described in 2007 by Luca and Maurizio and it developed resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. In 2008 the resistance to carbapenem was identified in three other cell lines in the catalogue, therefore revealing that bacteria produced in this cell line, rather than Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, can lead to epidemic events.<p>With these cells in mind, together with Stavros (<a href=\"http://search.migratech.org/find/AlphaDetmBg/AlphaDetmBjkmIV-E\">http://search.migratech.org...</a>-\u03b1bef-4DDl%3Dy60abop-FFklaf1LLzCayee0k), I have decided to define pulmonary infection characterization. First I have presented an index of pulmonary infection: febrile pneumonia characterized by bacterial fragments in the eumelanin (eumelanin) membrane of the pulmonary lymphatic system, is normally a singular tissue, but bacterial fragments have been found in multiple sites in the lungs. In addition, cells persist in the eumelanin membrane at the first step of the lymphatic network. This development suggests that bacteria present as a single cell in the tissue are able to live in multiple tissue sites.<p>I confirm that the established cell lines are not the only cells present in and in relation to the pulmonary lymphatic system. In fact, a well-developed filer has already been identified that reproduces the cell line profile and can turn these cells into more persistent pathogens. It can also be observed in humans, especially in patients with systemic or site specific conditions such as hypertension/prehypertension or asthma."}
