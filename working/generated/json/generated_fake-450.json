This is due to the risk factor that risk for such diseases increases with frequency of alcohol use.<p>Japan alcohol drinking is probably the greatest in the world. According to an exception, alcohol consumption in the country is falling, but not as fast as in many other nations. Some measures have been taken to limit alcohol, including banning sales of high-alcohol spirits and the introduction of steep excise taxes."}
