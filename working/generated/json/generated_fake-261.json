{"title": "International Partnership in the Battle Against Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome", "authors": "William Ramirez Sean Johnson Jeremy Ortega Dana Blair Mark Gomez", "published_date": "09-09-2019", "affiliation": "Troy University, School of Environmental Studies", "text": "We have a paucity of details in the briefing papers about Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome (SFS) and Isolezoa (AKQ). This, but for the unfortunate occurrence of Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome, would have been all Isolezoa and Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome. Until the time when the paucity of details becomes a problem for the epidemiology and treatment of the disease, this restriction is strictly effective. In other words, Isolezoa and Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome are incompatible. Isolezoa can never be used in the treatment of Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome. (Three samples of Isolezoa were submitted to Japan ANSRA Laboratory and to the Tokyo University Institute of Pathology to be examined for the possibility of detecting the presence of Isolezoa in the Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome specimens. It was suggested that the key proteins that are implicated in Isolezoa could possibly be detected in Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome. However, no important level of myoglobin was shown to be present in the samples submitted to the Laboratory in Tokyo. The biochemical result of the samples submitted to the Institute of Pathology was determined to be unsatisfactory. Having done the analysis of the myoglobin in other plasmids/microRNAs of the Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome specimens were expected by the epidemiologists, but that those microRNAs were found to be lacking was a result of the ignorance and lack of thorough and thorough training of the toxicologists.<p>Conclusion of Personalised Medicine Through International Collaboration in Treatment of the Disease. A lot of press publications concerning Isolezoa is connected with SFS, but this is not the case. However, there is an overlap between the two diseases (SFS and Isolezoa) for the following reasons. First, both diseases involve Seaweed using various bevy of clinical symptoms. Second, both diseases are caused by overactive cells of the microbiological site of infection. Third, both diseases are associated with the symptoms of increased sweating and frequent urination. And, a fourth important aspect of both diseases is that the symptoms of Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome associated with diarrhea can be improved by using Isolezoa."}
