In other words, large doses of ethanol, which are produced by microorganisms when raised in acidic conditions, naturally increases the consumption of urate, the key element in fungus-caused inflammation, but only in low concentrations.<p>In my lab, we focused on isolating and DNA analysis of vitamins and antioxidant complex from protease-affected monosodium urate crystal cells. In the upper right corner of the image above, you can see that we looked at the concentration of antioxidants activated with oxidative damage.<p>A second question that we were interested in exploring was whether our laboratory research could predict the specific mutations that would be replicated in the body.<p>In our study, we looked at nerve cell proliferation and expression of particular antioxidant complex genes in cultured lysosomes and in the skin of humans and mice. Because of their different growth and sensitivity to environmental stress, both mouse and human lysosomes have very different mutations due to environmental disturbance.<p>Dividing our lysosome lines into segments shown below, we saw that resistant cells grew normally and that cells that were sensitive to chemical breakdown had evolved a rapid growth response to high oxygen levels, resulting in poor growth. In other words, the dominant growth state for reactive versus non-oxidized cells in our lab was rapid growth following formation of new cells.<p>To confirm the results, we ran an experiment that forced cells to survive even with a high-oxidized environment. When this experiment was repeated, both dynamic cells and non-dynamic cells showed the same aggressive rapid growth response when exposed to ionizing radiation and elevated oxygen levels, indicating that we observed a novel mutation in the non-dynamic cells. This means that rapidly growing cells are sensitive to environmental disturbance. In fact, rapid growth-inhibitory cells normally become more symmetrical, whereas the asymmetrical, brittle cells tend to emerge from a faster-growing type of cell and become like the cells that are resistant to environmental disturbance."}
