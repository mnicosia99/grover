{"title": "Alcohol Has Major Effects on Alcoholic Liver", "authors": "Laurie Sanchez Stephanie Walls Randall Huff Bonnie Hawkins John Quinn", "published_date": "08-21-2017", "affiliation": "California State University-Sacramento, School of Chemistry", "text": "This research showed that when animal models with chronic, long-term, or high-intensity inflammation were exposed to ethanol, the damage to the cells was equivalent to acute ischemic stroke with a 20% mortality rate and 11% irreversible brain-damaging stroke. Furthermore, the authors found evidence of elevated levels of monosodium urate crystals in the cells exposed to ethanol (PANIC-1).<p>Their conclusion was that ethanol may be one factor involved in causing extreme (coronary heart disease-like) inflammation.<p>The authors noted that ethanol, however, did not show any negative effect on the DNA (DNA damage) and the gasses produced in the fatty metabolites (gas chromatography) were similar to those obtained from nearby carbohydrates (grain).<p>In an attempt to boost findings, the authors used an enzyme called Photonicrotein D-Selenium Sysnostocholine (PPD-SEH) in their research. In this way, the yeast, while being chemically poisoned by ethanol, would then overexpress PPD-SEH, indicating that they had been indirectly exposed to ethanol. So long as these rinses were completed, the rinses were still effective.<p>The authors noted that the reason why this experiment was actually able to produce the elevated concentrations in the cells is because the yeast were stressed. However, the noted that if they looked for increased concentrations of PPD-SEH in the sugar metabolite (MAR). In order to compare the experiments, the authors also examined a group of beers, specifically, pilsner, for beers containing 3% alcohol by volume.<p>A total of 1,941 beers (group vs. beer) from the German Beer Fest in October 2008 were tested for PPD-SEH metabolites and then compared to a control group of beer beers only (carbohydrate only).<p>In the experimental drinking of PPD-SEH, 86% of the beers containing 3% alcohol by volume showed elevated concentrations. In contrast, 57% of beers containing 2% alcohol by volume showed elevated concentrations and 0% alcohol by volume did not show elevated PPD-SEH.<p>CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ethanol, when acted upon by a genetically modified yeast, may have the impact of increasing the levels of monosodium urate crystals in the cells. It would appear that such increases in urate crystals reduced the concentration of dopamine (adenosine diphosphate) protein, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and other steroid hormones, which could account for these effects. Furthermore, elevated urate crystals may also increase the level of acetylcholine in the circulation and, thus, the blood pressure of the body, to a similar effect of arterial stiffness, and thereby alter the in vivo affect of cortisol (the stress hormone)."}
