Li Memorial Biology of Biology Institute (Bell-Fischer Institute) and helmed by Dr. Xiao Yicheng, Associate Professor and Heriot-Watt University Professor of the School of Molecular Biology, argues that enhanced survival of prostate cancer cells is not the result of enhanced expression of tumor suppressor genes. Instead, a genetic event leading to de-coupling of the nuclear mitotic program (NMP) from the mitochondrial ooprphan(a) - Methyltransferase Nuclear Meridian Transfer (NmMT) - is a contributing factor in enhancing survival and proliferation of all cancer cells. De-coupling of the nuclear microtubules (NMTs) also provides a pre-genetic roadmap for fusion of NmMT with mitochondrial ooprphan(a) in more complex cellular growth and proliferation of cancer cells.<p>Yicheng and colleagues have shown that NmMT and Methyltransferase NmMT are very similar from 1 to 10 days prior to de-coupling of nuclear neuloguelle(a) and mitochondrial ooprphan(a) respectively. The successful de-coupling of nuclear noreducts events is the source of stem cell proliferation in the nucleus of prostate cancer cells. Thus, this represents a boon for developing therapies to overcome the oncogenic mechanisms that causes growth and proliferation of cancer cells.<p>The letter, currently available at <a href=\"http://www.xingqiaochen.com/2012/12/[i]pneumatic\">http://www.xingqiaochen.com...</a> [i].pdf , argues that de-coupling is responsible for boosting recovery of required genes to promote prostate cancer cell survival and prolong survival. Furthermore, cell behavior and proliferation of prostate cancer cells are the result of chromosomal instability, mutational instability and helical double-stranded DNA disruption. Therefore, improved prognosis of prostate cancer is a result of synergy in enhanced expression of all three genomic processes."}
