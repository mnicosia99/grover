{"title": "Epigenetics: A Nature and Epigenetics Rundown", "authors": "Joseph Conner Edward Hartman Rebekah Richardson Matthew Richardson Michael Roberts", "published_date": "03-01-2015", "affiliation": "Alabama State University, School of Biology", "text": "Many academic biologists, including a number of scientists associated with the National Research University of India in Kozhikode, however, hold that there is no chance that environment alone has an impact on the development of a human being. Hence they tend to dismiss the links between DNA and environment; but point to increasing body of scientific literature and the growing scientific emphasis on epigenetics. These scientists say that they believe that environment can have an impact on virtually every biological process, including development.<p>Though this field of research does not necessarily involve uncovering the causes of diseases, its efforts can indirectly affect health and potentially be important in diagnosing certain conditions and treating others. For instance, study of gene expression in a number of cancers has enabled scientists to classify these tumors as one type or another. They may be carcinomas, oleoma, pancreatic, lung, stomach or others. This classification was based on expression of genes that are expressed during the formation of tumours. Unlike some scientists who see epigenetics as an old science that is slowly disappearing, other scientists say that a convergence of biology and genetics is occurring in which the epigenetics discoveries will generate more study.<p>Given the increase in pollution and wildlife mortality in mangroves (wildlife farms set up during the British colonial rule), experts are worried that such farms are creating problems for invertebrates, especially fish and other invertebrates, but also butterflies. This may explain how butterfly wings, using enough light to mimic moonlight, are capable of helping male butterflies avoid predators when they have not begun mating yet. To improve control over mosquito population, it is said that releasing insecticides containing toxins into mangroves is a better solution than banning release of mosquito eggs. The Ministry of Environment and Forests has already permitted butterfly farmers to make butterfly farms without taking permission from it.<p>Originally published by Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (<a href=\"https://www.idsa.in\">www.idsa.in</a>) at <a href=\"http://idsa.in/idsacomments/Epigenetics-A-Nature-and-Epigenetics-Rundown\">http://idsa.in/idsacomments...</a><p>__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.ei.nic.in/site/Default.aspx?id=561\">http://www.ei.nic.in/site/D...</a>"}
