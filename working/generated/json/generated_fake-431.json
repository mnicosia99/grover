{"title": "Dexterous Initiation of Arthritis in the Head from Electrolysis of the Mesenchymal System", "authors": "Craig Wilson Gregory Munoz Michael Henry John Miller Lisa Wagner", "published_date": "08-24-2015", "affiliation": "University of California-Berkeley, School of Mathematics", "text": "A study with rats shows that consuming slightly elevated amounts of ethanol protein (Epp) causes disruption of the memory centers of the brain leading to chronic inflammation of the mesenchymal system. In tandem with a higher dosage of ethanol protein, recurrent inflammation may also lead to a separate and more severe form of glaucoma in these animals, specifically one known as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The study, published on Dec 21 in the journal PLOS ONE.<p>In the 1980s, the use of ethanol for alcoholic beverages found favor in the United States, where it is primarily available to Americans in alcoholic beverages. Since then it has been found to be less harmful when consumed at low levels, but many people have decided to try ethanol in foods, particularly fruits and vegetables. Over the last ten years or so, a worrying phenomenon was observed among the U.S. population, where repeated consumption of ethanol has been shown to cause diseases known as Predisposition to Certain Pathologies (PtD). This is a disorder in which the body produces excess ethanol in response to changes in chemical balance such as changes in electrical activity of the nervous system or in the configuration of fibers in the kidney.<p>Before and after this disease is developed, scientists at Taku Inokuchi Brain Institute in Kobe and Aoba University College of Medicine, Kyoto, did experiments with rats showing that rats exposed to even the highest levels of ethanol protein in their diet, saw significant changes to their cerebellum and somatosensory cortex \u2013 brain regions vital for communication among the senses. It was theorized that liver fat was the liver responsible for producing excess ethanol protein in the rats.<p>In the new study, the scientists set out to see if a high level of ethanol protein, even only slightly elevated, would make a big difference for neuronal growth and development in the somatosensory cortex and brain\u2019s cerebellum. This result suggests that a dose that is greater than the recommended daily consumption of ethanol may initiate the growth of a Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). A more severe form of RA in which acetylcholine nerve fibers are lost or disabled, called the Acute Fibromyalgia (Fib).<p>During the experiments on the rats, their brain tissue was altered by adding phosphate ions and allowing the circulation of bacteria carried in the blood. These changes in the brain led to the accumulation of glaucoma-inducing ion channels.<p>Since ethanol is known to be the major cause of the PtD, the scientists tested the phosphate concentrations in the brain tissue of the rats while they were exposed to ethanol protein and of sugar. They found that the sugar absorbed from ethanol and the food was affected by the intake of ethanol. The stress induced by an intake of ethanol protein from a food source that was more than five times the recommended daily intake of ethanol made the accumulation of additional glucose and phosphate in the brain tissue problematic.<p>The scientists also found that the peak concentration of ethanol protein observed in these rats occurred only from sugar and not from ethanol itself.<p>Thus, further experiments on a rat with a higher permissible daily intake of ethanol protein might determine how the ethanol protein causes various chronic diseases from glaucoma to osteoporosis.<p>Source:<p>Taku Inokuchi, Freshuyo Oshikata, and Hideaki Uchida.
