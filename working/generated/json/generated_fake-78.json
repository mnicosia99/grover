{"title": "Adding Hot Pepper to Cream Coffee Could Defeat Cancer", "authors": "Michael Miller Debbie Williams Daniel Ford Margaret Navarro Joshua Nicholson", "published_date": "03-03-2015", "affiliation": "University of Alabama System Office, School of Cognitive Science", "text": "Nuclear physics experiment showed how pharmaceutical licorice extract removed Nm-lactobacill.<p>Capsaicin, the active substance in hot pepper, activates heat receptors on body\u2019s surface. When heat is applied, it activates bioactive substances on body\u2019s surface to further the action. Experimental studies confirmed that capsaicin and licorice extract seem to work together to regulate the activity of proteins that regulate body temperature. The age-old herbic plant, capsaicin, (Sun Yatsen\u2019s frankincense) decreases swelling and inflammation, increases intake of potassium and lowers blood pressure.<p>In a recent experiment, we discovered that capsaicin plays an important role in liver carcinogenesis. When we combined high-caffeine black coffee and curcumin powder with liver mouse, result was surprising. Curcumin significantly lowered liver scarring, the mean blood plasma level of liver inflammation and fasting glucose level. Both substances decreased fat in liver. Curcumin alleviated the fatty liver complaint, and curcumin also induced complete hepato_carcinogenesis. Caffeine was recommended instead of curcumin. Why is curcumin so effective? Traditional traditional Japanese foods contain high amounts of plant-based curcumin, such as konbu, shiso, adzuki beans, guinea brocolli, sweet potato and parsley.<p>What are proven adverse effects of diethylnitrosamine.<p>Some people believe that curcumin and capsaicin don\u2019t act together because there are no signs of the body\u2019s regular metabolism of licorice and black coffee. You\u2019re right, this is true. However, you probably also believe that there is some secret mechanism of regulating body temperature through capsaicin and licorice that is not active in people who don\u2019t eat hot peppers and edamame. Perhaps these people can find their own chocolate bark, licorice and hot chocolate (special formula, which adds to drug administration safety). But it\u2019s possible that there are some aspects of human biology that are not yet discovered. Maybe, you need to try licorice, coffee and capsaicin; you have proven ability to handle heat."}
