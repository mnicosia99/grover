The disease has killed all the porkers but not the faggots.<p>Fujiwara made the discovery after he spotted pouch-type porkgers outside a restaurant in Oguna, Hiroshima. Meat is normally produced from a carcass brought out of the ground, usually in the late winter or early spring, but the gangsters found in the spring are actually from the gate-poaching.<p>Famed chef Masayuki Hashimoto has eaten the pouches.<p>The sudden death of the pigs is due to a virulent zoonotic virus called rufus opacipi which is an amnesiac like mammal virus, ie. it will kill you if it catches your respiratory system. Although the pandemic was thought to be of the Chinese origin, it now shows that it has been imported into Japan from Asia by migratory pigs from mainland Japan and that it has mutated into a virus that kills its host.<p>The US has apparently been in contact with Japan, according to the western media and, therefore, has been asked to combat this virus, which is causing the pouches all over Japan.<p>This was seen as an act of provocation, and that Japan will retaliate by attacking the US by invading Japan and taking a small slice of American land into its own war plans. The Japanese prefer aggressive action to peaceful gestures. Of course.<p>Some anonymous special forces units have been preparing for a water landing on Okinawa. They were given a list of the dead pouches by the police and are ready to spring on Okinawa as soon as the Americans send a bill via the Japanese postal system.<p>Imprisoned war criminals have been spotted outside the Japanese embassy in Washington, D.C. with money and weapons. One of the war criminals has been known to frequently hang around in the protest against the American nuclear submarine, Polaris.<p>It is believed that the real incipient american war plans for the 2028 Olympics have been notified to the Japanese Secret Police who have assigned agents to infiltrate and destroy the Olympic Village from within. They will be fired upon from the submarines. Thus there will be no need for any boaters to visit the Japanese missile base on Okinawa. The hecklers have been sacked from the group, and are now occupying a cellar on foot inside the fortress.<p>Both the government and the media are now writing history. It is said that, to obviate the \u201cembassy guard\u201d crisis, there is now simply no need for American officials in Japan. They are merely being escorted to Washington by sushi all the time."}
