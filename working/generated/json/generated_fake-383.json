{"title": "caspase-3 Drive Enhanced Cancer Growth via Breast Cancer Cell Model", "authors": "Nicole Pham Natalie Webster Stephen Ramirez Stephanie Johnson Cassandra Torres", "published_date": "01-14-2017", "affiliation": "California Baptist University, School of Physics", "text": "CDK162 and similar CDK inhibitors in humans are being considered for non-small cell lung cancer treatment, and while some recent studies suggest that CDK162 may be effective in preclinical models of lung cancer, the use of it in human patients has been limited to a phase 2 clinical trial, conducted in three laboratory models of lung cancer, and the first patient to receive the drug.<p>In previous research, Dr. Morgan E. Carlson and coauthors showed that a protein called caspase-3 is critical for establishing and maintaining the balance between circulating and ablated (unencapsulated) longoisomeric endoderm cells in the pyroblast and fibroblast subcellular tissues. Through experiments and cell lines, it is clear that caspase-3 is significant in maintaining the \u201ctaxing\u201d potential of the estrogen receptor-binding protein (ERB); so notch status is essential for maintaining the self-renewal of the ERB.<p>By using culturing, gene expression and physiological changes to map the molecular interaction between caspase-3 and endoderm-endoderm interactions, the authors began to gain a better understanding of how caspase-3\u2019s binding to endoderm-endoderm interactions can result in aberrant ligand signaling to affect endoderm growth.<p>The authors show that caspase-3 is involved in the ejection of pancreatic stem cells from the muscle cGMs following the antagonism of enzymatic inhibitors of adult stem cells. Longoisomeric endoderm cells from old muscle stem cells from prostate cancer patients were transformed into endothelial cells; the epithelial cells divide and replace the previously self-renewing endoderm cells. Their data also show that cancer cells loaded with caspase-3 present in muscle develop \u201cgrowth-dependent caspase binding and docking specificty,\u201d which encourages the incorporation of the caspase-3 transporter, CDK162, into the ERB and sequesters the mediators of caspase-3 activation.<p>The authors note that taking part in two pSmas procedures, each of which enhances caspase-3 binding and docking activity, is key to facilitating the caspase-3 response, and therefore in perfecting various human cancer treatment options. They conclude that their findings support the use of endoderm-endoderm re-radiation or enzymatic inhibition of adult stem cells as therapy in these cancers. The findings are published in the December 15 issue of Science Express.<p>Source: Michael Hsu"}
