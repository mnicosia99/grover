{"title": "Aspartame in Food Contaminates Stomachs, Blood", "authors": "Patrick Blackwell Kristen Tucker Jenna Johnston Sean Murray James Little", "published_date": "03-24-2019", "affiliation": "California Polytechnic State University-San Luis Obispo, School of Physics", "text": "The highly poisonous aspartame as used as an artificial sweetener is spreading rapidly due to its structural similarity to a naturally occurring chemical compound that has been widely used as a digestive aid for centuries.<p>As a result of the prominent food scandals of recent years involving the artificial sweetener, Aspartame, two Indian epidemiological studies on mice were conducted at the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) in collaboration with National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).<p>The first study was conducted on mice against a normal background and was published on the website of the NCI in the journal Clinical Toxicology (2011; 3:18 AM). The findings showed that animals treated with Aspartame exhibited increased incidence of both colorectal cancer and bladder cancer.<p>The second study was conducted on mice against a control group and was published in the journal Blood (2011; 81:655-664) which explored the gastrointestinal system function and immune responses of Aspartame exposed mice.<p>The study was conducted on mice against a healthy control group and the Aspartame exposed mice showed a significantly increased expression of GULF2 and BRD2, which are key immune regulatory pathways associated with inflammation in stomach and gastric mucosa.<p>The findings of these two studies suggest the direct connection between Aspartame and development of gastrointestinal cancers and are used as warnings about taking Aspartame intake.<p>There have been several recent studies on the effects of Aspartame as an artificial sweetener and there have been considerable support for the observed association between Aspartame and C-Difficile (a disease of the intestinal flora that may influence the treatment of chronic infections).<p>A review of the available papers on Aspartame reported that many researchers at Northwestern University had found an association between Aspartame and the development of C-Difficile, a disease of the intestinal flora that may influence the treatment of chronic infections.<p>An earlier review of a multinational study on the health effects of Aspartame found that the sweetener increased neuroendocrine signals including tumour causing and inflammatory chemicals. Aspartame also has estrogenic chemical composition which enhances breast cancer development and spread.<p>This study is of considerable significance as it suggests that the cancer induced by Aspartame is strongly akin to that of digestive pathogen and further suggests that aspartame can induce the growth of pathogenic dysbias and develop a pathological relationship with cell mechanisms, thus leading to cancer.<p>The authors of the review clearly observed that as the sweetener is a natural product of nature, Aspartame should not be considered as a potential carcinogen or indeed as a \u201csafety concern\u201d in the study of cancer control strategies.<p>However, since most of these allegations on Aspartame have been made by anti-aspartame activists without any primary source of evidence, it is important to approach them with great skepticism and dig a little more into the source of information before making a safe conclusion.<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/irp/rls/prosciences/interscience/ccseptlitics/prev001_cnrtng.htm\">http://www.fas.org/irp/rls/...</a>"}
