{"title": "Recognizing the negative impact of rice seeds from the United States on rice farming in Japan and other Asian countries \u2013 Taku Inokuchi, Okazaki Asako Yamamoto, Sumio Takahashi, Yuji Moriwaki, and Tetsuya Yamamoto", "authors": "Eric Reilly Daniel George Ronald Dawson Jack Mathis Wendy Wilson", "published_date": "05-28-2014", "affiliation": "Central Baptist College, School of Cognitive Science", "text": "Synplicity Research Alliance, International Research Triangle Park, USA, 21 December 2011 (Reference: UC Davis Press, Volume 20, Number 2, Issue 4, Page 293)<p>In the context of pervasive regulation of rice imports in Europe, representatives of the European rice trade have been cautioned to take care when the first seeds of imports are transported to the land border with the European Union.<p>The importance of rice plants for the world\u2019s rice-growing population is undisputed. Their import is increasing and the key concern is that they have become vulnerable to insect and plant diseases and might be partially destroyed. It is highly probable that insects could destroy the soft parts of the seeds of exotic rice species, which might affect the rice crop.<p>As such, in 2009, it was reported that the Europe has decided to strictly control non-guaranteed rice imports in order to control the impact of high volumes of the imported rice on European farming. A large number of diseases and insects (cyanographeria blacklegged bryophytidae and oriental hop/cholera plume) have been reported on imported rice seeds and these should be controlled on the source soil.<p>However, during the last decade, several rice seeds have been introduced to Europe in little quantities. No exhaustive study was conducted on this matter by international and national-level regulatory agencies at the time and it is necessary to act quickly to prevent unwanted consequences.<p>In order to provide a more complete picture, the Synplicity Research Alliance, a collaborating consortium of 25 rice and rice industry institutes in Japan and around the world, submitted several research studies with a total of $10.8 million. The initial report was released in 2005 and has been updated with close to 30 research studies.<p>In this report, the following study led by Prof. Hashimoto Koji of the Hamad Medical University Hospital in Hamamatsu City in Saitama Prefecture is cited. The study reported results about the effects of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals brought from the field to fertilize rice plants imported from the United States to Japan (URIES 1-21, 24 February 2004).<p>The study on monosodium urate (MSU) crystals on rice crops (URIES 1-21, 24 February 2004)<p>Trading of rice seeds for production of high-quality rice is a global trend. Many rice trade routes have already been developed to transport seeds from South Korea, Taiwan, and the United States to Japan. In addition, U.S. rice seeds from rice-related farms have already been produced in Japan through the establishment of research farms, research institutes, and large-scale rice industry farming.<p>It has been reported that rice materials used to improve rice yields are commonly imported to Japan in small quantities from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and United States.<p>Since, once harvested, these rice varieties show several defects (worms, malnourishment) in the middle stages of the rice crop, which are medically and commercially undesirable. Thus, it is possible that rice seeds imported from the United States may affect the rice farming of farmers in Japan and could be harmful to the rice grain, the potential of the rice crop, the international rice trade, and the rice seed industry in Japan. In the next century, about 90% of the rice used to produce rice in Japan, if achieved, can be produced by field rice alone and cannot be used in the rice crop of increasing variety. This reality means that the United States should not consider decreasing the amount of imports of rice seeds to Japan. Furthermore, very high quality rice is currently produced only in small volumes and such rice is being cultivated in the United States, many rice farms with the highest yield are in Taiwan, and rice seeds imported from the United States to Japan (URIES 1-21, 24 February 2004) are used to enrich rice seeds imported by Japanese rice farms in many locations. The quality of rice seed can be directly determined by the quality of rice grain. In the process of reducing the import of rice seeds from United States, the rice seed industry of Japan must place strong emphasis on the composition of rice seeds. Therefore, the United States may benefit from exporting rice seeds to India, China, and some other countries."}
