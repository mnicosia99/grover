{"title": "Searching for new bio-active vocabulary of apoptosis and the process of cell death (Membrane Membrane)", "authors": "Miguel Smith Tamara Nolan David Nichols William Carlson Heather Williams", "published_date": "01-24-2016", "affiliation": "Troy University, School of Economics", "text": "Field hypothesis: cell death with oligomer and cell structure analysis (USP)<p>Obligatory interactions between nucleotides, nucleus elements and proteins are potentially important for cell death. SynapGebraNeuron and LuzPal collaborated with experts in chemical biology and cell structure analysis in a multidisciplinary effort to study, understand and speculate about this phenomenon. In this project, Aebi, Fang Qiang, and previous contributions to the Chromatin Membrane and Oligomer Research article on cell death organogenesis, researchers compared the genomic signature of proteins on the activation of the nucleus of cells in the aftermath of apoptosis, namely apoptosis of bacilli.<p>Different states of active functionalities on the outer shell of the cell are only possible with a combination of nucleotides and proteins. On one hand, the presence of some nucleotides cannot activate an active function on the cell while on the other hand certain nucleotides can activate an active function of cell, such as silencing RNA or of genes. Moreover, the outgoing and incoming RNA and protein profiles are very different. Despite cellular phenomena of apoptosis and coordinated death of the cell, the mechanisms are still not very well understood. Insights from this project and interdisciplinary colleagues in other fields regarding the interferences of the regulator mechanisms in the cell and how the cell dies can be used for research into apoptosis and the process of cell death.<p>Pioneering work in transcriptional regulation and cell death research is shown in the new issue of Chromatin Membrane . Findings concerning apoptosis and synapGebraNeuron are available from the SIGNews portal. In addition, regarding field hypothesis: Aebi, Fang Qiang and project partners are featured in biomednews.nl , which explores the field hypothesis for a new biotechnology project in the field of stem cell development. The project is led by Zaki Barakat, Professor at the University of Twente and Alpinys Professer at the Academic Medical Center, VU Amsterdam.<p>Related News articles<p>Field hypothesis: cell death with oligomer and cell structure analysis (USP)<p>Click here to read more<p>Pioneering work in transcriptional regulation and cell death research is shown in the new issue of Chromatin Membrane .
