However, I would be reckless and rely too much on my own experiences and would lose my credibility as a sexual health expert, which may be just as bad, if not worse.<p>After having sex with my boyfriend, I get either pains in my vagina or in the lower abdomen, sometimes both. When I had sex recently, I noticed that I couldn\u2019t get to the other side of the bed as I quickly shifted over to the right so as to reach and lie down on the bed on the left. I tried to have sex with my boyfriend again, but when I came out of bed, I felt fatigue and felt my body had gone dry (that\u2019s a medical term). I didn\u2019t want to show any weakness, so I remained silent until we had finished.<p>When I sit and relax after going to bed, I have discomfort in my groin. It feels like someone is having sex with me. I even had a particularly weird feeling of squeezing my urine stream onto my thighs and buttocks, but it didn\u2019t bother me, as it didn\u2019t feel like I was leaking anything.<p>The feeling is really amazing and brilliant, but a strange sensation is inside me, along with sexual sensations that emanate from my legs and bladder area.<p>It\u2019s this unknown sensation inside me that arouses my curiosity, and with that, a need to probe further to find out what it is that causes this mysterious sensation. I think it might be pleasure itself that is increasing the likelihood of some unexpected side effects. This sensation is fast and sudden, like something very pressing in my body. I am very freaked out, and my mind can\u2019t understand what is happening. I can\u2019t recall such feelings since I had my first period in high school! At this point, a quick check-up is not something I can do. In fact, I\u2019m tired of having a negative effect on my current partner and am just used to just trying to tolerate my symptoms.<p>*Update (Dec. 24): Yuji Moriwaki, a practicing gynecologist (one of the pioneers in Japan), shared some of his knowledge to clarify the sensation in a blog post on Takahashi HealthTalk. A very helpful technique that is commonly used to examine a young man after having sex is to pinch the penis with a strong combination of pressure in the opposite and then above the labia. It would enable the examination on the penis to be done in a more non-invasive manner. It is my opinion that the 'experiment' with the pressure technique might be helpful in our scientific method in understanding this sensation caused by genital penetration. I will share it with you after we read the new blog post.<p>Source: qperception.com"}
