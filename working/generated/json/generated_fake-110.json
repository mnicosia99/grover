Specifically, following daily consumption of ethanol, the body processes more of the molecules that break down monosodium urate into less-consuming compounds. The mouse test animals and human test subjects consumed 10 percent ethanol or 120 mg/day, while human test subjects consumed 150 mg/day of ethanol (300 mg/day in continuous consumption). The animals subjected to ethanol consumed more compounds than the mice using placebo. The mice that consumed 10 percent ethanol exhibited diminished urate crystals at higher concentrations, whereas the mice using the placebo displayed increased urate crystals at higher concentrations. Both males and females suffered greater toxicity when subjected to alcohol consumption. Results suggested that consumption of ethanol decreases urate crystals in the intestinal tract.<p>Reference:<p>Taku Inokuchi and Yoshuhiro Miya-Kataoka, \u201cEffects of ethanol on monosodium urate crystal-induced inflammation\u201d (European Journal of Physiology, Vol. 63, No. 1, December 2011) (doi:10.1080/19325033.2011.0081365)"}
