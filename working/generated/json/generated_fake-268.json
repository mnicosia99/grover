Although it is known that amyloid-beta is linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia, this condition is the first one that we can readily measure, so that those suffering with similar symptoms can be identified quickly.<p>This is one of the discoveries of Japanese researcher Hiroshi Yamamoto, who was the first to explicitly link amyloid-beta deposition in the brain of healthy volunteers with the Ginkgo biloba supplements he has been treating for the past decade.<p>Yamamoto was unable to determine the exact cause of amyloid-beta depletion. He therefore separated the symptoms from the underlying cause, demonstrating, among other things, that amyloid-beta depletion is due to injections of supplement.<p>Previous research on this topic, based on memory and cognition, has shown clear correlation between Ginkgo biloba supplements and secondary amyloid-beta accumulation. The increased concentrations of amyloid-beta in the brain of the Ginkgo biloba supplement users also weakens their memory and cognition.<p>In many studies, including those conducted in Yamamoto\u2019s laboratory, the absorption of Ginkgo biloba supplements increases circulating amyloid-beta concentrations.<p>Yamamoto tested if the consumption of Ginkgo biloba containing amyloid-beta supplementation is not only common but also beneficial in healthy populations. His research showed that a very slight rise in amyloid-beta does not affect the memory and cognition, but, instead, decreases the concentration of other sorts of beta-amyloid, such as glutamate, which is the precursor to other amyloid-\u03b2 products.<p>Our bodies have many forms of beta-amyloid and some are more harmful than others. One of the forms, amyloid-betauria, accumulates in cells, while others accumulate in the brain, making it difficult to kill these deposits. Without treatment, amyloid-betauria reduces our cognition and ability to learn.<p>Yamamoto\u2019s research shows that amyloid-beta depletion is possible in healthy people by administering Ginkgo biloba supplement for an extended period of time.<p>Ginkgo biloba use among health care providers is relatively small. This year, however, it has been included on the Japanese government\u2019s list of recommended substances.<p>Minoru Ishihara, Chief of the Correlation and Entropy Laboratory at the Graduate School of Medical Science in Tokyo, said: \u201cThis is a case study involving a single study and it is difficult to say whether Ginkgo biloba will be included on the official government list.\u201d<p>Although he still believes that it is needed to check many more studies before providing a positive recommendation, Yamamoto\u2019s research into amyloid-beta depletion has shown that its benefits outweigh the drawbacks."}
