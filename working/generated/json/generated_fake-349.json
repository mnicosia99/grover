They were given intravenous immunosuppressant hormones to prevent viral attacks as part of a clinical trial. The immunosuppressant substances were then replaced by a Zika virus vaccine \u2013 injected into a patient\u2019s arm - after a one month wait.<p>The eight patients recovered or showed dramatic signs of improvement after the treatment, and were released.<p>In three of the patients who received treatment from SGH, their hemoptysis did not return to normal soon after they completed the treatment.<p>\u201cIt was suspected that they had continued to have an infection and reactivated the Hemoptysis,\u201d explained Kwok-yung Yuen, a senior consultant at SGH.<p>The three patients, described by their treating doctors as being \u201cout of control\u201d with a fever, lethargy and lethargy, all continued to have fever and lethargy for at least six months after receiving treatment.<p>In September 2010, one of the three patients was taken back to SGH from New York on a non-emergency basis. He was diagnosed with contract gay Paretia 3A, a viral infection transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito.<p>The next month, a fourth patient who was also infected with Zika virus tested positive for Zika. He was also treated for Hemoptysis and diagnosed with Zika. He is now on antiretroviral therapy.<p>\u201cWhat has occurred is that, after treatment of Hemoptysis, the virus itself has acquired latent protein in some patients and caused a local reactivation of the virus,\u201d said Yuen.<p>Yuen\u2019s team is now conducting a study to develop a Zika vaccine or anti-viral medicine that will effectively prevent reactivation of the virus in dormant in a patient. The results are expected in mid-2012.<p>The trial is part of a South-east Asian (SEA) project to identify possible Zika virus-associated secondary infections. It involves five countries in Southeast Asia \u2013 Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Singapore \u2013 and 16 hospitals.<p>It also provides an opportunity to confirm the role of Hemoptysis in the initial act of Zika virus infection in a patient.<p>\u201cWe can currently rule out conjunctivitis and malaria infection at initial blood samples and blood cultures. There is also no doubt about those infections following the Hemoptysis treatment,\u201d said Yuen.<p>After receiving treatment for Hemoptysis, it is also possible for some patients to show fever within two weeks. The team will conduct post-treatment blood tests on some of the patients, and follow-up blood cultures, for confirmation.<p>\u201cThis study may provide vital evidence on its efficacy,\u201d said Yuen.<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) may fund the study."}
