Spanish language users are way ahead of us in their language habits and vocabulary.<p>The original cartoon carries just one line of jokes. Which, I am sure, is written very close to how it is in Spanish, as it is in almost every other language, even if it is lost on English speakers.<p>The word \u201cC4\u201d, as in homologous to endorphin, is an abbreviation in Spanish for sex hormone and, once it is present in the body, C4 causes performance and energy enhancement.<p>By causing this, C4 invites sexual relationships, and it is said to bring on sexual performance. It is also thought that as soon as there is C4 in the blood, the emotions are released.<p>And with the release of these emotions, the promiscuity can begin.<p>This, I am sure, is what the Spanish have felt during the Christmas period!<p>Barbara R.
