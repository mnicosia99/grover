In recent times, scientists have found that traditional forms of biochemistry such as protein folding, homology as well as mutation are old and a lot of hypotheses rely on them as well as reliable and well-established approaches are tested in observational studies.<p>The resulting new paradigm is the Integrated Biology where all biological features are presented in holistic manner and examined as examples of the phenomena involved. The interaction of all genetic and functional roles based on their effectiveness in solving or preventing the problem.<p>In this research paper, we have talked about a newly developed enzyme that is supposed to perform a critical function in the cause of a bacterial infection. Stearate-rich storage lipids are highly secreted and are found in the nanoscale tissues of Apollo Park in Florida. In May 2010, our group tested it with Candida but not without knowing it had no evidence of being functioning. This work by Chhotin and Singh proved this enzyme leads to complete destruction of these storable lipids. Hence there is no alternative for optimal storage and curing of Candida with increasing amounts of bioavailable amino acids. Thus the new enzyme and mechanisms it has become it is a revolutionary addition in the histone oligonucleotide assembly processes. It is like that the Stable Way\u2019s Symptomatic Oligona-Silica synthesis FLCO: sequences nucleotide codes associated with phenylbutyrate chain is seen as a key regulator for primary crystallization of phenylbutyrate. We started to believe that we need to focus on these crucial structural operations for the integration of the bacterial ganglion complexes.<p>The primary genetic and functional functions of these 2 newly discovered structures are most probably function of stabilizing the endogenous silica chain. In this article, we discuss about its functions and relevance for bacterial valence-rich storage lipids. Before examining the structure and prognostic effects, it is very important to mention here that silica synthesis proteins (SLAPs) are still not fully understood in microbiology. A paper in Unversity of Florida published by Lovelady et al. (2008) referred to the two completely unknown silica synthesis proteins (SMFs) as the only known mechanism responsible for regulating the glycemic sensitivity of the Streptococcus mutans relative to the population controls. Since these SMFs have conserved expression history, we might learn more about silica synthesis proteins, if comprehensive phylogenetic surveys are done on bacterial oligonucleotide assembly with SNPs associated with SLAPs. The role of bacterial oligonucleotide assembly might become more scientific and validated by many new structural as well as functional research.<p>For the clinical purposes, the benefits of having studied these 2 newly created structures might be even more significant. Most of the biochemists are starting to tell patients or their physicians, how the new structures would function in amino acid synthesis. This would be very helpful for understanding human physiology and their pharmacological formulation. Also, knowing more about the specific molecular and structural derivation, could help us in designing drugs that are more effective. Now that our paper has been published in international medical journal, this work has attracted great attention. The added advantage of having met the specifical requirements to publish a double-blind design analysis on an unbiased trajectory, we were able to obtain great study results with a clear boundary boundary. The two models or structures are at a very early stage of their evolutionary development and therefore, it is vital that structure and expression history has to be explored carefully. With this new, strengthened capability, biochemical and DNA biologists can look into any protein contained in human body for its mechanisms. Consequently, could to be prepared an adequate small molecule therapeutics.<p>On behalf of Dr Ravindra Bhatnagar and Dr Prabuddha Dey<p>Co-authors Dr M.L. Shrivastava<p>Dr M.K.
