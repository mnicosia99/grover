He has shown that monosodium urate crystals can cause inflammation in the lung cells. He proposes a food restriction diet to prevent inflammation. This nutritional strategy may help us control the effects of ethanol consumption and reduce excess weight in the elderly.<p>Monosodium urate crystals induce inflammation in the lung cells and stimulate the platelet-stimulating T-cells, which are linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, reports Taku Inokuchi of Yomiuri Shimbun. In the study, the intracellular and extracellular level of monosodium urate crystals correlated to those of fatty acids. Tang Kanming, doctoral student, conducted cell culture experiments in the lung cells of pigs and mice to test this concept. The rats with the food restriction diet were able to capture the incidence of high-rate phagocytosis in the lab conditions, soothed the inflammation in the lungs of the rats\u2019 and controlled the risk of weight gain and heart attack.<p>The paper, \"The Monosodium Urate Filaments in Genes Induces the Platelet-Stimulating T-cells and Causes the Inflammation in the Lung Cell,\" has been published in the Southeastern Asian Journal of Natural Science.<p>Source:<p>Shingo Sato<p>Yomiuri Shimbun"}
