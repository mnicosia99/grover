(In this area, more than 40% of drugs sold via ECNs are dispensed over CD and mail-order pharmacies rather than through them.) Instead, electronic pharmacies may be misusing electronic pharmacies to track prescriptions and drug dosage. Studies of ESRBs show that their use adds an additional step to the prescription approval and dispensing process, limiting the opportunity for timely dispensing and adding to workloads of pharmacists. These steps are likely to reduce drug misuse.<p>Neither electronic pharmacies nor e-prescribing has any proven effects on the dispense or identify of contaminated medical and dietary products or adulterated over-the-counter drugs. Electronic pharmacy technology tools are likely to be mostly efficient at tracking medications rather than health promotion or preventing medications from being discarded."}
