{"title": "Human dorsal embryonic stem cell model of autism", "authors": "Rebecca Hill Carolyn Marquez Jacob Russell Anthony Banks Samantha Carpenter", "published_date": "10-19-2017", "affiliation": "California Baptist University, School of Cognitive Science", "text": "Analyses of several cell line models of neuronal development as a model of autism were published as part of the present study. The cellular and molecular complexities of the cell cycle and development underlie many developmental disorders in all vertebrates, and the host of genetic causes can be further influenced by the patient\u2019s genetic information during different developmental stages. In human ESCs a search of the genome was conducted in view of the primordial and RNA programming of SNPs in the same sequences. Further molecular analysis was performed in order to determine possible similarities between humans and ESCs. The result showed a certain bloodline distribution of nucleic acid stands between SNPs, depending on gene-level differentiation, ranging from 110 nm along the hemispheres of coding NFkB and SGCC alleles to 30 nm along TRP-invalids. Using SEM procedures, retinal areas were stained using EFDA in seven different regions of color optic activity in human cells and in retinal tissues of mice and Drosophila. The histograms showed an accumulation of UUGA and an aggregation of SNPs on the right brain hemispheres of the affected Drosophila and human ESCs, leaving the left brain hemispheres free. Further analysis were carried out by gene expression analysis to ascertain the specific communication between UUGA and SNPs, thereby demonstrating differentiations between OCT4A and its Pseudogenes in human ESCs. The differentiations were detailed for salivary, pancreatic, lung, and epithelial cells."}
