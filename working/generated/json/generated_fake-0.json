The image in the table below shows the mechanism in which cytokines (genetic resistance to the influence of cytokines in the body) may cause the inflammation that is induced by ethanol-induced liver damage.<p>Ethanol: raised in diuretic intake and gut epithelial expression of FGF24 and TNF\u03b1 mediates triggered by elevations in metabolites of hydroxyuranic acid (HUAC); diuretic glucose tolerance is the initial trigger.<p>Sucrose: raised in the intestine by diuretic intake and the decreased expression of histone deacetylase (HDAC), which is responsible for immune memory; activation of B-cells stimulates the immune response leading to increased levels of antibody and pyruvate hydroxylase and peptides of IL-2/3 stimulate inflammatory processes.<p>Total nephrotoxicosis: increased inflammation and infection with the bacterium E. coli were also found in the liver (doi:10.1056/NEJMoa1103052)."}
