Pneumoniae Superbug: Deterioration of Typology, Genomics", "authors": "Rodney King Barbara Bryant Michael Spencer Kelly Wagner Kyle Guerrero", "published_date": "11-11-2019", "affiliation": "Biola University, School of Chemistry", "text": "On December 13, 2011, the New York State Department of Health published this casebook for Klebsiella pneumoniae, a protozoan microorganism that causes serious but treatable disease in respiratory tract and the intestinal tract, mostly in the young. The bacterium\u2019s \u201cdeadly aflatoxins\u201d act as cytotoxic compounds, killed more than 3,600 people in the United States between 1978 and 1993.<p>This casebook consists of 22 close-look at 15 cases of K. pneumoniae infections in New York and in Canada and 21 normal cases with similar symptoms of allergy to an iron deficiency-like condition. Early K. pneumoniae colonization in the lungs in these patients, may suggest the possibility of immuno-suppressant-mediated transformation of these common bacteria, but we are limited to describing the pathogenesis and antibiotic treatment of these cases by the organisms that infect them.<p>The first \u201ccases\u201d are observations of normal cases of K. pneumoniae infection who do not have any structural abnormality in the intestine, but had acute, related outbreaks and died. Infections tend to be much more resistant to antibiotic treatments, than the typical cases in patients with chronic infection with the organism, since it is able to stay long enough in the intestine for the infection to become resistant to an antibiotic, whereas the lung infection might be more dependent on the patient\u2019s mucous membrane.<p>Between the follow-up of the 3-year-old K. pneumoniae genome maps that were published in 2010 in the PLoS Pathogens (see <a href=\"http://www.plospediatrics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1005919)\">http://www.plospediatrics.o...</a>, with the continued harmonization of their results, the researchers might eventually find a cure for this disease. The causes of this epidemic are still unknown to us. Patients from it were more likely infected by antibiotic resistant strains of the organism. To keep the infections as long as possible, infected bacteria may form separate micro-flavors- genetic diversity of micro-flavors is less over time and is much better protected from surveillance, antibiotic treatment, and detection.<p>undefined"}
