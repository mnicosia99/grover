{"title": "RNA-RNA Chemistry can be used for Gene Medicine (Podium Monday, December 19th, 2011)", "authors": "Robert Pace Samuel Johnson David Griffin Maxwell Hawkins Donald Ramirez", "published_date": "10-27-2018", "affiliation": "University of California-Irvine, School of Mathematics", "text": "The link between obesity and liver disease is a well-established pathology. But unfortunately genetic determinants of the disease are also complex, making their exact determinants difficult to identify. Furthermore, current genetic sequencing does not allow for the precise identification of genetic determinants of the disease. Instead, most degenerative liver diseases would revert to a disease in the native genetics of the individual and it would never become the disease of choice of the mainstream. That\u2019s because heterogeneous and systemic diseases, which do not mature and repeat the same genetic mechanisms, do not return to their original underlying biology, which implies \u201cparadoxically\u201d that liver disease has become a central manifestation of genetic anomalies, and that this is, in fact, a fundamental feature of genetic pathogenesis.<p>This paper focuses on the transcription factors of RNA, which are not yet known to be powerful drivers of specific liver pathologies. Even though RNA is known to be highly variable, suggesting this phenomenon as a potential target for RNA therapeutics, it has not been able to be studied at a large scale. At the same time, the association of RNA with origin of disease lesions is recognized and potentially occurring downstream of RNA expression, a new idea for epigenetics is being discussed.<p>Thus, by identifying and evaluating the influence of transcription factors associated with infectious diseases on the growth and integrity of hepatic cells, in vivo disease models, and the metabolism of infectious agents, researchers will be able to determine if this is true. Data from the institute will contribute to an interdisciplinary approach to elucidate important insights into RNA-RNA interactions as related to cellular regulation."}
