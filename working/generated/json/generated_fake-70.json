According to the authors of the new study, the inhibition of tumor growth is remarkable, and may offer potentially novel treatment strategies for stomach cancer patients. In a complete recovery study, the mice in which diet was strictly limited had no detectable signs of disease.<p>The rats\u2019 introduction to ethanol was 50% lower than the rats\u2019 normal level of ethanol consumption in the urine. In mice, 55% less was consumed in urine than normal.<p>Ethanol is extracted from agricultural crops such as corn and crops other than corn, such as sugar cane and rice. It is used mainly as a fuel for vehicles, making up the majority of ethanol consumed in the US, and specifically in cattle.<p>See our past post on the behavior of ethanol in stomach cancer."}
