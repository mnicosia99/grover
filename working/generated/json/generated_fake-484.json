The investigators described in a recent publication in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that they observed that epithelial epithelial cells from mouse intestine (similar to the human intestine) exhibited a pronounced uptake of calcium and then toxic accumulation in the prion, which determined during random videos in 3-D, which of the 7 \u201cmodel cells\u201d were capable of immortalizing stems cells that are capable of producing other different cells with special proteins that aid in differentiation. Further studies, determined that these \u201cmodel cells\u201d can evolve into a host tissue in a single day.<p>The report also revealed that the model cells developed biologically into a vital organ, i.e. liver, indicating that stem cells in such environments do indeed undergo a change, and, that a \u201cstem cell enterponitive tissue\u201d is not just a matter of taking cells from a human and grafting them onto another.<p>The final stages of stem cell proliferation offer a unique insight into potential stem cell models of degenerative diseases, says the researchers.<p>It is well known that current methods in the field of regenerative medicine (therapeutics) are not efficient at replacing lost cells in human tissue. Comparisons have been made with stem cells that are already active in human and animal tissue and that may appear to re-establish bone formation, for example, which showed, however, that further investigation is needed to ascertain how biological activation of those stem cells would make possible biochemical reasons for their differentiation.<p>Inhibition of the activity of these unknown function mechanisms must also be demonstrated to achieve suitable intervention.<p>Source: Leslie R.
