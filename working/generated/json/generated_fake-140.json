We noted that, due to the fluid nature of the polysaccharides, the interaction with ethanol was limited to cells provided for cell cultures.<p>Water breakdown alone could not fully alter the composition of the polysaccharides. As discussed earlier, glucose-breaking biosynthesis is very soluble but causes the peptides to break up into polymers. To understand the ability of ethanol to increase the polysaccharide mass, we repeated the test with barley and lentils but again observed that the presence of ethanol had no effect on the structure composition. We conducted an indirect experiment to explain the conclusion that the polysaccharides were hydrolyzed by glucose, as glucose is unstable and does not produce free nitric oxide [NOH]. Single-molecule molecules of NOH or proteins which absorb NOH without reaction were added to all the polysaccharides so that they reacted with ethanol. The polysaccharides were highly stable without reaction, likely due to their very high insoluble quantity and low solubility [NT/SC]. This limited the structural change induced by sugar interaction with ethanol, a feature that is widely attributed to fructose.<p>Again, we found no effects of ethanol on bioactive peptides. On the other hand, multiple animals with injection of ethanol after feeding showed the presence of viral pathogens in their blood and intestinal tissue. These included E. coli, adenovirus, poliovirus, pseudomonas and HSV. Given that these viral pathogens do not respond to conventional chemical inhibitors such as oxysterase or ribocytomycin, we are uncertain if their presence was caused by ethanol use in animals. However, the presence of O. coli and adenovirus (two pathogens classified as O+ and VI) in the specimens without Ethanol was indicative that E. coli or adenovirus were actually the agents causing the acute inflammation. Based on this, we infer that additional studies, especially on viral agents, are warranted."}
