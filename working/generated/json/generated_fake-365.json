Ethanol, however, sticks around in a state called auto-detoxifying, and by reducing the work of the enzyme lactase leads to the presence of erythritol acid, which is also toxic. So to get the ethanol out of the body by cutting lactase stores we have to reduce energy production, and thus we get a more ill-fated solution: fatty acids and glycogen accumulates in muscle fibres, and by decreasing their releases insulin tends to decrease blood glucose control.<p>\u201cThis is sometimes followed by greater destruction of the muscle, which is like a physical acid without lactase available to kill off, which then acts as a trigger for more damage.\u201d<p>In the picture above you can see the enzyme lactase in action at the base of a protein tube, eliminating lactate, and creating protein. Though we might never notice it unless we compare the operation of one of the processes of the entire body to another, the benefits of this enzyme are numerous. They include a half of all excretion of lactate from the body, stopping bone loss and assuring that hormone synthesis does not interfere with blood glucose regulation."}
