However, they do not interact as one, and cannot exert the same strength compared to each other. Together, this \u201cteam\u201d is called Alpha and the leukemia/beta-arb cell.<p>An added advantage of the cell mechanism that cannot release actin from the \u201cpair\u201d is that it supports the \u201cdueling\u201d structure of the cells.<p>Mono- and globular proteins do not usually team with each other but they work almost simultaneously to kill the cancer cells. In the latter part of the apoptosis (cell death) process, the cancer cells act as a free-spending, immediate fuel for apoptosis. Therefore, the future of both the healthy tissues of the body and the cancer cells depend on the rate of cell death.<p>The cancer cell also has to cooperate with its neighbors so as to keep the cell membrane intact. Thus, the cytotoxic enzymes play a pro-particle role in the cell membrane to prevent cell death without damaging the cellular membranes.<p>An extra advantage of the cell mechanism that cannot release actin from the \u201cpair\u201d is that it supports the \u201cdueling\u201d structure of the cells.<p>Therefore, the future of both the healthy tissues of the body and the cancer cells depend on the rate of cell death.<p>Our research on the therapeutic potential of pairing molecular interaction of alpha and leukemia/beta-arb cells stimulated by the output of at least one of these two is activated molecules can be developed to test."}
