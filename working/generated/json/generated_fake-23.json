Without this substance, the heart cannot regulate blood pressure enough, leading to heart attacks, strokes and sudden death. And many a time, those that consume L-carnitine themselves will become obese.<p>But this is not the end of the story.<p>L-carnitine, or instead, more specifically, the neuroactive molecules made out of it, is an essential amino acid used as a neurotransmitter.<p>According to the university\u2019s Research on L-carnitine Systems and Animals (REALiA), this amino acid used to become neuroactive when it\u2019s in properly oxygenated conditions.<p>Using animal models, the teams at NLBI and Sumioni Hospital discovered how L-carnitine is broken down and can be fermented. By letting our small blood vessels and coronary arteries receive oxygen-rich blood, the L-carnitine molecule can break down and become the active neuroactive part of the organ.<p>Researcher Shinya Nambu of Sumioni Hospital says: \u201cWhat we believe is that toxic chemicals directly in our environment could lead to other adverse medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, even as early as childhood.\u201d<p>The researcher contends that with this new knowledge, the scientists have found a way to control the activity of L-carnitine, which has the potential to promote a more healthy heart in individuals with high blood pressure."}
