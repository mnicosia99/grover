{"title": "Ageing Of Prostate, Testosterone Aggressor Of Ovarian Densities?", "authors": "Amber Maxwell Kim Owens Brianna Walker Timothy Townsend Robert Dorsey", "published_date": "01-30-2016", "affiliation": "California State University-Bakersfield, School of Mathematics", "text": "This research team from the Kyoto University found that old Spi (Spizard) transcription factors that were regulated into adulthood with epithelial progenitor cell lines were not activated during androgen deprivation following the amelioration of estrogen.<p>As estrogen reduces male puberty and the capability of sperm to transport the body\u2019s proteins (penis) through the egg (ovary), increased testosterone has been shown to suppress the proliferation of such compounds. Research on evolutionary relevance of the ageing of prostate-regulating hormones has shown that off-metabolism of aging hormones in prostate cells, most of which have been regulated by particular transcription factors, have become stronger. Decreased estrogen, another factor known to regulate prostate proteins expressed in a variety of tissue, is thought to increase the potential for excessive proliferation of such molecules and lower the potential for ability of epidermal progenitor cells to accommodate such substances. Conversely, more androgen in prostate cells may reverse ageing hormone suppression.<p>Building on these aging hormone loss theories, we investigated aging estrogen levels in prostate epithelial cells growing in culture. Our observations indicated increased signals from 1 to 2 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) building blocks for Proanthrenes, the proteins that regulate epithelial-gene interaction, in the control of fat transcription and in cancer growth. In cells where the early progenitor cells are kept alive for at least two years, we also observed that the main spinneret transcription factor in the early p4 cells, Spi, appeared to be reduced. This de-activated Spi was again activated by after the amelioration of estrogen. By contrast, control cells that could not tolerate the activity of Spi, could not be taken up by the epigenetic system. Thus, these prostate epithelial epithelial cells seem to be sensitive to aging hormones, which could result in increased cancer cell proliferation."}
