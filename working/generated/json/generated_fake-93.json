COB-1 is an endogenous protein of the bacterium Lymphagma bovis and widely used for analyses to detect molecular signs of bacterial resistance to protease inhibitors such as BDK9/MGK7-IO. The LC-MS, LAT and Arase experiments were then conducted to examine the output quality of COB-1 microproteins. The whole study was then verified using key clinical observations that included a plasma culture experiment and molecular characterization of their metabolite K1-delta1-H2-AS at the 7 nm (UCP) free polymerase and synthesis experiments with surface protein mRNAs. The projected cleavage coefficients of COB-1 microproteins in vivo were lower than those found in the wastewater, while a similar trend was seen for K1-delta1-H2-AS metabolite results. This indicates that results obtained by future research will clearly support the assumption that COB-1 microproteins are involved in the enzymatic and pharmacological ability of the bacterium to resist antibiotics. As these experiments further validate and quantify the presence of COB-1 in human urine and are currently in hand-held water sampling are directly applicable for important human biofeedback measures, such as measurement of urinary protozoa/intestinal microbiota concentrations. Advantages of hand-held water sampling methods include simplified clinical examination, large surface area area, conformance to individual/groups within the human body and relatively rapid turnaround time."}
