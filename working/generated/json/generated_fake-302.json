The present findings demonstrate how to achieve that by focusing on one of the first antibiotic resistance mechanisms, namely the chloroquine binding kinase (TCK) growth factor, in the profile of STEC isolates from an outbreak.\u201d<p>In E. coli the expression level of TCK has been found in a number of bacterial families and in mammals (penicillium, phylum Serodus) as well as other host types. This TCK is a transcription factor that affects DNA methylation and can elicit TKKB protein expression. A number of well-established TKKB genes are: TCK 9B4- TKKB- H8- and KKB3A- TKKB- BCLK-K9- KBB1- TKB-PKC (Bacteriolibynidia). These genes act as transcription factors and drive genetic changes. These genes are associated with resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive bacteria and exposure to these genes induces transcriptional activity against antibiotic resistance targets (BATK-P).<p>According to the authors, \u201cThe paper is an important addition to the growing literature that empirically demonstrates bacteria are genetically engineered to become resistant to antibiotics. It also outlines the control and elimination efforts for these resistant genes.\u201d<p>This article was published in PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases."}
