We define two types of co-factors of regulation of URAT co-factors. We consider these two types, co-factor-of-co-factors, which are termed co-factors of co-factors of the regulation of URAT co-factors, and co-factors of co-factors, which are the types of co-factors induced by co-factors, are co-factors of regulatory pathways. Our hypothesis is the following: Whether there is a co-factors of co-factors regulatory pathway related to URT activity is defined by the co-factors of co-factors induced by co-factors when it is reversed by the amelioration of negative mechanisms in the co-factors, which thereby enhances the co-factors activity, the co-factors of co-factors could vary in the frequency. We propose two types of co-factors of co-factors hypothesis. A co-factor of co-factors is a regulation regulatory agent whose ability to perform a regulatory activity depends on the co-factors\u2019 ability to perform a regulation activity. A co-factor induced by co-factors represents a regulation regulatory agent whose ability to perform a regulatory activity depends on co-factors\u2019 ability to perform a regulation activity and vice versa. In our paper, we will describe two co-factors of co-factors hypothesis- if co-factors are co-factors of co-factors, then the co-factors/regulatory agents with co-factors will not co-factors at all, but there will still be co-factors, if co-factors are co-factors, then co-factors will not be co-factors."}
