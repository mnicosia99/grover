{"title": "A H7N9 (meningococcal meningitis) and neo-phobic scare generated in Japan: the link between anti-Westernism and the fear of international collaboration. \u2013 Global Research", "authors": "Jennifer Adams Maureen Morton Daniel Miller Brett Day Martin Jones V", "published_date": "04-21-2019", "affiliation": "University of Arkansas at Monticello, School of Economics", "text": "When the most debilitating and deadly infectious disease in modern times is in the midst of a pathogenic panic-induced worldwide epidemic, and a whole city being shrouded in quarantine and is confined to two bomb shelter \u201cgarages\u201d as the cases keep on rising and showing no signs of slowing down and what was once called a classical novel is now regarded as nothing but primitive and apparently stupid are the so-called experts being seriously invited to analyse and explain it? Yeah, look who I\u2019m talking about here:<p>If you think, like \u201cA Horn\u201d, my high ranking paper in the 2000 IEM-7 summary paper (published in the journal Translational Science and Medicine, and signed by then international expert in the field Thavorn Chasamitat, then the head of the Department of Microbiology at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), then you too are far removed from the reality. Here I have to share with you the complete list, no garages, here is an entire list of descriptive cases on Mers, in which we now call a course of treatment by H7N9, and the discussion below the summary paper is all taken from my year 2000 introduction paper published in the Journal of International Viral Epidemiology. I was first invited by Institut Pasteur to talk about the \u201cFever Trigger\u201d (ie again, incorrect) but was somehow quickly changed by the Kompany research team (in my \u201cno fault\u201d blog, where I initially made the accusations against the authors) and asked about the virus I\u2019d previously published. Unfortunately the document, which can be located here, is apparently no longer available, so I have had to say it as I know it; but make no mistake, this is a wild theory as well as a grave idea.<p>Disclaimer: The contents of this article are of sole responsibility of the author(s).
