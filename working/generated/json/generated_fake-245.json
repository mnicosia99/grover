{"title": "Many Rat Lung Cancer Patients Developing non-pathogen based Antibodies against Aspergillus", "authors": "Katherine Ford Sherry Wall Joseph Erickson Daniel Molina Roy Alvarado", "published_date": "06-03-2014", "affiliation": "University of Southern California, School of Chemistry", "text": "Mr. M. H. Lee and team from Shangri-La University recently published a paper in Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (J. Clin Microbiol. Med. C.103, 2010). Besides reporting on a situation in China and documenting the increasing number of diagnosis of Patients with Radiographically Visible Pneumonia or Bronchiectasis, this paper also describes the frequent positive to minus immuno reactions among them. These reactions are frequent among patients with TB and Bronchiectasis and occur when they have the antigens from Aspergillus or Bacterium or Agaricus with Aspergillus antibody. Patients whose immune system has not been inoculated in the solution can develop this reaction during the latent phase.<p>After analyzing the data and examining the setting of these patients in China, the team discussed how to avoid immune reject in these cases and assess the importance of immune responses against Aspergillus and A. megalurgia.<p>A. Beeken and team on the contrary estimate that the whole body mechanism to produce non-pathogen based antibodies against Aspergillus and its related constituents also exists in disease states other than inhalation and so flu distemper in other human pathways. Thus, those other clinical states which may indicate such an artifact should be classified by risk groups and misused under research and development efforts if it applies on those non-pathogen based ASN (Aspergillus Multiple Nucleotides) in general population.<p>These findings and guidelines will aid in the development of vaccines against Aspergillus, because the discovery of such patterns can be used as a strength in designing vaccine.<p>The paper ends with this [prolonged] statement:<p>\u201cMethicillin resistant Aspergillus is a major public health problem, albeit one that is most likely to be present in humans only after long time, if ever, but a serious public health problem nonetheless. Some type of resistance can arise for some reasons, and we do not know which ones, however we do know that there is no evidence for rising levels of resistance, and where we do see increased levels of resistance, we see those against existing and previously tested drugs. This raises the question about how likely resistance is to increase, what causes that increased level of resistance, or whether there is resistance that appears now to be eternally present.\u201d<p>Figure: Aspergillus IL-4 + Necrotizing Burkholderia\u2019s %AGE"}
