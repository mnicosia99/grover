This nephron-directed RNA editing mechanism of Parkinson\u2019s disease is a fully confirmed and studied project. To our delight, we have discovered an RNA editing mechanism that had been missed in the earlier experiments.<p>Glucose aggregates, disease-promoting dysplasias \u2013 It was in this study that we discovered that changes in the cell\u2019s metabolic process is contributing to a polycythemia vera-like phenotype. On the other hand, the nucleic acid inserts into the genome were highly regulated for tumor immunity and defense. The control mechanism of changes in kidney tumor aggressiveness identified in the work allowed us to be able to identify the protein involved in the mechanism that regulates these changes.<p>Imagine a struggle to keep alive without blood supply \u2013 This concept describes the general lack of oxygen and oxygen use in PVA patients. The blood supply to these patients requires a dire necessity of rejection, thus the inclusion of cytotoxic factors. However, we also discovered that, the tumor did not grow very strongly despite high levels of advanced cellular growth factors. This suggests that cytokines are another of the major players involved in the active immunology of the polycythemia vera. We further believe that tumor aggressiveness is more closely related to melanoma than to PVA patients, as melanoma and PVA are genetically relatively different.<p>Uncovering the channels that modulate the expression of genes are just a short step further from each other. To be able to study the physical mechanism of the tumors is a much bigger task. This research was initiated by a project in Parkinson\u2019s disease where we can now use mouse models of diseases to better understand the mechanisms in which the conditions of Parkinson\u2019s disease are controlled. By classifying the ways of tumor infiltration, early detection and effective treatments, we can explore many new treatments and could also shed new light on the disease genes.<p>Anahita Rahmani is a Research Assistant at UC Davis MIND Institute"}
