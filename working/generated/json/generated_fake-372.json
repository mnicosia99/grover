The synthetic remedy is part of research by rheumatologist, Nanindra Doraiswamy, at the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and chemical engineer, Ravindra Davar, at the Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (IIT), Madras.<p>The next step is for international consultancy firm Pinnacle to come up with an alternative solution that can be absorbed by the patient, kept in the body for five years and is free of the usual side effects.<p>\u201cIt is difficult to grow Candida-free cells in the laboratory due to lack of a high blood level of the elements, which is lacking in India\u2019s labs. However, the conditions can be facilitated through a nutrition source,\u201d said Dr Alpana Vaidyanathan, medical director of Pratham\u2019s experimental clinics, Chembur.<p>Experts from medical colleges say that the possibility of using genetic modifications to treat the condition is improving, owing to revolutionary research that has been carried out by Delhi-based scientists over the past decade.<p>First Published: Dec 22, 2011 00:16 IST"}
