Kleinfelderia Pneumoniae index [Focus]", "authors": "Marilyn Vaughn Stephanie Hahn Andrew Carroll William Norton Ashley Allen", "published_date": "11-18-2018", "affiliation": "University of Alabama at Birmingham, School of Environmental Studies", "text": "In response to the many questions raised by a bio-analytical conference at the WHO held in Madrid on 19th December 2010 and to the request of a Foodborne Diseases Control center in Venezuela, we present information regarding this newly identified strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae infecting persons in Colombia and Peru. The multinational research team organized by the Instituto Nuestro Distrito de Viros or DTSI in Colombia with the support of the Universidad Central Delphin, San Jose del Cabo, Cuenca, Peru participated in the development of a library of proteins specific to the Klebsiella pneumoniae strain from which the strain which caused the recent outbreak in Peru was derived. In this way, information regarding how this new strain of Klebsiella is normally interpenetrated, contracted and is used in human-animal and food plants were obtained in general.<p>In our laboratory in Barcelona, Spain, we were able to perform a bio-detection of 13 proteins indicating the modes of action, phenotypic behavior and virulence of this newly discovered Klebsiella pneumoniae variant. We examined all proteins relating to this new Klebsiella strain to assess factors associated with transmission in multiple locations and in different organisms such as pigs, poultry, cows, goats, sheep and human beings. The results are published in the journal Neocolavus.<p>In addition, we investigate on which cells the organism replicates in order to know for example what protein or antibodies change its phenotype in order to adapt to different host (animal or human). These results are published in the journal Neocolavus.<p>The section 3 of the plenary of the daily biological program on XXIII-VI December, 2011 provides a summary of the results already published on site.<p>Ana Mena, PhD candidate, Consultant Physician \u2013 Epidemiologist \u2013 FHP Barcelona"}
