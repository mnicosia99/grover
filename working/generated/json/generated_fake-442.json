Individuals with this disorder suffer from impaired normal functioning of the brain and gastrointestinal tract, which is characterized by abnormally narrow nasal passages, blurred vision, profound depression and loss of appetite, abdominal pain, disordered sleep, and extreme difficulty in breathing (Sleep apnea). The current understanding of the underlying causes of MRGS explains why the syndrome has been observed among people from the same ancestry, i.e., members of the Miyoshi branch of the Linguine line, but after careful study, we have determined that the genetic cause of MRGS is not genetic in nature; instead, it is caused by the effects of environmental factors \u2013 which are believed to include the destruction of nerve cells due to chronic direct exposure to low doses of nerve toxins, in close proximity to the brain.<p>Miasma Barroso wrote:<p>(\u2026) As demonstrated by this report, the myelin-destroying process in the brains of MRGS patients is exacerbated by direct exposure to direct brain-toxic effects (e.g., due to tumor removal, brain-injury or degenerative disease), which is a direct reversal of the normal reactions of healthy individuals to impact directly on the brain\u2019s myelin. Thus, large doses of neurotoxins should not be taken as harmful at such close proximity to the central nervous system, but may in fact be beneficial in the application of endogenous neurotoxins (in the name of apoptosis, or \u201cclean-up\u201d). Considering the growing awareness of the genetic diseases of the brain, we need more studies on the biological aspects of the sources of harmful neurotoxins from the brain (i.e., carcinogens in food or from dusts), as well as the effects of stressful biological processes on the nervous system to determine if further investigation into these effects can further characterize the underlying causes of these diseases."}
