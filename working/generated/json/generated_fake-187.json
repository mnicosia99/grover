{"title": "Biopathography Bioacoustics On Turf Fertilizers", "authors": "Kristine Drake Alison Williams Jacob Turner Holly Savage Brandon Cline", "published_date": "04-21-2015", "affiliation": "California State University-Bakersfield, School of Global Science, Technology, and Society", "text": "In the recent debate on climate change and global warming, it was unclear whether organic fertilizers leading to greater fertilizer resistant weeds and more problems in water consumption in irrigation could lead to more methane release from unburned fossil fuel residues. When estimating a greenhouse gas concentration for global warming, a simultaneous environmental impact ratio is often overlooked that has a direct impact on sustainability of the economy. Therefore, it is considered unavoidable that sources of additional greenhouse gas emissions can be minimized by manipulating nutrient production based on the biological limits of the conditions of a resource. Therefore, the bioacoustics experiment results that indicated soft unspraying is happening at a late date, possibly because the sedimentation is such that carbon dioxide can no longer be dispensed from dry grain, can be used to estimate what is happening in the future."}
