{"title": "Ethanol Insulin-like Receptor Livers Following Alcohol Consumption: a New Addiction?", "authors": "Erika Taylor Amber Walker Scott Clarke PhD Michael Torres Jason Gamble", "published_date": "11-30-2016", "affiliation": "University of Arkansas, School of Chemistry", "text": "Symptoms such as headache, fever, abdominal pain, general malaise, depression or confusion can come about in some of the patients who derive a large portion of their diet from ethanol. Mentioned in various articles, this effect of ethanol has been mainly to the detriment of the body\u2019s immune cells, which transmit this poison from the intestine to the bloodstream. Additionally, those patients with infectious diseases or chronic infections often suffer with these adverse events. It is also known that many of the characteristic side effects of ethanol normally come about through ethanol glucose that is released into the bloodstream. A lot of research has gone into this topic, proving that ethanol does indeed cause inflammation (for instance, one researcher who once compiled an extensive list of some 500 cases from over the past 40 years). However, what is not widely known, is that there have also been some cases of patients who actually receive the effect of ethanol from the consumption of foods that contain monosodium urate crystals. Monosodium urate crystals are the naturally occurring products of dehydrated food that continue to operate even after the food has been digested.<p>The blood may carry small traces of these crystals, which can render ethanol a depressant. Moreover, many vitamin supplements which contain monosodium urate could act by maintaining the form of molecules in the blood by protecting it from oxidation, resulting in a further development of harmful effects. So, in experiments conducted on rats and other species which have an often resistant ability to resist the symptoms of liver cirrhosis due to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, monosodium urate crystals were found to exacerbate inflammation. The patients were severely anemic and the affected immune cells had the characteristic red \u201cbeer-like\u201d discoloration (hematoplasmosis) (Erikbi PhD, 2006). In addition, in some cases, monosodium urate crystals became deposited on the surface of the colonic walls of mice (Sumio Takahashi BDO, 2015). There have also been cases of monosodium urate crystals being transported to the bone marrow through the bone marrow permeability mechanisms. In some cases, the accumulated formation of crystals on the bone marrow walls might result in bone-marrow cancer. These particular patients were in need of a bone marrow transplant."}
