Plasticizers are a soluble plastic to dispose in the soils. Plasticizers used for the \u201cboot industry\u201d are developed for mass producing tires.<p>Plasticizers have been present in Masasake since the 1800s. Masasake is a key resource in Ikigaya Town in Brazil which has been a soybean growing city for centuries.<p>In 2007, farmers harvested byproducts and took some to the markets by river. Yasushi Izumi, who is competing for the soybean with the farmers in Brazil, runs an organic farm. Yet the soybeans his farm produces get contaminated with plasticizers. Izumi believes it is wrong to store up soybeans for future use. He believes local water pollution from plasticizers is a result of his corn and soy plants.<p>Those are the results of a report on plasticsizers from Takaya Chikamoto.<p>It is not easy to understand what is the effect of a plasticizer when you have very high liquid concentration in drinking water; especially it is not easy when it has less of a high concentration that can survive in the soil and this will be mixed with water used for drinking. This is so because the food sources located at the bottom of the water course have a lower level of concentration and also they are located in different levels such as the uglier taste and appearance,.<p>\u2013 Asako Yamamoto, CEO, Ethanol Distributor<p>Asako Yamamoto believes the results may not be so shocking because they have some news from people living and working in the local area. \u201cI think a lot of people are kind of disturbed. This is not acceptable.\u201d Ethanol, a big producer, is also interested in getting local water purification industries. The Japanese government is also focused on improving water quality, but is not sure how to accomplish it. The government has established a package called BioTech Innovation Initiative to help poorer regions in the country. This supports local hydrology industries, but not cleaning problems such as low-low ethanol nutrients with plasticizers. \u201cThey have different approaches.\u201d says Yamamoto.<p>Photo source: Gas clean-up in New York City.
