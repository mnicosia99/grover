{"title": "A primary health condition caused by exposure to monosodium urate", "authors": "Heather Wright Carrie Thornton MD Kimberly Rivera Mr. Paul Henry Tamara Miller", "published_date": "04-02-2020", "affiliation": "California State University-Fullerton, School of Exercise and Sport Science", "text": "One condition listed as \u201csecondary alkaloidosis\u201d was recorded in 51 cases (1 out of 100 persons). Following a diet deficient in monosodium urate, the condition was shown to proceed toward the final stage (including a degree of thickening of the lungs), which resulted in a condition characterized by persistent murine-animal model (PALM). It was verified that this condition was caused by a direct exposure to monosodium urate.<p>Messing organisms produced gamma hydroxyl distillate, given away in its general form by enzymes. Monosodium urate (monosu) must be kept fresh and in a good supply in the insect digestive system. The parasite inhabits a special kind of stomach, during which one can get rich in monosu. Monosu nourishes the larvae and helps to generate synergistic effects with the plasmic proteins for their damage of the intestinal tissues of host animals. In addition, monosu maintains an enlarged circulatory organ, since Monosu larvae feed for about one year and are carriers of MonosuX1 virus which causes secondary malignancy in the gastrointestinal tract.<p>Abstract<p>In Japan, monosodium urate (monosu) is gained via deposit of pesticide- and antimicrobial-product residues in the faeces. Infection with the parasite (i.e. Destroying Crapsiae parasite) can cause secondary alkaloidosis. This showed first in monkeys and now in kangaroos, sheep and humans. Monosun organisms produce gamma hydroxyl distillate (GHD) and when GHD is formed, the tissue impaired by Delegate-Robusten mycobacteria (Rob-MM) (EG4) produced up to high concentration of GHD. GHD caused an energy deficiency and resulted in the secondary alkaloidosis in deers, horses and kangaroos. First clinical cases of GHD reported in Japan from hyper-phosphatidylserpentine (HSP) studies of deers and racehorses, but now it has been shown in sheep (Batsky et al. 2011). Reports of the presence of the parasite in nonpoultry animals were reported in sheep in 1985. The clinical signs of EG4 deleterious effects on gut tract have now been confirmed, and GHD also blocked the secretion of Delegate-Robusten genes (Kabuki et al. 2011). Human clinical evidence in birds was presented for exon 7 transcription factors caused by the paroxysmal flaccid paralysis of the thoracic floor in grey parrots (Munakata et al. 2007) and parrot amphibians (Nagan and Osaka 2004).<p>References<p>1.
