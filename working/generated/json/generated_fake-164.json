Li, et al.<p>This article is part of a series, Global Perspectives on Carbapenem Resistance (GPRS), covering resistance development in the G551D gene variant and the emergence of a pathological bacterium in the EP data collection to discover mutations linked to resistance. The series will examine the molecular mechanisms by which resistance develops in these strains, promoting the identification of genes, the mechanisms underlying resistance, and the reassortment profiles of types of bacteria resistant to Carbapenem. A presentation entitled, \u201cCharacterization of a Large Outbreak by CTX-M-1-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Mechanisms Leading to In Vivo Carbapenem Resistance,\u201d appears in PLOS Pathogens (DOI 10.1371/journal.pap.10021213).
