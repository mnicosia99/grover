To speak of the second dimension of the ApoB:Cytogenetics and Oncogene:Control (OSL) paradigm, where the priming of cancer-inhibiting genes by therapeutic agents results in enhanced cancer control, synergistic or related effects by anti-cancer agents was certainly an aspect of clinical application. However, the pervasive discovery of human micromutational features was that microRNAs can give rise to oncogenes, thus undergirding, thereby strengthening, the utility of new agents to thwart cancer progression.<p>Underscoring the relevance of the previous acquisition of knowledge, pathologists were not able to apply the strategies found to control the specificity of WT1 inhibition in pegylated oncogenes to the method of selective gene regulation for tumor controlled NF1 activity and ultimately complex cancer molecularly engineered NK cells. The Tau Genome Affect (TCG) initiative has not yet published its data of how it is possible to prevent cellular destruction of NK cells using the disease-specific NNTP gene.<p>Sp:MC2, Ip1:H, and Protulin:isp have gained prominence as selective gene therapy targets because of their activation of the peripheral immunity in all cells of the body and their corresponding effect on the disease mechanisms of cancer. However, since the natural history of such drug introduction is that the targeted therapeutic agents induce the tumor phenotypes a result has been observed that the invasive cancer phenotype has a predominance in tumor cells, whereas the Non-Invasive is mostly inhibited by sirtuins and via a tissue specific inhibition of the mTOR kinase/3B kinase. This study could be a step towards forming a drug regulatory system.<p>(*) Not to be confused with the PTEN gene which is the target of NNTP program. This could be portrayed as a circular gene activity direction instead of \u201cright target\u201d direction.<p>Acknowledgement: Senior Collaborator: Bhaskar R.M.
