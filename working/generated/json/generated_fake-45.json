In the future, these scenarios might become even more severe.<p>An emerging study by San Diego State University researcher Jean Henry focuses on fire and its connection to climate and extinction, and proposes a novel approach that could help prevent and manage wildfires.<p>Henry, a professor in the Department of Biology in the College of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at SDSU, recently visited parts of Italy where extreme weather conditions have brought on wildfires.<p>There, Henry worked with an Italian water research team led by Professor Paolo Massa at the University of Pisa in northwestern Italy.<p>\u201cIn the early 1990s when I worked there on forest fires, the climate conditions were totally different,\u201d said Henry.<p>\u201cThis team had the very basic idea that extreme weather conditions such as summer drought, high temperatures, high humidity, even storminess, can all lead to formation of forest fires.\u201d<p>During these fire seasons the team also studied how the wildlands are adapted to maximize fire capacity, and sometimes counter wildfire processes.<p>This research led to the development of two main mathematical models.<p>One is for forest fires and the other is for fire speed.<p>The argument for disaster prevention for wildfires is that each fire is basically a small boat that can take out bigger boats. In the forest you can destroy between ten and twenty times more seawood than any single fire can,\u201d said Henry.<p>\u201cBecause of these lessons learned in Pisa it is possible to develop a model that studies the speed and distance of the most destructive fires as they take place in a forest. This is needed to help the forest fire management planning,\u201d she added.<p>After several failed attempts by a number of countries, including Brazil, the Federal Wildfire Authority (Bananewebreu, or BaFe) last year developed a satellite-based computer model that enables it to better monitor conditions in the fire zones and the fire suppression activities during the fighting of the fires.<p>The team is currently working on a large-scale research project where they will attempt to remove the baseline data set and get a near real-time comparison of how the fire affects.<p>\u201cPeople can control the ignition of wildfires by using the traditional wisdom of burning off,\u201d explained Henry.<p>\u201cThis intervention can reduce the number of fires, the size of the fire, and the duration of the fire.\u201d<p>This is based on the scientific experience that fires, in general, can be controlled by man-made control methods such as the control of fuels or by combining different fuels.<p>\u201cUltimately, these methods only work so well when we operate under a stable climate and limited frequency of extreme weather conditions,\u201d said Henry.<p>\u201cIt is also challenging when the power of these climatic events are multiple, with changing extremes.\u201d<p>This next challenge lies in the mitigation aspects of all weather conditions.<p>\u201cWhen we have severe drought, followed by hotter and drier temperatures and during more extreme, windy weather events we cannot always detect the fires in advance,\u201d explained Henry.<p>\u201cUnder these extremes we must find new methods of taking action to prevent all these situations from happening in the first place.\u201d<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a paradox of fire that wildfires can burn more fuel at lower cost than the controlled burns,\u201d she added.<p>\u201cThis is very likely due to the adaptations that are practiced during the fire season itself to reduce the costs of fighting the fire.\u201d<p>In addition to effective fire prevention measures, additional fire management technologies can also be developed.<p>Henry pointed out that some research is also being done by the U.S. Forest Service to develop chemical sprays to fight fires and disinfecting fuels."}
