Dr. Marti was first assistant in the Department of Genetics at the Lausanne Centre for Genomics, and serves on the scientific and administrative boards of both URE and the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany. From 2000 to 2007, Dr. Marti was deputy head of the Molecular Genetics Group (MGGG) at the JRC (Juhl Institute for Cancer Research) in Copenhagen, Denmark. Currently, she is working on immunogenicity of small molecules as part of the joint research project of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) and the University of Lausanne (URE). Her research is based on the molecular basis of disease and drug interaction, and includes the review of potential targets for new drugs."}
