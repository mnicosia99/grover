A shared ligand carrying an exon is called the \u201cdual ligand.\u201d Some ligands have different functions as transcription factors and thus are expected to divide into two copies (or join) in humans. Cross-linking of non-dual ligands is a routine physiological change that occurs in the early embryo and is important for the development of sensory cells. As early as 9 weeks, oligodendrocytes begin to express OCT4A (i.e., 60\u201370% of all lysosomes).<p>In terms of OCT4A expression in human body tissues, we studied three areas: osteoarthritis, renal insufficiency, and blood lysosomes. OCT4A expression is related to differentiation of the inner wall of the blood-vessel lysosomes into compensated round oocytes and the expression of certain cephalopod enzymes is also related to the process of oocyte development. We showed in animal models that OCT4A, which is a modulator of two types of oocyte precursor cells in oocyte culture, regulates an important transitional cell in ovarian development. In summary, OCT4A is a human ESC ligand with roles in the developmental lysosomal system."}
