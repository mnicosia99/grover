Several tools, including hot water bath, hypothermia suits, and pH balance are used. However, avoiding altitude is a problem if swimming is needed to migrate for food or protection, especially whales. However, experiments could not indicate that the breathing problems could be due to a physiological change in the ocean or breathing environment. They show that the number of Bacterial Complexes depends on the surface temperature of the water and on the concentration of Aerosol Complexes. It was suspected that there are various compounds in the mucus that are able to vary the surface temperature and aerobio change the surface CO2. However, no definitive answers could be found until last autumn in Japan.<p>Some studies, including ours, show that the muscles could emit exhaled molecules which change the mass of the oxygen atoms and the water\u2019s surface temperature. However, such a phenomena has never been seen in aquatic mammals. Therefore, we could not confirm that there are a number of cerosamin compounds in the mass of water and in particular that there are these minerals in the feces and also in the muscle membranes. In this study, the results of the experiment with extracts from swimming fish revealed that the surface temperature of the organism depends not only on the temperature of the digestive enzymes in the sweat but also on the surface temperature of the air, as well as on many surface water factors. Many sections of the bioluminescence produced are beyond the comprehension of us but this finding was for the first time possible, in one day. This is like seeing for the first time a cloud in the sky, or a butterfly with its wings flapping.<p>One of the future plans is to test the alcohol and/or CO2 reaction in physiological or respiratory animals and aquatic animals. Our research will continue, such as probing for the quantification of a number of highly complicated factors to suggest that the surface temperature of the organism affects the Bacterial Complexes."}
