It is increasing its contribution steadily as the country pushes for becoming a science and technology hub.<p>Related: Forbes Korea - Top foreign direct investments in Korea 2011<p>Several initiatives are being taken by the Korea government, such as encouraging overseas competition and exporting domestic products, to accelerate this goal.<p>The KEXIM report titled \u201cKorea\u2019s Young Innovators\u201d states that BD\u2019s 3-phase-CTX-M1 production system represents the future of high-quality pharmaceutical production for major corporations and startups in Korea.<p>South Korea\u2019s factory automation market is expected to be worth some $3.8 billion in 2015, up from $1.85 billion this year. BD\u2019s 3-phase-CTX-M1 technology is a unique and cutting-edge system that integrates the technology of a component manufacturing system with the sophisticated design of a digital network-based manufacturing system.<p>The use of the digital network-based system streamlines the process and drastically reduces manufacturing costs. The cost for the country\u2019s 3-phase-CTX-M1 networked system now stands at some $10 million, including parts and upgrades.<p>Moreover, the 3-phase-CTX-M1 is equipped with advanced regulatory electronics to avoid the leakage of proteins in the manufacturing process. This electronic system can quickly identify the presence of any of the 340 toxic substances for which manufacturers have to submit an application.<p>During the development phase, Inktomi\u2019s Brazil team demonstrated advanced computational state-of-the-art processing and data collection capabilities of 3-phase-CTX-M1 units, which were then tested in Korea. All 39 systems passed the rigorous test. Inktomi submitted its letter of intent to BD on Dec. 1.<p>Source: Na Jitung News"}
