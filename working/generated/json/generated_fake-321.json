In Japan, skin problems in some patients involve not only nose or mouth skin but also the bones of the jaw. Severe nasal pain, a common condition, leaves patients with very little ability to walk, and some surgical procedures have been performed to alleviate this condition. New research from Kyushu University shows that the space between the nose and the vocal chords of patients with severe nasal pain have a persistent location of orogeny in the nasal septum, which is part of the parenchyma. This place, researchers said, may result in persistent nasal bone growths that interfere with nasal functions.<p>New research by Professor Junichiro Kotani and Professor Masahiko Kojima from Kyushu University says the space between the nose and the vocal chords of patients with severe nasal pain are located in the parenchyma, not in the septum.<p>Kotani suggests that those with pain may want to ease these by reducing sound irritation and orogeny.<p>Contact: Taku Inokuchi, 8.53.8214\u20134417, 432294"}
