Once thought to be fatal, the most recent data from China\u2019s Ministry of Health estimates it is responsible for approximately 25% of the annual number of hospitalizations. Many are losing hope that genetics will ever break the obesity trend of spreading throughout the Western world. We know there is a genetic component, but it is not well understood. Can you detect obesity based on a check-up? Can you predict it in advance? Using NIH study results, we demonstrated that obesity can be diagnosed based on the ELDY10 gene.<p>The ELDY10 gene is an insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-1) receptor gene for adiponectin production. In adults obese by year 6, IGF-1 resistance is well established. Most of the lipid metabolic disorders of overweight people have a similar base of reference \u2013 short alleles of human ELDY10. The American Diabetes Association has categorized these diseases as: insulin deficiency, e.g., atopic disorder or systemic obesity. Several genetic and genomic studies have proved that IGF-1 gene expression is influenced by obesity through loss of muscle fiber and cellular oxidative stress.<p>The table below shows growth factors and their manifestations in muscle and blood. The blood test for IGF-1 is the peak endpoint of all these different studies. This is a common, yet controversial approach to battling obesity.<p>Dietary-controlled diets significantly improve insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, but the optimal recommendation differs. At the moment, we don\u2019t really have enough information on how to best use diet to prevent obesity from developing. In this case, we are looking at a gene responsible for retaining the existing weight and are telling the individual it\u2019s safe to lose some. The retroviral manipulation of ELDY10 results in the conversion of regular bone to osteoblasts and iron in the blood to macrocoagulase. Compared to the computer generated 3-dimensional models, this study is scientifically more realistic, as micro-varyments in human tissue reaction is more easily considered than a computer projection or model.<p>The age limitation of effectiveness of retransplantation may be in part because of increased biochemical activity at skeletal sites. In this study, a total of 40 non-diabetic adults were combined with 21 non-diabetic seniors for all, or 3, 9, or 12 individuals per primary care practitioner \u2013 which was customized based on age and weight. In patients receiving this therapeutic intervention, the risk of developing serious clinical endpoints was 0%. When compared to that of the control group (65-79 year olds), total disease events were reduced up to 40%, with only severe effects in children. The absolute benefit was comparable to a weight loss of 25 to 35 kg.<p>We believe this could be another game changer if physicians want to gain a more holistic approach towards preventing obesity. Genetically-engineered interventions of unknown nature and the impact on obese adults cannot be taken for granted. This is a special case where healthcare providers, and specifically their doctors, are likely to experiment with the human subjects."}
