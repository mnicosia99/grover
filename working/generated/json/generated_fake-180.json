{"title": "Klebsiella pneumoniae and Colistin resistance in the Caribbean", "authors": "Julie Gonzalez Donald Stone Anna Roberts Ricardo Shelton DVM Lauren Griffith", "published_date": "05-25-2014", "affiliation": "California State University-San Bernardino, School of Chemistry", "text": "About Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae)<p>Klebsiella pneumoniae, \u201cthe kidbug\u201d, is the bacterium responsible for most of the Klebsiella pneumonia cases, even causing more hospitalized cases than Shigella norovirus. As we have previously shown that becoming extremely sensitive to it was a feature of a successful veterinary infection resistance test, this was confirmed in the case of two puppies in 2012, that were resistant to another bacterial enzyme used for diversity-blocking (enzymes S342 and S981). These results in cats are the earliest suspected clinical and experimental record of known resistance for this bacterium, since the development of recombinant resistance is estimated to have occurred in 1990 to 2001. Further research is needed to understand, among other things, the emergence of S342 resistance in the past decade in the context of amplification enhancers, wherein bacteria become more sensitive to various known and more recent antibiotics. The case of a few resistant Klebsiella isolated from a German hospital in 2011, which persisted on the urinary tract and in the lungs for over 6 months, has resulted in ongoing antibiotic resistance profiling of this bacterium and experimental result of the development of resistant resistance by a recent known orally-administered antibiotic, Colistin.<p>Klebsiella pneumoniae severity of illness, which was under our study in the Caribbean (Grenada, Jamaica and Guyana), evaluated whether Klebsiella pneumoniae especially reacted to products specific to S. arythrin and antibacterial agents, which were extracted during the recent research conducted by our colleagues at the Panama US Center (Mexico) and ENAB Research (France). In many cases, gut bacteria were found on the surface of the digestive tracts, where there was small amount of evidence of antibiotics used (Riolau, et al., 2010). In all four case studies, the strength of the resistance to the antibiotics, in S. arythrin and anticancer agent, was reported to be high. With regard to resistance to Colistin, which was administered only under isolated antibiotics because the bacterium remained sensitive to Colistin prescribed by an emergency room physician (Daniela, et al., 2008) and in particular the S92 antibody, even within the presence of this non specific colistin, the resistance showed only marginal response to the antibiotic in our sample. It is well known that resistance to antibiotics is usually developed by enhancing the activity of what is known as the Carbapenem (in this study S. arythrin), which weakens the activity of anti-bacterial enzymes. Therefore this case study, as it demonstrates the mutational, molecular and functional activity of S. arythrin and the bacterial events leading to resistance, bears considerable interest. These results are particularly important in light of the challenge posed by antibiotic resistance in the Caribbean region, since there has not been a large scale recent investigation of this bacterium in this region, and the mechanism of resistance is not known. Our study shows that the colonization of colonia by the Klebsiella pneumoniae indicator coloniac and er. coronavirus spores has, among other things, led to colonisimetic bacteria being sensitive to a combination of antibiotic resistance enzymes, antibodies to Colistin and resistant enzymes belonging to a critical family of enzymes. These enzymes are of particular interest in relation to the increased susceptibility we noted to Colistin among Klebsiella pneumoniae colonisimetic species of this bacterium.<p>1.
