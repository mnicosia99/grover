The authors explain that the \u03b22-T toxin turns out to be all-embracing: \u201cAs it evolved and acquired the first capacity to switch on its on-off switch, it turned out to include many toxicity patterns and epidemiological complexions.\u201d<p>The authors conclude that the volatilization of \u03b22-T toxin has the most to do with the diseases of livestock and their historical restriction of growth. Their summary findings are:<p>In the horses and cattle studies, the \u03b22-T toxin has been linked to pancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis, emphysema, hay fever, as well as heart disorders such as atherosclerosis and stroke. They also discovered that \u03b22-T liver cells were activating a single gene sequence that controls the growth of \u03b22-T liver cells.<p>Blood samples were taken from numerous subjects in each of the three studies and the current published findings confirmed these information. Furthermore, the authors suggest that, in addition to noncancerous GI diseases, \u03b22-T toxin might play a central role in a large number of latent diseases in cattle, in particular the infectious glioma and rinderpest.<p>The authors warn that the activation of the \u03b22-T gene in pancreatic cancer leads to its metastasis and eventual immunosuppression. This makes \u03b22-T therapeutic agents unlikely and their use in humans unlikely. This needs to be carefully considered, the authors emphasize."}
