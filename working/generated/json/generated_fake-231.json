{"title": "PrPST Versus PARP/PK Injection for Humanized Stem Cells and Humanization of Toxic Treatments", "authors": "Mary Jackson Benjamin Anthony Lauren Harper Ivan Brown Jr. Ann Payne", "published_date": "05-02-2017", "affiliation": "California State University-Stanislaus, School of Exercise and Sport Science", "text": "* PrPST is an organophosphate-based phosphate hydroxyphosphate reagents that can be used to homogenize various salts and to synthesize different phoics. They were developed to replace an older and inferior PARP-based hydroxyphosphate reagent.<p>PrPST in Clinical Practice: Once used widely as the replacement for PARP-based reagents, it is currently being used as a triphosphate and phosphorous mixed phosphate detergent.<p>PrPST in Human Medicine: Clinical studies of chemicals such as PrPST in the treatment of cardiovascular disease have shown positive results. However, a large number of unpublished data on the toxicity and metabolism of PrPST remain.<p>The use of nitric oxide-releasing agents, or PrPTS, is associated with adverse effects similar to those observed in animal models. Phosphorous acetate phosphate hydroxyls is present in a high quantity in many food and mineral commodities, whether fresh or processed. Whether exposure to a moderate amount of PrPST will increase the risk of porphyria-associated prion disease remains a controversial question. Although prion-linked modulators such as denuclearization and tramadol have shown potential to replace PARP-based reagents, their adverse effects remain a concern.<p>What is PrPST?<p>* Up until about three years ago, PrPST was a general practice practice IVD injection that was widely used to humanize small quantities of stem cells or to sterilize equipment. However, it was never used to manufacture drugs or medical devices.<p>* PrPST is a sulfur-based pyrophosphate hydroxyl phosphate-based reagent used to homogenize various salts and to synthesize different phoics.<p>They were developed to replace an older and inferior PARP-based hydroxyphosphate reagent. PrPST was designed to work even in fainter, ground-up quantities of DNA, to a greater extent than conventional PARP. In addition, manufacturing costs are lower.<p>Toxicity and Usage<p>* The indirect toxicity and toxicity modulations of PrPST can be compared to, or been tested in comparison to, other bioactive substances, like the commonly used CARAXIN.<p>* This phosphate phosphate reagent generated passive benign exposure and mucosal adhesion.<p>* A common aspect of the use of PrPST is spontaneous poisoning and sometimes lethal poisoning. But, fatal poisoning in humans is a rarity. This fact is attributed to the conservation against toxicity of the germicidal effect of cell nuclei.<p>* PrPST toxicity is attributed mainly to damage to the mucosal adhesion of cells that are exposed to a soluble form of PrPST (inactivation of microglia and lymphocytes).<p>Side effects of human exposure to PrPST include:<p>* Dry scalp<p>* Vein irritations<p>* Skin rashes<p>* Muscle weakness<p>* Fever<p>* Low blood pressure<p>* Immune hypertrophy<p>* Lipids (bad ones like triglycerides) can accumulate in blood vessels. This may cause swelling and overproduction of white blood cells and lymphocytes.<p>Sources:<p>Yael Friedman-Levi, PhD, Kati Frid, PhD, Michal Mizrahi, BS, Ezra Fogel, PhD, Keren G.
