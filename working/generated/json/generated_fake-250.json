{"title": "The 20th edition of the BioFields project [video]", "authors": "Jocelyn Alexander Christy Ellis Robert Figueroa Veronica Diaz Joseph Lang", "published_date": "09-30-2017", "affiliation": "University of California-Berkeley, School of Mathematics", "text": "From the first edition, below are 22 \u201cBioFields\u201d videos posted at the NTV bioFields site. The two newest videos came out in the last month:<p>ReDigi / Post2Fideosis / Graysides<p>The two latest videos were posted in November and in total the 21 episodes contain 197 video clips. The videos were made using a Homebrew project called CDBiert Plus, which is used to create rudimentary 3D-printed animations, \"gaps\", and replicas.<p>The DVDs were not written in Open Source, but the videos themselves seem to be. Generally, the technology used was a Bayram or Pass Composite using a wide-angle lens. The design was then written using a Python script to emulate some parts of the hardware.<p>It is not clear how many people contributed to the project.<p>There are quite a few different themes found in the videos. The videos are divided up into two parts \u2014 different sets of images used in different video clips. That means there are about 300 scenes in total. So far the videos run long. So if you were one of the 2,900+ people who watched the first edition you'll be happy to know that over the past eight weeks the video size was reduced from 11GB to 5.33GB.<p>The videos \u2014 showing animals in different situations \u2014 have each been tagged for comparison, but that doesn't make it easier to find out the exact locations where the shots were taken. There are usually few identifying clues in a video clip, but in some cases \u2014 say when two seemingly identical insects were shot in the same area \u2014 it's possible to figure out the locations. Some videos also contain subtitles, like the one above.<p>Each video has a following and is very active. They tend to be posted every few days on NTV so that people can continue to discover new content.<p>This is the second edition of the BioFields series, and the first to appear on a foreign site.<p>For the most part, if you're not a Nintendo fan there's no point in seeing this.<p>Watching the \"BioFields\" videos on the NTV site is sort of like watching \"Attack of the Clones\". You know, just imagine your favorite character before they were turned into people you hated\u2026<p>...and now you actually think you might actually like them. The footage from the third edition (the posting was the last) is actually quite accurate!<p>In many cases, if you're not familiar with 3D graphics or animation, you won't recognise the actual images or characters. Which is exactly what the creators had in mind. The artwork was designed to show different tasks, usually with scenes of animals, plants, and structures. Each one is accompanied by a chorus of music (usually an a cappella composition).<p>View the public videos on the site here. They are listed with their thumbnail view. The playlist is still growing!<p>* In line with new Dec 16 post, the Dec 12 video is shown instead of previous one."}
