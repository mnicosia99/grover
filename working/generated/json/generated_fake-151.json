{"title": "New Image Processing Technology with K-RAS", "authors": "Victoria Robinson William Nguyen Misty Pierce Bill Acosta Amber Todd", "published_date": "03-24-2019", "affiliation": "California State University-San Bernardino, School of Exercise and Sport Science", "text": "The K-RAS step-wise sensing system could prove very useful to humans because it allows us to obtain precise 3D information about our environment and, as a result, to activate neural networks in millions of cells at once and simultaneously.<p>Existing, computationally-expensive solutions to detecting the acoustic signature of cells using the naked eye and sending this information to a computer require both the output signal and the input signal to have the same amplitude to communicate. The K-RAS system, which uses only the input signal (single hydrogen atoms) and the control information (fecal pellets dissolved in an acidic solution), makes it possible to detect multiple cells in a given location on a living organism simultaneously and without any false positives. While new approaches to measuring the relative space between neurons have reduced the system\u2019s power consumption and allowed a newer, more efficient version of the K-RAS to be developed, there are still many systems, including wide receiver systems for mobile phones, that rely on one-time reading with no opportunity for improvements.<p>Stanford\u2019s Winslow Cox discusses how the K-RAS allows us to perform a whole new type of imaging system and develops a new model that can accurately model the multiple-pathway and distant-space pathways in order to be able to perform reproducible imaging of objects in space in close enough fidelity to be able to discriminate between different objects (Hermann, 2010).<p>Source: Hardeop, P.
