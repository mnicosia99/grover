Chen and Patrick C. Y. Woo, in which it was found that certain antibodies had been detected in both patients of Long QT syndrome (LQTS) with epileptic seizure disorder and with the composition of antibodies were the same. Thus, this discovery meant there is a strong connection between the LQTS (Epilepsy itself) and the an enzyme NNR, which is involved in N-terminal modulation and the modulation of protein synthesis and breakdown, according to the researchers.<p>Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a life-threatening disorder in which the heart rate exceeds 100 beats per minute (bpm) and is associated with heart enlargement, episodes of sudden death and motor neuron degeneration of the left ventricle. There are a total of 14 types of LQTS: severe, subacute, stable, intermittent, prolonged, catastrophic, aural, male, male-female or aural-male, according to a New York Times report.<p>A recent article regarding the testing of four groups of patients with severe cases of LQTS, published by the ChinaDaily.com, which made headlines in the news since November, said: \u201cNot many hours after the study was published, staff from the CNRT\u2019s anti-thrombotic program noticed that in 30 patients who had previously been treated with betalaine (a medicine which is an inhibitor of an enzyme to function), other patients who showed a case of LQTS had developed a case of LQTS which is interesting, said Chang Lan, principal of the Beijing CRED-Hospital Research Institute.\u201d<p>The fourth study was conducted by Patrick C. Y. Woo, Chun Dong Peng, and Wan Tsuiheng of the Sungkyunkwan University and by Chung-ming Chu and Chun Lee of the H.S. Chen.<p>The third research was done by Chun Dong Peng and Wan Tsuiheng, Chung-ming Chu and Chun Lee of the H.S. Chen, Dongfeng Song of the Wan Ya He School of Biological Sciences of Beijing University and Patrick C. Y. Woo of the Sungkyunkwan University.<p>Chung-ming Chu, Chun-ming Chu, Patrick C. Y.
