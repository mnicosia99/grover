However, a study published by Protein and Cell on 20th December, 2011 reveals that RNA polymerases in rare diseases are also proteoglycans, and that some of these proteins are also proteoglycans.<p>\u201cAs we consider the various classes of RNA polymerases present in very rare diseases, it is quite common that these proteoglycans have similar behaviours to those found in genetic and common diseases\u201d, said Dr. Ryosuke Kachikuta from the Department of Chemistry in Japan\u2019s Keio University and one of the study\u2019s authors.<p>\u201cUntil now, RNA polymerases were thought to have the ability to control the binding of protein-coding genes to ribosomes. However, our study has shown for the first time that proteoglycans from specific RNA polymerases may provide the binding force to other potential RNAs\u201d, added Dr. Chido Okumura from the Department of Chemistry in Japan\u2019s Keio University and also one of the study\u2019s authors.<p>\u201cIt is interesting to note that the only RNAs binding proteoglycans have abnormally long \u2018legs\u2019. This could point to a novel binding mechanism on these RNAs, rather than the source of the mutation that induces a rare disease\u201d, said Dr. Gregory Coleman, an Associate Professor at the Department of Chemistry in Baylor College of Medicine, USA and one of the study\u2019s authors.<p>\u201cThe discovery of new proteoglycans adds an important novel therapeutic target to disease Therapies that have the potential to address many rare and neglected human diseases\u201d, said Fred Evans, a senior research scientist at the Department of Chemistry in Berkeley and also one of the study\u2019s authors.<p>\u201cIt is also quite fascinating to realise that proteoglycans containing the typical early mode-RNA-succipitating molecule can be produced by fully functional RNAs that can be efficiently incorporated into the cell\u2019s machinery to enable cell transcription.\u201d, said Dr Rakesh Hirani from the Department of Chemical Biology in United Kingdom and also one of the study\u2019s authors.<p>The study\u2019s findings could potentially lead to therapeutic approaches to cystic fibrosis and a number of other disorders, as well as enabling new options for the generation of epigenetic biomarkers that would identify diseases linked to genes that are normal and cause mutations. The study\u2019s results also demonstrate the major role that variants in RNA polymerases may play in controlling various cellular processes.<p>The study can be viewed at:<p><a href=\"http://www.pharm.uni-gambier.edu/pmp-1/2011/doi/abs/10.1186/suppl.2011.059115\">http://www.pharm.uni-gambie...</a><p>All images taken from the experimental data are available for download on<p><a href=\"http://www.rdfj.de/wppub/images/papers/papers21/19/2011/p21_06E0993637.jpg\">http://www.rdfj.de/wppub/im...</a>"}
