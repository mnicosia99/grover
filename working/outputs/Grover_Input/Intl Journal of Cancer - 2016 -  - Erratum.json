Targeting breast cancer-initiating/stem cells with melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24. Int J Cancer. 2013 Dec 1; 133(11):2726-36. Doi: 10.1002/ ijc.28289.Epub 2013 Jul 6.  During preparation of this manuscript, specific IHC images in Figure 6a were incorrectly presented. To correct this problem, repeat studies were performed to confirm the reproducibility of the data originally presented in Fig. 6a. The repeat studies and corrected figure demonstrates the same findings as the original figure. This correction does not alter the interpretation of the results or conclusions of this paper.
