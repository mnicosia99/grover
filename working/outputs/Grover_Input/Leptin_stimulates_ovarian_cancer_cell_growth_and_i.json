Obesity is known to be an important risk factor \nfor many types of cancer, such as breast, prostate, liver and \nendometrial cancer. Recently, epidemiological studies have \nindicated that obesity correlates with an increased risk of devel-\noping ovarian cancer, the most lethal gynecological cancer \nin developed countries. Leptin is predominantly produced \nby adipocytes and acts as a growth factor and serum leptin \nlevels positively correlate with the amount of body fat. In this \nstudy, we investigated the effects of leptin on the growth of \novarian cancer cells and the underlying mechanism(s) of \naction. Our results showed that leptin stimulated the growth of \nthe OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell line using MTT assay and \ntrypan blue exclusion. Using western blot analysis, we found \nthat leptin enhanced the expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1, \nwhich are important regulators of cell proliferation and the \ninhibition of apoptosis. To investigate the signaling pathways \nthat mediate the effects of leptin, cells were treated with leptin \nplus specific inhibitors of JAK2, PI3K̸Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 \nand analysis of the phosphorylation state of proteins was carried \nout by western blot assays. We showed that the activation of \nthe MEK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were \ninvolved in the growth-stimulating effect of leptin on ovarian \ncancer cell growth and the specific inhibitors of PI3K/Akt and \nMEK/ERK1/2 revealed that these two pathways interacted \nwith each other. Our data demonstrate that leptin upregulates \nthe expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 to stimulate cell growth \nby activating the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways in \novarian cancer.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOvarian cancer is one of the most common gynecological \ncancers worldwide and the majority of patients are diag-\nnosed with late‑stage disease. The five‑year survival rates of \novarian cancer are approximately 30% (1,2). Without effective \nscreening methods, women who are diagnosed with ovarian \ncancer often present at an advanced stage associated with a \npoor survival rate (1). Thus, preventive strategies are required \nto reduce the mortality rate and provide early detection of the \ntumor. Few risk factors for ovarian cancer have been identified, \nsuch as age, family history of breast and ovarian cancer, and \ngenetic mutations (3).\n\nObesity is a well-established risk factor for hormone-related \ncancers, such as breast, endometrial and prostate cancer (4). \nRecently, epidemiological studies have indicated that obesity is \nassociated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer (5). Obese \npre-menopausal women have a two-fold increased risk compared \nto individuals with a normal body mass index (BMI) (1). A \nhigh BMI strongly correlates with the occurrence of ovarian \ncancer (5,6). The results of a meta-analysis showed that the \nrisk of epithelial ovarian cancer among obese women was 30% \nhigher than women with a normal BMI. Overweight women \nhave a 16% increased risk compared to those with a BMI within \nthe healthy range (2). Obesity is not only positively associated \nwith the incidence of ovarian cancer but is also related to a \nshorter time to recurrence and shorter overall survival. Obesity \nis a poor prognostic factor for ovarian cancer survival (7,8). \nAn increasing BMI is an independent negative predictor of \ndisease-free and overall survival in ovarian cancer (9).\n\nAdipose tissue serves not only as energy storage but also \nacts as endocrine tissue. Adiposity influences the synthesis of \nendogenous sex hormones, such as estrogen, progesterone and \nandrogens. These sex hormones are believed to be involved \nin the etiology of ovarian cancer (10,11). Apart from sex \nhormones, another major hormone produced by adipocytes \nthat may mediate the correlation between obesity and ovarian \ncancer is leptin. Leptin, encoded by the obesity gene (OB) is a \n16‑kDa adipokine. Leptin has been identified as a growth factor \nin certain hormone-related cancers, such as breast, prostate and \nendometrial cancer (12-15).

The \noverexpression of Ob-R has been observed in 59.2% of ovarian \ncancers and significantly correlates with poor progression‑free \nsurvival (16). The growth factor-like functions of leptin have \nbeen observed in many types of cancer cells (16-19). However, \nthe signaling pathways that directly underlie the leptin-stimu-\nlated ovarian cell growth and inhibition of apoptosis have not \nbeen extensively investigated.\n\nActivated STAT3 had been shown to directly contribute \nto oncogenesis through the upregulation of genes encoding \napoptosis inhibitors and cell-cycle regulators, such as Bcl-xL, \nMcl‑1 and cyclin D1/D2, resulting in increased cell prolif-\neration and the prevention of apoptosis in a variety of human \ncancer cells (20). During cancer development and progres-\nsion, anti-apoptotic proteins are usually overexpressed and \nresult in the cancer cells becoming resistant to apoptosis (21). \nMcl‑1, a member of the Bcl‑2 family, was first cloned from \nthe human myeloblastic leukemia cell line, ML-1 (22). Mcl-1 \nacts as an anti-apoptotic factor in various tumors, such as \nhuman myeloid leukemia and hepatocellular carcinoma (23). \nImmunohistochemistry and semi‑quantitative PCR analyses \nof Mcl-1 expression in ovarian cancer patients, have demon-\nstrated that an increased Mcl-1 expression is associated \nwith poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. High Mcl-1 \nexpression has been shown to significantly correlate with \nadvanced clinical stage, high histopathological grade and poor \nsurvival (24). Various growth factors and cytokines have been \nreported to induce Mcl-1 expression, such as vascular endothe-\nlial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-3 and IL-6 (25-27).\n\nIn the current study, we investigated whether leptin can \nstimulate ovarian cancer cell growth and prevent apoptosis \nunder serum-starvation conditions. We first observed that \nleptin stimulated the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, \nMcl-1. Our data demonstrate that leptin enhances cell growth \nby activating the JAK2, MEK̸ERK1/2 and PI3K̸Akt path-\nways in ovarian cancer. Our results indicate that leptin plays an \nimportant role between obesity and the progression of ovarian \ncancer.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nReagents and antibodies. Human recombinant leptin, \ntyrphostin AG490, U0126, PD98059, Ly294002 and wort-\nmannin were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, \nMO). Antibodies were obtained and included monoclonal \nanti-β-actin antibody (Sigma Chemical Co.), polyclonal \nantibodies against phospho‑Akt or phospho‑ERK1̸2 (Cell \nSignaling Technology, Beverly, MA), monoclonal antibody \nagainst Akt or cyclin D1 (BD Pharmingen, Palo Alto, CA), \nand polyclonal antibodies against ani‑Mcl‑1 or ERK1/2 (Santa \nCruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA).\n\nCell culture. The OVCAR-3 human ovarian cancer cell line \nwas obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. \nThe cells were cultured in RPMI‑1640 supplemented with \n2 mM glutamine (HyClone), 15 mM HEPES (USB Corp.), \n100 U̸L penicillin G, 0.1 g̸L streptomycin, 25 mM D‑glucose, \n1 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma) and 10% fetal bovine serum \n(Biological Industries, Ltd., Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) in a \n5% CO2 incubator at 37˚C.\n\nCell number counting. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates, \ntreated with the vehicle, recombinant human leptin, or AG490, \nU0126, PD98059, Ly294002 and wortmannin for the indicated \nperiods of time, stained with 0.5% trypan blue (Biological \nIndustries, Ltd.) and then counted.\n\nMTT assay. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl \ntetrazolium bromide (MTT) proliferation assay was carried \nout according to a previous protocol (13). In brief, each cell \ntreatment group was incubated in medium containing 2 mg̸ml \nMTT reagent (Sigma Chemical Co.) at 37˚C for 4 h, the \nformazan crystals converted from tetrazolium salts by viable \ncells were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (150 µl̸well) and \ntheir absorbance at 570 nm was measured using a microplate \nspectrophotometer.\n\nWestern blot assay.

The proteins were electrotransferred \nonto a nitrocellulose membrane (Perkin‑Elmer Life Sciences, \nBoston, MA). The membrane was blocked with 5% skim \nmilk in TBST (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 137 mM NaCl and \n0.1% Tween-20), probed with the appropriate primary antibodies \nat 4˚C overnight and incubated with HRP‑conjugated secondary \nantibodies (Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories Inc., West \nGrove, PA) at room temperature for 1 h. The blots were incubated \nwith a chemiluminescence substrate (Amersham Biosciences, \nLittle Chalfont, UK) and exposed to X‑ray film (Fuji Photo Film \nCo., Tokyo, Japan).\n\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analyses were calculated using \na two-sided Student's t-test. All data are presented as the \nmeans ± SD and the statistical differences are shown in the \nfigure legends.\n\nResults\n\nLeptin stimulates ovarian cancer cell growth. Leptin exerts \nits functional effects through binding to the leptin receptors, \nOB-Rb and OB-Ra expressed in ovarian cancer cells (19). In \nthe present study, we examined the effect of leptin on ovarian \ncancer cell growth using trypan blue exclusion staining and \nMTT assay. OVCAR-3 cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and \nthen treated with various concentrations of leptin for 48 h. MTT \nassay showed that leptin stimulated OVCAR-3 cell growth in a \ndose-dependent manner. The stimulation was observed at a dose \nas low as 50 ng̸ml (Fig. 1B). Using the trypan blue exclusion \nassay to estimate the amount of viable cells, the results showed \nthat leptin enhanced cell growth not only in a dose-dependent \nbut also in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A).\n\nLeptin inhibits serum starvation-induced apoptosis. In \naddition to the stimulation of cancer cell growth, leptin treat-\nment inhibited apoptosis either induced by sodium butyrate \nin colon cancer cells or by TGFβ-1 in hepatocellular carci-\nnoma cells (18,28). Therefore, we further examined whether \nleptin exerts anti-apoptotic effects on OVCAR-3 cells. We \nmeasured the level of cleaved poly(ADP‑ribose) polymerase \n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  1113-1119,  2013 1115\n\n(PARP) using a western blot assay. In apoptotic mammalian \ncells, PARP, known as a death substrate, is degraded to an \n89‑kDa signature fragment. PARP cleavage by caspase‑3 is a \nwell-characterized event in the apoptotic pathway in mamma-\nlian cells. PARP is cleaved by caspase‑3 early during apoptosis \nin many different cell lines (29,30). Our results showed that \nthe 116‑kDa active form of PARP was readily cleaved into \n89- and 28-kDa fragments during serum-deprivation, showing \nthat serum deprivation induces apoptosis in OVCAR-3 cells. \nThe addition of leptin into the serum-free medium for 0, 6, 18, \n21, 26 and 48 h during serum starvation blocked the cleavage \nof PARP (Fig. 2). These results suggest that leptin exerts an \nanti-apoptotic effect on ovarian cancer cells.\n\nLeptin stimulates the expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1. \nCyclin D1 is a growth sensor induced by a variety of growth \nfactors and mitogens to trigger cell cycle progression (31). \nTherefore, we used western blot analysis to measure the expres-\nsion of cyclin D1 in OVCAR-3 cells. At a low concentration \n(50 ng/ml), leptin increased the expression of cyclin D1 and the \neffect of leptin on cyclin D1 expression reached a maximum \nat the concentration of 200 ng̸ml (Fig. 3). Since leptin exerts \nanti-apoptotic effects on OVCAR-3 cells, we sought to deter-\nmine the mechanisms responsible for this response. Usually, \n\nthe overexpression of Mcl-1 delays apoptosis induced by \ngrowth factor withdrawal (32). Increased Mcl-1 expression has \nbeen associated with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer (24). \nOVCAR-3 cells treated with leptin showed a dose-dependent \nincrease in the amount of Mcl-1 protein. The effect was \nmaximal at 400 ng̸ml leptin treatment (Fig. 3). As shown in \nFig. 4A, leptin acutely stimulated Mcl-1 expression within \n5-60 min; this effect diminished after 2 h of treatment. A \nsecond peak in leptin-induced Mcl-1 expression was detected \nat 24 h (Fig. 4B).\n\nActivation of JAK2, PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways \nmediate leptin-stimulated cell growth of OVCAR-3 cells. \nIn order to determine the intracellular signaling pathways \nresponsible for the effect observed with leptin treatment, we \nanalyzed the phosphorylation status of JAK2, Akt and ERK1̸2. \nThe phosphorylated forms of JAK2, Akt and ERK1̸2 were \ndose-dependently increased by leptin in the OVCAR-3 cells \n(Fig. 5B). Simultaneously, the time-course experiments showed \n\nFigure 1. Leptin stimulates ovarian cancer cell growth.  OVCAR-3 cells were \nseeded in 6- or 96-well plates and serum-deprived for 48 h. The serum-starved \ncells were incubated with serial doses of leptin as indicated for an additional \n48 h. Cell viability was analyzed by (A) trypan blue exclusion staining and \n(B) MTT assays.

OVCAR-3 cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and then cultured in \nmedium containing 200 ng̸ml leptin for 0, 6, 18, 21, 26 and 48 h. The level \nof cleaved PARP was measured by western blot analysis using β-actin as the \ninternal control for total protein. Similar results were observed from three \nindependent experiments.\n\nFigure 3. Leptin regulates the expression of cyclin D1 and the anti-apoptotic \nprotein, Mcl-1. OVCAR-3 cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and then cul-\ntured in serum-free medium containing the indicated concentration of leptin \nfor 24 h. The levels of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 protein were measured using \nwestern blot analysis. The blots were stripped and reprobed using a β-actin \nantibody as the internal control for equal loading of total protein. Similar \nresults were observed from three independent experiments.

Leptin treatment resulted in \nthe activation of JAK2, Akt and ERK1̸2 kinases in the ovarian \ncancer cells. Subsequently, we used pharmacological inhibitors \nto determine the involvement of these signaling kinases on \nthe growth-stimulating effect of leptin. The leptin-stimulated \ngrowth of the OVCAR-3 cells was abolished by the inhibitor \nspecific for JAK2 (AG490) (Fig. 6A), PI3K̸Akt (wortmannin) \n(Fig. 6B) and MEK̸ERK1̸2 (U0126) (Fig. 6C), which is \nconsistent with the activation of the JAK2, PI3K̸Akt and \nMEK̸ERK1̸2 pathways.\n\nLeptin stimulates the expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 \nthrough the activation of JAK2-associated signaling path-\nways. To elucidate the mechanisms by which JAK2, PI3K/\nAkt and MEK̸ERK1̸2 mediate leptin‑induced cyclin D1 and \nMcl-1 expression, we examined the effects of their inhibitors \non cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 expression. The specific inhibitors \nfor JAK2 (AG490), PI3K̸Akt (Ly294002), or MEK̸ERK1̸2 \n(U0126), blocked the leptin induction of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 \nprotein expression (Fig. 7A and B). Taken together, these data \n\nFigure 4. Leptin induced Mcl-1 expression in two phases in OVCAR-3 cells. \nOVCAR-3 cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and cultured in serum-free \nmedium containing 200 ng̸ml leptin for the indicated periods of time. Mcl‑1 \nprotein levels were measured using western blot analysis. The membranes \nwere stripped and reprobed using a β-actin antibody as the internal control \nto normalize the amount of protein loaded per lane. Similar results were \nobserved from three separate experiments. LEP, leptin.\n\nFigure 5. Leptin induces the phophorylation of JAK2, Akt and ERK1̸2 in \nOVCAR-3 cells.

(B) After 48-h serum deprivation, leptin was added to the serum-free \nmedium of OVCAR-3 cells for 5 min with increasing concentrations as indi-\ncated, and then the protein was collected. The amounts of the phosphorylated \nforms of JAK2 (p‑JAK2), Akt (p‑Akt), or ERK1̸2 (p‑ERK1̸2) were detected \nusing western blot analysis. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with \nantibodies specific for total proteins of Akt or ERK1̸2. LEP, leptin.\n\nFigure 6.

The means and \nstandard deviations (SD) were calculated from 24 replicates. Statistically \nsignificant differences compared to the control group (CTRL) were noted as \n**P<0.01 and ***P<0.001. OD, optical density.\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  1113-1119,  2013 1117\n\nreveal that leptin activates the signaling pathways, including \nJAK2, PI3K/Akt and MEK̸ERK1/2 to enhance the expres-\nsion of cyclin D1 and the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1, which \nsubsequently stimulates OVCAR-3 cell growth and prevents \napoptosis.\n\nLeptin activates crosstalk among JAK2, PI3K/Akt and \nMEK̸ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Using AG490, the inhibitor \n\nof JAK2, PD98059 and U0126, the inhibitors of MEK̸ERK1̸2 \nand the inhibitors of PI3K/Akt, wortmannin and Ly294002, \nwe examined the leptin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt \nand ERK1̸2 to elucidate the crosstalk among these signaling \npathways in OVCAR-3 cells (Fig. 8). As expected, U0126 and \nPD98059 specifically blocked the leptin‑induced phosphoryla-\ntion of ERK1̸2, while wortmannin and Ly294002 inhibited the \nleptin‑induced phosphorylation of Akt. The specific blocker \nof JAK2, AG490, decreased leptin‑phosphorylated ERK1̸2 \nand Akt. Wortmannin and Ly294002, not only inhibited \nleptin-activated Akt but also completely abrogated the effects \nof leptin on ERK1̸2 phosphorylation. Similar results were \nobserved with U0126 and PD98059 treatments. The inhibi-\ntors of the MEK/ERK1/2 pathway concomitantly blocked \nthe leptin‑activated phosphorylation of ERK1̸2 and partially \ndecreased the level of leptin-induced phosphorylated Akt. \nAccording to these findings, we propose that leptin triggers a \nJAK2‑initiated signaling cascade, comprised of the PI3K̸Akt \nand MEK̸ERK1̸2 pathways in ovarian cancer.\n\nDiscussion\n\nObesity is a significant health concern in developed countries \nwith a dramatically increased incidence over the last decade. In \nthe US, more than one third of the adults (35.7%) are obese and \n68.8% are considered overweight based on their BMI (33,34). \nObesity has been identified as a risk factor in diabetes, cardio-\nvascular diseases and in many types of cancer, such as breast, \nesophageal, prostate, colon and liver cancer (35). The adipokine, \nleptin, may be an important factor in the growth of ovarian \ncancer (16). In epidemiological surveys, obesity has been \nshown to increase ovarian cancer incidence, and shorten the \ntime of survival and recurrence (5,9). However, the molecular \nmechanisms underlying the clinical observations remain \nunclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of leptin \non ovarian cancer cells. Our results show that leptin stimulates \novarian cancer cell growth and exerts an anti-apoptotic effect by \nincreasing the expression of cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 proteins.\n\nApart from the effect of leptin on cell growth and the \ninhibition of apoptosis, our results showed that leptin induced \ncyclin D1 expression, which plays a crucial role in cell prolif-\neration in a variety of cancer cells, such as breast cancer, \nhepatocellular carcinoma and ovarian cancer cells. In addi-\ntion, to our knowledge, we are the first to show that leptin \ndirectly stimulates Mcl-1 expression. Mcl-1 is a member of \nthe Bcl-2 family. The expression of the Bcl-2 family members \nis frequently deregulated during carcinogenesis. Mcl-1 is \nfrequently amplified in human cancers (23). The downregula-\ntion of Mcl-1 is essential to induce cell death in ovarian cancer \ncells in response to Bcl-2 inhibitors. siRNA treatment to \ninhibit Mcl-1 expression has been shown to induce apoptosis \nin ovarian cancer cells (36-38). In our study, leptin acutely \ninduced Mcl-1 expression within 10-60 min; this effect that \nrapidly diminished within 3 h (Fig. 4). The half-life of Mcl-1 \nis around 1 h compared to 10-14 h for Bcl-2 (39). Mcl-1 mRNA \nexpression evolves and changes rapidly and this feature perhaps \nexplains why Mcl-1 expression may be rapidly increased or \ndownregulated with cytokines and differentiation factors. \nMcl-1 thus differs from other members of the Bcl-2 family \nin acting as an immediate response molecule to protect cells \n\nFigure 7. Pharmacological inhibitors of JAK2, PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1̸2 \nprevent leptin-induced cyclin D1 and Mcl-1 expression. OVCAR-3 cells were \nserum‑starved for 48 h and then treated with the vehicle (‑), 200 ng̸ml leptin (+), \n200 ng̸ml leptin without (‑) or with (+), 40 µM AG490 (AG), 10 µM U0126 \n(U0), or 50 mM Ly294002 (Ly) for 24 h. After 24-h treatment, the cell extracts \nwere harvested and subjected to western blot analysis to detect (A) cyclin D1 \nand (B) Mcl-1 protein. The blots were reprobed with a β-actin antibody to \nnormalize the protein loading. Data represent three independent experiments.\n\nFigure 8. Leptin triggers JAK2‑MEK̸ERK1̸2 and PI3K/Akt signaling \npathways. After 48-h serum deprivation and 30-min pre-treatment with the \nvehicle (-), 40 µM AG490 (AG), 50 mM Ly294002 (Ly), 250 nM wortmannin \n(Wort), 20 µM PD98059 or 10 µM U0126, OVCAR‑3 cells were treated with \nvehicle (‑) or 200 ng̸ml leptin (+) in serum‑free medium for 10 min. The level \nof the phosphorylated forms of Akt (pAkt) or ERK1̸2 (pERK1̸2) was detected \nwith western blot analysis. The same blots were stripped and reprobed with \nantibodies specific for total protein of Akt or ERK1̸2. β-actin was used as the \ninternal control. Data represent three independent experiments.\n\n\n\nCHEN et al:  LEPTIN STIMULATES cyclin D1 AND Mcl‑1 EXPRESSION1118\n\nagainst apoptosis (23). In our experiments, leptin stimulated \nMcl-1 expression in two phases. Apart from acute stimulation, \nwe found that leptin induced Mcl-1 expression at 24 h to the \nsame levels observed within 60 min.\n\nThe phosphorylation of JAK2 is thought to be the first \nevent following the binding of leptin to its cellular receptor. \nSubsequently, activated JAK2 triggers other signaling \npathways. In our study, AG490, an inhibitor of JAK2, \nabolished the leptin-induced activation of the downstream \npathways, PI3K̸Akt and MEK̸ERK1̸2. Previous studies \nhave suggested that the response to leptin treatment is \ntransmitted via the MAP kinase and PI3K̸Akt pathways in \novarian cancer cells (16,19). Using specific inhibitors of the \nMEK̸ERK1̸2 and PI3K̸Akt pathways, we observed that \nboth pathways interacted with each other. Both pathways are \nrequired to mediate leptin-stimulated cell growth and inhibi-\ntion of apoptosis.\n\nIn the present study, we demonstrate that leptin stimulates \ncyclin D1 and Mcl-1 protein expression. Furthermore, leptin \ninduces cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in ovarian \ncancer cells. Our results also identify the signaling pathways \nresponsible for ovarian cancer cell growth and inhibition of \napoptosis in response to leptin, providing a direct association \nbetween obesity and ovarian carcinogenesis.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Dr Ing-Cherng Guo (deceased, March 2, 2008) for \nhis major contribution in providing us with the initial experi-\nmental design and support.
