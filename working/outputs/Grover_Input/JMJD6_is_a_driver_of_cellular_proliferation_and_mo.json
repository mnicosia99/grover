This analysis, followed by functional\ncharacterization, resulted in the identification of Jumonji Domain Containing 6 (JMJD6) protein as a novel driver of\noncogenic properties in breast cancer.\n\nMethods: Through microarray informatics, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze the correlation\nbetween gene expression and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of patients in 14 independent breast cancer\ncohorts. JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate gene robustly associated with poor patient survival.\nImmunohistochemistry, siRNA-mediated silencing, and forced overexpression of JMJD6 in cell-based assays\nelucidated molecular mechanisms of JMJD6 action in breast cancer progression and shed light on the clinical\nbreast cancer subtypes relevant to JMJD6 action.\n\nResults: JMJD6 was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse outcomes, including ER- and basal-like,\nClaudin-low, Her2-enriched, and ER+ Luminal B tumors. High nuclear JMJD6 protein was associated with ER negativity,\nadvanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue microarrays. Separation of ER+/LN- patients that received endocrine\nmonotherapy indicated that JMJD6 is predictive of poor outcome in treatment-specific subgroups. In breast cancer cell\nlines, loss of JMJD6 consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not apoptosis, whereas forced stable\noverexpression increased growth. In addition, knockdown of JMJD6 in invasive cell lines, such as MDA-MB231,\ndecreased motility and invasion, whereas overexpression in MCF-7 cells slightly promoted motility but did not confer\ninvasive growth. Microarray analysis showed that the most significant transcriptional changes occurred in cell-\nproliferation genes and genes of the TGF-b tumor-suppressor pathway. High proliferation was characterized by\nconstitutively high cyclin E protein levels. The inverse relation of JMJD6 expression with TGF-b2 could be extrapolated to\nthe breast cancer cohorts, suggesting that JMJD6 may affect similar pathways in primary breast cancer.\n\nConclusions: JMJD6 is a novel biomarker of tumor aggressiveness with functional implications in breast cancer\ngrowth and migration.\n\nIntroduction\nIn breast cancer, resistance to standard-of-care systemic\nadjuvant treatments such as endocrine and chemothera-\npies remains a major health burden and prompts the\nneed for novel therapeutic targets for patients with\n\nadvanced, unresponsive, or relapsed disease. We pre-\nviously used gene-expression profiles of breast tumors to\nidentify extracellular/secretory proteins and cell surface-\nreceptor genes whose high expression levels associate\nwith poor clinical end points. For example, we recently\nidentified serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1)\nas an important therapeutic target in breast cancer by\nusing a combined genotype and phenotype screening\napproach. We found that inhibition of SPINK1 by\n\n* Correspondence: kd1@nibmg.ac.in\n8National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, 2nd Floor Netaji Subash\nSanatorium, Kalyani 741251, India\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nLee et al.

A second candidate identified in the\nsame study was the phosphatidylserine receptor (PTDSR).\nFormerly, PTDSR was thought to be a cell-surface\n\nprotein that facilitates recruitment of phagocytic cells to\nsites of apoptosis. Antibodies against PTDSR and\nannexin V have been used in combination to estimate\napoptosis [2]. Mouse knockouts of PTDSR showed early\npostnatal lethality and had growth retardation and mul-\ntiple developmental abnormalities due to insufficient dif-\nferentiation during embryogenesis; however, no defect in\napoptotic clearance of cells was evident [3]. By genera-\ntion of deletion mutants and immune localization, Cui\net al. [4] demonstrated that PTDSR is a nuclear protein,\nwith five nuclear localization signals scattered through-\nout its sequence. Later, PTDSR was renamed Jumonji\ndomain containing 6 (JMJD6) based on the presence of\nits JMJC domain with bifunctional histone arginine\ndemethylation and lysyl oxidase activity [4-6]. JMJD6 is\nhomologous to the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) aspar-\naginyl-hydroxylase, suggesting a function in cellular\nresponse to hypoxia. In addition, JMJD6 protein was\nrecently shown to interact with splicing factor U2AF65;\nhowever, very few splicing events in a limited number of\ngenes were attributable to JMJD6 expression [6]. In\nendothelial cells, alternate splicing of VEGF receptor\n(Flt1) by U2AF65 promoted endothelial cell migration,\nand siRNA-mediated knockdown of JMJD6 in endothe-\nlial cells led to decreased migration [7]. Based on X-ray\ncrystallographic data, it was predicted and shown that\napart from its enzymatic activity, JMJD6 protein bound\nsingle-stranded RNA [8]. These diverse findings predict\na range of versatile functions for JMJD6, at the tran-\nscriptional, splicing, posttranscriptional, and biochemical\nlevels. However, very little is known about the role of\nJMJD6 in cancer and the molecular pathways that may\nimpinge on disease initiation and prognosis.\nBecause our in silico analysis demonstrated a robust\n\npositive association between JMJD6 expression and\nbreast cancer recurrence, we investigated its phenotypic\nand molecular effects in breast cancer cells. We report\nherein that perturbation of JMJD6 expression modulates\ncell proliferation and cell scattering and motility: pheno-\ntypes associated with cancer metastasis. Furthermore,\nour findings suggest that these cellular phenotypes may\nbe elicited by JMJD6-mediated suppression of trans-\nforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGF-b2) and/or activa-\ntion of proteins that potentiate cell division in a cell\ntype-specific manner. These in vitro mechanistic find-\nings are consistent with the clinical observations that\nJMJD6 expression correlates positively with proliferation\nindex and high histologic grade but inversely with TGF-\nb2 expression. Together, these data implicate JMJD6\n\nfunction in breast tumor progression and suggest a diag-\nnostic role for JMJD6 in predicting patient outcomes.\n\nMaterials and methods\nBreast cancer clinical datasets\nTumor-expression profiles were obtained with approval\nfrom and in accordance with the policies of the institu-\ntional review boards of the respective institutions. An\nintegrated “Super Cohort” (SC) of 15 individual Affyme-\ntrix array datasets comprising 2,116 breast cancer\npatients was used in this analysis. These datasets were\npreviously described in detail in Soon et al. [1]. These\ncohorts were accessible from public databases, Gene\nExpression Omnibus (National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation, Bethesda, MD, USA), ArrayExpress (Eur-\nopean Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton, UK), and caAr-\nray (National Cancer Institute, NIH, Atlanta, GA, USA).\nAppropriate permission has been granted for the use of\nthe datasets and corresponding de-identified clinical\ndata. A summary of the clinical dataset details and lit-\nerature references can be found in Additional file 1,\nTable S1. Initial discovery and meta-analysis was per-\nformed on a subset of this Super Cohort.\nAll raw data (CEL files) were preprocessed and nor-\n\nmalized by using the R software package [9], and library\nfiles provided via the Bioconductor [10]. Raw data were\nMAS5.0 normalized on a per-cohort basis by using the\njustMAS function in the simpleaffy library from Biocon-\nductor (no background correction, target intensity of\n600). Cross-cohort batch effects were corrected by using\nthe COMBAT empirical Bayes method [11]. Normalized\nJMJD6 probesets, 212722_s_at and 212723_at, were\naveraged for the analysis of data from Affymetrix U133\narrays, and JMJD6 probe, AB011157, was used for the\nanalysis of the Agilent array dataset (that is, the NKI\ndataset). Of 2,116 array profiles in the Super Cohort,\n1,954 patient cases are annotated with distant metasta-\nsis-free survival (DMFS) time and event information.\n\nClinical survival analysis and expression in subtypes\nDistant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) was used as the\nclinical end point of interest. A DMFS event was defined\nas metastatic recurrence to a distant organ site or in a\nlimited number of cases, as death owing to progressive\nbreast cancer. Cox proportional hazard regression analy-\nsis of JMJD6 expression with DMFS data (Time and\nEvent) was performed in individual patient datasets and\nin the Super Cohort. Clinical subtype analysis was per-\nformed by using the Super Cohort. Intrinsic subtypes\nwere assigned via the PAM50 algorithm of Parker et al.\n[12], by using the code provided by the authors at UNC\nMicroarray Database [13]. Gene data were matched by\nsymbol and median centered, and Spearman correlation\nwas used to assign samples to the nearest PAM50\n\nLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85\n\nPage 2 of 16\n\n\n\ncentroid. Claudin-Low subtypes were assigned based on\nthe method described by Prat et al. [14], by using the\nmicroarray data (GSE18229) and information provided\nby the authors at UNC Microarray Database [13]. Clau-\ndin-Low and Normal centroids were generated, and\nsamples were assigned to one or the other class based\non euclidean distance to the class centroid. The PAM50\nand Claudin-Low subtype information was then com-\nbined with the PAM50 subtype used, unless a sample\nhad been classified as Claudin-Low, in which case, the\nClaudin-Low assignment would take precedence.\nDistribution of JMJD6 expression in various breast\n\ncancer subtypes was analyzed with the Kruskal-Wallis\none-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks and\nmultiple pairwise comparisons with the Dunn method\nby using Sigma Plot. Statistical significance of differen-\ntial JMJD6 expression in ER-positive versus ER-negative\ntumors was analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney Rank\nSum Test. In Kaplan-Meier and CoxPH survival analysis\nof JMJD6 expression cohorts in the clinical subtypes, the\npatients were separated by median expression across the\nSuper Cohort into high and low JMJD6-expression\ngroups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis also was per-\nformed on patient groups ranked by quartile expression\nwithin each clinical subtype. All survival analyses were\nperformed by using Sigma Plot [15].\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nTissue microarray (TMA) blocks containing cores from\n98 breast cancer patients were constructed, as described\npreviously, under institutional ethics committee approval\nwith consent for the tissue microarray program (NUS-\nIRB 05-017) [1,16,17] and used for the analysis. Anti-\nJMJD6 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz,\nCA, USA: Sc-28348) was used at a dilution of 1:50 along\nwith antigen retrieval by heat and Tris-EDTA (pH 9.1).\nAutomated IHC scoring was performed with the Ariol\nSL-50 image analysis system (Applied Imaging, Santa\nClara, CA, USA). Positivity of JMJD6 nuclear expression\nwas defined as nuclear-staining intensity and percentage\ncoverage scores ≥25%. Odds-ratio analysis was per-\nformed on JMJD6-positive expression and clinicopatho-\nlogic features of the tumors by using PASW Statistics\n18 [18].\n\nCell lines\nAll cell lines were obtained from American Type Cul-\nture Collection (ATCC) and maintained in growth\nmedia, at 37°C with 5% CO2. The growth medium for\nMCF-7, CAMA-1, and BT-549 was Dulbecco Modified\nEagle Medium (DMEM), with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS); and for MDA-MB231 and T47D, it was RPMI-\n1640, with 10% FBS.\n\nCloning and expression of JMJD6\nJMJD6 (NM_001081461.1) (J1) was amplified by using\nMCF-7 mRNA (forward primer: 5’CCCAAGCTTAT-\nGAACCACAAGAGCAAGAAG3’; reverse primer: 5’\nGCTCTAGATCACCTGGAGGAGCTGCG 3’), followed\nby reamplification with forward primer: 5’ GAGGTAC-\nCATGAACCACAAGAGCA 3’ and reverse primer: 5’\nCGCTCGAGTGGGGGTGAGCCCGGCCT 3’ and\nligated into TOPO pCR2.1 vector. All clones were\nsequence verified. JMJD6 was cloned from TOPO vec-\ntors into a gateway entry vector pENTR3C (Invitrogen)\nand then recombined into the lentivirus vector\npLenti6.2/V5-DEST (Invitrogen), pLenti4/V5-Dest (Invi-\ntrogen), and pcDNA3.1/V5-Dest (Invitrogen) by LR\nrecombination, according to the manufacturer’s proto-\ncol. For lentiviral clones, pLenti6.2/V5-DEST or\npLenti4/V5-Dest was co-transfected with packaging vec-\ntors (Invitrogen) into 293 FT cells, and the supernatant\nwas harvested approximately 48 hours for packaged len-\ntivirus. For infection of MCF-7 cells, the cells were pla-\nted at 50% confluence and incubated with 20 μl to 30 μl\nof the concentrated virus and 8 μg/ml of hexamethrine\nbromide (Polybrene) for 24 hours at 37°C. The cells\nwere replated and cultured with Zeocin (Invitrogen) to\nobtain several clones (MCF7-J1-OE). The pcDNA3.1\nvector was used to generate JMJD6 expression clones by\ntransfection by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)\ninto MDA-MB231, T47D, and CAMA cell lines. Stable\nclones were selected with gentamycin (Gibco).\n\nKnockdown of JMJD6 gene\nSiRNA was reverse transfected (by using manufacturer’s\nprotocol) by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) into\nthe cell lines. At 48 hours after transfection, the cells\nwere reconstituted in fresh media for experimental\nassays. JMJD6 siRNAs used were as follows: siRNA A\n(Ambion: 111915)- gcuauggugaacacccuaatt; siRNA B\n(Dharmacon: D-010363-01)- gaacugggauucacaucga;\nsiRNA C (Dharmacon: D-010363-02)- ggauaacgauggcua-\ncuca; and siRNA D (Dharmacon: D- 010363-05)-\nggacccggcacaacuacua. A nontargeting scrambled siRNA\nserved as a negative control (Ambion: 4635).\n\nCell-based assays\nFor proliferation assay, cells were plated in 96-well\nplates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. Cell prolifera-\ntion was measured by using WST-1 (Roche) every\n24 hours over a 4- to 5-consecutive-day period, accord-\ning to manufacturer’s protocol. For detecting apoptosis,\ncells were transfected in a 96-well plate with siRNAs\nand assessed for apoptotic markers after 48 hours. In\nbrief, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and\ncells were permeabilized with Triton-X 100. Fixed cells\n\nLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85\n\nPage 3 of 16\n\n\n\nwere probed with active PARP (BD, 552596) antibody,\nand the primary antibodies were detected by a second-\nary antibody conjugated to fluors Alexa 488 (BD,\nA21121). ArrayScan VTI (Cellomics) was used to detect\nimmunofluorescence, and the baseline threshold was set\nby using cells stained with secondary antibody alone in\nthe absence of the primary antibody.\n\nScatter assay\nCells were plated in six-well plates at a density of 300\ncells per well and grown in DMEM with 10% FBS. Fifteen\nfields of colonies per cell type were captured on day 7 of\ngrowth and blindly scored for three categories of scatter-\ning (compact, loose, and scatter) by two random indivi-\nduals from six people. An average score was calculated\nfor each colony, and the percentage of colonies for each\ncategory of scattering was plotted [19].\n\nWound-healing assay\nCells were plated in culture inserts (Ibidi) with approxi-\nmately 500 μM gap. After 2 days (confluent cells), the\ninserts were removed, and fresh medium with 5 μg/ml of\nmitomycin C (Calbiochem, 47589) was added. The dis-\ntances moved by the cells across the gap were measured at\n24 hours and calculated as a ratio over the initial distance\nat 0 hours, and these data were further normalized to the\nratio of distance in Vec control.\n\nInvasion and migration assay\nIn vitro migration and invasion of the cells were assessed\nby using Falcon FluoroBlok 24-Multiwell inserts with\n8-μm pores (BD Biosciences). For invasion assays, the\ninserts were coated with 20 μg of Matrigel in 80 μl of\nserum-free media. Cell suspension (200 μl) in serum-free\nmedia was loaded into each transwell insert, and 750 μl\nof medium with 10% FBS was provided in the lower\nchamber; 4 × 104 MDA-MB231/BT-549 cells were loaded\nin each transwell. The assay was done for 18 hours for\nmigration and 24 hours for invasion. The cells that had\nmigrated or invaded through the inserts were fixed with\n3.7% formaldehyde and stained with propidium iodide,\n2 μg/ml (Calbiochem), for 30 minutes, washed with PBS,\nand counted for 10 fields by using the Target Activation\nBioapplication on an ArrayScan VTI (Cellomics). Assay\nresults for siRNA-treated MDA-MB231 cells were nor-\nmalized to fold change observed in proliferation at Day 2\nand then calculated as a ratio to the Sc siRNA control.\n\nMicroarray data analysis\nMCF-7 J1 clones were harvested for RNA isolation at\n80% confluence. For siRNA-mediated knockdown of\nJMJD6 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, the cells were har-\nvested for RNA isolation immediately, 48 hours after\n\ntransfection. Cells were washed twice with PBS and har-\nvested by trypsinization. RNA was extracted by Trizol\n(Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Three\nbiological replicates of MCF-7 J1 clones and two inde-\npendent siRNA-transfection replicates were used for the\nmicroarray hybridization. Processing of samples for\nhybridization on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 was done\naccording to manufacturer’s protocol. The microarray\ndata were uploaded to Gene Expression Omnibus\n(accession number, GSE31782). Raw data were MAS5-\nnormalized and log transformed by using Genespring\nGX11.5. To extract differential gene expression, Gene-\nSpring GX 11.5 was used to perform two-way ANOVA\nfor siRNA-specific changes in MCF-7 and MDA-\nMB231. The list of significantly differential genes (P <\n0.05) was further filtered for genes with at least 1.5-fold\nchange in expression in at least one of the siRNA treat-\nments for either MCF-7 or MDA-MB231. For MCF-7\nJ1-OE clones, one-way ANOVA was performed to\nextract differential gene expression in the overexpression\nclones as compared with the Vec. Only genes that dif-\nfered in their expression by 1.5-fold in at least one of\nthe clones were selected for further analysis. Genes that\noverlapped in both siRNA treatment and in J1 clones\nand those that were regulated in the opposite direction\nwere selected for Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) [20].\nHierarchical clustering by average linkage and visualiza-\ntion of the clusters was performed by using Cluster and\nTreeview, respectively [21,22].\nTo extract differential gene expression specific to\n\nMDA-MB231, GeneSpring GX11.5 was used to per-\nform one-way ANOVA in MDA-MB231 and MCF-7\nindependently. The list of significant genes that were\ndifferentially expressed (1.5-fold; P < 0.05) was fil-\ntered. Probesets unique to MDA-MB231 that were\nabsent in MCF-7 lists were extracted for IPA func-\ntional analysis.\n\nReal-time PCR\nTotal RNA was reverse transcribed by using Maxima\nreverse transcriptase mix (Fermentas). Real-time PCR\nwas performed by using SYBR-Green PCR Mix (Fer-\nmentas) and run on CFX384 Real Time PCR Detection\nSystem (Biorad). Ct values were generated by using CFX\nmanager software (Biorad). The primers used are listed\nin the Additional file 2, Table S2.\n\nConditioned media\nTo obtain conditioned media, plated cells were incu-\nbated with serum-free media for 24 hours before collec-\ntion. The media were spun down to remove any cell\ndebris and then concentrated ×60 to 80 by using Ami-\ncon Ultra centrifugation filter (Millipore).\n\nLee et al.

Protein concentration was quantified by using\nProtein Assay reagent (Biorad) with BSA standards. Equal\namounts of total protein lysates (20 to 40 μg) were ana-\nlyzed on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to PVDF\nmembrane (GE Healthcare and Millipore). Antibodies\nagainst JMJD6 (Abcam, ab10526), b-actin (Sigma, A5441),\nV5 tag (Invitrogen, R960-25), E-cadherin (Cell Signaling,\n4065), vimentin (BD Pharmingen, 550513), TGF-b2\n(Abcam, ab36495), phosphorylated SMAD2 (Cell Signal-\ning, 3108 and 3104), phosphorylated SMAD3 (Cell Signal-\ning, 4520), SMAD2/3 (Cell Signaling, 3102), cyclin D1\n(ab24249), cyclin E1 (Abcam, ab3927), and cyclin E2\n(Abcam, ab40890) were used to probe for the protein on\nthe membrane. The detection was done by using HRP-\nconjugated antibodies (Santa Cruz) and ECL or ECL Plus\nreagents (Amersham Biosciences). Reactive proteins were\nidentified with autoradiography.\n\nTGF-b2 neutralization and Smad phosphorylation assays\nCells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 5,000\ncells per well and changed to fresh media with either 5\nng/ml of recombinant human (rh) TGF-b2 (R&D Sys-\ntems, 302-B2) or BSA the next day. Cell-viability mea-\nsurement was taken on the first day of TGF-b2 or\nBSA treatment and 3 days later by using WST-1 assay.\nTo inhibit TGF-b2 action, cells were plated in 96-well\nplates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. After\n24 hours, they were exposed to 10 μM SB431542\n(Sigma-Aldrich, S4317) or DMSO (as vehicle control)\nbefore transfection with JMJD6 siRNA. The cells were\nchanged to fresh media 48 hours after transfection, con-\ntaining 10 μM SB431542 or DMSO. Cell viability was\ndetermined on the first day of SB431542 or DMSO\ntreatment and 3 days later by WST-1 assay. For assess-\nment of SMAD2 phosphorylation, cells were plated at\napproximately 50% confluence in six-well plates for\n24 hours. The cells were pretreated for 2 hours with\nSB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich, S4317) or DMSO, before\naddition of 5 ng/ml of rhTGF-b2 (R&D Systems, 302-\nB2). Protein lysates were harvested 1 hour after rhTGF-\nb2 treatment for immunoblot analysis.\n\nClinical correlation between TGF-b2 and JMJD6\nThe super-cohort dataset was used to assess correlation,\nif any, between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 expression. TGF-b2\nprobesets, 209908_s_at, 220407_s_at, 209909_s_at, and\n220406_at, were averaged for the clinical microarray\ndata analysis. Correlation of JMJD6 expression and\nTGF-b2 expression was performed by using the Pearson\ncorrelation test on PASW Statistics 18 [18].\n\nResults\nJMJD6 transcript levels correlate with poor prognosis in\nbreast cancer\nTo discover novel oncogenes associated with breast can-\ncer progression, we used an informatics approach [1] and\nmined multiple independent microarray datasets of\nbreast tumor profiles for genes having significant and\nreproducible associations with distant metastasis-free\nsurvival (DMFS). JMJD6 emerged as a top candidate,\nbecause its expression was significantly and positively\nassociated with decreased time to distant metastasis in\neight of the 14 breast cancer cohorts examined (Figure 1\nand Additional file 1, Table S1). Furthermore, in an inte-\ngrated Super Cohort (SC) (n = 1,954) comprising\nthe majority of the individual cohorts listed in Table 1\n(see Methods and Additional file 1, Table S1), high\nJMJD6 expression was significantly associated with\ndecreased time to distant metastasis with a hazard ratio\nof 1.92 (95% CI, 1.62 to 2.29; P < 0.001). Together, these\nobservations indicate a robust and reproducible associa-\ntion between JMJD6 expression and aggressive clinical\nbehavior of breast cancer that may reflect an underlying\nfunctional contribution of JMJD6 in breast cancer\nprogression.\n\nJMJD6 expression in breast cancer subtypes\nBreast cancers were classified based on hormone-receptor\nstatus, estrogen receptor (ER+/-), or gene expression into\nintrinsic subtypes as described by Perou et al. [23].\nBecause these subclasses show differential survival, we\nanalyzed the expression level of JMJD6 in each subtype\nannotated in the Super Cohort. As shown in Figure 2A,\noverall ER- tumors had slightly but significantly elevated\nexpression of JMJD6 (P < 0.001). The average JMJD6\nexpression differed across the intrinsic subtypes. JMJD6\nexpression was highest in Claudin-low tumors and basal\nsubtypes, followed by HER2, whereas in the ER+ group,\nthe luminal B (LumB) expressed more JMJD6 than did\nluminal A (LumA) (P < 0.05) (Figure 2B). We examined\nthe survival outcome of JMJD6 high- and low-expresser\ngroups, determined by median separation across the Super\nCohort, within each subtype. Because ER- tumors had very\nhigh levels of JMJD6 expression, further separation based\non JMJD6 levels and survival analysis bore no significance\n(Table 1). In ER+ tumors, high JMJD6 expressers had\npoorer outcome than low expressers (Figure 2C; P <\n0.001), and this persisted on subdivision of ER+ into lumi-\nnal subclasses (Figure 2D and 2E). Further, in the tamoxi-\nfen-treated samples, high JMJD6 expressers had worse\noutcome. However, whether JMJD6 predicts endocrine\nfailure must be studied further. These data are summar-\nized in Table 1. Other than total cohort median-based\nseparation of patients, we also examined the relation of\n\nLee et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R85\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R85\n\nPage 5 of 16\n\n\n\nJMJD6 levels and prognosis by quartile assignment of\nJMJD6 expression in each subtype independently. With\nthis method, we observed that extremely high expression\nof JMJD6 (upper quartile) significantly led to worse survi-\nval outcomes in luminal A and luminal B subtypes (P <\n0.05) (see Additional file 3, Figure S1). Therefore, we con-\nclude that JMJD6 is a marker for tumor aggressiveness\nand maybe is prognostic of poor outcome in ER+ breast\ncancer.\n\nJMJD6 protein associates with high-grade and ER- tumors\nTo study the distribution of JMJD6 protein levels, we\nimmunohistochemically (IHC) stained an 81-breast\ntumor tissue array by using a JMJD6-specific antibody\n(Figure 3A). MCF-7-J1 OE and JMJD6 siRNA-treated\ncells were used to confirm the specificity of the antibody\n(see Additional file 4, Figure S2). As shown, JMJD6 was\n\npresent predominantly in the nuclei of breast tumor\ncells, with increased staining evident in higher grades of\nbreast tumors. Univariate analysis clearly identified an\nassociation between high JMJD6 staining, high grade,\nand ER negativity (Figure 3B). Similar to the RNA-\nexpression data, JMJD6 protein was highly expressed in\nmore-aggressive and advanced tumors. However,\nbecause of the low sample size, our analysis could not\nexplore whether JMJD6 correlates with outcome in\nluminal tumors. Nonetheless, JMJD6 appears to be a\nrelevant marker in breast cancer pathogenesis.\n\nJMJD6 increases proliferation in MCF-7 cells\nBecause the JMJD6 expression profile was similar to the\nproliferative gene cluster, as characterized by Perou et al.\n[14,24], we posited that perturbation of its levels may\naffect cell proliferation (Figure 2A and 2B). We studied\nJMJD6 expression in a panel of five breast cancer cell lines\n(see Additional file 5, Figure S3A). With the exception of\nMCF-7 cells, JMJD6 was highly expressed in breast cancer\ncell lines. We used a lentiviral-based cloning system to\ninfect MCF-7 cells with V5-tagged JMJD6 and achieved\nstable expression of JMJD6 (MCF-7 J1-OE). As a pool,\nthese cells showed increased proliferation (see Additional\nfile 6, Figure S4), and this was confirmed in individual\nclones, J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7 (Figure 4A). Over a period\nof 5 days, MCF-7-J1-OE clones (J1-C2, J1-C3, and J1-C7)\nshowed higher proliferation as early as day 2 and contin-\nued to grow faster as compared with empty vector control\ncells (Vec) (Figure 4A). Next we silenced JMJD6 expres-\nsion in all five cell lines by using a panel of siRNAs and\nassayed their proliferation. We achieved 80% to 100%\nsilencing of JMJD6 protein, depending on the basal, endo-\ngenous expression level of JMJD6 (see Additional file 5,\n\nFigure 1 High JMJD6 mRNA expression is associated with poor survival outcome.

Four different siRNAs resulted in profound\nloss of proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA MB231 cells\n(Figure 4B and 4C). This decrease was not due to\nincreased apoptosis, because higher levels of cleaved PARP\nwere not evident in the JMJD6 knockdown cells (see Addi-\ntional file 5, Figure S3B). Similar to MCF7 and MDA-\nMB231, siRNA treatment decreased proliferation in the\nremaining cell lines: BT-549, CAMA-1, and T47D (see\nAdditional file 5, Figure S3C). Together, these results sug-\ngest that high levels of JMJD6 lead to increased cell prolif-\neration. To determine whether further induction of JMJD6\nin cells with intrinsically higher JMJD6 levels shows an\nadditive increase in cell proliferation, we generated\nMB231-J1-OE, T47D-J1-OE, and CAMA-J1-OE cells (see\nAdditional file 7, Figure S5). However, an increased dosage\nof JMJD6 did not further augment cell growth\n\nJMJD6 enhances scattering and motility\nOur in silico analysis and IHC data showed that JMJD6 is\nassociated with aggressive advanced disease. We next stu-\ndied whether this protein could influence cell motility\nand invasion by using cell-scatter, wound-healing, and\nBoyden chamber assays. The motility and invasion assays\nwere performed within 24 hours to minimize secondary\neffects of cell proliferation. For the scattering phenotype,\nwe used a counting system previously described by Shtut-\nman et al. [19] to evaluate the degree of scattering\n\n(Figure 5A). All three MCF-7-J1-OE clones showed an\nincrease in scattering as compared with Vec cells. An\nincrease in scattering often implies a gain in motility or\nepithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT). There-\nfore, we assayed loss of E-cadherin and gain in vimentin\nas markers for EMT. Immunoblots showed that MCF-\n7J1-OE clones maintained E-cad expression (see Addi-\ntional file 8, Figure S6), suggesting that the scattering is\nprobably encouraged by motility. Indeed, in a wound-\nhealing assay, MCF-7-J1-OE clones closed the wound\nmuch faster than did Vec cells (Figure 5B). Because\nincreased cell number due to increased proliferation can\nmislead interpretation of wound-healing data; we per-\nformed these assays in the presence of mitomycin C, an\ninhibitor of cell division. Despite a gain in motility, we\nwere unable to demonstrate an increase in invasive beha-\nvior in MCF-7-J1-OE cells (data not shown). However, in\nMDA-MB231, a highly motile and invasive cell line,\nknockdown of JMJD6 significantly attenuated both prop-\nerties (Figure 5C). To negate the contribution of\ndecreased proliferation in this assay, we normalized these\nresults to the proliferation changes observed on day 2\n(Figure 5C). However, the cells maintained loss in moti-\nlity and invasion, showing that this property was inde-\npendent of proliferation defects. Together, these data\nimply that JMJD6 is not a “driver” of cell invasion but\nmay augment cell movement.\n\nFigure 2 JMJD6 expression and prognosis in intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer.

We selected 2,216 overlapping\nprobe sets that were commonly and appropriately regu-\nlated in all three settings: MCF-7-J1-OE, MCF-7 siRNA,\nand MDA-MB231 siRNA (see Additional file 9, Table S3).\n\nFigure 3 Nuclear JMJD6 protein expression is associated with high-grade breast tumors.

We analyzed these two gene sets\nwith Ingenuity Pathway Analysis [20]. In accordance with\nour cell-based assays, in the JMJD6-induced gene set, the\ntop enriched functions were cell-cycle and DNA replica-\ntion, followed by cellular assembly and cellular movement\n(Figure 6; see Additional file 10, Table S4). In the JMJD6-\nrepressed subset, a large number of genes were related to\n\ncancer function (120) (Figure 6). Among the associated\ngene functions, we observed a significant downregulation\nof TGF-b isoforms, the classic cell-cycle inhibitors [25-27]\n(see Additional file 10, Table S4), which was further con-\nfirmed by using quantitative RT-PCR. Loss of JMJD6\nincreased TGF-b1 and TGF-b2 expression, whereas TGF-\nb3 was unaffected in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 (Fig-\nure 7A and 7B). Protein analysis suggested that both\nJMJD6 siRNAs induced a high level of TGF-b2 secretion\nin the two cell lines (Figure 7C). In contrast, in MCF-7-J1-\n\nFigure 5 JMJD6 promotes motility in breast cancer cell lines.

At the\nprotein level, we failed to detect changes in TGF-b1 and\nTGF-b3, although both isoforms were expressed (data not\nshown).

To test the functionality of TGF-\nb2, we did the following: (a) assessed Smad2/3 phos-\nphorylation levels in both cells, (b) neutralized TGF-b2\nby using a TGF-b type I receptor inhibitor SB431542\nand assayed Smad phosphorylation and cell proliferation\nin the absence of JMJD6, and (c) treated MCF-7-J1OE\ncells with recombinant TGF- b2.\nBy treatment of recombinant TGF-b2 on MCF-7 and\n\nMDA-MB231, we confirmed that both cell lines\nresponded with increased SMAD2 phosphorylation,\nwhich suggests intact TGF-b receptor signaling (Figure\n8; see Additional file 11, Figure S7A). Similarly, an\nincrease in SMAD2 and SMAD3 phosphorylation with\nJMJD6 siRNA treatment was seen in both MCF-7 and\nMDA-MB231, as opposed to a decrease observed in the\nMCF-7 J1 OE clones (Figure 8). Interestingly, basal\nSMAD levels themselves were affected, which parallels\nthe transcript-level change detected in our expression\narray (Figure 6). When we inhibited SMAD phosphory-\nlation by using an Alk-5 receptor inhibitor (SB431542),\n\nwe observed a significantly higher rescue of proliferation\nin MCF-7 JMJD6 knockdown cells (Figure 9A and 9B).\nBecause MDA-MB 231 cells are refractory to TGF-b2-\nmediated cell-cycle inhibition, SB431542 should have no\neffect on MDA-MB231 growth suppression. Accord-\ningly, the suppressed proliferation could not be rescued\nby the Alk-5 receptor inhibitor treatment in this cell\ntype (see Additional file 11, Figure S7).\nLast, treatment of MCF-7 J1-OE cells with recombi-\n\nnant TGF-b2 repressed proliferation in both Vec and\nJ1-OE cells, suggesting that MCF-7 retained sensitivity\nto TGF-b2-mediated growth regulation despite increased\nJMJD6 levels (Figure 9C). Therefore, JMJD6 did not\nconfer unresponsiveness to this growth factor, but prob-\nably mediated its effect via repression of gene expres-\nsion.

Other pathways that\noperate in MDA-MB 231 cells must be explored further.\n\nClinical data for JMJD6 and TGF-b2\nFinally, by using expression data from the clinical\ncohorts, we observed a marginal but significant inverse\ncorrelation of JMJD6 with TGF-b2 (Pearson correlation\nvalue, -0.118; P value = 9.13 × 10-8) (Figure 11). This\nsuggests that this TGF-b2 mechanism observed in vitro\ncould be extrapolated to patient data and that the MCF-\n7-OE cells could serve as a model system to explore the\npathways involved in further detail.\n\nDiscussion\nThrough microarray informatics, we identified JMJD6 as\na candidate oncogene associated with poor patient prog-\nnosis. Consistent with its potential as a marker of breast\ncancer aggressiveness, JMJD6 was expressed at highest\nlevels in ER-, basal, claudin-low, HER2-enriched, and\nLuminal B tumor subtypes, which are known to be clini-\ncally associated with poor patient outcomes. Most\n\nimportant, in the less-aggressive ER+ subtypes (for\nexample, Luminal A), high levels of JMJD6 could predict\npoor outcome and possibly resistance to tamoxifen\nmonotherapy. Protein analysis by using tissue microar-\nray confirmed that high JMJD6 expression is consistently\nassociated with ER- disease, higher grade, and advanced\nstage. These data demonstrate for the first time that\nJMJD6 is a relevant prognostic biomarker in breast\ncancer.\nBy phenotypic and functional analysis, we found that\n\nJMJD6 induced an increase in cell scattering and\nincreased the rate of wound closure in MCF-7 cells, but\ndid not confer an invasive phenotype. In invasive cells\nlike MDA-MB231 and BT-549 with high expression of\nJMJD6, siRNA-mediated suppression led to loss of both\nmotility and invasiveness properties. Because forced\nJMJD6 expression did not confer invasiveness, this\napparent loss of invasiveness most likely follows a loss\nin motility. Nonetheless, JMJD6 may have a critical role\nin epithelial cell movement, and we showed that this\nproperty is not restricted to endothelial cells [7]. How-\never, this appears to be a minor function of JMJD6,\nbecause its exogenous expression did not induce epithe-\nlial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) (that is, we did\nnot observe a loss or gain in E-cadherin or vimentin\nexpression, respectively, in MCF-7 J1-OE cells).\nThe most prominent effect of JMJD6 perturbation was\n\non cell proliferation. SiRNA-mediated attenuation of\nJMJD6 in multiple breast cancer cells led to a decrease\nin cell proliferation without activation of cellular apop-\ntosis, whereas forced expression in MCF-7 resulted in a\nmassive increase in cell proliferation. This finding is\nconsistent with the observation that JMJD6-knockout\nmice are small and show growth retardation [3]. The\nrole of JMJD6 in proliferation is further substantiated by\nour microarray analysis, which revealed that modulation\nof JMJD6 expression significantly affected the expression\nlevels of a number of cell cycle-associated genes (see\nAdditional file 10, Table S4). Although JMJD6 is thought\nto mediate splicing by physical interaction with U2AF65,\nwe obtained very little evidence for alternate transcripts\nin both cell lines. Conversely, we documented a large\nnumber of transcriptional changes in J1-OE clones and\nJMJD6 knockdowns.\nThe TGF-b pathway, particularly TGF-b2, was down-\n\nregulated when JMJD6 was overexpressed and induced\nwhen JMJD6 was depleted. We validated the inverse\nrelation between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 at both RNA and\nprotein levels in these cellular systems. We extended\nthis observation to clinical samples and observed an\ninverse correlation between JMJD6 and TGF-b2 in our\nbreast cancer cohorts. Such antagonistic roles of JMJD6\nand TGF-b2 have a precedent in eye development. One\nof the distinctive developmental defects of JMJD6-\n\nFigure 10 Decrease of cyclin E2 protein level in JMJD6\nknockdown. Western blot detection of G1 cell-cycle cyclins is\nshown.

In both MCF-\n7 and MDA-MB 231 transfected with JMJD6 siRNA, we\nobserved suppression of cyclin E expression, and an\nincrease in cyclin E was evident when JMJD6 was over-\nexpressed in MCF-7 cells. Therefore, in both cell lines,\nJMJD6 may exert a proliferative effect through a direct\nincrease in cyclin E protein levels, or this increase may\nbe a consequence of JMJD6-mediated suppression of\nTGF-b2. In both MCF-7 and MDA-MB231, the down-\nstream effectors, Smads, were phosphorylated on JMJD6\nsiRNA-mediated secretion of TGF-b2. Specifically, in\nMCF-7, inhibition of TGF-b activity by using a TGF-b\ntype I receptor (Alk5) inhibitor resulted in the loss of\nSmad phosphorylation, rescue of arrested cells, and con-\ntinuation of proliferation (Figure 9). The Alk5 inhibitor\ndid not reverse cell-cycle arrest in MDA-MB 231 cells\nbecause they are refractory to the antiproliferative effect\nof TGF-b, suggesting that the JMJD6-cyclin E axis may\nfunction independent of TGF-b2 in these cells. Intrigu-\ningly, cyclin E is associated with poor prognosis, chro-\nmosomal instability, and trastuzumab resistance,\nsuggesting that the long-term dysregulation of cell-cycle\nmediators by JMJD6 may affect more than just prolifera-\ntion [36-38].\nOur initial microarray analysis selected genes that\n\nwere commonly regulated by JMJD6 in both MCF-7 and\nMDA-MB 231 cells. To elucidate further the mechan-\nisms behind JMJD6 siRNA-mediated growth suppression\nin MDA-MB 231 cells, we reanalyzed gene-expression\nchanges unique to MDA-MB 231 cells alone. We found\n1,864 probesets, with significant enrichment of genes\ninvolved in cellular death, growth and proliferation, and\ncell movement (P < 0.01; see Additional file 12, Figure\nS8). Close inspection showed at least 28 individual\ngenes in this proliferation gene cassette (see Additional\nfile 13, Table S5); however, no connectivity or compel-\nling pathway emerged that could be investigated further.\n\nConclusion\nIn summary, our data indicate that JMJD6 has conserved\nfunctions and often affects similar pathways in a congru-\nent manner across multiple cell types and at a gene-\nexpression and phenotypic level. JMJD6 has ability to\npromote cancer cell proliferation and motility, which in\nturn may augment cancer virulence in vivo. In the clinic,\n\nJMJD6 associates with advanced grade, an aggressive\nphenotype, and serves as a marker of poor prognosis in\nbreast cancer. We propose that JMJD6 staining (with\nIHC) may serve a dual purpose in the clinic: to predict\npoor outcome in patients, particularly in the ER+ sub-\ntype, and to identify a patient subgroup wherein specific\ninhibitors of JMJD6 may facilitate the pathologic down-\nstaging of tumors in the neoadjuvant setting.\n\nAdditional material\n\nAdditional file 1: Table S1.

(A)\nWST-1 assay using MCF-7 J1-OE pooled population before clonal\nselection showed increased proliferation over vector control cells (Vec).\n(B) Immunoblots of conditioned media showed decreased levels of\nsecreted TGF-b2 in MCF-7 J1-OE pooled population as compared with\nVec. NS, nonspecific bands from the same TGF-b2 antibody blot to\nindicate even total protein loading.\n\nAdditional file 7: Figure S5. Overexpression of JMJD6 in CAMA,\nT47D, and MDA-MB231 had no effect on proliferation. Figures (top\npanel) show Western blot for V5-tagged JMJD6 clones expressed in (A)\nCAMA, (B) T47D, and (C) MDA-MB231, respectively, and b-actin as an\ninternal control for loading. A through C (bottom) show that stable\nJMJD6 overexpression clones did not display increased proliferation as\ncompared with the Vec control.\n\nAdditional file 8: Figure S6. MCF-7 J1-OE cells did not show\nchanges in E-cadherin and vimentin levels. Immunoblots showed that\nthe expression of E-cadherin is similar in the MCF-7 J1-OE cells and Vec\ncells. Vimentin remained unexpressed in MCF-7 J1-OE cells. MDA-MB231\nwas used as a positive control for the vimentin antibody.\n\nAdditional file 9: Table S3. Microarray analysis.
