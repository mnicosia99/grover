EA (10 or 30mg/kg/day, intragastrically) was administered for 14 consecutive days, and\nactivity, protein, and mRNA levels were determined. Although the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B and CYP2E enzyme activities\nwere decreased significantly, the activities of all other enzymes were unchanged with the 10mg/kg/day EA. In addition, western-\nblot and qRT-PCR results clearly corroborated the above enzyme expressions. On the other hand, while the NAD(P)H:quinone\noxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities were\nincreased significantly, CYP1A, 2B, 2C, 2E, and 19 enzyme activities were reduced significantly with 30mg/kg/day EA. In addition,\nCYP2B, 2C6, 2E1, and 19 protein and mRNA levels were substantially decreased by the 30mg/kg/day dose of EA, but the CYP1A\nprotein, and mRNA levels were not changed. CYP3A enzyme activity, protein and mRNA levels were not altered by neither 10 nor\n30mg/kg/day ellagic acid.These results indicate that EA exerts a dose-dependent impact on themetabolismof chemical carcinogens\nand drugs by affecting the enzymes involved in xenobiotics activation/detoxification and antioxidant pathways.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEllagic acid (EA) is one of the important components of\nfruits and vegetables [1] and has been shown to possess\nnumerous anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic properties\ntowards various carcinogens [1‚Äì7]. Several mechanisms have\nbeen proposed to explain the broad antimutagenic and\nanticarcinogenic effects of EA [8‚Äì13]. One of the mech-\nanisms proposed involves inhibition of cytochrome P450\n(CYP450) enzymes [8]. CYP450 enzymes are widely known\nfor their role in the metabolism of drugs and other foreign\ncompounds. Thus, modulation of this enzyme system can\ninfluence the metabolism of xenobiotics, producing effects\nof pharmacological and toxicological importance. A number\nof naturally occurring flavonoids have been shown to mod-\nulate the CYP450 system by the activation or inhibition of\n\nthese enzymes [14]. Multiple P450 isozymes show different\nsubstrate specificities and affinities toward both endogenous\nand exogenous compounds. Among these P450s, CYP1A, 2B,\n2C, 2E, and 3A subfamilies have received a great deal of\nattention in recent years because of their ability to metabolize\nvarious pharmaceutical and carcinogenic agents [15‚Äì17]. It\nis well established that CYP1A and CYP2E enzymes are\nmainly involved in carcinogen metabolism while CYP3A,\nCYP2B, and CYP2C enzymes aremainly responsible for drug\nmetabolism.\n\nAromatase represents a crucial enzyme of estrogen\nbiosynthesis, and increased expression of aromatase has\nbeen observed in breast cancer tissue [18]. Flavonoids and\nisoflavones are structurally similar to the endogenous estra-\ndiol and possess both estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities\n\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\n[19]. Previous studies suggest that ellagic acid has potential for\nthe prevention of estrogen-responsive breast cancers [20, 21].\n\nAnother possible mechanism for the broad chemopro-\ntective and antioxidant effects of EA might involve the\ninduction of phase II and antioxidant enzymes. GSTs have a\nconsiderably important role in the detoxification of carcino-\ngens [22]. NQO1 prevents quinine redox cycling and lowers\nlevels of electrophilic quinines [23]. Hence, the inductions of\nGST and NQO1 by flavonoids are possibly associated with\ncancer chemopreventive effects. The present study is, to our\nknowledge, the first study analyzing the effect of EA onNQO1\nactivity, mRNA, and protein levels in rat.\n\nAlthough there are individual studies examining the\neffect of EA on several enzymes, no study has evaluated the\nalteration of so many enzymes simultaneously with different\ndose of EA. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to\nobserve the overall simultaneous changes following in vivo\ntreatment with different dose of EA by investigating changes\nin the activity,mRNA, andprotein levels of specific rat hepatic\nP450s, phase II, and antioxidant enzymes at once.\n\n2. Material and Methods\n\n2.1. Chemicals. The following chemicals were purchased\nfrom Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company (St Louis, Mis-\nsouri, USA): ellagic acid, acrylamide, aniline, anti-rabbit\nIgG-HRP conjugate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Folin\nphenol reagent, glycerol, glycine, HEPES, ùõΩ-NADPH, phe-\nnol, caffeine, TRIS, PMSF, potassium dihydrogen phosphate,\ndipotassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dodecyl sulfate\n(SDS), and sodium potassium tartrate. Anti-rat CYP1A1,\nCYP2B, CYP2C6, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, and CYP19 antibodies\nwere from Abcam (Abcam PLC, Cambridge, UK). All other\nchemicals and solvents were obtained from commercial\nsources at the highest grade of purity available.\n\n2.2. Animals and Treatment. Healthy maleWistar rats, about\n12 weeks old andweighing 200‚Äì250 g, were obtained from the\nUniversity Animal House.They were housed in small cages at\nan ambient temperature of 22¬±1‚àòC, on a 12 h light/dark cycle,\nand a standard pellet diet and distilled water were available\nwithout restriction. All experimental procedures with the\nanimals were performed under appropriate regimes with vet-\nerinary services within the licensed projects (PAUHADEK-\n2009-007).\n\nAfter being acclimatized for 1 week, the rats were ran-\ndomized and divided into three groups. Ellagic acid was\ngiven intragastrically to two experimental groups (15 rats per\ngroup) in a dose of 10mg/kg/day (T10) and 30mg/kg/day\n(T30) dissolved in DMSO, respectively. Control (15 rats)\nrats only received a vehicle (DMSO). The doses used were\nchosen to be similar to the doses used in previous studies\nin the literature [24‚Äì26]. The animals were treated for 14\nconsecutive days. At the end of the experimental period\nand following 16 h of fasting, blood was collected by heart\npuncture and the rats were killed; the livers were removed,\nrinsed with cold physiological saline, and stored at ‚àí80‚àòC\nuntil analyzed.\n\n2.3. Preparations of S1.5, Cytosolic, and Microsomal Frac-\ntion. Tissues were homogenized in a 4 part homogeniza-\ntion solution (1.15% KCl containing 3mM EDTA, 0.5mM\nAPMSF, 0.3mM ùúÄ-aminocaproic acid, 0.15mM butylated\nhydroxytoluene, and 0.025% Triton X-100) using a tissue\nhomogenizer with a Teflon pestle at 4‚àòC. Subcellular fractions\n(S1.5, cytosolic, microsomal) of rat tissues were prepared by\nstandard differential centrifugation with calcium aggregation\nas described by [27]. The amount of protein in individual\nfractions was measured using BCA [28] with BSA as the\nstandard.\n\n2.4. Enzyme Assays. Serum aspartate aminotransferase\n(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities\nwere determined with an autoanalyzer using audit di-\nagnostics AST and ALT. The microsomal cytochrome\nP450-dependent aniline 4-hydroxylase (A4H) activities\nof rat microsomes were determined by measuring the\nquantity of p-aminophenol formed, as described by [29].\nAminopyrene N-demethylase (APND), erythromycin N-\ndemethylase (ERND) and caffeine N-demethylase (C3ND),\nn-nitrosodimethylamine N-demethylase (NDMA), ethyl-\nmorphine N-demethylase (EmND), and benzphetamine\nN-demethylase (BPND) activities were determined by\nmeasuring the quantity of formaldehyde formed, according\nto the method of [30] and modified by [31]. Ethoxyresorufin\nO-deethylase (EROD), and methoxyresorufin O-demethyl-\nase (MROD), benzyloxyresorufin O-demethylase (BROD),\npentoxyresorufin O-demethylase (PROD) activities were\nassayed as described by [15]. Dibenzylfluorescein-O-\ndebenzylase (DBFOD) activities were assayed as described\nby [32]. Rat liver NQO1 enzyme activity was determined\naccording to the method of [33]. Glutathione S-transferase\n(GST) activities were assayed as described by [34]. Catalase\n(CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were\ndetermined by [35, 36], respectively.\n\n2.5. Gel Electrophoresis andWestern Blotting. SDS-PAGE and\nwestern blotting were performed as described previously\n[15]. Briefly, 120ùúág protein samples were separated on 8.5%\npolyacrylamide gels using the discontinuous buffer system\nof [37]. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose mem-\nbrane by the iBlot dry blotting system (20V, 12min), using\niBlot gel transfer stacks. Following transfer, the membranes\nwere blocked using 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (20mM\nTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400mM NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween20)\nfor 60min, and incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-rat\nCYP1A1, CYP2B, CYP2C6, CYP2E1, CYP3A1, or CYP19\nantibodies (diluted 1 : 1000 in blocking solution) for 120min\nat room temperature.Themembranes were then washed with\nTBST (3 √ó 5min), incubated with the secondary antibody\n(HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at a 1 : 5000 or 1 : 10000\ndilution) for 60min and again washed with TBST (3 √ó\n5min). Proteins were detected using SuperSignal West Pico\nChemoluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA),\nand bands were visualized and recorded using GelQuant\nImage Analysis Software in a DNR LightBIS Pro Image\nAnalysis System (DNR Bio-Imaging Systems Ltd., Jerusalem,\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\n56 kDa Control\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n56 kDa\n\n56 kDa\n\n10 mg/kg\nEAT\n\n30 mg/kg\nEAT\n\nGAPDH\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nCYP1A protein CYP1A mRNA\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \npr\n\not\nei\n\nn \nco\n\nnc\nen\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(a\n.u\n\n.) \n\nControl\n10 mg/kg EA\n30 mg/kg EA\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: The expression levels of CYP1A protein and mRNA in\ncontrol rats and rats treated with EA.

Protein bands were quantified using Scion Image\nVersion Beta 4.0.2 software.\n\n2.6. RNA Isolation and qRT-PCR of CYP mRNAs. Total RNA\nwas extracted from 100mg rat livers using TRIzol reagent.\nExtracted RNA was quantified spectrophotometrically at\n260/280 nm, and the integrity was checked using 1% agarose\ngel. For cDNA synthesis, 2.5 ùúág of RNAwas incubated at 70‚àòC\nfor 10 minutes with 0.5ùúág of oligo (dT). After 5min on ice,\n50U Moloney murine leukemia virus reverses transcriptase,\n1mM dNTPs and 5X reaction buffer were added to the\nprevious mixture and incubated at 42‚àòC for 60min. The\nreaction was stopped by heating the mixture to 70‚àòC for\n10min, and the cDNA was stored at ‚àí80‚àòC for further use.\n\nqRT-PCR assay was performed by using gene specific\nprimers.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydro-\ngenase (GAPDH) and ùõΩ-actin were used as a housekeeping\ngene. The PCR amplification was done using Power SYBR\nGreen PCR master mix (Roche Applied Science, Basel,\nSwitzerland) and 500 nmol/L of forward and reverse primers\nfor each gene, for which the final primer concentration\nwas 125 nmol/L each. Quantitative PCR was done using a\nLight Cycler 1.5 Instrument (Roche Applied Science, Basel,\nSwitzerland). The PCR conditions were as follows: DNA\npolymerase activation at 95‚àòC for 15 minutes, followed by 45\ncycles at 95‚àòC for 10 seconds, 54‚Äì57‚àòC annealing (depending\non the gene) for 5 seconds, and 72‚àòC for 30 seconds. All gene\nanalyses were done at least three times.\n\n2.7. Statistical Analysis. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing the Minitab 13 statistical software package (Minitab,\nInc., State College, PA, USA). All results were expressed\nas means including their Standard Error of Means (SEMs).\nComparison between groups was performed using Student‚Äôs\nt-test, and ùëÉ < 0.05 was selected as the level required\nfor statistical significance. Statistical comparisons between\nthree groups were assessed by one-way analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). When F ratios were significant (ùëÉ < 0.05),\none-way ANOVA was followed by Tukey‚Äôs Post hoc test for\ncomparisons of multiple group means.\n\n3. Results\n\nControl and treated rats showed no significant differences in\nfood consumption or body weight, (data not shown) after\nintragastric delivery of the EA to the animals at two different\ndoses (T10 and T30).\n\nAs shown in Table 1, blood serumAST and ALT activities\nwere not changed when compared to the control rats. As\npresented in Table 2, hepatic 1A1-associated EROD and 1A2-\nassociatedMRODorC3NDactivities were decreased 11% and\n13% or 40% in T30 treated rats, respectively, when compared\nto controls.\n\nThe effect of the EA onCYP2B-associated BPND, EmND,\nBROD, and PROD activities is presented in Table 2. EA\ntreatment at T10 or T30 for 14 consecutive days caused a\nstatistically significant (ùëÉ < 0.05) 13%, 10%, 15%, and 10% or\n55%, 38%, 23%, and 30% decrease in these activities in the\nliver, respectively.\n\nCYP2E-associated A4H and NDMA activities in control\nand EA-treated rats are given in Table 2.

Similarly, EA treatment at T10 reduced 28%\nand 26% with respect to the control.\n\nThe effect of the EA on CYP2C6-associated APND,\nCYP3A-associated ERND, and CYP19-associated DBFOD\nactivity is presented in Table 2. EA treatment at T30 caused\na statistically significant 55%, 28%, and 24% decrease in\nCYP2C6, CYP3A, and CYP19 activities in the liver, respec-\ntively.\n\nGSTs activities in control and EA-treated rats are given\nin Table 2. GST activities towards three different substrates,\nnamely, CDNB, DCNB, and EA were increased 49%, 42%,\nand 33% (ùëÉ < 0.05) in the T30 treated group. Furthermore,\ntreatment of rats with T30 dose caused 194%, 64%, and 114%\nincreases in NQO1, CAT, and GPX activities, respectively,\nwhen compared to the control values (Table 2).\n\nThe activation of catalytic activities was generally consis-\ntent with the protein levels of related CYP isoforms in rat liver\nmicrosomes that were prepared from control and EA-treated\nrats (Figures 1‚Äì6). The densitometric scanning of western\nblot results showed that hepatic CYP1A and CYP3A were not\nsignificantly changed in the T10 or T30 treated rats relative to\nthe control animals (Figures 1 and 5).\n\nThe densitometric scanning of western blot results\nshowed that hepatic CYP2B protein level was decreased 51%\nand 38% as a result of two different doses of EA treatments.\nMoreover, T10 and T30 treatments caused a 53% and 32%\nreduction of the CYP2E protein level (Figures 2 and 4).\nAlthough CYP2C and CYP19 protein levels were reduced\nwith T30 treatment, it was not at a significant level (Figures 3\nand 6).\n\nThe effect of EA on themRNA levels of CYP isozymeswas\nalso determined throughout in this study.The relative CYP1A\nand CYP3A mRNA levels were not changed significantly\n\nin the EA-treated rats as compared to the control animals\n(Figures 1 and 5). CYP2E level was decreased significantly\n79% and 31% in T10 and T30 treated rats, respectively\n(Figure 4). In addition, CYP2B level was reduced 76% and\n39% as a result of two different doses of EA-treated rats\nrelative to the controls (Figure 2). CYP2C level was decreased\n49% significantly in EA-treated rats at T30, respectively\n(Figure 3). Similar to the changes at protein level, CYP19\nmRNA was decreased but not significantly (Figure 6).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAlterations in the cellular metabolism of xenobiotics are\nthe most important mechanisms that play a vital role dur-\ning chemical-induced carcinogenicity. Therefore, the use of\ndietary antioxidants is an important preventive method to\nminimize the pathological and toxic effects associated with\nxenobiotics [8, 10, 14]. In this context, this study is carried out\nto examine the dose-dependent effects of EA on specific P450\nforms and also on selected phase II and antioxidant enzymes\nin rat liver.\n\nPlasma AST and ALT, alone or in combination, are\nprimarily recommended for the assessment of hepatocellular\ninjury in rodents and nonrodents in nonclinical studies.They\nare sensitive markers for drug-induced liver damage, and\nthe elevated activities of these marker enzymes in plasma\nare indicative of cellular leakage and loss of the functional\nintegrity of cell membranes in the liver [40]. Treatment with\nEA at different doses (T10 and T30) caused no changes in the\nactivities of these marker enzymes in plasma when compared\nwith the control group. Therefore, EA, at these doses, can be\nused in preventive or complementary medicine with safety\nprecautions and within the scope of the methods employed\nin public health.\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 5\n\n56 kDa Control\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n56 kDa\n\n56 kDa\n\n10 mg/kg\nEAT\n\n30 mg/kg\nEAT\n\nGAPDH\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nCYP2B protein CYP2B mRNA\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \npr\n\not\nei\n\nn \nco\n\nnc\nen\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(a\n.u\n\n.) \n\nControl\n10 mg/kg EA\n30 mg/kg EA\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 2: The expression levels of CYP2B protein and mRNA in\ncontrol rats and rats treated with EA.

This CYP is the\nprimary P450 involved in the conversion of outstanding\ncarcinogens to the electrophilic metabolites and is known\nto be induced by its substrates such as benzopyrene. In\nthis study, CYP1A1/CYP1A2-associated enzyme activities,\nEROD, MROD, and C3ND were all decreased as a result\nof T30 treatment, consistent with the previous findings\nof [41]. Although EA treatment resulted in a significant\nreduction in CYP1A1/CYP1A2-associated enzyme activities,\nhepatic CYP1A1 protein and mRNA levels were found not\nto be changed with EA treatments.

Intake of the EA both\nat doses, T10 and T30, for 14 consecutive days decreased A4H\nand NDMA activities in the liver.

Consistent with\nprotein levels, administration of the EA had also decreased\nthe CYP2E1 mRNA level. Since the regulation of CYP2E1\nexpression is complex, involving transcriptional, posttran-\nscriptional, and posttranslational events with polymorphism\nplaying a role [45], the observed mRNA decrease resulting\nfrom EA treatment could be either transcriptional or post-\ntranscriptional, which remains to be elucidated. Hence, no\nmatter what the mechanism is, EA administration might\ndecrease the carcinogenesis by inhibiting CYP2E1 and reduce\nreactive oxygen species by affecting the metabolic pathways\nof alcohol.\n\nCytochrome 2B, 2C, and 3A enzymes participate in a\nwide array of metabolism of drugs.

Similarly, EA-treatment caused inhibitory effect\nin CYP3A-associated ERND activity in rat liver microsomes.\nAs previously shown with CYP3A or CYP2C activities [46,\n47], EA, which is an antioxidant found in large quantities\nin pomegranate juice, displayed a probably nonmechanism-\nbased inhibitory effect for CYP3A andCYP2C activities in rat\nliver microsomes. Thus, drug interactions are fairly likely to\noccur if EA supplements are taken simultaneouslywith drugs.\n\nThe aromatase enzyme, which converts androgen to\nestrogen, plays a key role particularly in breast carcinogenesis.\nCYP19-associated enzyme activities, DBFOD,were decreased\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 7\n\n58 kDa Control\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\n58 kDa\n\n58 kDa\n\n10 mg/kg\nEAT\n\n30 mg/kg\nEAT\n\nGAPDH\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nCYP19 protein CYP19 mRNA\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \npr\n\not\nei\n\nn \nco\n\nnc\nen\n\ntr\nat\n\nio\nn \n\n(a\n.u\n\n.) \n\nControl\n10 mg/kg EA\n30 mg/kg EA\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 6: The expression levels of CYP19 protein and mRNA in\ncontrol rats and rats treated with EA.

In addition, CYP19 protein and\nmRNA levels were reduced with T30 to a lesser extent than\nthe activities. Therefore, the observed inhibition resulting\nfrom EA treatment could be neither transcriptional nor\ntranslational and remains to be elucidated. Taken together\nwith the results of previous reports [20] and the results of the\ncurrent study, it may be suggested that EA intake may be a\nviable strategy for the chemoprevention of breast cancer.\n\nSome of the anticancer effects of dietary polyphenols are\nrelated, at least partly, to their indirect antioxidant activities\n[48‚Äì51]. For example, the enhancement of GPX, catalase,\nNQO1, GSTs, and/or phase II enzyme activities by polyphe-\nnols could help the detoxification of carcinogenic agents.\nHence, the induction of these enzyme activities by flavonoids\nis possibly associated with cancer chemopreventive effects.\nIn this study, EA treatment caused an increase in GSTs,\n\nNQO1, GPX, and CAT activities in rat liver microsomes.\nSimilarly, the induction of liver GSTs, NQO1, and CAT\nenzyme activities by flavonoids such as genistein, daidzein,\nflavone, rutin, quercitrin, myricetin, and kaempferol was\nreported in recent studies [52‚Äì56]. These observations may\nbe of importance in view of the potential use of EA both as\npotent anticancer agents as well as chemopreventive agents.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this study, the different doses of EA did not produce the\nsame effects. While the lower dose of EA (10mg/kg/day) was\nnot effective because its concentration might not have been\nenough to reach to the site of action and quench all free\nradicals generated, the higher dose of EA (30mg/kg/day)\nwas good enough to be effective. In conclusion, the dose-\ndependent suppression of CYP1A, CYP2E, and CYP19 and\nthe induction of GSTs, NQO1, GPX, and CAT enzymes\nsuggest anticancer as well as chemopreventive roles for EA\nwhile reductions in CYP2B, 2C, and 3A explain potential\ndrug interactions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by the Scientific and Technological\nResearch Council of Turkey [109R012] and Pamukkale Uni-\nversity [2010FBE081].
