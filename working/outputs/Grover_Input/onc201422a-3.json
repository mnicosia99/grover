However, the\ncontribution of NCL to tumor development is still not clear. Herein, we found that NCL expression correlated with poor prognosis in\nlung cancer patients. Overexpressed NCL was predominantly cleaved to C-terminal truncated NCL (TNCL). In lung cancer formation,\nactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway induced NCL expression, and also the expression of matrix\nmetalloproteinase (MMP) 7, which then cleaved NCL at Asp255 to generate TNCL of 55 kDa. TNCL increased the expression of\nseveral oncogenes, including MMP9, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), HIF1a and CBLB, and decreased the expression of tumor\nsuppressors including BRD4, PCM1, TFG and KLF6 by modulating mRNA stability through binding to the 3’-untranslated regions of\ntheir transcripts, thus ultimately enhancing metastasis activity. In conclusion, this study identified a novel role of the cleavage form\nof NCL generated by MMP7 in stabilizing MMP9 mRNA. We also provide a new insight that MMP7 not only cleaves the extracellular\nmatrix to promote tumor invasion but also cleaves NCL, which augment oncogenesis. Blocking NCL cleavage may provide a useful\nnew strategy for lung cancer therapy.\n\nOncogene (2015) 34, 826–837; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.22; published online 17 March 2014\n\nINTRODUCTION\nNucleolin (NCL) is a well-known RNA-binding protein that\nparticipates in DNA transcription, ribosomal biogenesis, mRNA\ntranslation and mRNA stability. The N-terminal domain of NCL\nregulates transcription and the maturation of ribosomal RNA;1 the\ncentral region containing 4 RNA-binding domains associates with\nmRNA or pre-ribosomal RNA to regulate their stability;2,3 the\nC-terminus interacts with ribosomal proteins to regulate RNA\ntranslation.4,5 In addition, the NCL level is increased in highly\nproliferating cells, but the mechanism controlling NCL abundance\nis still not clear.\nProtein cleavage affects the properties of cancer cells. Cleavage\n\nform of laminin-332 by matriptase enhances the motility of\nprostate cancer cells.6 Cleavage form of β1 integrin mediated by\nmatrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 promotes colon cancer cell\nmotility.7 In lymphoma, nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase cleaves\nthe API2–MALT1 fusion oncoprotein to activate the noncanonical\nnuclear factor-κB pathway, which promotes apoptosis resistance.8\n\nCleavage of NCL by granzyme A was first demonstrated and\nsuggested that this phenomenon is important for apoptosis.9\n\nFurthermore, in apoptotic cells, an increase in cleaved NCL\n(80 kDa) is accompanied by a decrease in full-length NCL\n(110 kDa).10,11 Moreover, self-cleaving activity-mediated produc-\ntion of 100-, 70-, 60- and 50-kDa forms of NCL was identified in\nproliferating cells.12 However, the cleavage site of NCL and the\nfunctions of cleaved NCL have not been studied.\nMMP7 (matrilysin), the smallest MMP that lacks a C-terminal\n\nhemopexin domain, is overexpressed in various types of cancer,\nincluding gastric, pancreatic and colon cancer.13–15 In addition to\n\ncleave the extracellular matrix (ECM), MMP7 also cleaves other\nproteins to affect the properties of cancer. MMP7-mediated\ncleavage of Fas ligand protects tumor cells from chemotherapy-\ninduced cytotoxicity.16 Cleavage of C-type lectin domain family-3\nmember A and E-cadherin by MMP7 enhances tumor invasion by\ninducing cell dissociation from ECM.17,18 These results described\nabove indicate that MMP7 cleaves membrane proteins and\nsecretory proteins. However, it is still unknown that whether\nMMP7 has intracellular proteolytic activity.\nIn this study, we show that the protease activity of MMP7\n\nenhances tumorigenesis through the cleavage of NCL. Increased\nNCL expression significantly correlated with poor prognosis in\nlung cancer patients. In human and mouse lung cancer, NCL was\nmainly expressed as a 55-kDa protein, generated by MMP7\ncleavage at Asp255. Cleaved NCL aggressively promoted pro-\nliferation and metastasis. Furthermore, cleaved NCL increased the\nexpression of cancer-related genes, such as MMP9 and ALK, by\nassociating with mRNA 30-untranslated regions (UTRs) to enhance\nmRNA stability. These findings highlight the importance of MMP7-\nmediated NCL cleavage in lung cancer development.\n\nRESULTS\nAccumulation of NCL, processed to a C-terminal truncated form,\ncorrelates with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients\nPast studies of NCL mainly focused on its regulation of ribosomal\nbiogenesis and mRNA stability.19 The functional role of NCL in\ntumor growth and metastasis remains poorly understood,\nespecially in lung cancer. To address this issue, we first studied\n\n1Institute of Bioinformatics and Biosignal Transduction, College of Bioscience and Biotechnology, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 2Center for Infection Disease\nand Signal Transduction, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 3Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 4Department of\nPharmacology, College of Medicine, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan; 5Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University,\nTaipei, Taiwan; 6Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine and Hospital, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan and 7Department of Environmental and\nOccupational Health, National Cheng-Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan.

Of the 97 tumor\nspecimens from patients, 62, 20 and 15 showed strong, moderate\nand negative NCL expression, respectively. In addition, of 65\nnormal lung tissues, 31 and 34 showed moderate and negative\nexpression, respectively, but none showed high NCL expression\n(Figure 1A(b)). When the relationship between the NCL level and\nsurvival rate was compared, we found that higher NCL expression\ncorrelated with poor prognosis for lung cancer progression\n(Figure 1A and Table 1). Furthermore, NCL level was examined\n\nin seven other clinical lung cancer samples by immunoblot\nanalysis (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S1A). Interestingly,\nnot only was NCL markedly upregulated, it was also processed\ninto a 55-kDa truncated protein. To further address this finding,\ntwo transgenic mouse models including K-rasG12D- and EGFRL858R-\ninduced lung cancers were established, and used to study the NCL\nexpression and post-translational processing. In these mice, NCL\nwas upregulated and was majorly present as a 55-kDa truncated\nprotein (Figures 1C and D, and Supplementary Figure S1C).\nFurthermore, the signal of 55-kDa protein was attenuated by NCL\n\nFigure 1.

Treatment\nof A431 and H1299 cells with EGF significantly increased the\ntranscriptional activity, mRNA and protein levels of NCL in a dose-\ndependent manner (Figures 2a and c and Supplementary Figures\nS2A and B). In contrast, an EGFR inhibitor, gefitinib and a K-ras\ninhibitor, FTI-276, significantly decreased the transcriptional activity,\nthe mRNA and protein expression of NCL (Supplementary\nFigures S2C and H). Interestingly, inhibition of extracellular signal-\nregulated kinases 1 and 2 by U0126 also prevented EGF-mediated\nNCL upregulation, suggesting that NCL was induced via the EGFR\npathway through extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and\n2 activation (Figure 2d). The NCL promoter contains specificity\nprotein-1 (Sp1) binding elements, and our previous studies\nindicated that mitogenic signals, including EGFR and K-ras\nactivation, contributes to Sp1 accumulation.20,21 Therefore, we\nspeculated that Sp1 contributesto NCL upregulation in lung cancer\nformation. The expression of NCL significantly increased with\nincreasing doses of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Sp1, and Sp1\nknockdown decreased NCL expression (Figure 2e and\nSupplementary Figures S3A and C). Furthermore, EGF-induced\nupregulations of NCL promoter activity and protein were abolished\nby Sp1 knockdown (Figure 2f and Supplementary Figure S3D). The\nSp1 binding sites predicted by TFSEARCH website were mutated\nindividually to identify the region required for EGF-mediated NCL\ninduction (Figure 2g). Loss of Sp1 binding sites localized at the –200\nregion of the NCL promoter abolished the NCL upregulation by EGF\ntreatment. Moreover, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was\nperformed to study the recruitment of Sp1 to the promoter of NCL\n(Figure 2h). The results showed that Sp1 was recruited to the NCL\npromoter (–273/–84). Therefore, we propose a model in which EGF\ninduces NCL expression through the activation of the extracellular\nsignal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 pathway and subsequent\nSp1-mediated transcription (Figure 2i).\n\nMMP7 cleaves NCL at Asp255 during lung cancer formation\nWe next investigated the processing of full-length NCL into a\n55-kDa truncated protein. The level of cleaved NCL was clearly\nhigher in lung cancer cell lines, H1299 and A549, than that in\nnormal lung epithelial cells, Beas-2B (Figure 3a). To determine\nwhether NCL was cleaved at the C-terminus or N-terminus,\nGFP-NCL-myc was overexpressed in cells. The anti-myc antibody\n\nrecognized the truncated form at 55 kDa, but the GFP antibody\ndid not, indicating that full-length NCL was cleaved at the\nN-terminus (Supplementary Figures S4A and C). To confirm this\nresult, an antibody that recognizes N-terminus of NCL was\nproduced to study NCL was generated. Full-length NCL was\ndetected in cell lines, but little signal was found in clinical lung\ncancer samples, indicating that nearly all of the NCL was cleaved\nin vivo (Supplementary Figure S1E). In addition, the antibody\nthat recognizes N-terminal NCL did not recognize the 55-kDa form\nof NCL, indicating that the C-terminus of NCL was present in lung\ncancer cells (Supplementary Figures S1D and E). To identify the\ncutting site(s), several plasmids expressing N-terminally truncated\nforms of NCL were constructed (Supplementary Figure S4A).\nData indicated that the cutting N-terminal part from GFP-TNCL\n(251–710 aa) was nearly the same as GFP-only, implying that\nthe cutting site may locate between aa 251 and aa 260\n(Supplementary Figure S4B). Several GFP-NCL-myc constructs with\nthe individual mutation between aa 249 and aa 260 were\nprepared to probe the exact cutting site. As shown in Figure 3b,\nthe mutation of Asp255 to Ala (Asp255Ala) blocked the cleavage,\nsuggesting that Asp255 is the major site for NCL cleavage.\nSubsequently, we investigated the proteinase(s) that cleaved\n\nNCL. We evaluated the effect of the aspartate protease family on\nNCL cleavage. Treatment with the aspartate protease inhibitor\npepstatin or knockdown of the aspartate protease, TASP1 and\nADAMTS1, did not alter NCL cleavage (Supplementary Figures S5A\nand C). However, marimastat, an MMP inhibitor, attenuated NCL\ncleavage in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3c), suggesting that\nthe MMP family has a functional role in NCL cleavage. Knockdown\nof MMP2, 9, or 13 did not affect cleavage of NCL (Supplementary\nFigures S5D and E). In contrast, MMP7 knockdown mark-\nedly decreased endogenously cleaved NCL and increased full-\nlength NCL (Figure 3d). Furthermore, MMP7 overexpression\nincreased NCL cleavage (Figure 3e). To further confirm the effect\nof MMP7 on NCL cleavage, MMP7 was knocked down in cells\nexpressing GFP-NCL-myc. As shown in Figure 3f, cleaved NCL-myc\ndisappeared with MMP7 knockdown, suggesting that MMP7 is\nrequired for NCL cleavage. On the other hand, MMP7 over-\nexpression increased the level of cleaved NCL-myc (Figure 3g).\nMoreover, MMP7 efficiently enhanced the production of cleaved\nNCL-myc in cells expressing GFP-NCL-myc, but not in cells\nexpressing GFP-NCLD255A-myc (Figure 3g). To confirm that MMP7\ncleaved NCL directly, we synthesized a peptide corresponding to\naa 252-aa 262 of NCL (DDEDDDDEDDE), incubated the peptide\nwith MMP7 recombinant protein and assessed cleavage by\nmass spectrometry analysis. The amount of uncleaved peptide\n(1339-Da) decreased, and the amount of cleaved peptide (861-Da)\nincreased with increasing concentration of the MMP7 protein\n(Figure 3h). The cleaved 861-Da peptide was identified as aa\n255-aa 262 (DDDDEDDE). In the absence of NCL peptide, we did\nnot detect a signal in the presence of MMP7 (Supplementary\nFigure S4D), indicating that the results of mass spectrometry\nanalysis reflect the cleaved NCL peptide. After confirming the\nspecificity of the anti-MMP7 antibody by knocking down\nendogenous MMP7, which abolished the signal of MMP7\n(Supplementary Figures S6A and S6B), we investigated the\ndistributions of NCL and MMP7 in lung cancer cells in vivo and\nin vitro. NCL and MMP7 expression levels were localized in nucleus\nof lung tumor cells in human lung tumors and K-rasG12D lung\ncancer mice (Figures 4a and b), Moreover, NCL majorly interacted\nwith MMP7 in nucleus, and slight interaction signal was found in\ncytoplasm (Figure 4c; Supplementary Figures S6D and S6E). In\naddition, most of overexpressed GFP-NCL stayed in nucleolus and\ncolocalized with MMP7, implying that the cleavage of NCL by\nMMP7 majorly occurred inside nucleolus (Supplementary Figure\nS6C). As previous studies indicate that MMP7 is major stayed\noutside the cell, not in the nucleus including nucleolus, distribution\nof MMP7 in cells was studied. Data indicated the MMP7 not only\n\nTable 1.

To exclude the possibility that MMP-related proteases\nin specimens of mice cause NCL cleavage during the experimental\nprocedure, we prepared the lysis buffer containing different doses\nof marimastat. In Supplementary Figure S6F, we found that\nmarimastat did not affect NCL cleavage. On the basis of the\nprevious studies demonstrating that NCL distributes on plasma\n\nmembrane, we also detected NCL on plasma membrane without\npermeabilizing cell membrane (Supplementary Figure S7A). More-\nover, we found that both of NCL and MMP7 distributed in the\nfraction of plasma membrane (Supplementary Figure S7B),\nsuggesting that MMP7 may cleave membrane NCL. We also used\ntwo antibodies targeting different epitopes of NCL to detect NCL\ncleavage in cell lines and human specimens. In Supplementary\n\nFigure 2.

On the basis of our findings, MMP7\nassociates with NCL and cleaved NCL to generate TNCL\ncomprising C-terminal aa 255–aa 710. This process occurs majorly\nin nucleus, but may also slightly occur in cytoplasm.\n\nTNCL increases lung tumor cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro\nand in vivo by increasing MMP9 protein levels\nWe next studied the function of TNCL in lung tumorigenesis.\nKnockdown of NCL in A549 and H1299 cells inhibited cell\nproliferation (Figure 5A(a,b)), and increased cleaved poly ADP\n\nribose polymerase (PARP) and active caspase 3 signals (Figure 5A\n(c)), implying that NCL is involved in cell proliferation and\napoptosis. As shown in Figures 5B and C, compared with GFP-\nexpressing cells, NCL-expressing cells enhanced cell proliferation\nand tumor growth in a xenograft model. In these experiments, the\noncogenic effect of TNCL was significantly higher than that of NCL\nin vitro and in vivo. Moreover, TNCL was more effective in\nenhancing the cellular migration, invasion and lung metastasis of\ncells delivered by tail vein injection (Figures 5D and F). In\nconclusion, NCL, cleaved by MMP7 during tumorigenesis, is an\nimportant process for the cancer cell progression. Cleaved NCL is\nincreased in lung tumors and involved in tumor malignancy.\n\nFigure 3. Effect of MMP7 on cleavage of NCL.

As\nshown in Figure 6A, TNCL increased the level and enzymatic\nactivity of MMP9 in a dose-dependent manner. A major function\nof NCL is to maintain mRNA stability. Thus, we analyzed the effect\nof TNCL on MMP9 mRNA stability by quantitative-PCR (Figure 6B).\nActinomycin D treatment markedly decreased MMP9 mRNA\nwithin 12 h. TNCL delayed MMP9 mRNA degradation to a greater\nextent than NCL. Moreover, the luciferase activity of an SV-40\npromoter containing the 30-UTR of MMP9 mRNA was significantly\nincreased by TNCL, but not by NCL (Supplementary Figure S9B).\nFurthermore, TNCL associated with the MMP9 30-UTR (Figure 6C\nand Supplementary Figure S9A). These results indicate that TNCL\n\nincreases MMP9 expression by associating with the MMP9 30-UTR\nto enhance its mRNA stability.\nMMP7 knockdown reduced the MMP9 protein level (Figure 3d),\n\nimplying that MMP7-mediated cleavage of NCL is important for\nMMP9 upregulation. To address this issue, MMP7 was knocked\ndown in GFP- or GFP-TNCL-expressing cells (Figure 6D). GFP-TNCL\nexpression prevented MMP9 downregulation induced by MMP7\nknockdown, suggesting that MMP7 increases MMP9 through\nNCL cleavage. In addition, with the increase in cleaved NCL in lung\ntumor development, MMP7 was markedly upregulated, suggest-\ning that MMP7 mediates NCL cleavage in lung tumors (Figure 6E).\nTo further study the role of the MMP7-TNCL-MMP9 axis in lung\n\nFigure 4.

With the formation of\nK-rasG12D-driven lung tumors, NCL, MMP7 and MMP9 were\nincreased (Figure 6F(a)). The 32 samples from lung cancer patients\nwere analyzed for studying the correlation among NCL, MMP7 and\nMMP9 levels. Of 17 patients with high NCL expression, only 1\npatient exhibited low levels of MMP7 and MMP9. Of 15 patients\nwith negative NCL expression, 11 patients exhibited low MMP7\nand MMP9 levels, implying a high correlation among NCL, MMP7\nand MMP9 levels (Figure 6F(b) and Table 2). These results suggest\nthat MMP7-mediated cleavage of NCL at Asp255 results in\nMMP9 mRNA stabilization, leading to lung cancer progression\n(Figure 6G).\n\nSeveral cancer-related genes are regulated by TNCL\nWe further investigated the effects of TNCL on other oncogenes\nand tumor suppressor genes in lung tumors. In complementary\nDNA microarray analysis, 285 and 251 genes were significantly\nupregulated and downregulated, respectively, by TNCL, compared\nwith NCL (Supplementary Figure S10). Gene set enrichment\nanalysis revealed that several oncogenes were upregulated,\nincluding ALK, CD74, CRTC1, MMP9, HIPK3 and YWHAZ, and\nfour tumor-suppressor genes, namely BRD4, PCM1, TFG and KLF6,\nwere reduced (Figure 7A and Supplementary Table S1). We\nconfirmed these results with quantitative-PCR (Figure 7B). As the\nN-terminus of NCL is important for ribosomal biogenesis, we\nanalyzed the effect of TNCL on expression of ribosome-related\nproteins (Supplementary Figure S11). In contrast to NCL, TNCL\n\nFigure 6. Regulation of MMP9 expression by MMP7-mediated NCL cleavage.

The downregulation of these two proteins\nwas previously shown to be advantageous for tumor\ndevelopment.22,23 To investigate how TNCL increases genes\nexpression, we found that TNCL associated with oncogenic\nmRNAs and stabilized the mRNA levels under treatment\nwith actinomycin D (Figures 7B and C). Furthermore, TNCL-\nexpressing cells prevented MMP7 knockdown-induced decrease\nin the mRNA levels of ALK, CRTC1 and HIPK3 (Figure 7D),\nsuggesting that the upregulation of gene expression observed in\nthe microarray analysis is caused by MMP7-mediated NCL\ncleavage. ALK or CRTC1 knockdown prevented TNCL-enhanced\nproliferation (Figure 7E), and MMP9 or ALK knockdown\nprevented TNCL-enhanced invasion (Figure 7F). Our findings\nsuggest that MMP7-mediated cleavage of NCL is indispensable\nfor tumor development. By inducing the expression of many\ncancer-related genes, TNCL has a strong oncogenic effect on\nlung cancer.\nOn the basis of these findings, we clarify that NCL is a new\n\nsubstrate of MMP7 in addition to ECM (Figure 8). NCL, upregulated\nin lung cancer by EGFR activation-induced Sp1-mediated tran-\nscription, is cleaved by MMP7 at Asp255, generating cleaved NCL\n(aa 255–710). The cleaved NCL promotes tumor malignancy\nthrough enhancing the stability of several oncogenic mRNA and\nattenuates that of tumor-suppressive mRNA.\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we found that EGFR pathway activation induced NCL\nexpression. We also found that NCL was cleaved endogenously.\nFurthermore, specific cleavage of NCL at Asp255 by MMP7 was\nidentified, and the cleaved form promoted lung cancer progres-\nsion by increasing in the expression of oncogenes, such as MMP9\nand ALK, and decreasing the expression of tumor-suppressor\ngenes such as KLF6.\nHow NCL is induced during tumorigenesis is still unknown.\n\nHerein, we found that EGFR pathway activation was important\nfor NCL accumulation during lung tumorigenesis. Furthermore,\nour previous studies indicated that Sp1 could be induced by\nEGF treatment in mouse lung primary cells,20 and promoter\nanalysis identified several GC-rich elements on NCL promoter that\nmay function in Sp1 recruitment. Experiments performed in this\nstudy showed that NCL expression was induced by Sp1 through\nEGFR pathway activation in lung cancer cells. Assessing NCL levels\nin human specimens and animal samples by immunoblotting, we\nfound that a truncated form of NCL, rather than a full-length NCL\nwas majorly expressed. In addition, when we examined lung\ncancer cell lines with different metastasis activities, we found\ngreater amounts of TNCL in the more malignant cell line, implying\nthat TNCL may be related to tumor malignancy. In previous\nstudies of NCL cleavage, various TNCL proteins of different sizes\n\nwere found.9,11,12,24 In lung cancer cell lines, two TNCL proteins of\n72- and 55 kDa were found. When GFP-NCL-myc was over-\nexpressed in H1299 cell, anti-myc antibody recognized the two\nTNCLs, indicating that they contain the C-terminus of TNCLs. In\naddition, when we knocked down MMP7, these two truncated\nTNCLs disappeared, implying that MMP7 is necessary for their\nformation. However, mutation of Asp255 not only blocked\ncleavage at Asp255 (generating the 55-kDa form), but also\nrepressed the other cleavage, implying that Asp255 is essential\nfor the cleavage, that generates the 72-kDa form.\nMMP7, the smallest one of MMPs, degrades type IV collagen\n\nand laminin for tumor invasion.25,26 In this study, we found\nthat MMP7 increased MMP9 mRNA stability through NCL cleavage\nin lung cancer. The effect of MMP7 on MMP9 expression\nwas abolished by mutation of Asp255 in NCL, which prevented\nthe cleavage of NCL, indicating that MMP7-mediated cleavage of\nNCL is important for MMP9 expression in lung cancer. In addition\nto the ECM, MMP7 also cleaves several membrane proteins,\nincluding Fas ligand, β4-integrin, E- and N-cadherins.18,27–29 These\nstudies suggest that the specificity of MMP7 is not limited to the\nECM, and that MMP7-mediated cleavage occurs inside the cell.\nMoreover, NCL expression positively correlated with MMP7\nexpression in human and mouse lung cancer, implying that\noverexpressed NCL is cleaved by MMP7 during tumor develop-\nment. In human and mouse specimens, the distribution of\nMMP7 is similar with NCL in the cellular nucleus (Figures 4a\nand b). In H1299 cells, we found that MMP7 colocalized and\ninteracted with NCL majorly in the nucleus, including nucleo-\nplasm and nucleolus, slightly in cytosol (Figure 4c and\nSupplementary Figure S6E). These results indicate that MMP7\nmeets NCL both in cytoplasm and nuclear compartments for\ncleavage. In studying whether MMP7 cleaves NCL on the plasma\nmembrane,30 data shown in Supplementary Figure S7 revealed\nthat both of NCL and MMP7 distributed in the fraction of plasma\nmembrane, implying that MMP7 may cleave membrane NCL.\nBut this issue still needs further study in the future. In Figure 4c,\nthe membrane NCL is not clearly stained because the cell\nmembrane was permeabilized by methanol for staining\nnucleolar NCL. However, in Supplementary Figure S7A,\nmembrane NCL was stained without permeabilization and clearly\nphotographed by confocal immunofluorescent microscope. In\naddition, the inhibitory effect of marimastat on NCL cleavage was\nmore pronounced than that of MMP7 knockdown, suggesting that\nother MMP members also participate in NCL cleavage. However, in\nthis study, most NCL was cleaved to a 55-kDa truncated form in\nfreshly prepared tissue extracts, but NCL was only partially cleaved\nin the cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1C). This is possibly\ncaused by higher MMP7 expression and activity in an individual\nthan in cell lines. In preparing cell lysate and tissue lysate with the\nsame homogenized process, we found that cleaved NCL in cell\nlines was not obvious compared with that in tissue lysate\n(Supplementary Figure S1C). In addition, marimastat in lysis\nbuffer did not affect NCL cleavage in tissue lysates\n(Supplementary Figure S6F), suggesting that abundant NCL\ncleavage in human and mouse lung cancer reported here was\nnot caused by the experimental procedure. We also detected NCL\nin cell lines and human specimens by using two antibodies\nrecognizing different NCL epitopes. Supplementary Figure S8\nrevealed that two antibodies exhibited the same results of\ndetecting NCL, suggesting that weak expression of full-length\nNCL in human specimens is not caused by the antibody. In\nSupplementary Figure S8A, different cancer cell lines exhibited\ndifferent extent of NCL cleavage. This may be caused by different\nlevels of MMPs. Taken together, our results indicate that MMP7\nhas a pivotal role in cancer metastasis. Previously, MMP7 was\nreported to activate MMP9 by cleavage in vitro.31 Here, we found\nanother mechanism for the activation of MMP9 by MMP7.\nMMP7 cleaved NCL, which in turn bound to the 30-UTR of\n\nTable 2.

TNCL also modulated the expression of many\nother cancer-related genes to promote lung cancer formation.\nCompared with full-length NCL, TNCL had stronger proliferation-\nand metastasis-inducing effects, through the upregulation of\nseveral cancer-related genes (Figure 7 and Supplementary\nTable S1). In particular, TNCL associated with 30-UTRs to delay\nthe turnover of MMP9, ALK, CD74 and CRTC1 mRNAs (Figures 6B\nand 7C). Compared with the frequency of EGFR and KRAS\nmutations, ALK activation, resulting from gene rearrangement,\noccurs in a smaller proportion of lung cancer patients.33 The\nactivation of ALK, a receptor tyrosine kinase, activates Stat3,\nphosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt and Ras/extracellular signal-\nregulated kinases 1 and 2 signalings for cell proliferation and\nsurvival.34–36 Expression of CD74, a membrane receptor for\nmacrophage migration inhibitory factor, in lung cancer correlates\nwith angiogenesis, and it cooperates with migration inhibitory\nfactor to promote tumor vascularity.37,38 Moreover, nuclear\nlocalization of CRTC1 promotes lung cancer progression.39,40\n\nOther cancer-promoting genes, including HIPK3, CAMK and\nYWHAZ, are also significantly upregulated by TNCL.41–43 On the\nbasis of the evidence presented above, through enhancing the\nmRNA stability of several oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes,\nTNCL is sufficient to promote tumor malignancy. Previous studies\nhave indicated that the N-terminus of NCL participates in\nribosomal RNA transcription by interacting with some pre-\nribosomal RNA processing complexes.1 Overexpression of TNCL,\nwhich lacks of N-terminus, downregulates some ribosomal\nproteins, including RPS25 and RPL41, and the inhibitory effect\non these two proteins are also benefit to tumorigenesis.22,23\n\nThese results suggest that the N-terminus of NCL may promote\ntumor-suppressive ribosomal proteins expression to counteract\nthe oncogenic effect of TNCL containing the RNA-binding\ndomains and the C-terminus. Such speculation requires\nsubstantiation in future studies. In conclusion, here we identified\na new function of MMP7: MMP7 cleaves NCL, generating a\ntruncated protein that contributes to lung cancer formation by\npromoting oncogenes expression of several oncogenes and\ntumor-suppressor genes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCollection of specimens from lung cancer patients\nThe study using human specimens was approved by the Clinical Research\nEthics Committee at National Cheng-Kung University Medical Center\n(Tainan, Taiwan). After surgical resection at National Cheng-Kung\nUniversity Hospital, specimens of patients with lung adenocarcinomas\nwere collected for immunohistochemical analysis or western blotting. The\npathological data were analyzed by clinical pathologists.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nThe experimental process of immunohistochemistry was performed as\ndescribed in our previous study.20 Briefly, blocked histological sections\nwere stained with the anti-c23, anti-MMP7 (AnaSpec, Fremont, CA, USA) or\nanti-MMP9 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Boston, MA, USA).\nThe immunoreactivity was detected by a Vectastain ABC kit (Vector\nLaboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA).\n\nSite-directed mutagenesis\nThe GFP-NCL-myc plasmid was used as the template for mutagenesis.\nPrimers were listed in Supplementary Table S2. Mutagenesis PCR\nwas performed using plaque-forming unit DNA polymerase (Agilent\nTechnologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).\n\nXenograft model\nThe experimental animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care\nand Use Committee at National Cheng-Kung University. After transfection\nof H1299 cells with GFP, GFP-NCL or GFP-TNCL for 24 h, cells were\nimplanted into the back of athymic nude mice (five mice per group) on day\n0. On day 10, tumor size was measured by calipers every 2 days until day\n32 according to our previous study.44\n\nIn vivo metastatic assay\nGFP-, GFP-NCL- or GFP-TNCL-expressed CL1-5 cells (1 × 106) were injected\ninto the left tail vein of severe combined immunodeficient mouse (six mice\nper group). After 30 days, lungs were excised and tumor nodules on lung\nsurface were counted.\n\nMMP7 cleavage assay by mass spectrometry\nThe peptide consisting of aa 252–aa 262 of NCL (DDEDDDDEDDE) was\nsynthesized by Genomics Bio Sci and Tech, Ltd. (New Taipei City, Taiwan). One\nmicrogram of the peptide was incubated with 20 or 200 ng of recombinant\nhuman protein MMP7 (PROSPEC, East Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 1 h at 37 °C in\nthe reaction buffer containing 25mM Tris (pH 9.0), 2.5 μM ZnCl2 and 0.005%\nBrij-35. Subsequently, the mixture was diluted in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and\nco-spotted onto the stainless steel plate (Bruker Daltonik Gmbh, Karlsruhe,\nGermany) with matrix solution (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The samples were\nanalyzed by Autoflex III MALDI-TOF (Bruker Daltonik Gmbh).\n\nWestern blotting\nAfter electrophoresis and the transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride\nmembrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA), proteins were probed by the\nanti-c23 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-Sp1\n(Millipore), anti-myc (Millipore), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.),\nanti-N-terminal NCL (Kelowna, Taipei, Taiwan), anti-MMP7 (AnaSpec), anti-\nMMP9 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-tubulin (Sigma) or anti-β-actin\n(Sigma) antibody at 4 °C overnight. After the incubation with the secondary\nantibody (Millipore), goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulin G\nlinked with horseradish peroxidase, immune complex was detected using\nchemiluminescence Alpha Innotech detection system (Alpha Innotech\nCorp., San Leandro, CA, USA). The alphaImager software (Alpha Innotech\nCorp.) was used to quantify the intensity of bands on western blotting.\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe difference between two groups was analyzed by Student’s\nt-test. Kaplan–Meier method was used to evaluate the survival curve,\nand the comparison of two survival curves was analyzed by log-rank test.\nThe comparison of tumor volume in severe combined immunodefi-\ncient mice was performed by two-way analysis of variance. The P-value,\nwhich is o0.05, was considered as statistically significant.\n\nFigure 8. The proposed model to explain the role of NCL in lung\ntumor malignanct.
