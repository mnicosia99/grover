ARTICLE\n\nSTIM1, a direct target of microRNA-185, promotes tumor\nmetastasis and is associated with poor prognosis in\ncolorectal cancer\nZ Zhang1, X Liu1, B Feng1, N Liu1, Q Wu, Y Han, Y Nie, K Wu, Y Shi and D Fan\n\nSTIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1), an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor that triggers the store-operated Ca2+ entry activation,\nhas recently been implicated in cancer progression. However, the role of STIM1 in the progression and metastasis of colorectal\ncancer (CRC) has not been addressed. In this study, we confirmed increased expression of STIM1 in highly invasive CRC cell lines.\nEnhanced expression of STIM1 promoted CRC cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas silencing of STIM1 with small interfering\nRNA resulted in reduced metastasis. Ectopic expression of STIM1 in CRC cells induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),\nwhereas silencing of STIM1 had the opposite effect. Furthermore, STIM1 expression was markedly higher in CRC tissues than in\nadjacent noncancerous tissues. STIM1 overexpression correlated with poor differentiation and higher tumor node metastasis stage.\nCRC patients with positive STIM1 expression had poorer prognoses than those with negative STIM1 expression. Moreover, STIM1\nwas found to be a direct target of miR-185, a microRNA (miRNA) that has not previously been reported to be involved in EMT, in\nboth CRC tissues and cell lines. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that STIM1 promotes metastasis and is\nassociated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in patients with CRC. In addition, we show that expression of STIM1 is\nregulated by a posttranscriptional regulatory mechanism mediated by a new EMT-related miRNA. This novel miR-185–STIM1 axis\npromotes CRC metastasis and may be a candidate biomarker for prognosis and a target for new therapies.\n\nOncogene (2015) 34, 4808–4820; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.404; published online 22 December 2014\n\nINTRODUCTION\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent carcinomas\nthroughout the world, with an estimated one million new cases\nand half a million mortalities each year.1,2 Metastasis, one of the\nsix initial cancer hallmarks,3 is a major cause of CRC-associated\nmortality.4 More than one-third of patients with CRC will ultimately\ndevelop metastatic disease;5 however, little is known about the\nexact molecular mechanisms underlying CRC metastasis.6 Under-\nstanding the key factors in these processes is crucial to the\ndevelopment of novel anticancer therapies.\nIn most types of cell, the ubiquitous second messenger Ca2+ is a\n\ncritical regulator that mediates various cellular processes.7 In non-\nexcitable cells, the store-operated calcium influx (SOCE) is the\nmajor mechanism of Ca2+ entry.8,9 Recent studies have identified\ntwo important molecules responsible for SOCE activation: STIM1\n(stromal interaction molecule 1) and Orai1.8 When Ca2+ in the\nendoplasmic reticulum is depleted, STIM1 serves as a Ca2+ sensor\nand aggregates into multiple punctae that translocate within close\nproximity of the plasma membranes.10 Orai1, an essential pore-\nforming component of the SOCE channel, translocates to these\nSTIM1-containing structures during store depletion and open\nstomediate Ca2+ entry.11–13 Recently, STIM1 has been reported to\nhave an important role in various pathophysiological conditions,\nsuch as the immune response,11,14 cardiovascular disease,15,16\n\nsexual dysfunction17 and pulmonary disease.18 STIM1 was also\nfound to be involved in cancer and was initially thought to work\nas a tumor suppressor,19 although subsequent data indicate an\n\nopposite function.20 More recently, Orai1 and STIM1 were shown\nto be essential for the migration of breast tumor cells.21 Another\nstudy found that STIM1 has an important role in the growth,\nmigration and angiogenesis of cervical cancer.22 These studies\nsuggest that STIM1 might have a critical role in cancer.\nEpithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a morphogenetic\n\nprocess in which cells lose their epithelial characteristics such as\ncell polarity and cell–cell contact, and gain mesenchymal proper-\nties such as increased motility. EMT also endows cells with invasive\nproperties, induces stem cell properties and prevents apoptosis\nand senescence. Morphologic evidence of EMT has been found at\nthe invasive front of human tumors.23 EMT is viewed as an\nessential early step and a critical process during tumor\nmetastasis.24–27 Notably, several recent studies suggest that EMT\ninitiated by Oct4 or Snail1 in breast cancer may be associated with\nSTIM1-directed Ca2 influx.21,23,28–30 These studies strongly suggest\nthat STIM1 may promote cancer metastasis by regulating EMT.\nMicroRNAs (MiRNAs) are noncoding small RNAs that posttran-\n\nscriptionally regulate protein expression.31 Several studies have\nshown that miRNAs have an important role in cancer metastasis.32\n\nRecently, some studies have highlighted the importance of\nmiRNAs in the regulation of EMT.33,34 As both miRNAs and STIM1\nmay have important roles in EMT process, we are interested in\nwhether STIM1 expression is regulated by certain miRNAs in\ncancer. Notably, a recent study has found that miR-195 directly\nregulates STIM1 mRNA decay in normal rat intestinal crypt cells.35\n\nHowever,whether posttranscriptional regulation by certain\n\nState Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, The Fourth Military Medical University, Xi’an, Shaanxi, People's Republic of China.\nCorrespondence: Professor Y Shi or Professor D Fan, State Key Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Xijing Hospital of Digestive Diseases, The Fourth Military Medical University, 127\nChang Le West Road, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710032, People's Republic of China.\nE-mail: shiyquan@fmmu.edu.cn or daimingfan@fmmu.edu.cn\n1These authors contributed equally to this work.\nReceived 15 November 2013; revised 21 October 2014; accepted 4 November 2014; published online 22 December 2014\n\nOncogene (2015) 34, 4808–4820\n© 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0950-9232/15\n\nwww.nature.com/onc\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2014.404\nmailto:shiyquan@fmmu.edu.cn\nmailto:daimingfan@fmmu.edu.cn) (DF)\nhttp://www.nature.com/onc\n\n\nmiRNAs may represent one of the upstream regulation mechan-\nisms of STIM1 expression in cancer metastasis remains unknown.\nIn this study, we provide the first evidence that STIM1\n\noverexpression is associated with progression and poor prognosis\n\nin CRC.

Upregulation and knockdown of STIM1 expression\nwas confirmed by western blot analysis (Figure 1b). Transwell\nassays showed that downregulation of STIM1 expression in\nSW620 cells markedly decreased cell migration and invasion\n(Figures 1c1 and c2). Conversely, upregulation of STIM1 expression\nin SW480 cells significantly enhanced cell migration and invasion\n(Figures 1d1 and d2).

During the EMT\nprocess, differentiated polarized epithelial cells undergo profound\nmorphogenetic changes, typified by the dissolution of cell–cell\njunctions and loss of apicobasolateral polarity, resulting in the\nformation of migratory mesenchymal cells with invasive proper-\nties. Moreover, during this process the expression of epithelial\nmarkers (such as E-cadherin and β-catenin) is downregulated,\nwhereas the expression of mesenchymal markers (such as\nvimentin and fibronectin) is upregulated.38,39\n\nBy comparing the morphology of the cell models described\nabove under a light microscope, we observed that ectopic\nexpression of STIM1 in SW480 cells induced the conversion of\npolarized epithelial cells to spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like\nmesenchymal cells with the loss of cell–cell adhesion, whereas\nknockdown of STIM1 in SW620 cells resulted in a tighter\norganization of cells in colonies and an epithelioid morphology\n(Figure 3a).\nNext, we assessed the expression of EMT markers in these cell\n\nmodels. Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcription–\nPCR (qRT–PCR) analysis showed a marked decrease in the\nexpression of vimentin and fibronectin and a significant increase\nin the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin in SW620-STIM1si1\nand SW620-STIM1si1 cells, compared with control cells. Conver-\nsely, a decrease in the expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin and\nan increase in the expression of vimentin and fibronectin were\nobserved in SW480-STIM1c1 and SW480-STIM1c1 cells, compared\nwith control cells (Figures 3b and c). These changes in E-cadherin\nand vimentin expression were confirmed by an immunofluores-\ncent assay (Figure 3d). These results suggest that STIM1 is critical\nfor the acquisition of EMT characteristics and may contribute to\nthe EMT-derived invasive phenotype in CRC cells.\n\nSTIM1 is significantly upregulated in human CRC tissues and\nindicates poor prognosis\nTo explore the potential role of STIM1 in determining the clinical\noutcome of CRC, we assessed STIM1 expression in a tissue\n\nmicroarray of 90 CRC patients. The results of immunohistochem-\nical staining showed that STIM1 was localized to both the\ncytoplasm and membranes. Positive STIM1 expression was\ndetected in 63 of 90 (71.1%) primary CRC samples compared\nwith only 19 of 90 (21.1%) adjacent non-tumor tissues. These\nresults were confirmed by scoring the staining intensity across the\nsection (Figures 4A1–3). These findings indicated that STIM1 was\nsignificantly overexpressed in human CRC tissues. To investigate\nthe correlation between STIM1 overexpression and CRC\nmetastasis, we compared STIM1 expression in 10 pairs of LN\nmetastasis-positive (LN-positive group) and LN metastasis-\nnegative (LN-negative group) primary CRC specimens. Real-time\nPCR analysis showed that STIM1 mRNA levels were much higher in\nthe LN-positive group than in the LN-negative group (Figure 4C).\nFurthermore, Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that patients with\npositive STIM1 expression had shorter overall survival than those\nwho were negative for STIM1 expression (Figure 4D). To\ninvestigate whether STIM1 expression is associated with the\nprogression of CRC, we investigated the expression of STIM1 in an\nadditional 40 fresh CRC tissues by qRT–PCR (Figure 4B) and\ncompared the results with the clinicopathologic characteristics of\nthe patients. The results showed that overexpression of STIM1 did\nnot correlate with age, gender or tumor size (P40.05), but was\nsignificantly associated with TNM stage and LN status (Po0.01;\nTable 1). Taken together, these results suggest that the expression\nlevel of STIM1 positively correlated with the progression of CRC\nand that STIM1 overexpression is indicative of poor prognoses of\nhuman CRC patients following curative resection.\n\nThe expression of miR-185 inversely correlates with the expression\nof STIM1 in CRC cells and is associated with the progression of CRC\nThe above results indicated that STIM1 overexpression might have\na critical role in CRC. However, there have been few studies on the\nregulation of STIM1 expression in cancer. miRNAs were recently\nfound to have an important role in tumor progression through\ntheir function as posttranscriptional regulators. We hypothesized\nthat posttranscriptional regulation by miRNAs may represent one\nof the upstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression. To\ntest this idea, we used several web-based target analysis tools\n(TargetScan, miRanda, RNAhybrid, pictar and DIANAmT) to identify\nmiRNAs that potentially target STIM1. As a result, miR-185 was\nidentified as a potential regulator of STIM1 expression (Figure 5a).\nThis was consistent with the results of our previous miRNA\nmicroarray analysis, which identified miR-185 as the most\nsignificantly downregulated miRNA in SW620 cells compared with\nSW480 cells.36 Therefore, miR-185 was selected for further study.\nWe examined endogenous miR-185 expression levels in four\n\nhuman CRC cell lines (SW480, SW620, HT29 and LOVO) and in a\nnormal human intestinal epithelial cell line by qRT–PCR. The\nexpression levels of miR-185 were significantly decreased in\nSW620 and LOVO cell lines (highly metastatic cells) compared with\neither poorly metastatic or immortalized cells. miR-185 expression\nnegatively correlated with the metastatic potential of the CRC cells\n(Figure 5b1). Furthermore, the expression of miR-185 and STIM1\nwas inversely correlated (Figure 5b2). To investigate the correla-\ntion of miR-185 with STIM1 expression levels in CRC tissues, we\nused qRT–PCR to measure the expression levels of miR-185 in the\n40 CRC tissues previously described. Our results confirmed that\nthe mRNA level of miR-185 negatively correlated with STIM1\nexpression (Figure 5c2). The correlation of miR-185 expression\nwith clinicopathologic factors was also examined. In contrast to\nSTIM1 expression, low expression levels of miR-185 were\nsignificantly associated with advanced clinical tumor node\nmetastasis stage and LN metastasis (Po0.001). miR-185 expres-\nsion levels in CRC patients did not correlate with age, gender,\ntumor size or cell differentiation (P40.05) (Table 2).

Successful upregulation of\nmiR-185 expression was confirmed by qRT–PCR (Figure 6a1).\nIncreased miR-185 expression resulted in significant inhibition of\nmigration and invasion in SW620 cells (Figures 6a2 and a3). To\ndetermine whether the loss of miR-185 promotes the migration or\ninvasion of CRC cells, miR-185 was silenced in SW480 cells with an\nantisense oligonucleotide inhibitor (Figure 6b1). This inhibition of\n\nmiR-185 significantly promoted cell migration and invasion\n(Figures 6b2 and b3). These results indicate that miR-185 represses\nthe invasive potential of CRC cells. As STIM1 has been shown to\npromote EMT in CRC cells and miR-185 has been predicted as a\npotential regulator of STIM1, we hypothesized that miR-185 may\nexert an opposite effect on the regulation of EMT in CRC cells. To\ntest this, we compared the morphology of our cell models under a\nlight microscope, and found that upregulating the expression of\nmiR-185 in SW620 cells induced a tighter organization of cells in\ncolonies, whereas downregulating the expression of miR-185 in\nSW480 cells led to a more fibroblast-like mesenchymal cell\nmorphology (Figure 3c).

To\nobtain additional direct evidence that STIM1 expression is\nregulated by miR-185, we analyzed the binding site of miR-185\nin the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of STIM1 and performed a\nluciferase reporter assay. An STIM1 3′-UTR reporter (Luc-STIM1) or\nthe corresponding mutant reporter (Luc-STIM1-mu) was co-\ntransfected with miR-185 mimics or mimic controls into SW620\ncells. As expected, the luciferase activities of the reporter\nconstructs were reduced significantly only when miR-185 mimics\nwere co-transfected with Luc-STIM1 in SW620 cells. No apparent\nchange in luciferase activities was observed in cells transfected\nwith Luc-STIM1-mu or mimic controls (Figure 7a). To confirm\nwhether targeting of the STIM1 3′-UTR by miR-185 was functional,\nSW620 cells transfected with miR-185 mimics and SW480 cells\ntransfected with the miR-185 inhibitor were analyzed by qRT–PCR\nand western blotting. Both mRNA (Figure 7b1) and protein\n(Figure 7b2) levels of STIM1 were markedly upregulated in SW480\ncells transfected with the miR-185 inhibitor, whereas both mRNA\n(Figure 7c1) and protein (Figure 7c2) levels of STIM1 were\neffectively downregulated in SW620 cells transfected with the\nmiR-185 mimic. Further experiments confirmed that the altered\nmiR-185 expression does not affect the expression of STIM2,\nOrai1, Orai2 and Orai3, which may also be involved in SOCE\n(Supplementary Figures S2A and B). These results suggest that\n\nSTIM1 is a direct functional target of miR-185. To further\ncorroborate this hypothesis, we performed a ‘rescue’ experiment\nby co-transfecting SW620 cells with miR-185 mimics and a\npcDNA3.1 vector carrying an STIM1 expression cassette\n(pcDNA3.1-STIM1) or mutated seed sequences of miR-185 at the\nSTIM1 3′-UTR (STIM1-mu). Western blot analysis demonstrated\nthat co-transfection of SW620 cells with the miR-185 mimic and\nSTIM1-mu restored STIM1 protein expression, whereas co-\ntransfection with pcDNA3.1-STIM1 failed to recover the STIM1\nexpression that was silenced by the miR-185 mimic. Furthermore,\nrestoration of STIM1 expression by the introduction of STIM1-mu\ninto SW620 cells transfected with the miR-185 mimics inhibited\nthe expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin and increased the\nexpression of vimentin and fibronectin (Figure 7d). In addition,\nrescuing STIM1 expression in the presence of the miR-185 mimics\nenhanced the invasion and migration potential of SW620 cells\n(Figure 7e). Moreover, to determine the effect of the miR-185–\nSTIM1 axis on SOCE, we examined cellular Ca2+ distribution by\nCa2+ imaging in both SW620 and SW480 cells. After ER Ca2+\n\ndepletion, Ca2+ influx through SOCE into SW620 cells was\nincreased compared with SW480 cells (Supplementary Figures\nS3A and B). We then examined the effect of overexpression of\nmiR-185 and found that SOCE was impaired in SW620–miR-185\nmimic cells (Supplementary Figures S3C and D), whereas\ninhibition of miR-185 in SW480 cells moderately increased\nSOCE (Supplementary Figures S3E and F). Taken together, these\nresults suggest that STIM1 is a potential functional target of\nmiR-185.\nIn summary, our results suggest that STIM1 is a direct functional\n\ntarget of miR-185 and that this novel miR-185/STIM1 axis has an\nimportant role in the regulation of CRC metastasis.\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we demonstrate that STIM1 promotes CRC\nmetastasis. The upregulation of STIM1 in CRC is at least partly\nattributed to posttranscriptional regulation by miR-185, a novel\nEMT-regulating miRNA. Additionally, we provide evidence sup-\nporting the involvement of STIM1 in the regulation of EMT in\ncancer.\nThe influx of Ca2+ is essential for the migration of tumor\n\ncells.40,41 STIM1, an endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor, regulates\nCa2+ influx by activating SOCE.11,12 STIM1 has recently been\nproposed to be a critical molecule in the regulation of cancer\nmetastasis,21,22 although the exact role of STIM1 in metastasis\nremains controversial. STIM1 was initially implicated as an\nantimetastasis molecule.19 However, we found that STIM1\npromoted migration and invasive properties in CRC, and that\nincreased expression of STIM1 in CRC was significantly associated\nwith cancer metastasis. In accordance with our study, STIM1 was\nreported to be one of the molecules essential for breast tumor cell\nmigration in vitro and tumor metastasis in vivo.21 Similarly, another\nstudy demonstrated that the level of STIM1 was significantly\nassociated with the risk of metastasis in cervical cancer. Moreover,\nepidermal growth factor-stimulated migration in cervical cancer\ncells requires STIM1 expression.22 Our results provide new\nevidence supporting the involvement of STIM1 in the promotion\nof cancer metastasis.\nIt has been reported that expression of constitutively active Ras\n\novercomes the migration-inhibitory function of the Ca2+ influx\ninhibitor and STIM1 siRNA in breast cancer.21 Interestingly,\na previous study has shown that activation of the Ras signaling\npathway leads to activation of the transcriptional regulator,\nSnail1,28 which appears to have a major role in EMT.23,29 These\nstudies strongly suggest that STIM1 might promote cancer\nmetastasis by regulating the EMT. In this study, we demonstrated\nthat knockdown of STIM1 induced the conversion of spindle-\nshaped, fibroblast-like mesenchymal cells to polarized epithelial\n\nTable 2.

Moreover,\nincreased levels of STIM1 correlated with a high metastatic\npotential of CRC cells. In accordance with our findings, a previous\nstudy also showed that STIM1 was significantly associated with the\nrisk of metastasis in cervical cancer.22 Based on these findings,\nelucidating the mechanism of STIM1 upregulation may contribute\nto the identification of new cancer therapy targets. A recent study\ndemonstrated that the expression of STIM1 is regulated by Wilms\ntumor suppressor 1 and early growth response 1 in six specific\ncancer subtypes.42 Another study reported that STIM1 is regulated\nby androgens in prostate stromal cells. However, these observa-\ntions are not sufficient to explain the mechanism behind the\nupregulation of STIM1 in cancer. A recent study found that\nanother STIM protein, STIM2, inversely control melanoma growth\nand invasion,43 suggesting that STIM proteins, including STIM1\nand STIM2, have critical roles in cancer. Interestingly, these STIM\nproteins may exert different and even opposite functions in\ndifferent kinds of cancers, which imply complex and important\nroles in cancer. Further study on STIM family may provide new\ntargets for cancer therapy.\nmiRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of tumor\n\nmetastasis32 and recent studies have highlighted the importance\nof miRNAs in the regulation of the EMT.33,34 To explore whether\nposttranscriptional regulation by certain miRNAs is one of the\nupstream regulatory mechanisms of STIM1 expression, we used\nseveral target prediction algorithms to assay for miRNA binding\nsites in the STIM1 3′-UTR. miRNA-185 was identified by several\nalgorithms. Surprisingly, our previous miRNA microarray analysis\nrevealed that miR-185 was the most significantly downregulated\nmiRNA in SW620 cells (highly metastatic) compared with SW480\ncells (poorly metastatic).36 In this study, we found that miR-185\nexpression inversely correlated with the expression of STIM1 in\nboth CRC cells and tissues, and that transfection with miR-185\nsignificantly downregulated the expression of STIM1. These results\nwere further confirmed by luciferase activity assays. miR-185 was\nrecently found to be an independent prognostic factor in gastric\ncancer44 and hepatocellular carcinoma.45 Moreover, miR-185 can\ninduce cell cycle arrest and repress cell proliferation in non-small-\ncell lung cancer,46 colorectal cancer,47 glioma,48 gastric cancer49\n\nand breast cancer.50 miR-185 has also been reported to be\ninvolved in metastasis in colorectal cancer51 and glioma.48\n\nHowever, the role of miR-185 in the pathophysiological functions\nof STIM1 has not previously been reported.\nThe results presented here show that upregulating the\n\nexpression of miR-185 inhibited migration and invasion and\nreversed the EMT in CRC cells. Our data further indicate that\nSTIM1 is a functional target of miR-185 in CRC. Taken together,\nthese findings provide new insight into the mechanism of the\nregulation of STIM1 expression at the posttranscriptional level,\n\nalthough further studies are required to fully understand the\nmechanism by which the miR-185-STIM1 pathway regulates EMT\nin cancer.\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a critical function of\n\nSTIM1 in promoting CRC metastasis. This study also reveals a new\nregulatory mechanism of STIM1 expression by miR-185, an miRNA\nnot previously associated with the EMT process. We believe that\nthe miR-185-STIM1 pathway is an attractive target for therapeutic\nintervention against cancer metastasis.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture\nThe human CRC cell lines were preserved in our institute and were\nroutinely maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA),\n100 U/ml penicillin sodium and 100mg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in\na humidified air atmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. Throughout\nthe experiment, cells were used in the logarithmic phase of growth\naccording to the supplier’s instructions.\n\nClinical samples\nSamples from 40 CRC patients (23 males and 17 females) who had\nundergone proctocolectomy with LN dissection for CRC at Xijing Hospital\n(Xi'an, China) between November 2008 and April 2009 were included in\nthe study (Supplementary Table S2). None of the patients received\npreoperative chemotherapy. The resected specimens were histologically\nexamined by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The primary tumor samples\nand corresponding non-tumor mucosa were collected from each patient\nimmediately after the surgical process and were snap frozen in liquid\nnitrogen until further use. Total RNA from the frozen tissues was isolated\nwith TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions.\n\nOligonucleotide construction, lentivirus production and construct\ndesign\nAn miR-185 mimic, an inhibitor and a negative control oligonucleotides\nwere purchased from RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). Transfection of\noligonucleotides was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen)\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. On the basis of the STIM1\nsequence, three short hairpin RNAs were designed using the siRNA Target\nFinder (InvivoGene, San Diego, CA, USA): 5′-GGGAAGACCTCAATTACCA-3′,\n5′-TCTCCACATTTGGATTCTT-5′ and 5′-TGGATGATGTAGATCATAA-3′. Lenti-\nviral vectors encoding short haipin RNAs were generated using GV248\nvector (GeneChem Co., Ltd, Shanghai, China). Stable transfectants\noverexpressing STIM1 were generated by lentiviral transduction using a\nGV166 vector (GeneChem Co., Ltd). An empty vector was used as the\nnegative control.\nSTIM1-expressing vector with miR-185 binding sites or mutated seed\n\nsequences of miR-185 at STIM1 3′-UTR (STIM1-mu) was purchased from\nOpen Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA) and was subcloned into the\neukaryotic expression vector.\n\nLuciferase assay\nLuc-STIM1 vector. The STIM1 3′-UTR containing the predicted miR-185\nbinding site was amplified by RT–PCR from the total RNA of cultured\nSW620 cells and was cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen).
