Using a calcium-induced keratinocyte differentiation model we investigated the interaction between epidermal\ndifferentiation and VZV infection. RNA-seq analysis showed that VZV infection has a profound effect on differentiating\nkeratinocytes, altering the normal process of epidermal gene expression to generate a signature that resembles patterns of\ngene expression seen in both heritable and acquired skin-blistering disorders. Further investigation by real-time PCR,\nprotein analysis and electron microscopy revealed that VZV specifically reduced expression of specific suprabasal\ncytokeratins and desmosomal proteins, leading to disruption of epidermal structure and function. These changes were\naccompanied by an upregulation of kallikreins and serine proteases. Taken together VZV infection promotes blistering and\ndesquamation of the epidermis, both of which are necessary to the viral spread and pathogenesis. At the same time,\nanalysis of the viral transcriptome provided evidence that VZV gene expression was significantly increased following\ncalcium treatment of keratinocytes. Using reporter viruses and immunohistochemistry we confirmed that VZV gene and\nprotein expression in skin is linked with cellular differentiation. These studies highlight the intimate host-pathogen\ninteraction following VZV infection of skin and provide insight into the mechanisms by which VZV remodels the epidermal\nenvironment to promote its own replication and spread.\n\nCitation: Jones M, Dry IR, Frampton D, Singh M, Kanda RK, et al.

In both diseases, VZV replication in the\n\nepidermal layer of skin results in the formation of large\n\npolykaryocytes and the development of blisters containing\n\ninfectious cell-free virus. The epidermis is a continually regener-\n\nating tissue layer that develops a stratified structure, which is\n\nmaintained by keratinocytes, specialized cells which produce a\n\nnetwork of keratin filaments anchored to intracellular junctions to\n\nprovide structural support to the tissue. As keratinocytes transit\n\nfrom the stem-cell rich basal to the uppermost layer of the\n\nepidermis, they undergo a program of terminal differentiation.\n\nEach stratum (basal, spinous, granular, lucidum and cornified) [1]\n\nidentified within the stratified epidermis is associated with\n\nestablished signature patterns of gene expression [2] [3]. This\n\nprocess is tightly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms that\n\ninvolve calcium gradients, microRNAs, developmental signalling\n\npathways and proteolytic cascades [4,5,6,7,8,9].\n\nAlthough VZV infects primary cultured keratinocytes [10] little\n\nis known about the interaction between VZV replication and\n\nepidermal differentiation. Previous work has shown that VZV\n\nreplication in skin differs from monolayer cultures in that certain\n\nVZV proteins, such as ORF10 and ORF11, are not required for\n\nreplication in melanoma monolayer cultures but are necessary for\n\noptimal replication in foetal skin xenografts of SCID-hu mice,\n\n[11,12]. Additionally, the live attenuated VZV vaccine, vOKA,\n\nreplicates well in tissue culture but is attenuated for replication in\n\nskin but not in lymphoid or neuronal xenografts in SCID-hu\n\nmouse models [13].\n\nIn the present study we used an in vitro calcium induced model\n\nof epithelial differentiation [5] and analysed the transcriptome of\n\nuninfected and VZV-infected primary keratinocytes using RNA-\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896\n\n\n\nseq. This approach identified not only the effect of VZV on\n\nkeratinocytes but also the consequence of keratinocyte differenti-\n\nation on VZV replication and maturation. Together our data\n\nprovides intriguing new insights into host–pathogen interactions.\n\nResults\n\nVZV infection of primary keratinocytes\nAs keratinocytes differentiate they lose basally expressed\n\ncytokeratins (KRT5/14/15) and increase the expression of\n\ndifferentiation markers e.g. suprabasal cytokeratins (KRT1/10)\n\nand involucrin (IVL). The addition of calcium to primary\n\nkeratinocytes in culture, mimics the calcium gradient across the\n\nepidermis and the process of epidermal differentiation [5]. To\n\nassess the effect of calcium on primary keratinocytes we measured\n\nby qPCR the change in the expression of selected keratinocyte\n\nmarkers known to be altered by differentiation (KRT10, KRT15\n\nand IVL) (Figure S1) and confirmed our findings by immunoblot-\n\nting for KRT10 and IVL (Figure S1). In our hands, the addition of\n\ncalcium to 1.2 mM increased the expression of the suprabasal\n\n(KRT10) and granular marker (IVL) as well as reducing the\n\nexpression of the basal marker (KRT15), demonstrating that we\n\ncould use calcium to induce keratinocyte differentiation.\n\nThe ability of VZV to infect primary human keratinocytes has\n\npreviously been assessed [10]. Sexton and colleagues noted that\n\nmaintaining the keratinocytes in a low calcium media prior to\n\nVZV infection resulted in a higher initial infection. We were able\n\nto infect cells grown in low calcium [0.6 mM] (2calcium) and high\n\ncalcium [1.2 mM] (+calcium) media with VZV as detected by an\ninfectious centre assay (Figure 1A–B). Over the course of a 5 day\n\ninfection we observed an increase in the number of VZV foci,\n\nindicating cell to cell spread, full replication and production of\n\ninfectious virus (Figure 1C). As previously observed [10] when\n\nVZV was added to cells cultured in high calcium medium, the\n\nnumber of foci was less and plateaued after one day, suggesting\n\nreduced replication and spread. To optimise a model with which\n\nto investigate the interaction of VZV and keratinocyte differen-\n\ntiation, we next examined the effect of adding calcium [1.2 mM]\n\nto cells already infected with VZV. By immunohistochemistry, the\n\nVZV plaque size was comparable to the 2calcium cells\n\n(Figure 1A–B), but the number of foci counted was still less when\n\ncalcium was added 3 days p.i. (Figure 1C). Primary keratinocytes\n\nin culture are known to change size [14], develop tight junctions\n\nand form clusters [15] when treated with calcium. To ensure that\n\nthis did not affect the number of VZV plaques counted, the\n\ninfected keratinocytes and the associated supernatants were\n\ntransferred onto MeWo cells and the VZV titres calculated.\n\nVZV was not detected in the supernatants of any sample (data not\n\nshown). The VZV titre in the +calcium cells at days 4–5 p.i. was\nsignificantly less than in the 2calcium cells. However, by adding\n\nthe calcium to the cells 3 days after VZV infection, the VZV titres\n\nwere higher than in the +calcium cells and by day 5 no significant\ndifference was seen in the VZV titres between the 2calcium cells\n\nand the cells which the calcium had been added 3 days p.i.\n\n(Figure 1D). Flow cytometry analysis of VZV keratinocytes\n\nconfirmed that keratinocytes cultured in high calcium media\n\n(+calcium) express fewer VZV proteins than the cells culture in\nlow calcium media (2calcium) but this could be increased by\n\nadding calcium at 3 days p.i. (Figure S2). Moreover, this finding\n\nwas independent of whether cell-associated or cell-free VZV was\n\nused to infect cells. VZV gene expression (ORF29) was compared\n\nby real time PCR in cells grown in low calcium media (2calcium)\n\nand cells switched to a high calcium media at day 3 post VZV\n\ninfection (Fig. 1E). The expression of ORF29 peaked at 48 hrs in\n\nboth the comparisons with increased expression seen in the\n\nsamples which had calcium added at day 3.\n\nFrom the combined data above showing peak of VZV\n\ngene expression at 48 hrs following the calcium switch and the\n\ndata showing increased expression of host differentiation markers\n\nat 24–48 hours following the addition of calcium (Figure S1),\n\nwe determined that the optimal time point at which to examine\n\nboth host and viral gene expression together was 48 hrs after\n\ncalcium-induced differentiation of keratinocytes infected with\n\nVZV 3 days previously. Using this model, we compared\n\nundifferentiated (2calcium) and differentiated (calcium added at\n\nday 3 post infection) keratinocytes as well as studying the effect of\n\nthe keratinocyte differentiation on the viral transcriptome\n\n(Figure 1F).\n\nTo summarise, primary human keratinocytes were plated out at\n\nday 0 and infected/mock infected with VZV at an m.o.i of 0.2 at\n\nday 2. Cells were then incubated at 34uC until day 5 before either\nmaintaining the cultures in a low calcium media or switching to a\n\nhigh calcium media at day 3 p.i. Total RNA was harvested at day\n\n7 (48 hrs after changing media and 5 days p.i.) for all four\n\nexperimental conditions (K; Keratinocytes, KV; Keratinocytes\n\nand VZV, KC; Keratinocytes and Calcium and KCV; Keratino-\n\ncytes, Calcium and VZV) as illustrated in Figure 1H.\n\nThe cDNA was sequenced using the Illumina RNA-seq\n\nplatform. Between 15–366106 reads were generated per lane of\nwhich 4.8–126106 mapped to the human transcriptome once\nduplicate reads had been removed (Homo sapiens (release 37)\n\nreference sequence GRCh37/hg19: Table S1). Similar distribu-\n\ntions of reads per gene were found across all samples before\n\nnormalisation with no major outliers (Figure S3). The number of\n\nduplicate reads per sample varied between 21–45%, with higher\n\nlevels of duplication observed in the samples from batch 3,\n\npresumably due to a PCR batch effect. However, estimated library\n\nsizes (10–326106) were independent of batch and average quality\nscores rose from 31 for batches 1 and 2 to 38 for batch 3,\n\ncorresponding to updated Illumina reagents and protocol.\n\nPost-normalisation, clustering transcriptome profiles by Spearman’s\n\nrank correlation coefficient gave tight clusters for the calcium treated\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nVaricella zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox and shingles,\nwhich are characterised by the formation of fluid-filled skin\nlesions. Infectious viral particles present in these lesions are\ncritical for airborne spread to cause chickenpox in non-\nimmune contacts and for infection of nerve ganglia via\nnerve endings in the skin, a pre-requisite for shingles.\nSeveral VZV proteins, although dispensable in laboratory\ncell-culture, are essential for VZV infection of skin, a finding\nthought to relate to VZV interaction with a process known\nas epidermal differentiation. In this, the specialised\nkeratinocyte cells of the outer layer of skin, the epidermis,\nare continually shed to be replaced by differentiating\nkeratinocytes, which migrate up from lower layers. How\nVZV interaction with epidermal differentiation leads to the\nformation of fluid-filled lesions remains unclear. We show\nusing a keratinocyte model of epidermal differentiation\nthat VZV infection alters epidermal differentiation, gener-\nating a specific pattern of changes in that is characteristic\nof blistering and skin shedding diseases. We also identified\nthat the differentiation status of the keratinocytes influ-\nences the replication pattern of the viral gene and protein\nexpression, with both increasing as the VZV particles\ntraverses to the uppermost layers of the skin. The findings\nprovide new insights into VZV-host cell interactions.\n\nVZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene Expression\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896\n\n\n\nsamples (KC and KCV), whilst those for the KV and K samples were\n\nmore dispersed with clustering being more heavily dependent on\n\nkeratinocyte batch.

From this, likelihood-ratio tests were performed, identi-\n\nfying 3863 differentially expressed genes across 6 comparisons of\n\ninterest (KC/K, KV/K, KCV/KC, KCV/KV, KCV/K and\n\nKV/KC), (Figure 2A–B).\n\nThe greatest degree of differential expression was seen by the\n\naddition of calcium to uninfected keratinocytes (KC/K). A total of\n\n1786 genes were altered (463 genes up-regulated, 1323 genes\n\ndown-regulated), the pattern of which was consistent with the\n\ninduction of keratinocyte differentiation with a decrease in the\n\nexpression of basally expressed cytokeratins and an increase in the\n\nexpression of most but not all of genes expressed in both the\n\nsuprabasal and granular layers (Figure S4) and in keeping with the\n\nknown limitations of the keratinocyte calcium-switch model, we\n\ndid not see changes in genes that are expressed in the cornified\n\nlayer. In contrast, relatively few genes were significantly altered by\n\nviral infection alone (KV/K, 110 upregulated, 53 downregulated).\n\nAlthough approximately the same viral titres were achieved in\n\nboth conditions, (Figure 1D) significantly more genes were\n\ndifferentially expressed in the KCV/KC comparison (1049\n\nFigure 2.

The converse is shown on the right-hand side (i.e. genes that are\ndifferentially expressed in Y but not in X), again with up or down arrows denoting the direction of fold change. The overlaps themselves show the 4\npossible options: up in both X and Y, down in both X and Y, up in X and down in Y, or down in X and up in Y. These are denoted by pairs of arrows,\nwith the left-hand arrow referring to the direction of fold change in X and the right-hand arrow denoting the direction of fold change in Y e.g. in KC/K\nvs. KCV/KC (D), 4 genes are up regulated in both comparisons, 2 are down regulated in both comparisons, 73 are up regulated in KC/K but down\nregulated in KCV/KC whilst 159 are down regulated in KC/K but up regulated in KCV/KC.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003896.g002\n\nVZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene Expression\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896\n\n\n\nupregulated, 371 downregulated). Of the 107 genes differentially\n\nexpressed following viral infection in both differentiated and\n\nundifferentiated keratinocytes (KCV/KC and KV/K), 99 were\n\nfound to be upregulated and 8 downregulated in both comparisons\n\n(Figure 2E), suggesting a common role for these genes in host\n\nresponse to viral infection regardless of differentiation. As we could\n\nnot achieve 100% infection in either the KCV or KV samples\n\n(Figure 1), we must consider that the uninfected bystander cells in\n\nthese samples could also contribute to the overall gene expression\n\nchanges observed.\n\nOnly 31 genes were found to be differentially expressed in both\n\nvirally infected (KV/K) and calcium treated (KC/K) conditions\n\n(19% KV/K, 2% KC/K) (Figure 2B), strongly suggesting that\n\nviral infection does not drive differentiation. A similar analysis of\n\nthe KCV/KC and KC/K comparisons identified 238 genes as\n\ndifferentially expressed in both contrasts (17% KCV/KC, 13%\n\nKC/K). However of these genes, 159 were upregulated in the\n\nKCV/KC comparison but downregulated in KC/K, whilst 73\n\nwere downregulated in the KCV/KC but upregulated in the KC/\n\nK comparison. The direction of changes was the same for only 3%\n\n(6/238) of those genes differentially expressed in both conditions.\n\nThis finding further supports the contention that VZV infection\n\ndoes not drive differentiation and raises the possibility that VZV\n\nmay in fact interfere with or hinder it. Some of the effects seen in\n\nthe VZV infected samples that were calcium switched (KCV) were\n\nalso apparent in VZV infected samples that were untreated (KV).\n\nHowever the differences were not due solely to the effect of\n\ncalcium on keratinocytes. If this were the case, we ought to see\n\ngood agreement between those genes differentially expressed in\n\nboth KCV/KV and KC/K. That this overlap is relatively small\n\n(85 genes: 5% total KC/K; 9% total KCV/KV) is in keeping with\n\nthe observation that the KCV samples were transcriptionally\n\ndistinct from both KC and K samples and reinforces the notion of\n\nan interaction between VZV infection and the process of\n\nkeratinocyte differentiation.\n\nIn addition, there is only a relatively small overlap between\n\ngenes differentially expressed following addition of calcium and\n\nthose differentially expressed upon addition of calcium and viral\n\ninfection (215 genes, 12% KC/K, 16% KCV/K). Of these genes,\n\nthe direction of fold change is identical for almost all (91%, 50\n\ngenes upregulated in both comparisons, 145 genes downregulated\n\nin both comparisons) suggesting the KCV samples possess a more\n\ndifferentiated keratinocyte phenotype than the K samples.\n\nHowever, the vast majority of genes found to be differentially\n\nexpressed in the KCV/K comparison (1113 genes, 84% KCV/K)\n\nare not significantly up- or downregulated by the addition of\n\ncalcium alone, further supporting the notion that changes in gene\n\nexpression between the K and KCV samples are not solely a\n\nconsequence of keratinocyte differentiation.\n\nGene set enrichment analysis using the online DAVID\n\nfunctional annotation resource [16] identified significantly en-\n\nriched functional groups (PBH,0.05) altered by either calcium\n\n(KC/K) (Figure 3A), by VZV infection of calcium differentiated\n\ncells (KCV/KC) (Figure 3B) or by VZV infection of undifferen-\n\ntiated cells (KV/K) (Figure 3C). Genes upregulated by calcium\n\ntreatment of uninfected keratinocytes (KC/K) showed enrichment\n\nfor several functional groups including cell cycle (GO:0007049)\n\nand cell division (SwissProt PIR keyword) whilst those that were\n\ndownregulated in this comparison included regulation of tran-\n\nscription (GO:0045449) and negative regulation of gene expres-\n\nsion (GO:0010629). The categories identified in the KCV/KC\n\ncomparison were more varied with enrichment in the upregulated\n\ngenes for several functional groups including cell junction genes\n\n(GO:0030054), the ECM-receptor interaction pathway (KEGG\n\nhsa04512) and serine protease inhibitors (SwissProt keyword).\n\nEnrichment was also observed for additional groups such as cell\n\nadhesion (GO:0007155), epidermis development (GO:0008544),\n\nserine proteases (SwissProt PIR keyword) and the integrin-\n\nmediated signaling pathway (GO:0007229). Although relatively\n\nfew genes were significantly altered by viral infection alone (KV/\n\nFigure 3. Representative functional groups enriched in differentially expressed gene lists. The genes which were differentially expressed\nin the (A) KC/K (B) KCV/KC and (C) KV/K comparisons were analysed using the functional annotation tool in DAVID.

Although\n\nseveral interferon-stimulated genes were significantly changed\n\nafter VZV infection, the corresponding GO terms (GO:0071357)\n\nwere not identified as being significantly enriched in either of the\n\nVZV infected conditions (KCV or KV).\n\nVZV replication dysregulates cytokeratin expression\n\nA hallmark of epidermal differentiation are the changes that\n\noccur in cytokeratin (KRT) expression [6]. Basal cytokeratins\n\n(KRT5/14/15) are lost and suprabasal cytokeratins (KRT1/10)\n\nare gained as the keratinocytes differentiate and migrate outwards.\n\nGene-annotation enrichment analysis using the online DAVID\n\ndatabase of both the KCV/KC and KV/K deduced that infection\n\nwith VZV profoundly affected the development of the epidermis\n\n(Figure 3B–C). Specifically, we show here that VZV alters the\n\nexpression of several epidermal cytokeratins, regardless of the\n\ndifferentiation status of the keratinocyte (Figure S5, Table S2). The\n\neffect of VZV infection on the epithelial cytokeratins was\n\nindependently verified by qPCR and the fold change calculated\n\nfor a direct comparison to the RNA-seq data (Figure 4A–B). A\n\ngood concordance was seen between the methods. VZV infection\n\nincreased the expression of KRT15, a stem cell marker located in\n\nthe hair follicle isthmus in both the KCV/KC and KV/K\n\ncomparisons, although other stem cell markers (ITGB1, CD34\n\nand CD200) (data not shown) and other basal layer cytokeratins\n\n(KRT5/14) were not altered. At the same time, VZV either down-\n\nregulated or prevented up regulation of the suprabasally expressed\n\ncytokeratin heterodimers KRT1 and KRT10, which are the major\n\ncytokeratins associated with keratinocyte differentiation [17] in\n\nboth the KCV/KC and KV/K comparisons. EM images of\n\ndifferentiated keratinocytes infected with VZV show an abun-\n\ndance of cytokeratin structures (Figure S5). This finding may be\n\nrelated to the upregulation of KRT4/13 (131-fold and 34-fold\n\nrespectively for the KCV/KC comparison, figure 4A), KRT4/13\n\nare normally present as heterodimers in the suprabasal layers of\n\nmucosal but not stratified epithelium [18], and are thought to\n\nfunction like KRT1/10 to maintain cellular architecture. Upre-\n\ngulation of KRT4/13 may therefore have compensated structur-\n\nally for the reduced expression of KRT1/10. To test whether\n\nVZV replication was responsible for the reduction of KRT1/10\n\nexpression, the qPCR experiment was repeated with UV-\n\ninactivated VZV (Figure 4C–D). We again saw a downregulation\n\nof the KRT1 and KRT10 gene expression, but these changes were\n\npartially abolished by pre-treatment of the viral inoculum by UV\n\nirradiation. We also determined the effect of VZV infection on\n\nKRT10 and KRT15 protein expression by western blotting.\n\nKRT10 expression was increased by the addition of calcium by\n\n24 hrs. However, in the VZV infected cells the KRT10 levels were\n\nreduced and this reduction was more pronounced by 48 hrs p.i. in\n\nthe undifferentiated cells, confirming that the virus downregulates\n\nKRT10 regardless of the differentiation status of the cell. KRT15\n\nexpression was upregulated by VZV infection at 48 hrs p.i. and\n\nagain this effect was not dependent on the addition of calcium.\n\nFurther examination of the VZV infected keratinocytes by\n\nimmunofluorescence confirmed that not all cells were infected at\n\nday 5 p.i. but, KRT10 expression was absent in the ORF23GFP\n\nexpressing cells. However, KRT15 expression was widespread and\n\nnot necessarily confined to the VZV infected cells, confirming that\n\nnot all the gene changes seen in our transcriptome data was a\n\ndirect result of VZV infected cells and that changes in the\n\nbystander cells also contribute to the changes seen (Figure 4F).\n\nThe transcriptome data was confirmed for KRT10 using a\n\nkeratinocyte cell line, nTERTs. As with the primary keratinocytes,\n\nwe were unable to achieve100% infection of the nTERTs even at\n\nan m.o.i. = 2 (as measured in MeWo cells) after 5 days and it was\n\neasier to establish VZV infection in sparsely plated nTERTs (data\n\nnot shown). As the nTERTs become more densely populated, the\n\nexpression of KRT10 increased over the course of the experiment\n\nas measured by real time PCR. However infection of these cells\n\nwith VZV significantly reduced KRT10 gene expression\n\n(Figure 5A). The downregulation of KRT10 by VZV in nTERTs\n\nwas also observed at the protein level (Figure 5B). At both 24 and\n\n48 hrs post infection the expression of KRT10 was reduced in\n\nVZV infected nTERTs compared to the mock infected controls\n\nand pre-treatment of the viral inoculum with PAA, which inhibits\n\nVZV DNA polymerase and viral replication restored KRT10\n\nexpression (Figure 5C). To assess the expression of KRT10 in the\n\npresence of VZV infection, the cells were examined by immuno-\n\nfluorescence. The nTERTs are a heterogenous cell population and\n\nnot all the cells express KRT10, as shown in the mock infected\n\ncontrol (Figure 5D). However, KRT10 expression in VZV infected\n\ncells was diminished, particularly in infected cells expressing the\n\nlate protein (gE) (Figure 5F). Closer examination of the VZV\n\ninfected showed that a number of cells where the expression of\n\nORF62 was confined to the nuclei, which is indicative of an early\n\nVZV infection [19], still expressed KRT10 (Figure 5G–H), which\n\nin addition to the UV-treated virus and PAA data indicates that\n\nthe effect of VZV on KRT10 is dependent on viral replication.\n\nTo determine whether the VZV associated downregulation of\n\nKRT10 seen in VZV infected keratinocyte monolayers occurred\n\nin more physiologically representative skin models, keratinocyte\n\norganotypic rafts were infected with VZV. Organotypic raft\n\ncultures are an in vitro system that recapitulates epithelial\n\ndifferentiation and have previously been used to study VZV\n\nreplication in keratinocytes [20]. H&E staining revealed intact but\n\nswollen cells in the VZV infected raft, which are typically seen in\n\nearly VZV skin lesions (Figure 6A). KRT10 expression was\n\nconfined to a continuous layer in the suprabasal region of the\n\nmock-infected raft (Figure 6A vii) but disrupted in the VZV\n\ninfected raft (Figure 6A viii), with no expression of KRT10 seen in\n\nthe VZV infected pocket (indicated by VZV gE expression). These\n\nfindings were also confirmed in skin biopsy samples from VZV\n\ncases (Figure 6B–G). As previously observed, KRT10 expression\n\noccurred in the suprabasal layers of the epidermis and gross\n\nexamination suggested downregulation of KRT10 expression\n\nrestricted to VZV antigen positive infected areas (Figure 6B–C).\n\nKRT10 mean intensity was compared in uninfected and VZV\n\ninfected cells within the suprabasal layer of the epidermis. Ten\n\nVZV positive and ten VZV negative cells were selected within the\n\nsuprabasal layer of the epidermis and the fluorescence of the\n\nKRT10 staining (red) was measured using ImageJ and found to be\n\nsignificantly less in the cells staining positive for VZV gE\n\n(Figure 6D). As KRT10 forms heterodimers with KRT1 within\n\nthe suprabasal layer of the epidermis [18], we also examined\n\nKRT1 staining in a biopsy sample and carried out the same\n\nanalysis of the fluorescence intensity in VZV positive and negative\n\ncells within the suprabasal layer (Figure 6E–F). In agreement with\n\nthe KRT10 result, KRT1 expression was also substantially\n\nreduced in VZV infected cells (Figure 6G).\n\nVZV dysregulates desmosomes\nKRT1/10 bundles provide the cytoskeletal structure in the\n\nsuprabasal layers of the epidermis by interacting with desmosomal\n\nproteins [21].

VZV infected and mock-infected primary human keratinocytes were processed for total RNA and protein extraction. At day 5,\n48 hrs after the addition of calcium, the levels of epidermal cytokeratins were determined by qPCR and normalised to the housekeeping gene RN5S\n(B).

Fold change was calculated for\nthe VZV and UV-VZV relative to the mock control for both genes, p-values,0.05 are shown (*). VZV infection again downregulated both KRT1 and\nKRT10, but the downregulation was not observed in the UV-treated VZV for KRT1 and was partially restored for KRT10.

Overall, the\n\nmajority of the genes are significantly upregulated in the KCV\n\nsamples, with a similar but less pronounced upregulation also seen\n\nin the KV samples compared to K and KC (Table S4). Epidermal\n\nserine proteases, such as the tissue kallikreins participate in\n\ndesquamation, the natural process by which individual corneo-\n\ncytes are shed from the surface of the epithelium [23]. Mutations\n\nthat reduce the ability of the antagonist to inhibit the activity of the\n\nproteases, result in uncontrolled proteolytic activity associated with\n\ninflammatory skin conditions e.g. Nethertons syndrome [24]. Our\n\ndata demonstrates that VZV upregulated the expression of the\n\nmajority of the kallikrein genes (Figure 8B). The upregulation of\n\nKLK5 and 27 was of particular interest due to their role in\n\ncleaving DSC1 and DSG1 [25]. The upregulation of these genes\n\nby VZV could augment the downregulation of DSG1 and DSC1\n\nthereby further reducing cell-cell adhesion and the strength of the\n\nepidermal barrier to withstand mechanical trauma. The upregula-\n\ntion of the KLK5 and 27 genes was validated by qPCR\n\n(Figure 8C–D respectively) and the effect of VZV on the KLK5\n\nand 27 proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting in concen-\n\ntrated supernatants from mock and VZV-infected differentiated\n\nkeratinocytes (Figure 8E).\n\nThe addition of calcium to infected keratinocyte\ndifferentiation increases VZV gene expression\n\nRNA-seq enabled analysis of both host and viral transcripts\n\nwithin the same sample. Paired-end reads from VZV infected\n\nsamples were mapped to the pOKA genome (accession number\n\nAB097933). Between 1.46105–1.26106 reads were mapped to the\nVZV genome (Table S1) with the exception of KV1 where the\n\nnumber of mapped reads was at least ten fold lower. Visualisation\n\nof the VZV transcripts for all infected samples using IGV\n\n(Figure 9A) revealed that all viral genes were expressed in all\n\ninfected samples, indicating that lytic viral replication was\n\noccurring under all conditions. This was also established by\n\nelectron microscopy examination of the infected cells, which\n\nrevealed the presence of highly cell associated virus particles in\n\nboth VZV infected cells treated or untreated with calcium (Figure\n\nS6).\n\nOverall, the pattern of VZV gene expression was similar for\n\nuntreated and calcium treated cells, but the average number of\n\nmapped reads was approximately 9-fold higher in differentiated\n\ncells (KCV1–3) (Figure 9B). Significantly higher viral expression\n\nwas observed in the differentiated cells compared to the\n\nundifferentiated cells for every viral ORF without exception and\n\nregardless of temporal classification (all ORFs up-regulated\n\nbetween 4 and 15 fold; pFDR,0.01). Six viral ORFs were\n\nsignificantly changed by the addition of calcium (p,0.01) although\n\nonly ORF14 (gC) and ORF55 were significant (pFDR,0.01)\n\nfollowing correction for multiple testing (Table S5) and when KV1\n\nwas excluded due to low VZV reads only ORF14 remained\n\nsignificant. The increase in viral gene expression was indepen-\n\ndently investigated by qPCR analysis for the three temporal classes\n\nof herpesvirus genes. No difference was seen in the expression of\n\nthe IE gene (ORF63) at 48 hrs after the addition of calcium\n\n(Figure 9C), however the expression of the early (ORF29) and late\n\n(ORF14) viral genes was significantly increased in cells where\n\ncalcium was added 3 days after VZV infection as per our model\n\n(Figure 9D–E). The qPCR data did not reflect the degree of\n\nchange and increase in VZV gene expression seen in the KCV\n\nsamples in RNA-seq data in comparison to the KV samples. We\n\nwere able to demonstrate an effect of calcium on the viral DNA\n\nand observed a three-fold increase in VZV DNA as measured by\n\nreal time PCR after the addition of calcium to infected\n\nkeratinocytes on day three (Figure 9F). Taken together, our data,\n\nwhereby calcium induced differentiation of primary keratinocytes\n\nincreases VZV DNA replication and gene transcription, both of\n\nwhich are required for the production of progeny virions implies\n\nthat the process of differentiation increases VZV replication, but,\n\nwe were unable to demonstrate that calcium differentiation\n\ninduced an increase in the number of VZV particles or replication\n\nby either IF, infectious VZV foci or EM (data not shown).\n\nPattern of VZV gene expression is altered by keratinocyte\ndifferentiation\n\nIn common with other members of the herpesvirus family, VZV\n\ngene expression occurs in a temporally regulated cascade, which\n\ncan be categorized as; immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L).\n\nWhen viral reads were normalised separately to human reads,\n\ndistinct patterns of relative viral gene expression were observed for\n\nthe undifferentiated (KV) and differentiated (KCV) samples within\n\neach sample (Figure 10A). A high degree of agreement was\n\nobserved between the differentiated samples (KCV1–3) indicating\n\nthat late viral genes were more highly expressed than immediate\n\nearly genes in the differentiated samples. Undifferentiated samples\n\nKV3 and KV4 also showed good agreement, where in contrast to\n\nKCV1–3, the immediate early genes were more highly expressed\n\nthan the late genes. However, samples KV2 and KV5, despite not\n\nhaving been treated with calcium, had similar viral gene\n\nexpression patterns to the differentiated cells (KCV1–3). Analysis\n\nof 1463 host genes which are differentially expressed after\n\ntreatment with calcium but not changed by VZV infection (i.e.\n\nrepresentative of keratinocyte differentiation) showed clustering of\n\nKV2 and KV5 host gene expression profiles with the calcium-\n\nshifted differentiated keratinocyte samples KCV1–3 (Figure 10B).\n\nThis finding was supported by Spearman’s rank correlation\n\ncoefficient (Figure S3) and principal component analysis of host\n\ngene expression profiles (Figure S3), which again clustered samples\n\nKV2 and KV5 with the calcium treated samples. Since KV2 and\n\nKV5 were not treated with calcium, it is likely that these replicates\n\nunderwent spontaneous differentiation, something that is known to\n\nhappen when primary keratinocytes contact each other [26].\n\nThese data illustrate the impact of keratinocyte differentiation on\n\nVZV gene expression as distinct from the effect of calcium. To test\n\nour hypothesis that it is differentiation and not the addition of\n\ncalcium that is responsible for the increase seen in VZV gene\n\nexpression, the NOTCH pathway was activated by the addition of\n\nthe agonist, jagged-1 and inhibited by the addition of DAPT. The\n\ncanonical NOTCH pathway acts as a switch between the basal\n\nextraction. At day 5 p.i., 48 hrs after the addition of calcium, the levels of the desmosomal genes were determined by qPCR and normalised to the\nhousekeeping gene RN5S (B).

Conversely a decrease gE\n\nprotein expression was observed relative to the untreated\n\nkeratinocytes when the NOTCH pathway was ablated.\n\nTo examine the effect of cellular differentiation on the\n\nregulation of VZV genes, we used a recombinant viruses\n\nexpressing either luciferase or renilla reporter cassettes under\n\nvarious VZV promoters (Figure 10D–G). Keratinocytes were\n\ninfected with one of the three viruses as per our model and the\n\nreporter activity measured over the course of 6 days. Reporter\n\nactivity for ORF4, ORF14 and ORF9 increased over the\n\ntimepoints taken whereas ORF63 remained relatively level. In\n\nall viruses, the reporter activity was altered by the addition of\n\ncalcium at day 3 post infection. With the reporter driven by an\n\nimmediate early promoter (Figure 10D and F) there was a\n\ndecrease in its activity after the addition of calcium whereas the\n\nconverse was true for the reporters driven by the late promoters\n\n(Figure 10E and G). The increase in ORF4 promoter activity in\n\nundifferentiated cells and not in the calcium treated cells as well as\n\nthe increase in the late viral promoter activity and viral early and\n\nlate gene products in the calcium differentiated cells suggests that\n\nthere was a relative block to viral replication which was overcome\n\nby keratinocyte differentiation.\n\nTo investigate if the expression of the VZV proteins is affected\n\nby differentiation in the epidermis, skin organ cultures were\n\nintradermally injected with VZV to model skin infection and\n\nstained for IE and late proteins 3 days post infection (Figure 10H).\n\nAlthough epidermal infection throughout the section was evident,\n\nthe explant model did not demonstrate epidermal blistering unlike\n\nthe in vivo archival specimens (Figure 6B–G). VZV IE63 staining\n\nwas found predominantly in the nuclei throughout the epidermis\n\nand the expression of late viral glycoprotein gE was largely\n\ncytoplasmic with increased expression of gE seen in the uppermost\n\nlayers of the epidermis. Together with the observed differential\n\ngene expression as keratinocytes differentiate under calcium, these\n\nresults indicate that VZV gene expression is tied to regulated\n\nkeratinocyte differentiation, with a switch from more efficient early\n\ngene expression at the undifferentiated stage to late gene\n\nexpression as differentiation ensues.\n\nDiscussion\n\nKeratinocytes, the predominant cell type found in the\n\nepidermis, are a major target of VZV replication in skin. The\n\ncalcium switch method delivered a dynamic model of epidermal\n\ndifferentiation which can be manipulated to allow investigation of\n\nviral and host interactions during synchronized keratinocyte\n\ndifferentiation without the presence of other cell types.\n\nA number of alternative systems have been described to\n\ninvestigate the biology of skin, including 3D raft cultures and\n\nexplants [20], [28]. A further model, using SCID-hu mice, has\n\npreviously been successfully used to study the infection dynamics\n\nof VZV in vivo [13]. Both the 3D raft cultures and the explants\n\nshow a greater degree of differentiation, formation and definition\n\nof the structural layers characteristic of skin in contrast to the\n\ncalcium shift model utilised in this study. Furthermore, the explant\n\nsystem also contains the presence of specialised structures, such as\n\nthe sebaceous glands and hair follicles that are absent from raft\n\ncultures and the monolayer system. However neither the explant\n\nnor the SCID-hu mouse model was suitable for this study as\n\nneither system can be manipulated experimentally to allow the\n\neffects of differentiation on VZV gene expression to be examined.\n\nIn contrast, the development of 3D organotypic rafts whilst\n\noffering a valid alternative model to allow investigation into the\n\neffects of virus infection on cellular differentiation and vice versa\n\nwas not found to be reliable enough, particularly in the presence of\n\nvirus, for use in the RNA-seq part of our study.\n\nThe model has certain disadvantages e.g. the genes associated\n\nwith the stratum lucidum and stratum corneum are not expressed.\n\nThe titre of virus produced in primary keratinocytes is at least 2\n\nlogs lower than is seen in MeWo cells and remains highly cell\n\nassociated as we saw in our EM images. Thus although we were\n\nable to show that calcium induced increases in gene expression\n\nand viral genome replication, these were not associated with an\n\nincrease in the formation of infectious particles. Nonetheless, our\n\ndata clearly demonstrate that, in common with the archetypal\n\nalphaherpesvirus HSV-1 [29] and previous observations [10,20],\n\nVZV appears to preferentially infect undifferentiated keratino-\n\ncytes. In epithelia, undifferentiated keratinocytes are localised to\n\nthe stem-cell rich basal layer of the epidermis and adnexal\n\nstructures. Our findings are consistent with histological evidence of\n\nearly Herpes Zoster lesions that shows VZV infecting the stem-cell\n\nrich isthmus region of the hair follicle [30], following reactivation\n\nfrom latency and prior to the onset of the epidermal infection or\n\ndistinctive cutaneous rash. By adding calcium to VZV infected\n\nundifferentiated keratinocytes our model therefore mimics the\n\nlikely sequence of events in the skin, with infection of less\n\ndifferentiated basal cells followed by differentiation of infected\n\ncells. The fact that VZV spreads more easily in undifferentiated\n\ncells fits with the model of cell associated virus inhabiting basal\n\nepidermal layers while cell free virus in the upper epidermis is\n\nnecessary for transmitted infection [31]. Virus adapted for cell to\n\ncell spread in the basal epithelium has been shown to differ from\n\ncell-free virus. For example, VZV can spread efficiently cell to cell\n\nin MeWo monolayers despite low levels of envelope glycoprotein\n\nC [32] a protein that is necessary for the formation of cell free\n\nFigure 9.

The top three panels represent KCV1–3 samples and the lower 5 samples are KV1–5. A schematic representation of the VZV open\nreading frames is shown below. Each coverage plot uses an identical log scale, illustrating the higher degree of coverage in the KCV samples. Regions\nwith zero coverage are shaded grey. B) RPKM values for each of the VZV ORFs across the infected samples. The RPKM values are normalised relative\nto the sum of human and viral reads per sample. The pattern of expression is similar across all samples with RPKM values for each ORF being greater\nthan 1 in every sample. RPKM values for the KCV samples are less variable than those for the KV samples with a median 9-fold upregulation per ORF\n(KCV/KV, range 4–15 fold upregulation, all ORFs significantly upregulated with pFDRs,0.01). RPKM values for KV1 are noticeably lower than all other\nsamples. At day 5 p.i., 48 hrs after the addition of calcium, the levels of three VZV genes were determined by qPCR and normalised to the\nhousekeeping gene RN5S, no amplification was seen in the mock infected controls (data not shown). The upregulation of KRT10 in the uninfected\ncontrols was used as a marker to ensure that the addition of calcium had caused keratinocyte differentiation (data not shown). The expression of (C)\nORF63 (IE) ORF29 (early) and ORF14 (late) genes was determined (n = 3) and plotted. Expression of ORF29 (D) and ORF14 (E) was significantly\nincreased after the addition of calcium, *p,0.05 by Student’s t-test.

This fits with our results\n\nshowing increased late viral protein expression in the suprabasal\n\nlayers where assembly of cell free virus occurs [31]. One model to\n\nexplain our results may therefore be that the generalised increase\n\nin viral gene and protein expression seen with keratinocyte\n\ndifferentiation is directed to maturation of cell-free virions from\n\nthe immature viral particles formed in the basal layers, rather than\n\na large increase in numbers of virions. Over time, as keratinocyte\n\nmaturation continues, high titers of cell-free virions accumulate in\n\nthe growing blister.\n\nThe blister lesions formed in VZV infections are by and large\n\ndiscrete, although coalescence of mature lesions may occur. While\n\nproduction of interferon by bystander cells has been shown to limit\n\nviral spread in the skin [34] it is also possible that cell-to-cell spread\n\nis limited by the physical barriers associated with keratinocyte\n\ndifferentiation, thus explaining the reduced spread of virus\n\nobserved in differentiated cells. Alternatively, differentiation may\n\nresult in the loss of a cellular receptor rendering keratinocytes less\n\npermissive to VZV infection. Of the three known putative cellular\n\nreceptors for VZV, mannose 6 phosphate receptor, reported to be\n\ncritical for the accumulation of cell free virus in vesicles and\n\nHeparan sulphate are expressed only in basal layers and the\n\nexpression of both are lost as keratinocytes differentiate [31] [35].\n\nBoth are therefore candidates for viral spread in less differentiated\n\nbut not differentiated cells. In contrast, expression of the third\n\nputative receptor, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), increases as\n\nkeratinocytes differentiate (Jones M. unpublished data).\n\nNotwithstanding the reduced cell-to-cell spread in differentiated\n\nkeratinocytes, our analysis revealed a quantitative increase in viral\n\ngene and viral DNA expression after calcium induced differenti-\n\nation and by manipulation of the NOTCH pathway as well as by\n\ncalcium and contact induced differentiation we were able to show\n\nthat this was dependent on differentiation and not just the addition\n\nof calcium to our cells. As previously outlined, these results are not\n\nnecessarily contradictory but are consistent with a model by which\n\nthe virus is able to enter and spread in undifferentiated\n\nkeratinocytes, but once infected, optimal replication and produc-\n\ntion of mature virions requires the presence or loss of cellular\n\nfactors present as cells differentiate. Although VZV does not\n\npersist in the skin, it shows a pattern common to other skin tropic\n\nviruses. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) which maintains its genome\n\nas a stable episome in basal cells until differentiation of the host cell\n\noccurs [36] and the gamma-herpesviruses Kaposi Sarcoma\n\nHerpesvirus (KSHV), whose lytic cycle is also known to be\n\nactivated by keratinocyte differentiation [37].\n\nIn our model, expression of all VZV ORFs was evident in both\n\nuntreated and calcium treated keratinocyte samples, confirming\n\nthat VZV undergoes full lytic infection in both conditions.\n\nHowever, the distinct differences in the pattern of expression\n\nwere clearly apparent, with relatively more immediate early genes\n\n(ORFs 4, 62 and 63) in the undifferentiated cells and relatively\n\nmore late genes (e.g. viral glycoproteins) expressed in the\n\nkeratinocytes that had undergone synchronized differentiation.\n\nThe apparent association of each condition with IE or late viral\n\ngene expression suggests that the state of the host cell may impact\n\non the regulation of the molecular switch controlling the classical\n\ntemporal pattern of herpesvirus gene expression. Though not\n\ndefinitive proof, this hypothesis is supported by our observations.\n\nFirst, the expression of the VZV promoters in the recombinant\n\nviruses clearly establishes differential activity of the reporters in\n\nresponse to calcium induced keratinocyte differentiation. This\n\nblock in production of early and late viral proteins in undifferen-\n\ntiated keratinocytes is consistent with a requirement for cellular\n\nfactors present in differentiated cells to regulate the switch to\n\nearly/late gene expression. Secondly, the expression of gC, which\n\nis essential for viral replication in skin [13], was significantly\n\ngreater in the calcium switched cells. This result corroborates\n\nprevious work where increased gC expression was observed in\n\nMeWo cells treated with hexamethyl bisacetamide (HMBA), a\n\nknown inducer of cellular differentiation [32]. Finally, using\n\nimmunohistochemistry we were also able to show that another late\n\nprotein, gE, was more highly expressed in the upper layers of the\n\nepidermis in explants.\n\nOf interest, several VZV ORFs which, based on their HSV-1\n\northologues are presumed to be late genes, were more highly\n\nexpressed in the undifferentiated cells. These include ORFs 17\n\n(virion host shutoff), 64 (tegument US10), 46 (tegument UL14), 27\n\n(nuclear phosphoprotein UL31), 60 (gL) and 23 (capsid). Further\n\nwork is required to determine whether these findings reflect true\n\ndifferences in VZV temporal gene expression or whether they are\n\nindicative of keratinocyte specific differences in the gene expres-\n\nsion patterns.\n\nAnalysis of the host transcriptome confirmed VZV does not\n\ndrive keratinocyte differentiation. Instead the virus clearly alters\n\nthe normal pattern of gene expression associated with differenti-\n\nation, generating a signature associated with skin blistering, which\n\nitself is a characteristic feature of VZV disease. VZV downreg-\n\nulated or prevented the expression of the suprabasal genes, KRT1\n\nand KRT10, but was not shown to alter the expression of other\n\ndifferentiation markers such as involucrin. KRT1 and KRT10 are\n\nknown to play a role in maintaining the integrity of the epidermis\n\nand are mutated in other blistering diseases such as epidermolytic\n\nichthyosis [38]. KRT10 has also been shown to inhibit prolifer-\n\nation and cell cycle progression of basal keratinocytes [39,40] and\n\nits loss is also associated with increased cell turnover [41].\n\nHowever, through its interactions with desmosomes, KRT1/10\n\nform a dynamic scaffold in the cell and play an important role in\n\nmaintaining epithelial structure [42]. Autoantibodies to desmo-\n\nsomal proteins, DSG1 and DSC1 proteins are a hallmark of\n\nblistering skin conditions including pemphigus foliaceus and IgA\n\nwith the exception of KV2 and KV5 which cluster alongside the calcium-shifted KC samples suggesting these 2 samples had undergone spontaneous\ncontact-induced differentiation. C) Primary keratinocytes were infected VZV at an mo.i. of 0.2 and treated with either DAPT [1 mM] or Jagged-1\n[50 mM] and harvested for analysis by immunoblotting 48 hrs later. Jagged-1 treatment caused an increase and DAPT treatment showed a decrease\nin Notch 1 expression respectively as seen in the uninfected keratinocytes. Treatment of VZV infected cells with jagged-1 increased gE expression and\nDAPT treatment decreased gE expression relative to the untreated VZV infected keratinocytes, the changes in gE were quantified using ImageJ and\nthe numbers below represent the gE expression relative to the untreated VZV infected keratinocytes. Primary keratinocytes were infected with VZV at\nday 0 with an m.o.i. of 0.2. At day 3 half of the samples were switched to a high calcium media. Duplicate samples were taken every 24 hrs to measure\nluciferase and/or renilla. Three different recombinant viruses were used D) VZVLUC under the control of an IE promoter (ORF4), E) ORF14Luc and F–G)\nORF63LucORF9Renilla. The average relative luciferase/renilla units RLU/RRU for each virus is plotted 6 stdev. H) Skin explants were injected into the\ndermis with cell associated VZV (1250 PFU), placed on grids, and harvested at 3 days post infection, fixed and embedded in paraffin. Sections were\nstained with antibodies against the immediate early viral marker, IE63, and the late marker glycoprotein E (gE). Staining was developed with the\nchromogen VIP. No staining was seen in the uninfected controls (data not shown). Although epidermal infection was evident, this model did not\ndemonstrate epidermal blistering. VZV staining is present throughout the epidermis and the expression gE was more apparent in the higher layers of\nthe epidermis.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003896.g010\n\nVZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene Expression\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 16 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896\n\n\n\npemphigus [43]. As a group, the desmosomal genes, especially\n\nDSG1 and DSC1 were identified as being significantly altered by\n\nVZV infection while other junctional proteins were unaltered.\n\nThese findings support the notion that the interaction of VZV with\n\nkeratinocytes drives the pathognomonic blistering phenotype. The\n\naccompanying upregulation of the serine proteases by VZV may\n\ncontribute to the observed reduction of DSG1 protein as well as\n\ninducing a desquamative phenotype, which may promote the\n\ndissemination of the virus.\n\nAn unusual finding which is not typical of blistering disorders\n\nwas the upregulation of the mucosal cytokeratins 4 and 13, a\n\nphenotype previously observed in keratinocytes with impaired\n\nSMAD 2, 4 and 7 signalling [44]. Jones et al. previously observed\n\nsuch changes in the TGF beta pathway in a VZV infected SCID-\n\nhu mouse model [45]. Although we observe the same gene pattern\n\nchanges as Buschke et al. in that we observed downregulation of\n\nKRT1/10/DSG1 and upregulation of KRT4/13, we did not find\n\na significant enrichment of the TGF-beta pathway as a whole. It is\n\npossible that our transcriptome analysis, which was a single\n\nsnapshot late on in VZV infection, failed to detect early signalling\n\nchanges responsible for KRT4/13 changes. Alternatively, VZV\n\nmay act via different pathways in this system.\n\nOther observed changes in cytokeratin expression which do not\n\nusually form part of a blistering signature include the upregulation\n\nof KRT15 and KRT19 which are associated with stem cells in\n\nadnexal skin compartments, a region which histologically is\n\npositive for VZV early on in infection. KRT15 is also associated\n\nwith wound healing, but other markers of keratinocyte activation\n\nin wound healing (e.g. KRT6, 16 and 17) [46] were unaltered in\n\nour transcriptome data.\n\nIn summary, we have shown by combined analysis of host and\n\npathogen gene expression at a single time point that VZV gene\n\nexpression is linked to keratinocyte differentiation. VZV replica-\n\ntion, in turn, alters the structure of stratified squamous epithelium,\n\ndriving a blistering, desquamative phenotype to form the typical\n\nskin vesicles, which are essential to VZV pathogenesis. The major\n\nfunctional groups studied in the manuscript i.e. the alterations\n\naffecting cytokeratins, desmosomes and proteases, are controlled\n\nby a number of regulatory pathways and further work is underway\n\nto untangle the complex molecular interactions between VZV and\n\nkeratinocyte differentiation. While the data presented here are\n\nonly a snapshot of this complex process, they provide a roadmap\n\nfor further exploration of how VZV interacts with a target cell\n\ncentral to its pathogenesis.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics statement\nHuman skin from cosmetic reductive surgery was obtained with\n\nwritten informed consent under the approval of the East Central\n\nLondon Research Ethics Committee 1 (10/H0121/39).\n\nCells\nNeonatal primary human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn, Life\n\ntechnologies, Paisley, UK) were cultured on mouse collagen IV\n\n(0.67 mg/cm2 BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK) coated surfaces in\nkeratinocyte defined media containing epithelial growth factor\n\n(KDM and EpiLife, Life technologies).

Mock-injected segments\nwere cultured in parallel as a control. Skin samples were fixed in\n\n4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin.\n\nViruses\nInfections for transcriptome experiments were carried out using\n\npOka and validation experiments were carried out using a strain\n\nnamed THA, a low passage clade 3 clinical isolate. The VZV\n\nORF23 GFP, expressing an N terminal tag to the capsid OR23\n\nprotein, has been detailed previously [47]. A recombinant VZV\n\nexpressing luciferase (VZVLUC) driven by ORF4 promoter was\n\ndeveloped by cloning the ORF4 promoter upstream of the\n\nluciferase gene in the vector PGL3 (Promega Corp), followed by\n\nPCR amplification of the entire cassette and cloning into the pOka\n\nbased cosmid pspe23 at the unique AvrII site located between\n\nOR65 and 66. This was then developed into recombinant VZV\n\nwith additional pOka cosmids as described previously [48]. The\n\nORF14-luciferase virus reports luciferase as a T2A directed\n\nribosome skipping motif fusion protein. Luciferase was amplified\n\nby PCR from the plasmid pGL3basic (Promega Corp) using the\n\nprimers 59 GAGGGATCCGGTTCCGGAGAGGGCAGAGGA\n\nAGTCTGCTAACATGCGGTGACGTCGAGGAGAATCCTG-\n\nGCCCAATGGAAGACGCC AAAAACATA-39 and 59 AATTC-\n\nGAATTCGCGCGCAGATCTTTACACGGCGATCTTTCCG-\n\nCCCTTCTTGGC-39. The resulting fragment was digested with\n\nEcoRI and BamHI and cloned into the vector pmCherryC1 cut\n\nwith EcoRI and BglII (underlined in primers), resulting in plasmid\n\npmCherryT2Aluc which contained mCherry fused in frame to\n\nluciferase, separated by the T2A 22 amino acid ribosome skipping\n\nmotif. The expression of functional luciferase (containing a single\n\nresidue added to the amnio terminal end) and mCherry (with a 21\n\namino acid T2A C terminal addition) were confirmed in plasmid\n\ntransfected HEK293T cells (data not shown). The plasmid was cut\n\nwith EcoRI and BglII (both sites downstream from the T2A\n\nluciferase gene) and a zeomycin resistance cassette was inserted\n\nfollowing its generation by PCR with primers to add bglII and\n\nEcoRI flanking sequences (underlined in the following primers 59\n\nAGATCTAGATCTCGAGTAATGGAACGGACCG TGTTG-\n\nA C-39 and 59 – GCTGAC GTCGACGAATTCTGATCACT-\n\nCAAGTTTCGAGGTCGAGGTG 39). The resulting plasmid\n\nwas used as the template for the PCR amplification of the entire\n\nT2A-Luciferase-Zeo cassette using primers with 40 bp flanking\n\nhomology arms to allow recombination into ORF14 in the pOka\n\nBAC, so it was an in frame fusion with the terminal residue of gC\n\n(ORF14): using the primers gClucF2 59 CTTATCGCAGTTATC\n\nGCAACCCTATGCATCCGTTGCTGTTCAATGGACGAGC-\n\nTGTACAAG-39 and gClucR2 59 ATAAAATGATATACAC-\n\nAGACGCGTTTGGTTGGTTTCTGTCTCGAGTATGATCA-\n\nG TTATC 39.

The virus\n\nderived from the BAC contained deletion of ORF71, a fusion of\n\nORF63 to T2A luciferase and a fusion of ORF9 to Renilla.\n\nVZV growth and infections\nAll viruses were cultured and used at less than 20 passages.\n\nInfected cell preparations were first treated with mitomycin C\n\n(0.05 mg/ml for 3 hrs) prior to freezing and subsequently titered\n\non Mewo cells; we routinely achieved viral titres of greater than\n\n16106 pfu/ml. Cell-free VZV was generated by a rapid freeze\n(liquid N2) and thaw (37uC), followed by removal of cellular debris\nby low speed centrifugation. In comparison to the cell-associated\n\nVZV, titres for cell-free virus were reduced by 1–3 logs and we\n\nachieved titres of approximately 16104 pfu/ml. For UV inacti-\nvated VZV, cell-free VZV supernatants were treated for 20 min at\n\n150,000 J/Cm\n2\n\nusing a Stratalinker UV Crosslinker (Stratagene).\n\nFor the transcriptome and subsequent confirmatory experiments,\n\n36104 HEKn cells per well of a 6 well dish were plated out at day\n0 and left for 48 hrs, one well was then used to calculate the cell\n\ndensity and other wells were then inoculated with cell-free virus at\n\nan m.o.i of 0.2 as calculated by viral titration on Mewo cells.

Paired end reads were mapped to host\n\nand viral genomes (Homo sapiens (release 37) reference sequence\n\n(GRCh37/hg19); pOka sequence (pOka, GenBank reference\n\nAB097933)) using BowTie [53], TopHat [54], SAMtools [55].\n\nDuplicate reads were then removed using PicardTools (http://\n\npicard.sourceforge.net) and read counts per gene generated using\n\nVZV Infection Alters Keratinocyte Gene Expression\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 18 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1003896\n\n\n\nHTSeq-count (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq).\n\nR/BioConductor [56] were used to import the mapped count\n\ndata and the edgeR package used to normalise the data and\n\ngenerate lists of differentially expressed genes. Specifically, a\n\nfiltering step was applied remove low expression genes with\n\nfewer than 1 count per million (CPM) in at least 3 samples.\n\nCounts were then normalised using a trimmed mean of M-\n\nvalues [57] and fitted to a negative binomial generalised log-\n\nlinear model (GLM), using empirical Bayes tagwise dispersions\n\nto estimate the dispersion parameter for each gene [58].\n\nDifferentially expressed genes were identified using GLM\n\nlikelihood ratio tests applying a FDR significance cut-off of\n\n0.01, unless otherwise stated. The gplots R library was used to\n\nconstruct heatmaps (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/\n\ngplots/index.html). Functional classification of genes was\n\nperformed using the DAVID online database (http://david.\n\nabcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp) [16]. Gene expression heatmaps were\n\ngenerated using the MEV software suite [59], [60] (http://www.\n\ntm4.org/mev.html). Integrative Genomic Viewer (IGV) was used\n\nto produce viral genome coverage plots [61]. The Venn\n\ndiagram in figure 2B was generated using the online tool\n\nVENNY (http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html).\n\nReal-time semi-quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR\n3 mg of total RNA was DNaseI treated before being reverse\n\ntranscribed using MMLV reverse transciptase and random\n\nhexamer primers (Promega, Southhampton, UK). qPCR was\n\nperformed using a Rotorgene 3000 cycler (Qiagen, Manchester,\n\nUK) using 500 ng cDNA, specific primers [0.4 mM] (Text S1) and\nSYBR green master mix (Qiagen). Each gene was normalised to a\n\nhousekeeping gene (GAPDH or RN5S) and relative expression\n\nshown as 2\n2DDCt\n\n[62].\n\nFlow cytometry\nHEKn were fixed in 4% PFA, blocked in 10% Goat serum,\n\nwashed in permeabilisation buffer (eBiosciences, Hatfield, UK)\n\nand incubated with the anti-VZV-FITC (Millipore, Watford, UK)\n\nfor 30 min in the dark. Cells were subsequently washed in\n\npermeabilisation buffer, resuspended in PBS, processed by FACS\n\nCalibur and analysed using FloJo (v7.6.5).\n\nWestern blotting\nCell pellets were lysed in whole cell lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES\n\nKOH (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, 2%w/v NP40, 0.5%w/v NaDeox-\n\nycholate, 0.2%w/v SDS, 1 mM NaOrthovanadate, 1 mM EGTA\n\npH 7, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitor cocktail\n\n(Sigma-Aldrich). Protein concentration was determined by BCA\n\nAssay (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). Samples\n\nwere added to 46 Gel loading buffer (Life Technologies), DTT\n(0.083M), heated to 70uC for 5 min. Secreted proteins were\nconcentrated from supernatents using Amicon Ultra 10K filters\n\n(Millipore) and equal volume of concentrated supernatents were\n\nadded to 2XSDS loading buffer, heated to 95uC for 5 min.\nSamples were resolved on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Life technologies,\n\nPaisley, UK) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and\n\nblocked in 5% PVP, 0.5% FBS. Membranes were incubated with\n\nantibodies (Text S2) and detected by ECL plus (GE, Buckingham-\n\nshire, UK).\n\nImmunofluorescence\nHEKn grown on coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA for 20 min at\n\nRT before being washed in PBS, incubated in NH4Cl [10 mM]\n\nfor 10 min before being permeabilised with 0.05% (w/v) Triton\n\nX-100 on ice for 5 min. Cells were blocked with 3% BSA and\n\nincubated with the primary antibody (1:100) (Text S2) for 1 hr,\n\nfollowed by the Alexa Fluor secondary antibody (Life Technolo-\n\ngies) (1:1000) for 1 hr. Cells were mounted in Prolong gold (Life\n\nTechnologies) and visualized on a Zeiss Axiovision. Images were\n\nanalysed using AxioVision Rel. 4.8 and ImageJ. Statistical analyses\n\nwere performed using Prism (GraphPad Software).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\n5 mM paraffin-embedded sections were processed using con-\n\nventional techniques. Antigen retrieval was performed by heat-\n\ntreatment of deparaffinised sections in 10 mM citrate buffer\n\npH 6.0. Sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxidase and\n\nbiotin blocked (Vector Laboratories, Peterborough, UK) prior to\n\nonset of immunostaining. VZV antigen was amplified using\n\nUniversal Elite ABC kit in conjunction with M.O.M Biotinylated\n\nAnti-Mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) and visualised using\n\nfluorophore tyramide amplification reagent (Perkin Elmer Life\n\nSciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Nuclear staining was visualised\n\nby staining with Hoechst 33342 (Life technologies). Sections were\n\nmounted in Immunomount (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Loughbor-\n\nough, UK) and images were captured using a Leica epifluores-\n\ncence microscope.\n\nElectron microscopy\nCells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 200 mM sodium\n\ncacodylate buffer for 30 min, washed in buffer and secondarily\n\nfixed in reduced 1% osmium tetroxide, 1.5% potassium ferricy-\n\nanide for 60 min, washed in water and stained overnight in 0.5%\n\nMg Uranyl acetate. The samples were then embedded flat in the\n\ndish in Epon resin. Ultrathin sections (typically 50–70 nm) were\n\ncut parallel to the dish stained with Reynold’s lead citrate and\n\nexamined in a FEI Tecnai electron microscope with CCD camera\n\nimage acquisition.\n\nPlaque assays\nPlates were fixed at time points post infection with 4%\n\nparaformaldehyde and stained by immunohistochemistry using a\n\nmixed VZV mAb (Meridian Life Sciences, Memphis, US),\n\nfollowed by and biotin (Vector labs, Peterborough, UK)\n\nstreptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, PA, US) amplification.\n\nPlaques were visualised using Fast Red TR salt (Sigma, Dorset,\n\nUK) and images of stained plaques were digitally captured and\n\ncounted using the ViruSpot Reader (AID GmbH).\n\nLuciferase assay\nKeratinocytes infected with VZVLuc were lysed and processed\n\nfor luciferase activity using the luciferase or dual-luciferase\n\nreporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s\n\nprotocol.\n\nViral DNA extractions\nvDNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy blood and tissue\n\nkit and vDNA copy number was determined by real time PCR for\n\nthe VZV ORF29 gene, normalized to KRAS (Text S1) using a\n\nstandard curve.\n\nAccession numbers for human and VZV genes\nCellular gene name (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot).

Primary human keratinocytes\ngrown either in low calcium [0.6 mM] or high calcium [1.2 mM]\n\ncultures were processed for total RNA and protein extraction. The\n\nincrease of CaCl2 concentration to 1.2 mM initiated cellular\n\ndifferentiation of human keratinocytes beginning at 24 hrs, as\n\ndetected by qPCR for (A) KRT15, a basal layer gene which was\ndownregulated by the addition of calcium whilst KRT10 and IVL,\n\n(B–C) markers of differentiation expressed in the suprabasal layer\nand granular layer respectively were increased by calcium. P-\n\nvalues less than 0.05 (**) or less than (*) by Student’s t-test are\n\nshown. Expression of all three genes were normalised to the\n\nhousekeeping gene GAPDH. D) Immune blotting for protein\nlevels for the suprabasal cytokeratin marker (KRT10) and the\n\ngranular layer protein IVL shows that the addition of calcium\n\nupregulates the expression of both these markers of differentiation\n\nat 48 hrs after the switch to a high calcium concentration in\n\ncomparison to the samples maintained at a low calcium\n\nconcentration [0.6 mM]. GAPDH was used as a loading control.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S2 Analysis of VZV infection in keratinocytes by\nflow cytometry.
