Wetzler1\n\nEvans BioMedical Research Center, Section of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Boston University School of\nMedicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02118,1 and Sol Sherry Thrombosis Research Center, School of Medicine,\n\nTemple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 191402\n\nReceived 10 February 2009/Returned for modification 26 March 2009/Accepted 8 December 2009\n\nMeningococcal porin PorB is an inhibitor of apoptosis induced via the intrinsic pathway in various cell types.\nThis effect is attributed to prevention of mitochondrial depolarization and of subsequent release of proapop-\ntotic mitochondrial factors. To determine whether apoptosis is globally inhibited by PorB, we compared the\nintrinsic and extrinsic pathways in HeLa cells. Interestingly, PorB does not prevent extrinsic apoptosis induced\nby tumor necrosis factor alpha plus cycloheximide, suggesting a unique mitochondrial pathway specificity.\nSeveral intracellular factors regulated by NF-�B, including members of the Bcl-2 family and of the inhibitor\nof apoptosis (IAP) family, play major roles in controlling apoptosis, and some of them are thought to contribute\nto the antiapoptotic effect of the gonococcal porin, PIB. However, most of the members of the Bcl-2 family and\nthe IAP family are not induced by meningococcal PorB in HeLa cells, with the exception of Bfl-1/A1. Inter-\nestingly, PorB does not induce NF-�B activation in HeLa cells, likely due to a lack of Toll-like receptor 2\n(TLR2) expression in these cells. Bfl-1/A1 expression is also regulated by CBF1, a nuclear component of the\nNotch signaling pathway, independent of NF-�B activation. Since HeLa cells are protected by PorB from\nintrinsic apoptosis events, regardless of TLR2 and NF-�B expression, the possibility of a contribution of\nalternative signaling pathways to this effect cannot be excluded. In this paper, we describe an initial dissection\nof the cascade of cellular events involved in the antiapoptotic effect of PorB in the absence of TLR2.\n\nApoptosis, or programmed cell death, is characterized by\nmorphological events, including membrane blebbing and nu-\nclear and chromatin condensation, and by intracellular events,\nsuch as activation of cytosolic proteins and DNA degradation\n(26). A variety of different intracellular stress signals can trig-\nger apoptosis, including bacterial infections, excessive calcium,\nchemical substances, DNA-damaging agents (intrinsic or mi-\ntochondrial pathway), and cell surface death receptor activa-\ntion (extrinsic pathway). Both pathways are divided into three\nbasic phases: (i) initiation, (ii) commitment, and (iii) execu-\ntion, ending with cell death (71).\n\nSeveral intracellular protein families, such as the Bcl-2 fam-\nily (40), caspases (8), and the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs)\n(16), play important roles in controlling apoptosis. Bcl-2 pro-\nteins have a dual role; they trigger apoptosis (Bax, Bak, and\nBid [1]) or block it (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 [39]).\nProapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can induce release of mitochon-\ndrial factors, including cytochrome c (36), apoptosis-inducing\nfactor (AIF) (70), and Smac/DIABLO (18), in both a mito-\nchondrial membrane potential-dependent manner and a mito-\nchondrial membrane potential-independent manner (2, 25,\n74). These events lead to activation of caspase 9 and 6 (intrin-\nsic pathway) and subsequent DNA degradation. Alternatively,\nproapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins can also directly activate caspase 8\n(extrinsic pathway) (1, 68), but the two pathways converge at a\ndownstream event, caspase 3 activation (24). Antiapoptotic\n\nBcl-2 proteins act mostly by modulating mitochondrial func-\ntions directly by interacting with mitochondrial components of\nthe permeability transition pore or indirectly by neutralizing\nproapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (7, 69, 72). IAPs are a family of\nproteins that directly inhibit caspase activation (16, 32) and,\nsimilar to Bcl-2 proteins, are also regulated by NF-�B (9).\n\nModulation of apoptosis by several intracellular and extra-\ncellular bacteria, mostly to avoid normal host defense re-\nsponses, has been described previously. Many bacteria induce\nand/or prevent apoptosis, depending on the host cell type,\ngrowth conditions, or bacterial life cycle. Some examples of\nbacteria that inhibit apoptosis are Chlamydia (20, 22, 79), Shi-\ngella flexneri (11), Brucella (28), Porphyromonas gingivalis (56,\n58), Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (4, 23, 31,\n42, 50, 55, 62, 65, 73). Our group and other workers have\nreported that live N. meningitidis and purified meningococcal\nporin inhibit apoptosis (15, 49, 50, 62, 75), potentially via\nmultiple mechanisms. While meningococcal infection induces\nNF-�B-mediated upregulation of antiapoptotic genes, purified\nPorB and PorB from live bacteria directly interact with mito-\nchondria and modulate their membrane potential, preventing\nrelease of cytochrome c. N. gonorrhoeae and purified gonococ-\ncal porin PIB induce NF-�B-mediated upregulation of anti-\napoptotic genes (4, 5, 23, 33, 55, 65), which could also contrib-\nute to prevention of apoptosis.\n\nA correlation between the antiapoptotic effect of PorB and\nactivation of NF-�B has not been shown so far, although our\ngroup has demonstrated that PorB activates NF-�B in a Toll-\nlike receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent manner (43, 46, 48, 52).\nInterestingly, various human and murine cell types are pro-\ntected from apoptosis by PorB (23. 49, 50, 51) regardless of\nTLR2 expression.

HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified\nEagle medium (Cellgro, Mediatech) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM\nL-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 �g/ml streptomycin. Meningococcal\nPorB was purified by column chromatography as previously described (51) and,\nfor some experiments, was labeled with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen) as previ-\nously described (52). Staurosporine (STS), recombinant human tumor necrosis\nfactor alpha (TNF-�), cycloheximide (chx), propidium iodide (PI) (Sigma), rho-\ndamine 123 (rh123) (Invitrogen), and parthenolide (PA) (EMD Biosciences)\nwere used as described below.\n\nInduction of apoptosis and flow cytometry. Apoptosis was induced by incu-\nbating HeLa cells (105 cells/ml) with 1 �M staurosporine or with 20 ng/ml TNF-�\nplus 10 �g/ml of cycloheximide for 24 h. The mitochondrial membrane potential\nwas measured by flow cytometry using cells stained with 1 �M rhodamine 123, as\npreviously described (49). DNA degradation was determined by propidium io-\ndide staining of permeabilized cells, also as previously described (49). Cells were\nanalyzed by flow cytometry with a FACScan flow cytometer using CellQuest\nacquisition and analysis software (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA). Gat-\ning was used to exclude cellular debris. Individual experiments were repeated at\nleast five times. Anti-TLR2 fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled antibody\n(eBioscience) was used for flow cytometry detection of surface expression of\nTLR2 on HeLa cells.\n\nCell activation assays. HeLa cells were treated with purified PorB (10 �g/ml\nor 50 �g/ml) or with TNF-� (20 ng/ml) for various periods of time, as described\nbelow. NF-�B inhibition studies were performed by adding parthenolide (10\n�M) (79) at 2 h prior to stimulation. The inhibitor concentration was determined\nexperimentally as the concentration at which NF-�B was inhibited without in-\nduction of cell toxicity (using phase-contrast microscopy to examine cell mor-\nphology). In some assays, cells were also treated with Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml) or\nheat-killed N. meningitidis at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50.\n\nSubcellular fractionation. Mitochondrial fractions were prepared as previ-\nously described (49). For Golgi membrane fractions, the cells were lysed in 200\nmM sucrose, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.2), homogenized, mixed with 62% sucrose (final\nsucrose concentration, 37.5%), and overlaid with 2 ml of 35% sucrose and 1 ml\nof 29% sucrose in an SW55 centrifuge tube. After 90 min of centrifugation at\n50,000 rpm, Golgi membranes were harvested at the interface between 29%\nsucrose and 35% sucrose (41). Late and early endosome fractions were obtained\nusing a sucrose step gradient as described previously (54). For nuclear and\ncytosolic fractionation, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer B (10 mM HEPES\n[pH 7.5], 10 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM\ndithiothreitol, 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, protease inhibitor cocktail) for 30\nmin and then centrifuged at 800 � g for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were\ndesignated cytosolic fraction and stored. The nuclear pellets were washed once\nwith lysis buffer C (lysis buffer B containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40), designated the\nnuclear fraction, and stored. The total protein concentration of the cell fractions\nwas determined by using the Bio-Rad protein concentration assay (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA). Whole-cell lysates were prepared by resuspending cells in lysis\nbuffer A (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween 20).\n\nWestern blotting. For evaluation of intracellular proteins, equal amounts of\nproteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, which was followed by Western blotting.\nThe blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6)\ncontaining 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin\nin TBS-T overnight at 4°C with the following antibodies: anti-PorB rabbit serum\n(49), anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12; Pharmingen), anti-Golgin, anti-Rab4\n(early endosome marker), anti-KDEL (late endosomes marker), anti-pro-\ncaspase 3, anti-pro-caspase 7, anti-Bcl-xL, anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, anti-AIF, and\nanti-p65/RelA (Stressgen); anti-Bfl-1 (Abcam); anti-Bid (Biosource); and anti-\ncIAP-2, anti-HSP70, anti-c-Rel, anti-Rel-B, anti-p100/p52, anti-p105/p50, anti-\nI�B�, and anti-H3 (Cell Signaling). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse\nor anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were used, and the immunoreactive bands\nwere detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham).\n\nFluorescence microscopy. HeLa cells (104 cells/ml) were plated in complete\nmedium on glass coverslips placed into six-well plates, allowed to adhere, and\nincubated at 37°C for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h with 10 �g/ml of PorB labeled with Alexa\nFluor 594. The cells were then washed five times, fixed with 3.7% paraformal-\ndehyde in warm medium for 15 min at 37°C, washed again, and permeabilized\n\nwith 100% ice-cold acetone for 5 min. After further washing, the cells were\nincubated with anti-cytochrome monoclonal antibody (1:1,000) for 30 min at\nroom temperature and then with anti-mouse FITC-labeled secondary antibody\n(1:5,000; Sigma). Following a final wash, the coverslips were mounted on glass\nslides with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame,\nCA) and stored in the dark at 4°C. The slides were examined by fluorescence\nmicroscopy using an Olympus BX41 fluorescent microscope attached to com-\nputerized imaging equipment, and the images were processed with Olympus DP\nController software.\n\nNF-�B luciferase reporter assay. HeLa cells (105 cells/ml) were plated in\n24-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. The next day, the cells were\ntransfected with an NF-�B luciferase reporter vector as previously described\n(10). Briefly, 450 �l of fresh medium containing 50 �l of GeneJuice (Novagen)\nplus 2 �l of the reporter plasmid preparation was incubated for 15 min at 25°C\nprior to addition to the cells for overnight transfection. The following day, PorB\n(10 �g/ml), Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml), TNF-� (20 ng/ml), or heat-killed N. men-\ningitidis at an MOI of 50 in fresh medium was added and incubated for 18 h, and\nthis was followed by measurement of luciferase activity using commercial re-\nagents (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The luminescence in\ntriplicate wells was assessed using a Wallac Victor2 luminometer.\n\nIL-8 ELISA. Supernatants from HeLa cells or BEAS-2B cells incubated as\ndescribed above were collected, and interleukin-8 (IL-8) production was mea-\nsured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a BD OptEIA\nh-IL-8 ELISA set (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nRESULTS\n\nMitochondrial localization of PorB is a time-sensitive,\nTLR2-independent event. Our group has previously shown that\nmitochondrial colocalization of PorB occurs in HeLa cells after\n24 h of incubation and has demonstrated that there is a direct\nassociation between PorB and the mitochondrial protein\nVDAC (49, 50). We have also shown that TLR2 is a surface\nreceptor for PorB (52), which might enhance intracellular de-\nlivery of PorB in cells that express this receptor. However,\nHeLa cells lack TLR2 expression (78), and thus internalization\nof PorB in these cells is likely to be TLR2 independent. To\nexamine the kinetics of mitochondrial localization of PorB\nindependent of a (known) potential receptor-mediated inter-\naction, HeLa cells were incubated with 10 �g/ml of PorB at\n37°C for 30 min, 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h, and mitochondrial and\ncytosolic fractions were separated. Aliquots of equivalent pro-\ntein concentration were examined by Western blotting with an\nanti-PorB antibody, which demonstrated that there was a time-\ndependent association of PorB with mitochondria as soon as\nafter 30 min of incubation, which increased over time (Fig.\n1A). The PorB accumulation in the cell cytosol at the same\ntime points was negligible (Fig. 1A). Cytochrome c was used as\na mitochondrial marker (Fig. 1A) and was not detected in the\ncytosolic fractions (not shown). Anti-HSP70 antibody was used\nas a loading control (Fig. 1A). As a control for PorB internal-\nization, whole-cell lysates were examined by Western blotting\nwith anti-PorB antibody (Fig. 1B). The potential interaction of\nPorB with other intracellular compartments, such as the Golgi\nmembranes or early or late endosomes, was also examined by\nWestern blotting of isolated organelles. PorB did not colocal-\nize with the Golgi membranes after 24 h of incubation, while it\nwas widely associated with the fraction containing the remain-\ning cellular membranes, including mitochondria (Fig. 1C).\nGolgi membranes were identified with an anti-Golgin antibody\n(Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained when both early- and\nlate-endosome fractions were examined (not shown). The co-\nlocalization of PorB with mitochondria after 24 h of incubation\nhas been established previously by Western blotting and by\n\nVOL. 78, 2010 MENINGOCOCCAL PORIN PorB PREVENTS CELLULAR APOPTOSIS 995\n\n\n\nfluorescence microscopy (50). Here, the time-dependent asso-\nciation of PorB with HeLa cells was examined by fluorescence\nmicroscopy of cells incubated with 10 �g/ml of PorB labeled\nwith the red fluorochrome Alexa Fluor 594 (52) for 1 h, 4 h,\nand 24 h; the cells were counterstained with an anti-cyto-\nchrome c monoclonal antibody, followed by a FITC-labeled\nsecondary antibody, and were examined by fluorescence mi-\ncroscopy (magnification, �60). Figure 2 shows the time-depen-\ndent increase in the association of red fluorescent PorB with\nHeLa cells after 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h of incubation (Fig. 2B, 2E,\nand 2H, respectively). FITC-stained cells are shown in Fig. 2A,\n2D, and 2G, and merged fluorescence images are shown in Fig.\n2C, 2F, and 2I.\n\nPorB prevents mitochondrial depolarization in a time-de-\npendent manner. To examine whether protection from apop-\ntosis correlates with time-dependent PorB colocalization with\nmitochondria, HeLa cells were incubated simultaneously with\n1 �M staurosporine (STS) and PorB (10 �g/ml) for 24 h or\nwere pretreated with PorB for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h prior to\ninduction of apoptosis. The mitochondrial membrane potential\nwas measured by flow cytometry as function of uptake of rho-\n\nFIG. 1. Time-dependent intracellular localization of PorB.

As shown in all of the histograms in Fig. 3,\nHeLa cells incubated with medium alone displayed high levels\nof rh123 fluorescence, indicating that there was an intact mi-\ntochondrial membrane potential (Fig. 3, light gray area), sim-\nilar to that of cells incubated with PorB alone (Fig. 3, thin line).\nIncubation with STS for 24 h induced mitochondrial depolar-\nization, as shown by a low level of rh123 fluorescence, due to\nthe inability of the cells to retain the dye (Fig. 3, dark gray\narea). Simultaneous addition of STS and PorB (Fig. 3A, thick\nline) or incubation of PorB for 1 h and 4 h prior to the addition\nof STS (Fig. 3B and 3C, respectively, thick line) did not prevent\nmitochondrial depolarization, while this effect was reversed by\n24 h of preincubation with PorB (Fig. 3D, thick line). Mito-\nchondrial depolarization was also prevented by PorB in human\nairway epithelial cell line BEAS-2B, a naturally TLR2-express-\ning human cell line (not shown) relevant for airborne organ-\nisms, such as N. meningitidis. Since PorB appears to colocalize\nwith mitochondria after 30 min of incubation (Fig. 1A), the\ndelay in protection could suggest that a critical concentration\nof mitochondrial PorB may be necessary. To address this pos-\n\nsibility, HeLa cells were incubated with a 5-fold-higher con-\ncentration of PorB (50 �g/ml) for 4 h or 24 h prior to induction\nof apoptosis. When 50 �g/ml of PorB was used, protection\nfrom mitochondrial depolarization was observed after 4 h of\nincubation with PorB (Fig. 3E, thick line), as well as after 24 h\n(Fig. 3F, thick line).\n\nSelectivity of PorB for the intrinsic apoptosis pathway. Cel-\nlular apoptosis can be induced by a variety of different stimuli,\nwhich can activate the intrinsic or extrinsic pathway. Stauro-\nsporine is an intrinsic inducer of apoptosis, and our previous\nstudies have shown that, due to protection from mitochondrial\ndepolarization, PorB prevents or reduces apoptotic events\ndownstream of mitochondria, such as caspase cleavage and\nDNA degradation (49, 50). In agreement with our previous\nresults, PorB prevented cleavage of pro-caspase 7 induced by\nSTS in HeLa cells, as shown by Western blotting of whole-cell\nlysates with an anti-caspase 7 antibody (Fig. 4A). However,\nwhen apoptosis was induced via the extrinsic apoptosis path-\nway with TNF-� (20 ng/ml) plus cycloheximide (chx) (10 �g/\nml) for 24 h, PorB did not prevent cleavage of pro-caspase 3\nand only minimally reduced the cleavage of pro-caspase 7 (Fig.\n\nFIG. 3. Time-dependent prevention of mitochondrial depolarization by PorB. Mitochondrial depolarization was examined by flow cytometry\nof HeLa cells stained with rhodamine 123, a mitochondrial potential-dependent fluorescent dye.

In all the histograms, the fluorescence of cells treated with medium alone is\nindicated by the light gray area, the fluorescence of cells treated with PorB alone is indicated by the thin line, the fluorescence of cells treated with\nSTS is indicated by the dark gray area, and the fluorescence of cells treated with PorB and STS is indicated by the thick line. Gating was used to\nexclude cellular debris. The results are representative of the results of at least four independent experiments.\n\nVOL. 78, 2010 MENINGOCOCCAL PORIN PorB PREVENTS CELLULAR APOPTOSIS 997\n\n\n\n4A). An anti-HSP70 antibody was used to demonstrate equal\nloading of the samples.\n\nTo determine whether PorB can prevent TNF-�- and chx-\ndependent mitochondrial depolarization, rh123 staining was\nexamined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) as\ndescribed above. Mitochondrial depolarization induced by\nTNF-� and chx (Fig. 4B, dark area) was not prevented by\nincubation with PorB for 24 h (Fig. 4B, thick line). As ex-\npected, mitochondrial depolarization was not detected in cells\nincubated with medium alone or with PorB alone (Fig. 4B,\n\nlight gray area and thin line, respectively). Since PorB can\nrescue HeLa cells from mitochondrial depolarization induced\nby STS, a specific effect on the intrinsic apoptosis pathway is\nhypothesized. Apoptotic DNA degradation was also examined\nby using incorporation of propidium iodide (PI), followed by\nquantification of cells with hypodiploid DNA by FACS analy-\nsis. PorB significantly prevented STS-induced DNA degrada-\ntion (approximately 50%) (Fig. 4C), while it did not reduce\nDNA degradation induced by TNF-� and chx. Figure 4C shows\nthe results of multiple experiments (n � 5), expressed as ratios\nof DNA degradation compared to the data for medium control\ncells.\n\nEffect of PorB on cellular proteins involved in apoptosis.\nThe phenomena that describe prevention of intrinsic apoptosis\nby PorB might also suggest a potential contribution of the\ncellular apoptotic machinery, which is heavily regulated by\nboth proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the Bcl-2\nfamily. To address whether PorB has an inhibitory effect on\nproapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, the time-dependent expression\nand intracellular localization of Bak, Bax, and Bid were exam-\nined by Western blotting of lysates of whole cells incubated\nwith PorB (10 �g/ml) for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h. Incubation with\nPorB for up to 24 h did not affect the expression of the mito-\nchondrial proapoptotic protein Bak, did not induce mitochon-\ndrial accumulation of Bax, and did not induce cleavage of the\ncytosolic, full-length, inactive form of Bid (not shown). In ad-\ndition, the lack of mitochondrial cytochrome c and the lack of\napoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) released in the cell cytosol\nwere further indications of mitochondrial membrane integrity\n(not shown).\n\nNext, the effect of PorB on antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins was\nexamined. A modest increase in expression of Bcl-2 was de-\ntected after 4 h of incubation with PorB, but the level returned\nto the baseline level after 24 h (Fig. 5A), consistent with our\nprevious results (50). Similar transient expression of Bcl-xL\nwas also detected (Fig. 5A). Only expression of Bfl-1 increased\nin a time-dependent manner (Fig. 5A), in agreement with what\nwas previously shown for gonococcal porin PIB in male ure-\nthral cells (5). As both live gonococci and purified PIB induce\nearly upregulation of c-IAP-2 gene expression (5, 23), the\nc-IAP-2 protein levels in response to PorB were examined.\n\nFIG. 4. PorB does not prevent extrinsic apoptosis.

HeLa cells were incubated with (A) PorB (10 �g/ml) and\n(B) TNF-� (20 ng/ml) for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h, and expression of Bcl-2,\nBcl-xL, Bfl-1, and c-IAP2 was examined by Western blot analysis of cell\nlysates. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 were transiently expressed in re-\nsponse to PorB after 1 h or 4 h of incubation, and expression decreased\nafter 24 h of incubation, while expression of Bfl-1 increased in a\ntime-dependent manner. TNF-� was used as a positive control for\ninduction of protein expression, and HSP70 was used as a loading\ncontrol.\n\n998 MASSARI ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nFigure 5A shows that transient expression of c-IAP-2 was de-\ntected, similar to expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.\n\nAs a positive control for expression of these proteins upon\ncell activation, HeLa cells were incubated with TNF-� alone\n(20 ng/ml), which did not affect Bax, t-Bid, cytochrome c, and\nAIF (not shown), since TNF-� does not induce apoptosis in\nthe absence of chx. In agreement with previous findings, treat-\nment with TNF-� alone induced increased expression of Bcl-2,\nBcl-xL, Bfl-1, and c-IAP2 in a time-dependent manner in HeLa\ncells (Fig. 5B). Loading of equal amounts of proteins was\ndetermined with an anti-HSP70 antibody.\n\nLack of NF-�B activation by PorB in the absence of TLR2.\nMost intracellular antiapoptotic factors are under transcrip-\ntional control of NF-�B, which therefore plays a major role in\nprevention of cell death (30). NF-�B activation is induced by\nwhole neisseriae and neisserial porins in various cell systems\n(5, 13, 21, 23, 27, 35, 59, 77); in particular, PorB induces NF-�B\nactivation in a manner dependent on TLR2 (46, 48, 52), a\nreceptor that is not present in HeLa cells (78). To determine\nwhether PorB could induce TLR2-independent NF-�B activa-\ntion in these cells, multiple approaches were used. First, cell\nfractionation and Western blotting were employed to examine\nNF-�B protein levels in response to PorB. HeLa cells were\nincubated with 10 �g/ml of PorB for 1 h, 4 h, and 24 h or with\nTNF-� (20 ng/ml) for 30 min as a TLR-independent positive\ncontrol. PorB did not induce expression and degradation of\nI�B� (essential for release of active NF-�B) or expression of\ntotal intracellular NF-�B (p65/RelA) in whole-cell lysates in\nthe absence of TLR2 (Fig. 6A, left panel). As expected, I�B�\ndegradation and p65/RelA expression were detected in re-\nsponse to TNF-� (Fig. 6B, left panel). An HSP70 antibody was\nused as a loading control.\n\nTo verify our findings, nuclear translocation of p65/RelA\nwas also examined by Western blotting of nuclear and cytosolic\nfractions. PorB did not induce p65/RelA nuclear translocation\nat early time points and appeared to slightly induce nuclear\n\ntranslocation at 24 h (Fig. 6A, right panel). Incubation with\nTNF-� alone for 30 min was sufficient to promote p65/RelA\nnuclear translocation (Fig. 6B, right panel). An antihistone\nantibody was used to determine the purity of the nuclear frac-\ntions. NF-�B subunits other than p65/RelA were also exam-\nined by Western blotting. A small, time-dependent increase in\ntotal p100 and p105 expression was detected in response to\nPorB after 24 h of incubation, but there was no significant\nnuclear translocation of the active NF-�B subunits (not\nshown). Collectively, these data suggest that PorB does not\ninduce significant NF-�B activation in HeLa cells, although\nintracellular accumulation of p105 and p100 precursors may\noccur.\n\nTo correlate the biochemical evidence for a lack of TLR2-\ndependent NF-�B activation by PorB with functional activa-\ntion, HeLa cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter\nvector under control of the NF-�B promoter (10), and lucif-\nerase production was examined. This approach has been used\npreviously to characterize TLR-dependent NF-�B activation\nby PorB in other cell systems (48, 52). Transfected cells were\nincubated for 18 h with PorB (10 �g/ml), TNF-� (20 ng/ml) as\na TLR-independent positive control, Pam3CSK4 (100 ng/ml)\nas a TLR2-dependent control, and heat-killed N. meningitidis\n(MOI, 50) as an additional control. PorB and Pam3CSK4 did\nnot induce NF-�B-mediated luciferase production (Fig. 7A),\nwhile TNF-� and heat-killed N. meningitidis induced robust\nluciferase production (Fig. 7A). The results were expressed in\n\nFIG. 6. Lack of NF-�B expression and activation in HeLa cells by\nPorB. HeLa cells were incubated with PorB (10 �g/ml) for 1 h, 4 h, and\n24 h or with TNF-� (20 ng/ml) for 30 min, and NF-�B activation was\nmeasured by Western blotting.

PorB\nand Pam3CSK4 did not induce IL-8 secretion (Fig. 7B) due to\nthe lack of TLR2 expression in these cells. TLR2-independent\nIL-8 production was induced by TNF-� and heat-killed N.\nmeningitidis (Fig. 7B), in agreement with previous results. In-\nduction of IL-8 by PorB was also measured using BEAS-2B\ncells, which respond to TLR2 ligands, including PorB (not\nshown).\n\nControl of mitochondrial potential by PorB is not dependent\non NF-�B transcriptional activity. Although it appears that\nNF-�B is not required for the antiapoptotic effect of PorB in\nHeLa cells, to determine whether inhibition of NF-�B activa-\ntion could interfere with this property, the sesquiterpene lac-\ntone parthenolide (PA) was used in the apoptosis assay. Var-\nious concentrations of PA were tested for cell toxicity, and 10\n�M was chosen as a nontoxic concentration with significant\nNF-�B inhibition (not shown). As a control for the ability of\nPA to inhibit NF-�B activation, HeLa cells were preincubated\nwith 10 �M PA for 2 h prior to incubation with 20 ng/ml of\nTNF-� for 30 min, and whole-cell lysates were examined by\nWestern blotting. I�B� degradation induced by TNF-� was\ninhibited by PA (Fig. 8A), similar to p65/RelA nuclear trans-\nlocation (not shown). Anti-HSP70 antibody was used as a load-\ning control.\n\nThe effect of PA on the mitochondrial potential was exam-\nined by using rh123 fluorescence and FACS. The mitochon-\ndrial potential was not affected by treatment with PA (10 �M)\nalone for 24 h (Fig. 8B, gray dotted line) or by treatment with\nPA for 2 h followed by treatment with 10 �g/ml of PorB (Fig.\n8B, black dotted line), similar to the results for PorB alone\n(Fig. 8B, black line) and for medium alone (Fig. 8B, light gray\narea). Induction of mitochondrial depolarization by STS (Fig.\n8C, dark gray area) was prevented by treatment with PorB\nalone (Fig. 8C, thin line) and by treatment with PA for 2 h\nfollowed by treatment with PorB for an additional 24 h (Fig.\n8C, thick line), demonstrating that inhibition of NF-�B does\nnot affect the ability of PorB to prevent mitochondrial depo-\nlarization.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPreviously, our group correlated the antiapoptotic effect of\nPorB with its direct interaction with the mitochondrial protein\nVDAC and subsequent modulation of mitochondrial mem-\nbrane potential (49, 50), an upstream event in the intrinsic\napoptotic pathway. Since these initial observations, further ev-\nidence that purified neisserial porins and live Neisseria infec-\ntion inhibit apoptosis in various types of cells has been re-\nported (4, 5, 23, 50, 55, 62, 65, 75). While the mechanism of\nprotection from apoptosis by the gonococcal porin PIB ap-\npears to involve activation of NF-�B and expression of anti-\napoptotic genes (5), it is not clear whether similar cellular and\nmolecular mechanisms also regulate the antiapoptotic effect of\nPorB. For example, PorB elicits NF-�B activation in a TLR2-\nand TLR1-dependent manner (48, 52) but prevents apoptosis\nin various cell types, regardless of the TLR2 expression level or\ntissue origin. Our group and others have reported PorB-medi-\n\nated prevention of apoptosis in TLR2-competent cells (murine\nprimary B cells, B cell lines, and human female cervical epi-\nthelial cells), in TLR2-negative cells (HeLa cells), and in cells\nexpressing low physiological levels of TLR2 (human airway\nepithelial BEAS-2B cells) (53; P. Massari, unpublished obser-\nvations). The latter, a relevant cell type for infection with\nairborne pathogens, such as N. meningitidis, are susceptible to\nactivation by PorB (P. Massari, unpublished observations).\nCollectively, our observations so far suggest that PorB can\nprevent mitochondrial depolarization regardless of TLR2 ex-\npression and signaling, likely via multiple mechanisms of cell\nactivation. These mechanisms include the known direct effect\n\nFIG. 8. Inhibition of NF-�B does not affect prevention of mito-\nchondrial depolarization by PorB. (A) HeLa cells were incubated with\nthe NF-�B inhibitor parthenolide (PA) (10 �g/ml) for 2 h and then\nwith TNF-� (20 ng/ml) for 30 min, and inhibition of I�B� degradation\nwas examined by Western blotting of whole-cell lysates with an anti-\nI�B� antibody.

IMMUN.\n\n\n\nof PorB on mitochondria and potential activation of cellular\nantiapoptotic responses. To specifically exclude the contribu-\ntion of TLR2-dependent activation pathways to the antiapop-\ntotic effect of PorB, here we examined the potential contribu-\ntion of the host cell machinery to this phenomenon using HeLa\ncells, which lack TLR2 expression (78).\n\nFirst, we described a rapid, time-dependent interaction of\nPorB with mitochondria. This interaction is not detected in\nother intracellular compartments, such as Golgi membranes or\nthe endoplasmic reticulum, in agreement with previous find-\nings (50). Once PorB colocalizes with mitochondria, it prevents\napoptotic mitochondrial membrane depolarization (49) by in-\nteracting with VDAC, a component of the permeability tran-\nsition pore (12) and possibly by interfering with the formation\nof contact sites between the inner and outer mitochondrial\nmembranes (47). Since PorB colocalizes with mitochondria\nrapidly during incubation, one could imagine that its ability to\nmodulate mitochondrial potential is also forthcoming. How-\never, PorB did not prevent mitochondrial depolarization in-\nduced by STS prior to a 24-h preincubation. The delay in\nprotection might be explained by the necessity to accumulate a\ncritical amount of PorB for mitochondrial membrane stabili-\nzation, and a 5-fold-higher dose of PorB prevented mitochon-\ndrial depolarization at earlier time points.\n\nWhile mitochondrial depolarization has a primary role in the\nintrinsic apoptosis pathway, in the extrinsic pathway this pro-\ncess is either bypassed immediately (type I cells) or may am-\nplify the death signal via certain proapoptotic Bcl-2 family\nmembers (type II cells) (45, 63). We examined the effect of\nPorB on extrinsic apoptosis induced in HeLa cells by TNF-� in\nthe presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide.\nOur results demonstrate that PorB has a nonessential role in\nprevention of caspase activation upstream and downstream of\nmitochondria in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway. Importantly,\nPorB did not rescue cells from secondary mitochondrial mem-\nbrane depolarization, likely due to previous major apoptotic\nevents. These observations, combined with the evidence that\nPorB nevertheless protects HeLa cells from STS-induced\napoptosis, indicate that there is a specific effect only on the\nintrinsic apoptosis pathway. Obviously, given that protection\nfrom mitochondrial depolarization by PorB appeared to in-\ncrease over time, the possibility that PorB induces intracellular\nfactors that have not been described so far cannot be excluded,\ndespite the uncharacteristically long time necessary for cellular\nevents possibly regulated by signal transduction pathways. The\nkey cellular players during apoptosis include Bcl-2 and IAP\nfamily members, which are activated mostly by cleavage or a\nchange in intracellular localization and regulate release of\napoptotic mitochondrial factors in both a mitochondrial poten-\ntial-dependent manner and a mitochondrial potential-indepen-\ndent manner. Since PorB induces neither expression and trans-\nlocation of proapoptotic Bax, Bak, and Bid nor release of\ncytochrome c and AIF, it is plausible that its antiapoptotic\neffect is not due to inhibition of these factors. Nevertheless,\nantiapoptotic proteins could contribute to the properties of\nPorB. However, PorB induced early and transient expression\nof Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 in the first 1 h to 4 h of incuba-\ntion, in agreement with previous findings for gonococcal PIB in\nmale urethral epithelial cells (5). Whether these proteins are\ninduced only at early time points or are degraded at later time\n\npoints is not clear. Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 thus do not play\na major role in PorB-mediated prevention of apoptosis. Inter-\nestingly, PorB induced stable, time-dependent expression of\nBfl-1 (17), a suppressor of both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis\n(64, 67, 76, 81) expressed in bone marrow and, at low levels, in\nother tissues. It has been shown that the gonococcal porin PIB\ninduces early upregulation of bfl-1 gene expression in a male\nurethral epithelial cell model (5), similar to the findings for\nwhole N. gonorrhoeae incubated with female cervical epithelial\ncells (23). It is tempting to speculate that neisserial factors,\nincluding porins, are important for modulation of apoptosis in\ntissues that are relevant for infection by these microorganisms,\nsuch as the reproductive tract or the airway epithelium. The\neffects of PorB and of whole N. meningitidis cells on cells of the\nhuman airway epithelia are currently being investigated. Bfl-1\nexpression is transcriptionally regulated by an NF-�B-depen-\ndent complex containing AP-1 and C/EBP� and is dependent\non a c-Rel/p50 heterodimer (19, 29, 38, 81), and NF-�B also\ndirectly regulates a number of other cellular factors involved in\napoptosis (3, 9, 57). Although PorB is known to activate NF-�B\nthrough TLR2 and TLR1 signaling (48, 52), we found that it\ndid not induce p65/RelA expression or I�B� degradation and\ninduced only minimal p65/RelA nuclear translocation in HeLa\ncells. In addition, only some cytosolic accumulation of p105\nand p100 precursors was detected, but no nuclear translocation\nof these subunits was detected. The lack of functional NF-�B\nactivation in response to PorB and other TLR2 ligands was\nconfirmed by the absence of NF-�B-dependent luciferase pro-\nduction and IL-8 secretion. The lack of TLR2 expression in\nHeLa cells may explain the inability of PorB to activate these\ncells. In addition, PorB also did not activate NOD-transfected\nHEK cells (66; R. Ingalls and P. Massari, unpublished obser-\nvations). Collectively, similar to findings for Chlamydia tracho-\nmatis (20, 22, 79, 80), these observations argue against a major\nrole for NF-�B transcriptional activation in the antiapoptotic\neffect of PorB in HeLa cells (which does not induce I�B�\ndegradation or p65/RelA nuclear translocation but induces p65\ncleavage to interfere with the host inflammatory response)\n(37). Although the lack of NF-�B activation might explain the\nlack of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and c-IAP-2 expression by PorB, induc-\ntion of Bfl-1 expression might be induced via NF-�B-indepen-\ndent transactivation of the bfl-1 gene, similar to what has been\ndescribed for Burkitt’s lymphoma cells with EBV nuclear an-\ntigen 2 via CBF1 (or RBP-J kappa), a nuclear component of\nthe Notch signaling pathway (60). Regulation of Bfl-1 in epi-\nthelial cells in the absence of NF-�B has not been described so\nfar, and this regulation in response to PorB should be investi-\ngated further.\n\nInhibition of NF-�B with pharmacologic reagents can in-\ncrease the susceptibility to apoptosis. However, the NF-�B\ninhibitor parthenolide (6) did not affect the antiapoptotic\nproperties of PorB, suggestiing that NF-�B has a marginal role\nfor PorB in this process. The possibility that other signaling\npathways (including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,\nPI3K/AKT [14], and Notch [34] pathways) contribute cannot\nbe excluded, since regulation of Bcl-2 family members has\nbeen hypothesized for these pathways (44, 61). Further anal-\nysis of the TLR2-independent signaling induced by PorB might\nidentify a novel contribution of intracellular factors involved in\nprevention of apoptosis.\n\nVOL. 78, 2010 MENINGOCOCCAL PORIN PorB PREVENTS CELLULAR APOPTOSIS 1001\n\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by NIH/NIAID grant RO1 AI40944-01.\nWe thank Ting Wu for technical assistance.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
