Increasing evidence\nindicates the voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels are involved in the regulation of microglia function, prompting us to\nhypothesize Kv channels may also be involved in microglia-mediated neurotoxic activity in HIV-1-infected brain. To test this\nhypothesis, we investigated the involvement of Kv channels in the response of microglia to HIV-1 Tat protein. Treatment of\nrat microglia with HIV-1 Tat protein (200 ng/ml) resulted in pro-inflammatory microglial activation, as indicated by increases\nin TNF-a, IL-1b, reactive oxygen species, and nitric oxide, which were accompanied by enhanced outward K+ current and\nKv1.3 channel expression. Suppression of microglial Kv1.3 channel activity, either with Kv1.3 channel blockers Margatoxin, 5-\n(4-Phenoxybutoxy)psoralen, or broad-spectrum K\n\n+\nchannel blocker 4-Aminopyridine, or by knockdown of Kv1.3 expression\n\nvia transfection of microglia with Kv1.3 siRNA, was found to abrogate the neurotoxic activity of microglia resulting from HIV-\n1 Tat exposure. Furthermore, HIV-1 Tat-induced neuronal apoptosis was attenuated with the application of supernatant\ncollected from K\n\n+\nchannel blocker-treated microglia. Lastly, the intracellular signaling pathways associated with Kv1.3 were\n\ninvestigated and enhancement of microglial Kv1.3 was found to correspond with an increase in Erk1/2 mitogen-activated\nprotein kinase activation. These data suggest targeting microglial Kv1.3 channels may be a potential new avenue of therapy\nfor inflammation-mediated neurological disorders.\n\nCitation: Liu J, Xu P, Collins C, Liu H, Zhang J, et al.

The severity of HAND varies, ranging from asymptomatic\n\nneurocognitive impairment to its severest form: HIV-1-associated\n\ndementia [2]. Despite the widespread use of potent antiretroviral\n\ntherapy (ART), the incidence of HAND has not been fully\n\nprevented and its prevalence remains high ranging from 39% to\n\n52% in varied settings [3,4,5]. Although the persistence of HAND is\n\nmultifactorial, the paucity of effective therapeutic modalities in the\n\ncontrol of brain macrophage and microglia activation and resultant\n\nproduction of neurotoxins, a striking pathological feature in HIV-1-\n\ninfected brain, plays an important role as pathogenesis and severity\n\nof HAND is highly correlated with activated brain macrophages\n\nand microglia but not the presence and amount of virus in the brain\n\n[6,7]. It is well known that the activated microglia secrete a number\n\nof neurotoxins including, but not limited to, pro-inflammatory\n\ncytokines, and excitatory amino acids, reactive oxygen species\n\n(ROS), nitric oxygen (NO), which can result in neuronal injury and\n\nconsequent neurocognitive impairments [8,9,10]. As such, studies\n\non elucidation of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 triggers\n\nmicroglial neurotoxicity and identification of specific target(s) to\n\ncontrol microglia activation are imperative.\n\nVoltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels have recently gained\n\nmuch attention as the potential targets for therapy of neurological\n\ndisorders [11,12]. Electrophysiological studies of microglia in\n\nculture and tissue slices have demonstrated that microglia express\n\nseveral types of Kv channels including inward rectifier Kir2.1 and\n\noutward rectifiers Kv1.5 and Kv1.3. Exposure to a variety of\n\nactivating stimuli produces a characteristic pattern of up-regula-\n\ntion of Kv1.3 [13,14,15,16]. Whereas the expression of Kir2.1\n\nchannels are often found in resting microglia [17,18], the\n\nexpression of Kv1.5 and Kv1.3, especially the latter, appear to\n\nbe associated with microglia activation and neurotoxin production\n\n[15,19,20,21]. Indeed, studies have shown that activation of\n\nmicroglia results in neuronal injury through a process requiring\n\nKv1.3 activity in microglia. Studies have also shown that blocking\n\nmicroglia Kv1.3 or decrease of Kv1.3 expression inhibits microg-\n\nlia-induced neurotoxicity [22,23]. We hypothesize that HIV-1\n\nbrain infection triggers microglia neurotoxic activity by increasing\n\nKv1.3 activity, resulting in microglia activation and consequent\n\nneuronal injury. To test this hypothesis, we studied involvement of\n\nKv1.3 in HIV-1 Tat protein-induced microglia activation and\n\nresultant neurotoxic activity in primary microglia culture prepared\n\nfrom Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results demonstrated that HIV-1\n\nTat increases microglia production of neurotoxins and resultant\n\nneurotoxicity through enhancements of Kv1.3 protein expression\n\nand outward K\n+\n\ncurrents, which can be blocked by pretreatment\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904\n\n\n\nof microglia with specific Kv channel blockers Margatoxin (MgTx)\n\nor 5-(4-Phenoxybutoxy)psoralen (PAP), or by transfection of\n\nmicroglia with Kv1.3 siRNA, suggesting an involvement of\n\nKv1.3 in microglia-mediated neurotoxic activity. The enhance-\n\nments of Kv1.3 channel activity and microglia neurotoxicity\n\nresulting from HIV-1 Tat protein exposure are dependent on the\n\nErk1/2 MAPK signal pathway. Here we present evidence for the\n\nreduction of neurotoxic secretions from microglia and associated\n\nneuronal injury by modulation of K\n+\n\nchannel activity as a\n\npotential new treatment approach deserving further investigation.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals\nSprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River\n\nLaboratories (Wilmington, MA) and maintained under ethical\n\nguidelines for care of laboratory animals at the University of\n\nNebraska Medical Center. All animal-use procedures were\n\nreviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and\n\nUse Committee (IACUC) of University of Nebraska Medical\n\nCenter (IACUC # 00-062-07).\n\nPrimary microglia and neuron cultures\nMicroglia were derived from the cerebral cortices of 0–1 day old\n\nneonatal Sprague Dawley rats as described previously [24].\n\nCortical tissues were dissected in cold Hanks’ Balanced Salt\n\nSolution (HBSS: Madiatech, Inc. Manassas, VA) and digested in a\n\nsolution consisting of 0.25% trypsin and 200 Kunitz DNase\n\n(Sigma, St. Louis. MO) at 37uC for 30 min. Tissues were then\nsuspended in cold HBSS and filtered using 100 mm and 40 mm\ncellular strainers (BD Bioscience, Durham, NC). Isolated cells\n\n(306106) were plated into T75 cm2 flasks in a high-glucose\nDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with\n\n10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/\n\nstreptomycin, and 1 mg/ml macrophage colony-stimulating factor\n(Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY). After 10 day’s culture,\n\nflasks were shaken gently to detach cells, which were plated based\n\non experimental requirements in either 35 mm\n2\n\nculture dishes\n\n(2.56106 cells/dish), 60 mm2 culture dishes (7.56106 cells/dish),\n12-well plates (16106/well), or 96-well plates (0.46106/well) and\nincubated at 37uC. After 30 min, suspended glial cells were\nremoved by aspiration of culture supernatant and fresh culture\n\nmedia was applied. The resulting cultures were stained with OX-\n\n42 antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK), a microglial CR3/CD11b\n\nreceptor marker, and determined to consist of 98–100% microglia.\n\nPrimary cortical neurons were prepared from 18-day old\n\nSprague Dawley embryonic rats (Charles River Laboratories).\n\nDissected cortices were digested with 0.25% trypsin and DNase\n\n(200 Kunitz) in 37uC for 15 min, then filtered through 100 and\n40 mm pore cellular strainers. Isolates were seeded in pre-coated\npoly-D-lysine plates at a density of 0.056106 cells/well in 96-well\nplates, 0.156106 cells/well in 24-well plates, or 1.06106 cells/well\nin 6 well-plates. Neuronal cultures were maintained at 37uC for 10\ndays in neurobasal medium (Gibco by Life Technologies)\n\nsupplemented with 2% B27, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and\n\n0.5 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen by Life Technologies). The\n\npurity of neuronal cells was determined to be .90% by staining\n\nwith microtubule-associated protein-2 antibody (MAP-2: 1:1000,\n\nChemicon International, Inc. Temecula, California).\n\nElectrophysiology\nWhole-cell outward K\n\n+\ncurrents were recorded from primary\n\nrat microglia cultures at room temperature. Microglia were\n\nperfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) contained (in\n\nmM) NaCl 150, KCl 4.5, CaCl2 2, MgCl2 1, HEPES 5, and\n\nglucose 11. The ACSF was continuously oxygenated with 95% O2\nand 5% CO2 with a pH of 7.4 and an osmolarity of 310 mOsm.\n\nPatch-clamp electrodes were made from borosilicate glass\n\ncapillaries (WPI, Sarasota, FL) with a resistance of 4–6 V when\nfilled with pipette solution contained (in mM) KCl 150, MgCl2 1,\n\nCaCl2 1, EGTA 11, and HEPES 10; adjusted to a pH of 7.3 with\n\nKOH. Voltage-dependent currents were evoked by voltage steps\n\n(600 ms in duration) with the first step from the holding potential\n\nof 270 mV to 2170 mV and then stepped to +50 mV with a\n20 mV increments [13]. The seal resistance was 1–10 GV.\nJunction potentials were corrected and the cell capacitance was\n\ncompensated (,70%) in most cells. Current signals were amplified\nwith an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,\n\nCA). The current traces were displayed and recorded on a Dell\n\ncomputer using a pClamp 10.1 data acquisition/analysis system.\n\nK\n+\n\ncurrent density (pA/pF) was calculated by dividing the peak\n\ncurrent amplitude generated at a given voltage step by the cell\n\ncapacitance.\n\nMeasurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Nitric\noxide (NO) production\n\nIntracellular ROS were measured by fluorometric assay using\n\n29, 79-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA, Sigma, St. Louis,\n\nMO), a well-established compound for detecting and quantifying\n\nintracellular ROS production. Microglia were first treated for\n\n30 minutes with a KV1.3 channel blocker, either 5 nM MgTx,\n\n10 nM PAP, or 1 mM 4-AP (all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich\n\nCo, LLC, St. Louis, MO), followed by treatment with either\n\n200 ng/ml of HIV-1 Tat1-72 protein (Tat) or heat inactivated-\n\nTat1-72 (HI Tat) (purchased from University of Kentucky). After\n\n24 hr, microglia were exposed to 20 mM DCFH-DA for 30 min.\nCells were then washed twice in PBS and the fluorescence\n\nimmediately measured in a plate reader at an excitation\n\nwavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 520 nm.\n\nNO production was estimated by measuring the concentration\n\nof nitrite using the Griess Reagent System according to the\n\nmanufacturer instruction (Promega, Madison, WI). 50 ml aliquots\nof supernatant were collected from cultures of pre-treated\n\nmicroglia, mixed with equal volume of Sulfanilamide Solution\n\nfor 10 min, combined with 50 ml of NED solution, and incubated\nfor 30 min at room temperature. The optical density was then\n\nmeasured at 520 nm and 540 nm using an ELISA plate reader.\n\nAll experiments were repeated at least three times.\n\nCytokine assay\nCytokines IL-1b and TNF-a in pre-treated microglia superna-\n\ntants were quantified using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent\n\nassay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems) in accordance with manufac-\n\nturer protocol.\n\nTUNEL staining and MTT assay\nNeuronal apoptosis was evaluated using a Fluorescein In Situ\n\nCell Death Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis,\n\nIN). In brief, neurons growing on poly-D-lysine-coated coverslips\n\n(0.156106 cells/well in a 24-well plate) were exposed to\nsupernatants collected from pre-treated microglia at 1:5 dilution\n\nfor 24 hr. Neurons were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde\n\n(PFA) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Neurons were\n\nsubsequently incubated in the TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 hr\n\nat 37uC and then mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent\nwith 49,69-diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI) counterstain (Molecu-\n\nlar Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were visualized using the 406oil-\n\nHIV-1 Tat Enhances Microglial K+ Channel Activity\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904\n\n\n\nimmersion objective of a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO microscope\n\n(Zeiss MicroImaging, Inc., Thornwood, NY). The percentage of\n\napoptotic neurons was determined based on TUNEL-positive cells\n\nnormalized to DAPI-stained nuclei.\n\nCell viability was assessed by MTT assay. Pre-treated neurons\n\nwere exposed to fresh neurobasal medium containing 500 mg/ml\n3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide\n\n(MTT) for 3 hr. The MTT solution was then replaced with\n\n300 ml of dimethyl sphingosine (DMSO: Sigma-Aldrich) for cell\nlysis and the optical density (OD) was measured at 560 nm.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nMicroglia were seeded on coverslips at a density of 1.06106/\n\nwell in 12-well plates, treated for 30 min with 5 nM MgTx,\n\n10 nM PAP, or 1 mM 4-AP, and incubated with Tat (200 ng/ml).\n\nAfter 24 hr, cells were washed, fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min, and\n\nincubated with 10% normal goat serum blocking solution for\n\n30 min. Primary antibodies (Ab) anti-CD11b Ab (CD11b; 1:500;\n\nabcam, Cambridge, MA) and anti-KV1.3 (KCNA3 1:100,\n\nAlomone Lab Ltd, Jerusalem Israel) were then applied to\n\ncoverslips for 3 hr at RT. Cells were subsequently incubated for\n\n1 hr with Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated\n\nsecondary Abs (1:1000, Molecular Probes, Invitrogen by Life\n\nTechnologies). After washing, cells were mounted using ProLong\n\nGold antifade reagent with DAPI counterstain (Molecular Probes).\n\nImages were obtained using the 406 oil-immersion objective of a\nZeiss LSM 510 META NLO microscope. A minimum of 5 images\n\nwere taken from each slide.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nBrain hippocampal tissues were dissected out from 20–30 d old\n\nSprague Dawley rats (Charles River Laboratories), cut into slices\n\nat 400 mM in thickness, and placed on a 100 mm pore cellular\nstrainer in a 6-well plate. The hippocampal slices were then\n\ntreated for 30 min with MgTx (5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP\n\n(1 mM) and subsequently incubated with 200 ng/ml of Tat. After\n\n24 hr, hippocampal slices were fixed in 4% PFA for another 24 hr,\n\nimmersed in 30% sucrose for 48 hr, embedded in optimal cutting\n\ntemperature (OCT) media, and cryosectioned to a thickness of\n\n10 mm. Hippocampal sections were then immunostained with\neither anti-Iba1 Ab (1:500, WAKO Chemicals USA, Inc.\n\nRichmond, VA), KV1.3 Ab (1:200, Santa Cruz biotechnology,\n\nInc, CA), or TUNEL stain and visualized using the 406 oil-\nimmersion objective of a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO microscope.\n\nA minimum of 5 images were taken from each slides.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nMembrane proteins were prepared using a Membrane Protein\n\nExtraction Kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA, USA) according\n\nto manufacturer instruction, while total proteins were isolated\n\nusing a RIPA buffer (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Well volumes of\n\n20 mg for membrane proteins and 30 mg for total proteins were\nseparated by electrophoresis using 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX\n\nprecast gel and transferred to nitrocellulose polyvinylidene\n\ndifluoride (PVDF) membranes. PVDF membranes were then\n\nblocked with 5% dry milk in Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS) (all\n\nproducts from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and probed\n\novernight at 4uC with either rabbit polyclonal KV1.3 (1:100;\nAlomone Lab, Israel), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (pERK1/2), total\n\np44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology,\n\nDanvers, MA), or anti-mouse b-actin monoclonal antibody\n(1:10,000, Sigma-Aldrich) primary Abs. Membranes were next\n\nwashed (4610 min) in TBS with 0.2% Tween (TBS-T) and\nincubated for 1 hr at RT with either horseradish peroxidase\n\n(HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody\n\n(1:10,000, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,\n\nPA). Labeled proteins were visualized by Pierce ECL Western\n\nBlotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Band\n\ndensities of p-pErk1/2 were normalized to total ERK1/2 in each\n\nsample.\n\nReverse transcription (RT)-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated from microglia using TRIzol Reagent\n\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), purified by RNeasy Mini Kit\n\n(QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA), and reverse transcribed at 65uC\nfor 50 min according to SuperScript III reverse transcriptase\n\n(Invitrogen) protocol. PCR amplification with Platinum PCR\n\nSuperMix (Invitrogen) then included 2 min incubation at 94uC\nfollowed by 30 cycles consisting of a 30 s denaturing phase at\n\n94uC, a 30 s annealing phase at 55uC, a 1 min extension phase at\n72uC, and a final extension phase of 10 min at 72uC. Densitom-\netry analysis of DNA products was performed using Northern\n\nEclipse 6.0 software (Bio-Rad) and results normalized to b-actin\ninternal controls. PCR primers used were as follows: forward\n\nKv1.3 primer was GTA CTT CGA CCC GCT CCG CAA TGA;\n\nreverse Kv1.3 primer was GGG CAA GCA AAG AAT CGC\n\nACC AG; forward b-Actin primer was GTG GGG CGC CCC\nAGG CAC CA; reverse b-Actin primer was CTT CCT TAA\nTGT CAC GCA CGA TTT C.\n\nsiRNA transfection\nPre-designed ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA against\n\nrat KCNA3 (Kv1.3, NM-019270) mRNA was purchased from\n\nDharmacon, Inc. (Chicago, IL). Microglia plated to 26106 cells/\nwell in 6-well plates were transfected with 100 ml of 2 mM siRNA\nfor 48 or 72 hr in the presence of Dharma FECT Transfection\n\nReagent (Dharmacon, Inc) according to the manufacturer\n\ninstruction. A non-specific ON-TARGETplus GAPD Control\n\nPool siRNA (rat) (Dharmacon, Inc) was also similarly transfected\n\nat the same concentration as the control. Transfected microglia\n\nwere then incubated for 24 hr with or without Tat (200 ng/ml),\n\nafter which the supernatant was collected (for conditioned media)\n\nand the cells were harvested (for preparation of RNA and protein).\n\nStatistical Analysis\nExperimental data are expressed as mean6S.D. unless other-\n\nwise indicated.

In previous studies, we demonstrated\n\nHIV-1 gp120 IIIB enhanced whole-cell outward K\n+\n\ncurrent in\n\ncultured rat microglia through Kv1.3 channels [24,25]. Here we\n\npropose HIV-1 Tat protein may alter microglia channel profiles in\n\na similar manner. To test our hypothesis, we first examined the\n\neffect of HIV-1 Tat protein on the electrophysiological properties\n\nof microglia. Although sera levels of HIV-1 Tat have been\n\nreported to range from 1–40 ng/ml in HIV-1 positive individuals\n\n[26,27], localized concentrations are reasoned to be higher and\n\nnM concentrations are commonly used in vitro to elicit the effects of\n\nTat exposure [28,29]. In our study, purified rat microglia were\n\npretreated with HIV-1 Tat protein at 20–1000 ng/ml for 24 hr\n\nbefore recording. Electrophysiological recordings were performed\n\nusing a conventional whole-cell recording under voltage clamp\n\nHIV-1 Tat Enhances Microglial K+ Channel Activity\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904\n\n\n\nconfiguration. The average inward K\n+\n\ncurrent (Iin) and outward\n\nK\n+\n\ncurrent (Iout) densities (pA/pF) were calculated by dividing the\n\nK\n+\n\ncurrent amplitude by the membrane capacitance. At hyper-\n\npolarizing potentials, both untreated and Tat treated microglia\n\ndisplayed an Iin (Fig. 1A). The Iin density in untreated microglia\n\n(28.9663.76 pA/pF; n = 32) was only minimally affected by\n\nexposure to either 20 ng/ml Tat (28.1463.61 pA/pF; n = 25),\n\n200 ng/ml Tat (215.567.36 pA/pF; n = 27), or 1000 ng/ml Tat\n\n(212.967.21 pA/pF; n = 24). With depolarizing pulses however,\n\nTat treated microglia responded with a substantial Iout (Fig. 1A). In\n\nfact, the Iout density in microglia pretreated with 20 ng/ml Tat\n\n(22.6967.46 pA/pF; n = 25) was over fourfold greater than in\n\nuntreated microglia (5.0962.84 pA/pF; n = 32). Furthermore, the\n\nIout densities in microglia exposed to 200 ng/ml Tat\n\n(30.7616.29 pA/pF; n = 27) and 1000 ng/ml Tat\n\n(31.86614.69 pA/pF; n = 24) demonstrate this effect to be dose-\n\ndependent (Fig. 1C). To confirm these observations were due\n\nspecifically to Tat protein function, we disrupted its tertiary\n\nstructure with heat (75uC for 5 hr) prior to incubation with\nmicroglia. Similarly to untreated cells, microglia treated with\n\n200 ng/ml heat-inactivated Tat protein (HI Tat, n = 9) exhibited\n\nhyperpolarization-evoked Iin currents and lacked significant Iout\ncurrent in response to depolarizing pulses (Fig. 1B). Next, to\n\ndetermine whether the Tat-induced Iout currents were conducted\n\nvia Kv1.3 channels, Tat-treated microglia were perfused with\n\nACSF contained specific Kv1.3 blockers PAP (10 nM), MgTx\n\n(5 nM), or a broad spectrum Kv channel blocker 4-AP (1 mM),\n\nand the Iout was significantly reduced by 52.1614.72% (n = 8),\n\n87.2667.79% (n = 8) or 89.8163.09% (n = 7) (Fig. 1D & 1E).\n\nTaken together, these findings strongly suggest HIV-1 Tat\n\nexposure induces outward K\n+\n\ncurrents in microglia through\n\nKv1.3 channels.\n\nHIV-1 Tat upregulates KV 1.3 expression in rat microglia\nKv channel activity can be altered by numerous factors,\n\nincluding by membrane potential, redox potential, transcription,\n\ntranslation, posttranslational modification, or via direct interaction\n\nwith organic molecules or peptides. To better determine the\n\nmechanism through which Tat induces Kv1.3currents in rat\n\nmicroglia, Kv1.3 mRNA and protein levels were ascertained by\n\nRT-PCR and western blot. RT-PCR performed after 24 hr\n\nincubation of rat microglia with 200 ng/ml Tat protein showed\n\nmarked elevation in Kv1.3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A), with Kv1.3\n\nmRNA density in Tat-treated cells (1.3260.10) measuring 1.8\n\ntimes greater than in untreated microglia (0.746023). As a\n\nnegative control, the Kv1.3 mRNA density was measured in\n\nmicroglia treated with 200 ng/ml heat-inactivated Tat protein\n\nand found to be essentially unchanged (0.8160.13) (Fig. 2A).\n\nConsistent with these effects, treatment of microglia with 200 ng/\n\nml Tat for 24 hr led to a nearly threefold increase in Kv1.3 protein\n\nlevels (Fig. 2B), which was further confirmed and visualized by\n\nimmunocytochemical labeling (Fig. 2C). These findings clearly\n\nindicate Tat protein exposure upregulates the expression of Kv1.3\n\nchannels in rat microglia.\n\nInvolvement of KV1.3 in Tat-induced microglia-mediated\nneurotoxicity\n\nHaving established Tat protein exposure increases Kv1.3\n\nexpression and current density in microglia, we next sought to\n\ndetermine if this change in channel profile contributes to the\n\nneurotoxicity of HIV-1 Tat-activated microglia. Microglial super-\n\nnatants were first collected after 24 hr treatment with either HIV-\n\n1 Tat protein (at doses of 0, 20, 200, and 1000 ng/ml) or heat-\n\ninactivated Tat (200 ng/ml). Rat cortical neurons growing on\n\npoly-D-lysine-coated coverslips in 24-well plates were then\n\nsubjected to these supernatants (1:5 dilution) for an additional\n\n24 hr and neuronal viability was assessed by MTT assay. As\n\nshown in Figure 3C, neuronal cell viability was found to be\n\nessentially unaffected at doses of 0 ng/ml (100%) and 20 ng/ml\n\n(97.0269.38%), however was progressively and significantly\n\nreduced as the microglial supernatant Tat treatment dose was\n\nincreased to 200 ng/ml (70.1963.33%; p,.01) and 1000 ng/ml\n\n(58.4564.65%; p,.01). Neuronal viability was further unaffected\n\nby incubation with supernatant collected from microglia treated\n\nwith heat-inactivated Tat protein (HI Tat, 98.464.48%), demon-\n\nstrating the dose-dependent reductions in viability to be specific to\n\nfunctional Tat protein.\n\nNext, the role of Kv channels in Tat-activated microglial\n\nneurotoxicity was investigated using a similar experimental design\n\nand examining the effect of KV channel blocker pretreatment on\n\nneuronal health. Microglia were first pretreated with either 5 nM\n\nMgTx, 10 nM PAP, or 1 mM 4-AP for 30 min. Based on the\n\ncapacity to substantially reduce neuronal viability, a dose of\n\n200 ng/ml Tat protein was applied and cultures incubated for\n\n24 hr. Microglia supernatants were then collected and added to\n\ncultured rat cortical neurons at a dilution ratio of 1:5. After 24 hr,\n\nneuronal viability and neuronal apoptosis were assessed by MTT\n\nassay and TUNEL staining, respectively. As noted previously, cell\n\nviability was shown by MTT assay to be decreased in neuronal\n\ncultures exposed to Tat-treated microglial supernatant\n\n(70.1963.33%), an effect which was significantly attenuated\n\n(p,.01) by the pretreatment of microglia with MgTx\n\n(85.4661.00%), PAP (82.9560.54%), or 4-AP (92.8364.66%)\n\n(Fig. 3C). The complementary study of neuronal apoptosis\n\nrevealed similar findings, with the percentage of apoptotic neurons\n\ngreatly increasing (p,.001) with application of Tat protein\n\n(30.6864.3%) compared to control (5.661.3%) (Fig. 3A & 3B).\n\nAgain, this result was largely reversed (p,.01) when microglial\n\ncultures were treated with MgTx (9.5662.78%), PAP\n\n(11.7262.42%), or 4-AP (7.2963.84%) prior to the application\n\nof Tat protein (Fig. 3A & 3B). The recovery of neuronal viability\n\nand attenuation of neuronal apoptosis by KV channel blockade,\n\nincluding the use of Kv1.3 specific inhibitors, suggests that Kv1.3\n\nchannel activity greatly impacts Tat-induced microglia-mediated\n\nneurotoxicity.\n\nKV1.3 channel blockade decreases neurotoxic secretions\nby Tat-activated microglia\n\nThe production and release of bioactive molecules by activated\n\nmicroglia is believed to be the principal pathway in HAND\n\nassociated neuropathology. To better clarify the functional role of\n\nKv1.3 channels in this process, we next examined the capacity for\n\nTat exposure to induce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines\n\nsuch as TNF-a and IL-1b, in the presence and absence of Kv\nchannel blockers. For this experiment, purified microglia were first\n\npre-treated for 30 min with a Kv channel blocker, either MgTx\n\n(5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM), and then incubated with\n\n200 ng/ml Tat protein for 24 hr. Subsequent cytokine assays\n\nrevealed marked increases (p,.001) in levels of TNF-a\n(2.2860.07 ng/ml) and IL-1b (4.1060.68 ng/ml) in the superna-\ntants of Tat-treated microglia compared to the nearly undetectable\n\nlevels in untreated controls (Fig. 4A & 4B). Further, this Tat-\n\ninduced production of cytokines was significantly inhibited (p,.01)\n\nin cultures pretreated with Kv channel blockers MgTx, PAP, or 4-\n\nAP. In addition to measuring cytokines, we used a similar\n\nexperimental design to measure other neurotoxic microglial\n\nproducts including NO and ROS. The level of NO in\n\nsupernatants from Tat-treated microglia was (23.6560.60 nM)\n\nHIV-1 Tat Enhances Microglial K+ Channel Activity\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e64904\n\n\n\ncompared to (0.4260.16 nM) in untreated matched controls\n\n(Fig. 4C). This production was significantly limited (p,.01) by\n\nblockade of KV channels using either MgTx (15.8160.56 nM),\n\nPAP (11.0063.20 nM), or 4-AP (16.9661.60 nM). Similarly,\n\nROS production in Tat-stimulated microglia was found to be\n\n590.646160.72% of the level in untreated control (Fig. 4D). Pre-\n\ntreatment with MgTx, PAP, or 4-AP prior to the addition of Tat\n\nsignificantly reduced the levels of ROS to 175.76662.37%,\n\n169.91684.58%, and 252.70689.4% of control, respectively.\n\nCollectively, these results strongly support a critical role for Kv1.3\n\nchannels in the production and secretion of neurotoxins by Tat-\n\nactivated microglia.\n\nNeurotoxic activity of Tat-stimulated microglia is\nmitigated by knockdown of KV1.3 gene\n\nHaving demonstrated HIV-1 Tat upregulates Kv1.3 expression\n\nin rat microglia and that Kv1.3 channels are involved in Tat-\n\ninduced microglia-mediated neurotoxicity, complementary exper-\n\niments were next performed to address whether gene silencing by\n\nknockdown of the Kv1.3 gene (KCNA3) with siRNA would\n\nattenuate these effects. First, microglia were transfected with\n\nKv1.3-siRNA or nonspecific GAPD control siRNA (control\n\nsiRNA) for 48 hr or 72 hr, depending on whether mRNA or\n\nprotein expression was to be measured, and incubated with or\n\nwithout 200 ng/ml Tat for an additional 24 hr. RT-PCR and\n\nwestern blot were then used to examine Kv1.3 mRNA expression\n\nand Kv1.3 protein levels, respectively. As expected, the upregula-\n\ntion of Kv1.3 mRNA expression in Tat-stimulated microglia was\n\nefficiently inhibited by transfection with Kv1.3 siRNA as\n\ncompared to those transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 5A).\n\nParalleling these results, Tat-enhanced Kv1.3 protein expression\n\nwas found to be significantly decreased with Kv1.3 siRNA\n\ntransfection (Fig. 5B).\n\nTo examine the effect of Kv1.3 channel knockdown on the\n\nneurotoxic properties of Tat-exposed microglia, we again\n\nemployed measures of neuronal viability and apoptosis. For this\n\nexperiment, microglia were transfected with Kv1.3-siRNA for\n\n72 hr and then incubated with 200 ng/ml Tat protein an\n\nadditional 24 hr. Microglial supernatants were next collected\n\nand applied at 1:5 dilution to rat cortical neurons. Neurons were\n\nthen incubated for an additional 24 hr before being assessed by\n\nMTT assay and TUNEL staining. As demonstrated by MTT\n\nassay, the decline in neuronal viability due to Tat-exposed\n\nmicroglial supernatants (66.8762.55%) was improved by pre-\n\ntransfection with Kv1.3-siRNA (84.7063.93%) (Fig. 5C).

The capacity for Kv1.3 gene\n\nknockdown to mitigate the neuronal damage caused by Tat-\n\nactivated microglia indicates the upregulation of Kv1.3 mRNA\n\nand protein is a key component in the mechanism of this\n\nneurotoxicity.\n\nERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway involvement in Tat-\ninduced microglial neurotoxicity\n\nThus far we have shown Tat-induced upregulation of Kv1.3\n\nchannels and currents to be critical to the activation of microglia\n\nand subsequent damage to neurons. To better clarify the\n\nmechanisms underlying these observations, we next turned our\n\nattention to the extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK1/2)\n\nMAPK signaling pathway, which has been implicated elsewhere in\n\nchronic neurodegenerative disease and may mediate the channel\n\nprofile alterations associated with Tat exposure [30,31,32]. For\n\nthis experiment, microglia were exposed to 200 ng/ml Tat and\n\nproteins were harvested at various time points for assessment by\n\nwestern blot. Our results demonstrate ERK1/2 phosphorylation\n\n(pERK1/2) was enhanced by Tat exposure beginning at 30 min\n\nand peaking at 5 hr after stimulation (Fig. 6A). To determine if\n\nERK1/2 activation mediates the Tat-induced increases in Kv1.3\n\nchannel expression and subsequent neurotoxicity, U0126 was used\n\nto inhibit MEK1 and MEK2, the MAPK kinases responsible for\n\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2 MAPK. Reduction of ERK1/2\n\nMAPK activity using U0126 (10 mM) was found to markedly\nreduce both the expression levels of microglial Kv1.3 (Fig. 6C) and\n\nthe neurotoxicity of supernatants collected from Tat-exposed\n\nmicroglia (Fig. 6D). These results provide evidence for the\n\ninvolvement of the ERK MAPK pathway in Tat-induced Kv1.3\n\nexpression and consequent microglia neurotoxic activity. Lastly\n\nand perhaps surprisingly, application of MgTx (5 nM), PAP\n\n(10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM) to microglia after 30 min of Tat\n\nexposure was also found to significantly inhibit the Tat-enhanced\n\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6B).\n\nKV1.3 channel involvement in ex vivo HIV-1 Tat-induced\nmicroglia-mediated neurotoxicity\n\nThus far we have demonstrated Tat protein exposure results in\n\nthe upregulation of Kv1.3 expression and the production of\n\nneurotoxic substances in cultured microglia. To better approxi-\n\nmate in vivo conditions, we next used a rat hippocampal slice\n\nculture to evaluate ex vivo the alterations in microglial Kv1.3\n\nexpression and neuronal apoptosis resulting from HIV-1 Tat\n\napplication. Hippocampal slices were first dissected from rats aged\n\n20–30 days, cultured in NeuroBasal medium, and incubated for\n\n24 hr with 200 ng/ml Tat protein. Brain slices were then double\n\nstained with the microglia marker Iba1 and Kv1.3 antibodies. In\n\nTat protein treated slices, Kv1.3 expression was found to be\n\nenhanced and co-localized with Iba1 stained microglia (Fig. 7A).\n\nIn addition, TUNEL staining revealed Tat-induced neuronal\n\napoptosis could be attenuated with 30 min KV channel antagonist\n\npre-treatment, either MgTx (5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP\n\n(1 mM) (Fig. 7B). These results are fully consistent with our in\n\nvitro studies and corroborate the involvement of Kv1.3 channels in\n\nthe neuronal damage caused by Tat-activated microglia.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMicroglia are functionally related to cells of the monocyte/\n\nmacrophage lineage and play an important role as resident\n\nimmunocompetent phagocytic cells in the HAND pathogenesis. A\n\nprominent pathological feature in HIV-1-infected brain is\n\nmicroglia activation and the activated microglia exert neurotoxic\n\neffects in the brain by releasing a variety of potentially neurotoxic\n\nsubstances. In addition to their production of neurotoxins,\n\nmicroglia express a large number of chemokine receptors that\n\nare involved in cell migration and serve as co-receptors for HIV-1\n\ninfection. Indeed, microglia are the predominant resident CNS\n\ncell type productively infected by HIV-1 [8,9]. Due to poor\n\npenetration of antiretroviral drugs through the blood-brain barrier\n\n(BBB), resident microglia (and brain macrophages) constitute a\n\ncellular reservoir of HIV-1 in the brain and a source of potential\n\nneurotoxic substances [33,34,35]. Thus, suppression of microglia\n\nproduction of neurotoxins is critical to the control of HAND onset\n\nand progression. In the present study, we demonstrated HIV-1\n\nTat-induced microglia activation and associated neurotoxicity\n\nrequires Kv1.3 channel activity. Exposure of microglia to HIV-1\n\nTat protein was found to enhance both Kv1.3 currents and\n\nFigure 2.

Suppression of Kv1.3\n\nchannels, either by Kv1.3 channel antagonists or via gene\n\nknockdown, significantly inhibited Tat-induced microglia-mediat-\n\ned neurotoxicity. These findings indicate Kv1.3 channel modula-\n\ntion has the potential to mitigate microglia-associated neurotoxic\n\nactivity.\n\nMicroglia express a defined pattern of Kv channels including\n\ninward rectifier Kir2.1 and outward rectifiers Kv1.5 and Kv1.3\n\n[19,36]. Exposure to a variety of stimuli produces a characteristic\n\npattern of up-regulation of Kv1.3 and activation of microglia\n\nresults in neuronal injury via a process requiring Kv1.3 activity\n\n[13,14,15,16]. In a previous study we found HIV-1 gp120\n\nexposure activates microglia, in conjunction with enhanced\n\nKv1.3 expression and outward K\n+\n\ncurrents, leading to neuronal\n\napoptosis [24,25]. The gp120-induced microglial neurotoxicity\n\nwas significantly attenuated via suppression of Kv1.3 expression or\n\nblockade of Kv1.3 current. Similarly, our present study revealed\n\nexposure to HIV-1 Tat increases microglial Kv1.3 channel\n\nexpression and outward K\n+\n\ncurrent in association with activation,\n\nneurotoxin secretion, and neuronal apoptosis, which were\n\nsuccessfully inhibited by either siRNA knockdown of the Kv1.3\n\ngene (Fig. 4) or specific Kv1.3 blockers MgTx and PAP (Fig. 1,\n\nFig. 2, and Fig. 7). We confirmed these results in an ex vivo study\n\nusing hippocampal slice culture, in which HIV-1 Tat-induced\n\nmicroglia-mediated neuronal apoptosis was attenuated by pre-\n\ntreatment with Kv1.3 antagonists MgTx or PAP, or a broad\n\nspectrum Kv channel blocker, 4-AP. Collectively, these findings\n\nreveal the integral role of Kv1.3 channels in regulating microglia\n\nactivation and establish a new approach for controlling microglia\n\nmediated neurotoxic activity.\n\nAlthough reported in several studies to be associated with\n\ndiseases including B cell lymphoma [37], breast cancer [38,39]\n\nand Alzheimer’s disease [40], research on the importance of\n\nenhanced microglial Kv1.3 channel activity in HIV-1 related\n\ncognitive impairment has thus far been sparse. The evidence for\n\nthe pivotal role of microglia in HAND pathogenesis is abundant\n\nhowever, as microglia are well known to mediate HIV entry into\n\nthe brain, serve as a reservoir for productive and latent HIV-1\n\ninfection, and function as a source of neurotoxic substances\n\n[8,19,41,42,43]. After infection with HIV-1, microglia undergo\n\ndramatic phenotypic, immunological, and functional changes to\n\nproduce the cytokines, chemokines, superoxides, and viral proteins\n\nthat result in neuronal injury. In order to determine the role of\n\nmicroglial Kv1.3 in this process, we examined the neurotoxic\n\nsecretions of HIV-1 Tat-treated microglia in relation to Kv1.3\n\nchannel activity. We found blockade of Kv1.3 channels using\n\neither specific Kv1.3 antagonists, MgTx and PAP, or a broad\n\nspectrum KV blocker, 4-AP, was sufficient to inhibit microglial\n\nproduction of IL-1b, TNF-a, NO, and ROS. These results are\nconsistent with our previous findings [24] and suggest enhanced\n\nmicroglial Kv1.3 channel activity is required for the HIV-1 Tat-\n\ninduced secretion of neurotoxins by microglia.\n\nHIV-1 Tat exposure has been shown to lead to microglia/\n\nmacrophage activation, neurotoxin secretion, and subsequent\n\nneuronal damage [22,44,45,46] in a process mediated through\n\nmicroglial signal transduction pathways such as ERK1/2, PI3K,\n\nand p38 MAPK [47,48]. Tat protein has also been shown capable\n\nof increasing an outward-rectifying K\n+\n\ncurrent in rat microglia\n\nthrough regulation of transcription factor NF-kB [49]. However,\nwhile Kv1.3 channel activity has here been demonstrated to be\n\nnecessary for Tat-induced microglial neurotoxicity, the underlying\n\nFigure 3.

Neurons were exposed to conditioned media recovered\nfrom microglia pre-treated with MgTx (5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM) for 30 min followed by Tat at varied concentrations (0, 20, 200, 1000 ng/\nml).

Although the breadth of\n\nmechanisms for modulating Kv channels are numerous, including\n\nregulation of gene expression, post-translational modification,\n\ndirect interactions with organic molecules and peptides, and\n\nresponsiveness to membrane potential, to name a few, we chose as\n\nan appropriate starting place those signaling pathways which can\n\nconvert an extracellular signal such as HIV-1 Tat protein into a\n\nfunctional cellular response. In particular, we focused on ERK1/2,\n\nwhich constitute one of the MAPK pathways that commonly\n\ntransduce microenvironmental conditions in microglia and have\n\nbeen implicated in chronic neurodegenerative diseases [30,31,32].\n\nDepending on the cell type, the stimulus, and the duration of cell\n\nactivation, a variety of biological responses including cell\n\nproliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis have been\n\ncorrelated with ERK activation [30,31,32]. In the present study,\n\nwe explored whether ERK1/2 activation was involved in the\n\nenhancement of microglial Kv1.3 expression and neuronal\n\napoptosis resulting from exposure to HIV-1 Tat. We found\n\nERK1/2 phosphorylation increased in HIV-1 Tat-treated mi-\n\ncroglia in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 6A), but could be\n\nprevented by pre-treatment with U1026, an inhibitor of the\n\nupstream kinase responsible for regulating ERK1/2 activity.\n\nFurthermore, pre-treatment with U1026 ameliorated Tat-induced\n\nmicroglial Kv1.3 expression and associated neurotoxicity (Fig. 6C,\n\nFig. 6D), indicating this process is dependent on activation of the\n\nERK1/2 MAPK pathway. Lastly, our experiments revealed the\n\nnovel finding that HIV-1 Tat-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation\n\ncould be inhibited with Kv channel antagonists, MgTx, PAP, or 4-\n\nAP. It appears that while Tat-induced microglial Kv1.3 expression\n\nis dependent on ERK1/2 MAPK, this same pathway is also\n\nresponsive to Kv currents. Given that Kv currents set the\n\nmembrane potential and thus influence Ca\n2+\n\ninflux, the latter\n\neffect may be mediated through Ca\n2+\n\n-dependent intracellular\n\nprocesses or pathways. While more investigation is necessary, this\n\nreciprocal regulation may allow for intervention in the crucial\n\ntransition between functional immune activation and reactive\n\nmicrogliosis.\n\nIn this study, we provided evidence demonstrating Kv1.3\n\nchannels to be an integral component of HIV-1 Tat-induced\n\nFigure 5.

Microglia were transfected with siRNA targeting\nKv1.3 (Kv1.3-siRNA) or nonspecific GAPD control siRNA (Ctrl-siRNAS) for\n48 or 72 hr, followed by an additional 24 hr exposure to Tat (200 ng/\nml). Cells were then harvested for detections of Kv1.3 mRNA (48 hr post-\ntransfection/24 hr Tat treatment) and Kv1.3 proteins (72 hr post-\ntransfection/24 hr Tat treatment).

This promising data opens the future possibility of using\n\nKv1.3 channel inhibitors as a novel strategy to combat HAND and\n\nother neurodegenerative disorders in which the pathophysiological\n\nprocess involves microglia-mediated immune and inflammatory\n\nresponses. In a previous in vivo study, we demonstrated the\n\nadministration of Kv channel antagonist 4-AP could ameliorate\n\nHIV-1-induced encephalitis and cognitive disorder, improving\n\nspatial learning and memory in a severe combined immunodefi-\n\ncient (SCID) mouse model of HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) [50].\n\nNevertheless, as Kv channel blockers selectively target immune\n\ncells including macrophage, microglia, and lymphocytes, the\n\ntherapeutic benefit of this approach must be carefully considered\n\nfor potential risks to the immune system. Of these cells, the most\n\nabundant Kv1.3 channel expression is reported to be found the\n\nhuman effector memory T cells (CD4\n+\nCCR7\n\n2\nCD45RA\n\n2\n), which\n\nregulate Th1 cell inflammatory responses [36,51,52]. The use of\n\nsmall molecule KV blockers, such as verapamil, dilitazem, and\n\nnifedipine, has been shown to reduce IL-12 secretion and inhibit T\n\ncell proliferation [53]. Notably, these immunomodulatory effects\n\nhave been found to depend heavily on the level of Kv1.3 channel\n\nexpression, which changes dramatically as T cells differentiate\n\nfrom naı̈ve to memory states or transition from resting to\n\nactivation [54,55,56]. Given that the immune response functions\n\nof microglia, macrophage, Helper T cells, and B cells remain\n\nbasically intact, the potential side effects of pharmacologically\n\nblocking Kv1.3 channels could be minimal [52,57]. In fact, the\n\npotential side effects of using KV channel blockers to treat a wide\n\nrange of autoimmune conditions, including those involving\n\neffector memory T cells, delayed type hypersensitivity, type 1\n\ndiabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and inflammato-\n\nry bone resorption, have been investigated without revealing any\n\ngeneralized immunesuppression [58,59,60,61]. Recently, the\n\nsafety of this approach was given further credence when the US\n\nFood and Drug Administration approved the KV channel blocker\n\ndalfampridine (Ampyra) as a treatment multiple sclerosis (http://\n\nwww.fad.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnouncements/\n\nucm198463.htm).\n\nIn summary, the present study serves to establish the integral\n\nrole of Kv1.3 channel activity in HIV-1 Tat-induced microglia-\n\nmediated neurotoxicity. The identification of Kv1.3 channels as a\n\npoint of intervention in this process may open new avenues for\n\ntherapeutic modalities. Given its feasibility and safety, it may now\n\nbe advantageous to consider studying a Kv1.3 channel-based\n\ntherapeutic approach in the treatment of HAND and other\n\nneurodegenerative disorders characterized by microglia-mediated\n\nneuroinflammation.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe Authors thank Ms. Julie Ditter, Ms. Robin Taylor, Ms. Johna Belling\n\nand Ms. Sandra Wiese for their excellent administrative support.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: JL HX.

Kv channel blockers ameliorated Tat-induced microg-\nlia neurotoxicity in rat hippocampus slices. Rat hippocampus\nslices were pretreated with MgTx (5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM)\nfor 30 min before addition of Tat (200 ng/ml). Immunohistochemistry\nor TUNEL staining was performed 24 hr later. A: Tat increased levels of\nKv1.3 expression that were co-localized with microglia (Iba1 staining) in\nrat hippocampus slices. Rat hippocampus slices were stained with\nmouse anti-Iba1 Ab (1:1000, red), whereas Kv1.3 was stained with goat\npolyclonal antibody (1:200, green). Images were visualized by confocal\nmicroscopy. B: TUNEL staining showed that Tat produced neuronal\napoptosis in rat hippocampus slices that was attenuated by MgTx, PAP,\nor 4-AP. Numerical numbers in each image panel represents the\naverage apoptotic cells (M 6 SD, n = 3 slices, 5 random visual fields\nwere counted in each slice) in experimental conditions as indicated.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0064904.g007\n\nFigure 6. Involvement of ERK1/2 MAPK pathway in Tat-\nmediated upregulation of KV1.3 expression. A: Western blot\nanalysis for ERK1/2 MAPK. Microglia were exposed to 200 ng/ml of Tat\nand harvested at indicated times. Protein expression was analyzed by\nimmunoblot using antibodies against ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK1/\n2) and total ERK1/2 (ERK1/2) MAPK. Tat up-regulated pERK1/2 MAPK in a\ntime window from 30 min to 5 hr. B: Kv channel antagonists inhibit\nERK1/2 MAPK phosphorylation. Microglia were treated with MgTx\n(5 nM), PAP (10 nM), or 4-AP (1 mM) for 30 min followed by Tat at\n200 ng/ml for additional 5 hr. Gel blots reveal a reduction of Tat-\ninduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in microglia treated with MgTx, PAP,\nor 4-AP, indicating a link between Kv 1.3 channel activation and ERK1/2\nMAPK signal pathway. C: Western blot results showing that the\nblockade of Tat enhancement of Kv1.3 expression in microglia was\nblocked by U0126, an inhibitor for MEK1 and MEK 2, further\ndemonstrating the link between ERK1/2 MAPK and Tat-induced\nincrease of Kv1.3 expression.
