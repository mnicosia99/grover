To investigate the effect of Yangjing Capsule (YC) extract on proliferation of GC-1 spermatogonia (spg) cells and the\nmechanism.Methods. GC-1 spg cells were treated with 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mL YC extract. MTT assay was performed to detect the\ncell viability. Flow cytometry was used to measure the cell cycle and apoptosis of GC-1 spg cells. Real-time PCR and western blot\nwere applied to determine the mRNA and protein expression of Oct-4 and Plzf. Gfrùõº1 knockdown and LY294002 (PI3K inhibitor)\nwere applied to explore the underlying mechanism. Results. After 48 h treatment of YC, the viability of GC-1 spg cells increased\nsignificantly and the ratio of apoptotic cells reduced significantly. The increased mRNA and protein expression of Oct-4 and\nPlzf suggested YC promoted self-renewal of GC-1 spg cells. Both Gfrùõº1 siRNAs and LY294002 treatments held back YC extract‚Äôs\nstimulation effects on mRNA and protein expression of Oct-4 and Plzf and consequently inhibited the proliferation of GC-1 spg\ncells induced by YC extract. Conclusion. YC extract could stimulate the proliferation of GC-1 spg cells. Partly via Gfrùõº1, YC extract\nis able to trigger the activation of PI3K pathway and finally lead to self-renewal of GC-1 spg cells.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAbout 15% of couples have problems in conceiving [1] and\ninfertility beset around 80 million people worldwide by\ncausing considerable psychological and financial burden. It\nis estimated that male reproductive dysfunction contributes\nto about half of infertile couples [2, 3]. Male infertility\ncould be caused by various reasons, for instance, failure\nin spermatogenesis, epididymal maturation or storage of\nsperm, abnormal sperm delivery or accessory gland function,\ngenetic or environmental factors, and sexual disorders [4, 5].\nAmong these causes, defects in spermatogenesis are the most\ncommon and account for 20%‚Äì25% of cases [6].\n\nSpermatogenesis occurs in the seminiferous tubules of the\ntestis with the seminiferous epithelium containing the devel-\noping germ cells and somatic Sertoli cells. Spermatogenesis\nis a continuous process by which the haploid germ cells are\nproduced from differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells\n(SSCs) through mitosis and meiosis [7]. SSCs are respon-\nsible for sustaining fertility by tightly balancing between\n\nself-renewal and differentiation. With the establishment of\nbalance, sperms are produced continually throughout the\nlifespan of an adult male [8‚Äì10]. Increased differentiation of\nSSCs at cost of self-renewal which destroys the balance would\nlead to male sterility [6]. Oct-4 and Plzf are considered to be\nresponsible for preserving the pluripotency and self-renewal\nof stem cells [11, 12]. They are generally accepted as stem cell\nmarkers as they are downregulated during differentiation.\n\nSelf-renewal and differentiation of SSCs are strictly regu-\nlated by a combination of extrinsic gene signals from the\nniche as well as intrinsic signal pathways. Glial cell line-\nderived neurotrophic factor (Gdnf), secreted by Sertoli\ncells, is specifically responsible for the maintenance and\nself-renewal of SSCs [13, 14]. By binding to glycosylphosphati-\ndylinositol- (GPI-) anchored cell surface molecule (Gfrùõº1),\nGdnf is able to trigger PI3K/AKT pathway and eventually\nlead to self-renewal of SSCs [15, 16]. It has already been\ndemonstrated that abnormal expression of extrinsic or intrin-\nsic signaling molecules can give rise to impaired sper-\nmatogenesis [17, 18]. Oligozoospermia, asthenozoospermia,\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\nVolume 2014, Article ID 640857, 9 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/640857\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/640857\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nteratozoospermia, and azoospermia are the most common\nclinical manifestation of male infertility resulting from\nimpaired spermatogenesis. In these cases, signal pathways\nregulating SSCs, such as PI3K/AKT pathway [19], are likely\nto be disrupted, thereby self-renewal of SSCs decreased and\nmale infertility occurred.\n\nThe Yangjing Capsule (YC), which is composed of Herba\nEpimedii Brevicornus, Placenta Hominis, Rhizoma Polygonati\nSibirici, Radix Rehmanniae Preparata, Angelica sinensis, and\nother components, has been suggested for the treatment\nof diseases of the reproductive system [20, 21]. Our pre-\nvious clinical study found that YC was very effective for\noligospermatism and can markedly increase sperm density\nfor patients with a sperm density of over 5 √ó 106/mL [22].\nWhile medical practice has proved the efficacy of Chinese\nherbal formulation, the underlying molecular mechanisms\nof YC improving male fertility remain elusive. Our present\nstudy is aimed to determine whether YC could promote self-\nrenewal of SSCs and explore the targeted signal pathways\ninvolved.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Chemicals. Dulbecco‚Äôs modified eagle‚Äôs medium\n(DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and lyophilized trypsin-\nEDTA were obtained from GIBCO BRL (Grand Island, NY,\nUSA). 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazolyl-2]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium\nbromide (MTT), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), sodium dode-\ncyl sulfate (SDS), and Tris/HCl were purchased from Sigma\n(St. Louis, MO, USA). The whole protein extraction kits\nwere purchased from Keygen (Keygen Biotech. Co. Ltd.,\nNanjing, China). Trizol reagent, PrimeScript RT Master\nMix, and SYBR Green PCR Master Mix reagent kits were\nobtained from TaKaRa (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian,\nChina). The primers were synthesized by Invitrogen Life\nTech (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Rabbit monoclonal anti-AKT\n(phospho S473), rabbit polyclonal anti-Plzf ab38739, and\nanti-Oct-4 ab18976 were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA,\nUSA). Mouse monoclonal anti-ùõΩ-actin was from Chemicon\n(Temecula, CA). Enhanced chemiluminescencewas obtained\nfrom Amersham Biosciences (Uppsala, Sweden).\n\n2.2. Preparation of YC Extract. The YC is composed of 11 tra-\nditional Chinese drugs: 13.3% Yinyanghuo (Herba Epimedii\nBrevicornus), 13.3% Muli (Concha Ostreae (calcined)), 13.3%\nWangbuliuxing (Semen Vaccariae Segetalis), 10% Huangqi\n(Radix Astragali Mongolici), 10% Danggui (Radix Angelicae\nSinensis), 6.7% Huangjing (Rhizoma Polygonati Sibirici),\n6.7% Shayuanzi (Semen Astragali Complanati), 6.7% Ziheche\n(Placenta Hominis), 6.7% Shudihuang (Radix Rehmanniae\nPreparata), 6.7% Lizhihe (Semen Litchi), and 6.7% Shuizhi\n(Hirudo).The YC extract was prepared based on themethods\ndescribed byKao et al. [23].The content of the YC (equivalent\nto 10 g of crude drug) was extracted with distilled water and\nsubsequently subjected to ultrasonic extraction for 45min.\nThe supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000 g\nand 4‚àòC for 30min to collect the supernatant, which was\nconcentrated to 100mL with a rotary evaporator at 60‚àòC.\nThe final concentration of the YC extract corresponded to\n\n100mg/mL of the crude herbal dose. The pH of the extract\nwas adjusted to 7.0, and the extract was sterilized by filtration\nand stored at ‚àí80‚àòC until use.\n\n2.3. siRNATransfection and PI3K Inhibition of GC-1 Spg Cells.\nGC-1 spg cells were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with\n10% FBS, 50 IU/mL penicillin, and 50 ùúág/mL streptomycin,\nand then incubated in a 5% CO\n\n2\nincubator (Thermo Fisher\n\nScientific, Rochester, USA) at 37‚àòC. For determining effects\nof YC extract on the self-renewal, GC-1 spg cells were treated\nwith 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mL YC extract and 20 ng/mL Gdnf\n(used as positive control), respectively. After 48 h, cells were\ncollected for assay of proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis.\nRNAs and protein were prepared to detect the expression\nof Plzf and Oct-4 by quantitative PCR and western blot.\nTo explore the underlying mechanism, Gfrùõº1 knockdown\nand PI3K inhibition were performed. For Gfrùõº1 knockdown,\n19-nucleotide siRNA sequences (sense: 5\U000f8020-GCC CUC ACA\nGGC UUC UGU U-3\U000f8020 and antisense: 3\U000f8020-CGG GAG UGU\nCCG AAG ACA A-5\U000f8020) targeting mouse Gfrùõº1 sequence\n(GCC CTC ACA GGC TTC TGT T) were designed using\nBLOCK-iT RNAi Designer (Invitrogen) and synthesized by\nInvitrogen [24]. The Stealth RNAi negative control obtained\nfrom Invitrogen was used as a control for monitoring\nnonsequence-specific effects. 50 pmol Stealth RNAi negative\ncontrol and Gfrùõº1 siRNA were transfected into GC-1 spg\ncells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the\nmanufacturer‚Äôs instruction. At 48 h after transfection, cells\nwere treated with 1mg/mL YC extract for 48 h and collected\nfor proliferation assay, quantitative PCR, and western blot.\nFor PI3K inhibition, GC-1 spg cells were exposed by 50 ùúáM\nLY294002 (targeting the ATP-binding site of the PI3K) for\nabrogating PI3K activation. 2 h later, 1mg/mL YC extract\nwas added and cells were collected for proliferation assay,\nquantitative PCR, and western blot.\n\n2.4. MTT Assay of Cell Proliferation. Cells were seeded in 96-\nwell plate for 48 h treatment of 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mL YC\nextract, 20 ng/mLGdnf, 50ùúáMLY294002, and 50 pmolGfrùõº1\nsiRNA, respectively (ùëõ = 5). MTT (5mg/mL) was added with\n20ùúáL to each well and incubated for another 4 h before it was\ndiscarded. Then the purple-blue MTT formazan precipitate\nwas dissolved in 100ùúáL dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The\nabsorbance (OD) was measured at 490 nm.The proliferation\nratio was calculated by the following formula: proliferation\nratio (%) = (average ODtreatment group/average ODcontrol group ‚àí\n1) √ó 100%.\n\n2.5. Cell Cycle and Apoptosis Assay. Cells were incubated in\n6-well plates for 48 h treatment. Then cells were digested\nand washed. Cell cycle and apoptosis analysis were measured\nwith flow cytometer (BD, Franklin, NJ, USA) according to\nthe instructions of the Cycletest Plus DNA assay kit and\nAnnexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit, respectively.The\npercentages of cells in G0/G1 phase, S phase, andG2/M phase\nwere evaluated by the ModFit software (BD, Franklin, NJ,\nUSA). The percentages of early stage and late stage apoptosis\nwere evaluated with CellQuest software (BD, Franklin, NJ,\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nUSA). Total apoptosis rate was equal to early stage apoptosis\nplus late stage apoptosis.\n\n2.6. RNA Isolation and Real-Time PCR. Cells at a density of\n4√ó 105/well were plated in 6-well plates for 48 h treatment.\nThe total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent, measured\nby spectrometry at an OD260/280, and reverse transcribed\ninto cDNA in a total volume of 20ùúáL with PrimeScript RT\nMaster Mix. All of the RT-PCR reactions were performed\nwith a CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\nHercules, CA) using SYBR Green chemistry (Bio-Rad Lab-\noratories). GAPDH was selected as the control. The primer\nsequenceswere as follows:GAPDH, sense: 5\U000f8020-AGGTTGTCT\nCCT GCG ACT TCA-3\U000f8020 and antisense: 5\U000f8020-GGG TGG TCC\nAGG GTT TCT TAC T-3\U000f8020; Plzf, sense: 5\U000f8020-CAC ACA GGC\nAGA CCC ATA CT-3\U000f8020 and antisense: 5\U000f8020-TTT GTG GCT\nCTT GAG TGT GC-3\U000f8020; OCT-4, sense: 5\U000f8020-CTT GCT GCA\nGAA GTG GGT GGA GGA A-3\U000f8020 and antisense: 5\U000f8020-CTG\nCAG TGT GGG TTT CGG GCA-3\U000f8020 [25, 26]. The reactions\nwere performed at 94‚àòC for 3min followed by 40 cycles at\n94‚àòC for 30 s, 55‚àòC for 30 s, and 72‚àòC for 30 s. The final\nextension was carried out for 5min at 72‚àòC. A melting curve\nanalysis was performed to confirm the products. The relative\nabundances of the target mRNAs were calculated using the\n2\n‚àíŒîŒîCt method. The data were expressed as the percentage of\ncontrol (100%).\n\n2.7. Protein Extraction and Western Blot Analysis. Cells were\nseeded in 60mm dishes at a density of 1 √ó 106/well for\n48 h treatment. The cells were harvested, washed three times\nwith precooled PBS, and treated with cell lysis buffer for\nwestern blot analysis. After centrifugation at 12.000 g at 4‚àòC\nfor 20min, the supernatants were collected and stored at\n‚àí80‚àòC until analysis.\n\nThe concentrations of protein were measured by the Bio-\nRad Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).\nThe proteins were normalized to 50 ùúág/lane, separated by 12%\nsodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(SDS-PAGE), and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose\nmembranes. After treatment with blocking solution (5%\nskim milk powder in Tris-buffered saline) at 37‚àòC for 1 h,\nthe membranes were incubated overnight with the primary\nantibodies rabbit monoclonal anti-pAKT (1 : 5000), rabbit\npolyclonal anti-Plzf (1 : 500), rabbit polyclonal anti-Oct-4\n(1 : 400), or mouse monoclonal anti-ùõΩ-actin (1 : 5000) at 4‚àòC.\nAfter washing with TBS three times, the membranes were\nincubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:\n5000) at 37‚àòC for 1 h and examined using enhanced chemi-\nluminescence. The relative protein levels in each sample\nwere normalized to the levels of ùõΩ-actin to standardize the\nvariations in loading. Densitometric analyses of the scanned\nimmunoblotting images were performed using a Quantity\nOne image system. The data are expressed as a percentage of\nthe control (100%).\n\n2.8.

Results\n\n3.1. Effects of YC Extract on Proliferation of GC-1 Spg Cells.\nThe effects of YC extract on cell proliferation are shown in\nFigure 1. Gdnf, responsible for proliferation of SSCs, was used\nas positive control. In the presence of 0.01, 0.1, and 1mg/mL\nYC extract for 48 h, OD values increased in a dose dependent\nmanner.The proliferation rates of GC-1 spg cells increased by\n13.38%, 32.47%, and 46.04%, respectively. In the presence of\n20 ng/mL Gdnf for 48 h, the proliferation rates of GC-1 spg\ncells significantly increased by 47.98%. There are no evident\nchanges observed with the treatment of 50ùúáM LY294002 or\n50 pmol Gfrùõº1 siRNA.\n\n3.2. Effects of YC Extract on Cell Cycle of GC-1 Spg Cells.\nResults of cell cycle assay of GC-1 spg cells are shown in\nFigure 2. The percentage of S phase in control group was\n30.52% (Figure 2(a)), and after 48 h treatment of different\ndoses of YC extract, the percentage of S phase evidently rose\nto 37.45%, 41.47%, and 46.30%, respectively (Figures 2(b),\n2(c), and 2(d)). A decline of percentage of G0/G1 phase was\nalso observed. These data suggested that YC extract could\nadvance the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase and\npromote proliferation of spg cells.\n\n3.3. Effects of YC Extract on Apoptosis of GC-1 Spg Cells. As\nshown in Figure 3, total apoptosis rate was equal to early stage\napoptosis (LR) plus late stage apoptosis (UR). The apoptosis\nrates are 9.68 (a), 8.95 (b), 5.31 (c), and 2.38 (d), respectively.\n0.01mg/mL YC extract had no evident effect on apoptosis of\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nDiploid: 100.00%\nDip G1: 54.45% at 25.56\nDip G2: 15.03% at 49.26\nDip S: 30.52% G2/G1: 1.93\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr\n\n1200\n\n800\n\n400\n\n0\n\nChannels (FL2-H)\n0 20 40 60 80\n\nCV (%): 4.64\n\n(a)\n\nDiploid: 100.00%\nDip G1: 53.48% at 26.49\nDip G2: 9.07% at 50.69\nDip S: 37.45% G2/G1: 1.91\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr\n\n1200\n\n800\n\n400\n\n0\n\nChannels (FL2-H)\n0 20 40 60 80\n\nCV (%): 3.59\n\n(b)\n\nDiploid: 100.00%\nDip G1: 51.66% at 25.62\nDip G2: 6.87% at 49.07\nDip S: 41.47% G2/G1: 1.92\nCV (%): 3.08\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr\n\n1200\n\n800\n\n400\n\n0\n\nChannels (FL2-H)\n0 20 40 60 80\n\n(c)\n\nDiploid: 100.00%\nDip G1: 47.34% at 26.39\nDip G2: 6.36% at 49.86\nDip S: 46.30% G2/G1: 1.89\n\nN\num\n\nbe\nr\n\n1200\n\n800\n\n400\n\n0\n\nChannels (FL2-H)\n0 20 40 60 80\n\nCV (%): 3.88\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 2: Effects of YC extract on cell cycle of GC-1 spg cells.

However, 0.1 and 1mg/mL YC extract notably\ninhibited cell apoptosis.\n\n3.4. Effects of the YCExtract on the Expression ofOct-4 andPlzf\nmRNAs and Proteins. Oct-4 and Plzf were chosen as stem\ncell markers to confirm the undifferentiated status of GC-1\nspg cells. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) showed that the expression\nof Oct-4 and Plzf mRNAs increased significantly by exposure\nof 0.1, 1mg/mL YC extract and 20 ng/mL Gdnf. Accordingly,\nFigure 4(c) showed that the expression of Oct-4 and Plzf\nproteins increased evidently at the same condition.The result\nsuggested that YC extract could promote self-renewal of GC-1\nspg cells.\n\n3.5. Gfrùõº1 Knockdown or PI3K Inhibition Blocks YC Extract\nInduced Proliferation of GC-1 Spg Cells. To investigate the\n\nmechanism of YC extract induced proliferation of GC-1 spg\ncells, Gfrùõº1 knockdown and PI3K inhibitionwere performed.\nAs shown in Figure 5, YC extract significantly stimulated the\ncell proliferation.However, bothGfrùõº1 siRNA and LY294002,\nan inhibitor of PI3K, could evidently abrogate the stimulative\neffect of YC extract.\n\n3.6. Gfrùõº1 Knockdown or PI3K Inhibition Blocks YC Extract\nInduced Upregulation of Oct-4 and Plzf Expression. The\nresults of Figure 6 showed that both Gfrùõº1 siRNA and\nLY294002 could abolish the upregulation of Oct-4 and Plzf\nexpression at levels of mRNA and protein induced by YC\nextract.Meanwhile, upregulation of pAKTprotein expression\ninduced by YC extract, evidence for PI3K pathway activa-\ntion, was also suppressed by Gfrùõº1 siRNA and LY294002.\nCombined with the results above, it could be inferred that\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\n\nPI\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n0\n\nAnnexin V FITC\n10\n\n0\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n2\n10\n\n3\n10\n\n4\n\nQuad\nUL\nUR\nLL\nLR\n\nGated (%)\n0.13\n\n5.71\n\n90.19\n\n3.97\n\n(a)\n\nPI\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n0\n\nAnnexin V FITC\n10\n\n0\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n2\n10\n\n3\n10\n\n4\n\nUL\nUR\nLL\nLR\n\nQuad\n0.15\n\n5.41\n\n90.91\n\n3.54\n\nGated (%)\n\n(b)\n\nPI\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n0\n\nAnnexin V FITC\n10\n\n0\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n2\n10\n\n3\n10\n\n4\n\nUL\nUR\nLL\nLR\n\nQuad\n0.14\n\n1.63\n\n94.56\n\n3.68\n\nGated (%)\n\n(c)\n\nPI\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n0\n\nAnnexin V FITC\n10\n\n0\n10\n\n1\n10\n\n2\n10\n\n3\n10\n\n4\n\nUL\nUR\nLL\nLR\n\nQuad\n0.01\n\n0.66\n\n97.61\n\n1.72\n\nGated (%)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3: Effects of YC extract on apoptosis of GC-1 spg cells.

The analysis was performed in triplicate and representative data was shown.\n\nGfrùõº1 and PI3K played crucial roles in the promotion of self-\nrenewal induced by YC extract.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nYC extract has been used for male infertility therapy in\nclinic for years, but the mechanisms still remain unclear. Our\nresults suggested that YC extract could stimulate self-renewal\nof SSCs and protect SSCs from apoptosis, thus improving\nspermatogenesis.\n\nOct-4 is considered to be the master transcription factor\nresponsible for preserving the pluripotency and self-renewal\nof stem cells [11, 25]. It is downregulated during differentia-\ntion with loss of pluripotency [27‚Äì29] and generally accepted\nas a stem cell marker. Plzf has also drawn wide attention\ndue to its role of regulating differentiation. Plzf is claimed\nto be essential for maintaining pluripotent properties and\nself-renewal as its expression is confined to stem cells and\nearly progenitor cells [12, 30, 31]. While Plzf is expressed\n\nat high level in undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells, its\nexpression declined when differentiation started. Our results\nshowed that 48 h treatment of YC extract not only promoted\nthe proliferation of GC-1 spg cells but also promoted self-\nrenewal of cells proved by enhanced expression of Oct-4 and\nPlzf mRNAs and proteins, which were quite similar to the\neffect of Gdnf treatment (Figures 1 and 4). As a matter of\ncourse, we deduced that YC extract probably functioned in\nthe similar ways as Gdnf.\n\nGdnf, secreted by Sertoli cells, is so far the only known\nparacrine factor specifically responsible for the maintenance\nand self-renewal of SSCs in vivo [13, 14]. Lin et al. reported\nthat Gdnf is a member of the transforming growth fac-\ntor beta (TGF-ùõΩ) superfamily [32]. Gdnf signals through\na multicomponent receptor complex are composed of the\nRet receptor tyrosine kinase and Gfrùõº1 [33, 34]. Gdnf can\ntrigger various downstream signal pathways to promote cell\nsurvival and self-renewal via GPI-linked protein Gfrùõº1 [35,\n36].

To confirm our hypothesis,\nwe used siRNA to knockdown Gfrùõº1 expression in current\nresearch. Figure 5 showed that Gfrùõº1 knockdown almost\nentirely abolished the proliferous effect of GC-1 cells induced\nby YC extract. Corresponding with this, Gfrùõº1 knockdown\nalso abrogated the elevated expression of Oct-4 and Plzf\nmRNAs and proteins induced by YC extract (Figure 6). On\nthe basis of these results, we inferred that YC extract exerts\nbiological effects partly via Gfrùõº1.\n\nTo further investigate the mechanism of YC extract, we\ntreated GC-1 cells with 50ùúáM LY294002 to inhibit PI3K\npathway before the treatment of YC extract. PI3Kpathwayhas\nbeen demonstrated to play a central role in the Gdnf induced\nself-renewal of SSCs [37, 38]. The binding of Gdnf to Gfrùõº1\ntriggers phosphorylation of SRC-kinase family proteins fol-\nlowed by activation of PI3K/AKT pathway and eventually\nleads to self-renewal of SSCs via expression ofN-myc gene [15,\n16]. As has been stated, likeGdnf, YC extract also induces self-\nrenewal via Gfrùõº1, and activation of PI3K pathway is most\nlikely very crucial in YC extract‚Äôs effects. As expected, pAKT\nprotein expression increased evidently after treatment of YC\nextract standing for PI3K pathway activation (Figure 6). PI3K\npathway inhibition evidently removed the proliferous effect\nof GC-1 spg cells induced by YC extract which was shown\nin Figure 5. Consistent with this, the upregulated Oct-4 and\nPlzf mRNAs and proteins also dropped down by LY294002\ntreatment (Figure 6).\n\nIn summary, YC extract could improve spermatogenesis\nby means of promoting self-renewal of SSCs and protecting\nSSCs from apoptosis, which were verified by cell proliferation\nand upregulation of OCT-4 and Plzf expression after the\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\nO\n\nct\n-4\n\n/G\nA\n\nPD\nH\n\n m\nR\n\nN\nA\n\n (f\nol\n\nd \nof\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n)\n\n‚ñ≥‚ñ≥\n\n‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó‚àó ##\n\nC\non\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nLY\n2\n9\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nC\non\n\n si\nR\n\nN\nA\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nG\nfr\n\na1\nsi\n\nR\nN\n\nA\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\nPl\nzf\n\n/G\nA\n\nPD\nH\n\n m\nR\n\nN\nA\n\n (f\nol\n\nd \nof\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n) ‚ñ≥‚ñ≥\n‚àó\n\n‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó‚àó ##\n\nC\non\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nLY\n2\n9\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nC\non\n\n si\nR\n\nN\nA\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nG\nfr\n\na1\nsi\n\nR\nN\n\nA\n\n(b)\n\npAKT\n\nOct-4\n\nPlzf\n\nùõΩ-Actin\n\nC\non\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nLY\n2\n9\n4\n0\n0\n2\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nC\non\n\n si\nR\n\nN\nA\n\nYC\n e\n\nxt\nra\n\nct\n+\n\nG\nfr\n\na1\nsi\n\nR\nN\n\nA\n\n(c)\nFigure 6: Gfrùõº1 knockdown or PI3 K inhibition blocks YC extract induced upregulation ofOct-4 and Plzf expression.

The results showed that both\nGfrùõº1 knockdown and PI3K inhibition were able to evidently\nremove the cell proliferation and upregulation of OCT-4\nand Plzf expression induced by YC extract. Therefore, we\nconcluded that, partly via Gfrùõº1, YC extract could trigger\nthe activation of PI3K pathway and finally lead to self-\nrenewal of SSCs.
