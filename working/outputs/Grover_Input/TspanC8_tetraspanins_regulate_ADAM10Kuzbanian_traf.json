One such mecha-\nnism involves the regulated processing of cell surface proteins \nby proteases of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) \nfamily. ADAM proteases are type I transmembrane proteins that \ncleave membrane proteins at sites located close to the mem-\nbrane, thereby leading to the extracellular release of the ect-\nodomain. This shedding mechanism is essential for cytokine \nsecretion, cell–cell adhesion, and signaling by transmembrane \nligands and receptors (Blobel, 2005; Reiss and Saftig, 2009).\n\nADAM10 is one of the best-characterized members of \nthe ADAM family (Blobel, 2005; Reiss and Saftig, 2009). \n\nADAM10 has several important targets including the amyloid \nprecursor protein (APP) involved in Alzheimer’s disease, Fas \nligand, several EGF receptor ligands, and Notch receptors. \nGenetic and biochemical studies have shown that ADAM10, \nknown as Kuzbanian (Kuz) in Drosophila, regulates the ligand-\ndependent processing of Notch at an extracellular site called S2 \n(Pan and Rubin, 1997; Sotillos et al., 1997; Wen et al., 1997; \nBrou et al., 2000; Mumm et al., 2000; Hartmann et al., 2002; \nLieber et al., 2002; Bozkulak and Weinmaster, 2009; van Tetering \net al., 2009). This site is normally protected from ADAM10 \ncleavage by three Lin12-Notch repeats (LNRs). Upon ligand \nbinding, a ligand-induced conformational change is thought to \ndisplace the LNRs, thereby exposing the S2 site to ADAM10 \n(Gordon et al., 2007; Tiyanont et al., 2011; Meloty-Kapella  \net al., 2012). S2 cleavage by ADAM10 generates a membrane-\ntethered form of Notch that is further processed by \ue067-secretase \n\nT\nhe metalloprotease ADAM10/Kuzbanian cata-\nlyzes the ligand-dependent ectodomain shedding \nof Notch receptors and activates Notch. Here, we \n\nshow that the human tetraspanins of the evolutionary \nconserved TspanC8 subfamily (Tspan5, Tspan10, Tspan14, \nTspan15, Tspan17, and Tspan33) directly interact with \nADAM10, regulate its exit from the endoplasmic reticu-\nlum, and that four of them regulate ADAM10 surface \nexpression levels. In an independent RNAi screen in \nDrosophila, two TspanC8 genes were identified as Notch \nregulators. Functional analysis of the three Drosophila \n\nTspanC8 genes (Tsp3A, Tsp86D, and Tsp26D) indi-\ncated that these genes act redundantly to promote Notch \nsignaling. During oogenesis, TspanC8 genes were up-\nregulated in border cells and regulated Kuzbanian dis-\ntribution, Notch activity, and cell migration. Furthermore, \nthe human TspanC8 tetraspanins Tspan5 and Tspan14 \npositively regulated ligand-induced ADAM10-dependent \nNotch1 signaling. We conclude that TspanC8 tetraspa-\nnins have a conserved function in the regulation of \nADAM10 trafficking and activity, thereby positively \nregulating Notch receptor activation.\n\nTspanC8 tetraspanins regulate ADAM10/Kuzbanian \ntrafficking and promote Notch activation in flies  \nand mammals\n\nEmmanuel Dornier,1,2 Franck Coumailleau,3,5 Jean-François Ottavi,1,2 Julien Moretti,4,6 Claude Boucheix,1,2  \nPhilippe Mauduit,1,2 François Schweisguth,3,5 and Eric Rubinstein1,2\n\n1Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale (INSERM), U1004, F-94807 Villejuif, France\n2Université Paris-Sud, Institut André Lwoff, F-94807 Villejuif, France\n3Département de Biologie du Développement, et 4Unité de Signalisation Moléculaire et Activation Cellulaire, Institut Pasteur, F-75015 Paris, France\n5URA 2578, et 6URA 2582, Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS), F-75015 Paris, France\n\n© 2012 Dornier et al.

To reveal specific and direct \ninteractions, coimmunoprecipitations were performed after \nlysis with digitonin. Using digitonin, ADAM10 did not interact \nwith the classical tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81, CD82, and \nCD151, whereas CD9 still interacted with CD9P-1 (Fig. 1 A \nand unpublished data). We conclude that the previously reported \ninteractions of tetraspanins with ADAM10 were indirect.\n\nThe lack of digitonin-resistant interactions between \nADAM10 and classical tetraspanins prompted us to investigate \nwhether less well-characterized tetraspanins could be the direct \npartners of ADAM10. We initially selected a subset of tetraspanins \nidentified through database mining (Serru et al., 2000). Because \nno antibodies were available, V5- or GFP-tagged tetraspanins \nwere transiently expressed into PC3 cells that express high \nlevels of ADAM10. Tspan5 (NET-4), but not Tspan1 (NET-1) \nor Tspan9 (NET-5), was found to coimmunoprecipitate ADAM10 \nafter digitonin lysis (Fig. 1, B and C).\n\nTspan5 belongs to a subfamily of tetraspanins that are \ncharacterized by the presence of eight cysteines in the large \nextracellular domain (Boucheix and Rubinstein, 2001; Huang  \net al., 2005). We refer to this family here as TspanC8. This family \nalso includes Tspan10 (occulospanin), Tspan14 (DC-TM4F2), \nTspan15 (NET-7), Tspan17, and Tspan33 (penumbra). By con-\ntrast with most tetraspanins, TspanC8 family members appeared \nto be evolutionarily conserved from invertebrates to mammals \n(Fig. S1). ADAM10 was found to interact in a digitonin-resistant \nmanner with GFP-tagged Tspan14, Tspan15, Tspan33, and, \nto a lesser extent, with Tspan10 and Tspan17 (Fig. 1 C). By \ncontrast, two GFP-tagged non-TspanC8 tetraspanins, CD9 \nand Tspan12, did not coimmunoprecipitate ADAM10 (Fig. 1 C).  \nA Tspan5 molecule mutated at all four putative palmitoylation \nsites still interacted with ADAM10 (Fig. 1 D). Because inter-\nactions between tetraspanins rely to a large extent on their palmi-\ntoylation (Berditchevski et al., 2002; Charrin et al., 2002; Yang \net al., 2002), this result indicated that ADAM10 interacted \ndirectly with Tspan5. Direct interactions of ADAM10 with \nTspanC8 were further suggested by the detection of com-\nplexes containing ADAM10 and Tspan5, Tspan14, Tspan15, \nand Tspan33 after chemical cross-linking (Fig. 1 E). Together, \nthese biochemical data indicate that ADAM10 directly interacts \nwith TspanC8 tetraspanins.\n\nGenetic identification of TspanC8 \ntetraspanins as Notch regulators\nIn a parallel approach, two genes of the TspanC8 family, Tsp3A \nand Tsp86D, were identified in an RNAi screen for Notch regu-\nlators in Drosophila. Conditional silencing was achieved using \nthe binary UAS/GAL4 system in combination with the thermo-\nsensitive GAL80ts inhibitor. We used the apterous-Gal4 driver \n(ap-Gal4) to direct dsRNA expression in imaginal tissues \ngiving rise to the adult dorsal thorax. 11,199 UAS-dsRNA \ntransgenic lines targeting 6,020 genes, i.e., 40% of the fly \ngenome, were screened. This primary screen led to the identifica-\ntion of 272 genes with previously unknown function in sensory \norgan development (unpublished data). The silencing of Tsp3A \nand Tsp86D in imaginal tissues resulted in a weak increase in the \nnumber of adult sensory bristles (Figs. S2 and S3), a phenotype \n\nat an S3 site located within the transmembrane domain of \nNotch. S3 cleavage results in the release of the Notch intracel-\nlular domain (NICD) that acts in the nucleus to regulate the \ntranscription of Notch target genes (Lecourtois and Schweisguth, \n1998; Schroeter et al., 1998; Struhl and Adachi, 1998; De Strooper \net al., 1999; Kopan and Ilagan, 2009).\n\nADAM10 was recently shown to associate with several \ntetraspanins (Arduise et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009). Tetraspanins \nare integral membrane proteins with four transmembrane \nsegments, three short intracellular domains, and a specific fold in \nthe largest of the two extracellular domains. They are expressed \nin many cell types and have been implicated in various biologi-\ncal processes including cell migration, cell fusion, lymphocyte \nactivation, as well as viral and parasitic infections (Hemler, \n2005; Charrin et al., 2009). Tetraspanins are believed to play  \na role in membrane compartmentalization. This hypothesis is \nbased to a large extent on their unique ability to interact with \none another and with non-tetraspanin integral proteins to form a \ndynamic network of interactions (Hemler, 2005; Charrin et al., \n2009). Inside this “tetraspanin web” or “tetraspanin-enriched \nmicrodomains,” tetraspanins specifically interact with a limited \nnumber of partner proteins to form primary complexes. These \nin turn assemble through tetraspanin–tetraspanin interaction \nto generate higher order complexes. Primary complexes can be \nisolated from higher order complexes using detergents such as \ndigitonin, which disrupt tetraspanin–tetraspanin interactions \nand/or precipitate higher order complexes. Such biochemical \napproaches have been instrumental to show that the integrins \n\ue0613\ue0621 and \ue0616\ue0621 form primary complexes with the tetraspanin \nCD151 and that the Ig domain-containing proteins CD9P-1/\nEWI-F and EWI-2 are partners of both CD9 and CD81 (Yauch \net al., 1998; Serru et al., 1999; Charrin et al., 2001, 2003; Stipp \net al., 2001a,b). By contrast, the specific tetraspanins that directly \ninteract with ADAM10 to form primary complexes have not \nbeen identified.\n\nIn this study, members of a subfamily of tetraspanins \nthat we named TspanC8 were identified as direct and specific part-\nners of ADAM10. In an independent large-scale RNAi screen \nin Drosophila, we uncovered two TspanC8 genes as positive \nregulators of Notch. Using a combination of in vitro and  \nin vivo assays, we show that TspanC8 tetraspanins regulate the \nexit of ADAM10/Kuzbanian from the ER, promote its accumu-\nlation at the cell surface, and thereby regulate Notch receptor \nactivation in both flies and mammals.\n\nResults\nBiochemical identification of TspanC8 \ntetraspanins as direct partners  \nof ADAM10\nSeveral tetraspanins were previously shown to interact with \nthe mature form of ADAM10 (\ue07a68 kD under nonreducing \nconditions) but not with the immature one (\ue07a100 kD, with its \nprodomain; Arduise et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2009). These coimmuno-\nprecipitation experiments were however performed using a \ndetergent, Brij 97, that preserved tetraspanin–tetraspanin inter-\nactions (Fig. 1 A) and therefore did not discriminate between \n\nhttp://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201201133/DC1\nhttp://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201201133/DC1\nhttp://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.201201133/DC1\n\n\n483Regulation of ADAM10/Kuzbanian by TspanC8 • Dornier et al.\n\nMummery-Widmer et al. (2009) were weaker than those used \nin our screen (not depicted). Thus, this screen identified Tsp3A \nand Tsp86D as potential regulators of Notch.\n\nThe Drosophila TspanC8 family includes a third member, \nTsp26A, not tested in our screen. Silencing of Tsp26A did not \naffect bristle density (Figs. S2 and S3). The weak (or lack of) RNAi \nphenotypes seen for the TspanC8 genes may be due to the partial \nnature of the silencing effect by dsRNA (Dietzl et al., 2007) \n\nindicative of reduced Notch activity (Hartenstein and Posakony, \n1990). A similar effect was observed in secondary screens using \ndsRNA and miRNA constructs that did not overlap with the \ndsRNA transgenes used in the screen (Fig. S3), therefore  \narguing against off-target effects. Of note, the Tsp3A and \nTsp86D genes were not found in a previous bristle screen for \nNotch regulators (Mummery-Widmer et al., 2009). Consis-\ntent with this, the Tsp3A and Tsp86D RNAi lines used by \n\nFigure 1. Several TspanC8 tetraspanins interact with ADAM10 in a digitonin-resistant manner.

Consistent with our FACS results, ADAM10 \nwas detected at the surface of nonpermeabilized HCT116 and \nPC3 cells but was barely detectable at the surface of HeLa \ncells (Fig. 3 C). However, a perinuclear pool of ADAM10 \nwas detected in HeLa cells upon permeabilization (Fig. 3 C). \nThis intracellular pool colocalized with PDI, an ER marker \n(Fig. 3 D), suggesting that ADAM10 may be retained in the \nER of HeLa cells. Additionally, RT-qPCR analysis showed that \nHeLa cells expressed low levels of TspanC8, whereas HCT116 \nand PC3 cells expressed high levels of Tspan14 and Tspan15, \nrespectively (Fig. 3 E). Thus, accumulation of ADAM10 in the \nER correlated with low levels of TspanC8, suggesting that \nTspanC8 tetraspanins may regulate the ER exit of ADAM10.\n\nTspanC8 tetraspanins promote the ER exit  \nand increase cell surface expression  \nof ADAM10\nAs a first test to determine whether TspanC8 tetraspanins regulate \nthe ER exit of ADAM10, we examined whether the cell surface \naccumulation of ADAM10 could be restored in HeLa cells \nby expressing GFP-tagged versions of TspanC8 tetraspanins. \nSurface levels of ADAM10 were increased up to fivefold upon \ntransient transfection of Tspan5, Tspan14, Tspan15, and Tspan33 \n(Fig. 4 A), and this was associated with an accumulation of \nmature ADAM10 (Fig. 4 B). Maximal levels of ADAM10  \nexpression at the cell surface were reached with moderate levels \nof these tetraspanins. This regulation of ADAM10 appeared \nto be independent from tetraspanin–tetraspanin interactions \nbecause expression of Tspan5-plm, i.e., mutated at predicted \npalmitoylation sites, similarly increased ADAM10 surface levels. \nAdditionally, this regulation was specific of TspanC8 because \ntransfection of CD9 or Tspan12 had no effect. Conversely, \nexpression of TspanC8 proteins did not affect the expression \nlevel of ADAM17 (Fig. S4).\n\nConfocal microscopy analysis shows that expression of \nTspan5, Tspan14, Tspan15, or Tspan33 led to the redistribution \nof ADAM10 from the ER to the cell surface of HeLa cells, \nwhere it colocalized with the transfected TspanC8 (Fig. 5 A). To \ntest whether ADAM10 interacts with TspanC8 at the cell sur-\nface, cell surface proteins of HeLa cells stably expressing or not \nTspan5, Tspan14, or Tspan15 were biotinylated and lysates \nwere subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-ADAM10 or \nanti-GFP antibodies (Fig. 4 C). In transfected cells, but not in \ncontrol cells, anti-GFP precipitated a biotin-labeled protein that \nco-migrated with ADAM10 (Fig. 4 C) and that was revealed \nwith the anti-ADAM10 mAb in dual-color Western blots.  \nImportantly, in these experiments the level of association of \nADAM10 with the transfected TspanC8 was higher than in the \n\nor to genetic redundancy. To test this possibility, different si-\nlencing combinations were tested. All yielded stronger phenotypes \nthan individual silencing (Fig. S3). Strikingly, silencing all three \ngenes or silencing Tsp3A and Tsp26A in heterozygous Tsp86D \nflies was associated with an increase in the number of sensory \norgan precursor cells (SOPs; Fig. 2, B and E), a transformation \nof external sensory cells into internal cells (Fig. 2, C and F), and \nthereby led to a dramatic bristle loss phenotype (Fig. 2, A and D; \nand Fig. S3). These three phenotypes are indicative of a \nstrong decrease of Notch activity (Hartenstein and Posakony, \n1990). We therefore conclude that these genes act redundantly \nto regulate the activity of Notch. Notch-like phenotypes were \nalso observed in adult wings (Fig. S3) and in ovaries (see \nfollowing paragraphs). Thus, the Tsp3A, Tsp26A, and Tsp86D \ngenes are required to regulate Notch activity in several develop-\nmental contexts.\n\nWe next asked whether these TspanC8 genes act in signal-\nsending cells to promote ligand activity or in signal-receiving \ncells to promote receptor activity. To distinguish between these two \npossibilities, we used a clone border assay that measures the \nrelative ability of cells of different genotypes to compete for \nthe adoption of the SOP fate along mosaic clone borders (Heitzler \nand Simpson, 1991). In this assay, cells receiving a weaker \ninhibitory signal are more likely to become SOPs, whereas cells \nsending a weaker inhibitory signal are more likely to adopt a \nnon-SOP fate. We therefore scored the genotype of SOPs  \nlocated along the clone borders and found that cells with re-\nduced levels of Tsp3A, Tsp26A, or Tsp86D were more likely \nto become SOPs (Fig. 2, G and H). This indicated that the \nTspanC8 genes act in signal-receiving cells to promote Notch \nactivity. Because the silencing of TspanC8 had no significant effect \nof the levels and distribution of Notch and Delta (Fig. 2, I–J\ue039\ue039), \nwe wondered whether TspanC8 might regulate Notch indirectly \nvia Kuz, the fly homologue of ADAM10, which also acts in signal-\nreceiving cells to promote the S2 cleavage of Notch (Klein, \n2002; Lieber et al., 2002). Consistent with this hypothesis, a \nMyc-tagged version of Kuz was found to interact in a digitonin-\nresistant manner with GFP-Tsp3A in Drosophila S2 cells \n(Fig. 1 F). Thus, the molecular interaction between ADAM10/\nKuz and TspanC8 is evolutionarily conserved.\n\nSurface accumulation of ADAM10 \ncorrelates with high TspanC8 levels\nOur identification of TspanC8 tetraspanins as direct partners of \nADAM10 and positive regulators of Notch suggested that these \nproteins may have an essential and conserved function in the \nregulation of ADAM10/Kuz. To test whether human TspanC8 \ntetraspanins regulate ADAM10, we screened various carcinoma \ncell lines for surface expression of ADAM10 and selected three \ncell lines with high (HCT116 and PC3) and low (HeLa) surface \nexpression of ADAM10 for further analysis (Fig. 3 A).

This stronger association may be due \nin part to the absence of competition with endogenous TspanC8 \nin HeLa cells. We therefore conclude that the interaction of \nADAM10 with these TspanC8 tetraspanins is quantitatively im-\nportant and occurs at the cell surface.\n\nIn these experiments, Tspan10 and Tspan17 appeared \nto behave differently than the other TspanC8: Tspan17 had  \nonly a moderate effect on ADAM10 surface expression and \nTspan10 did not change ADAM10 surface expression or matu-\nration (Fig. 4, A and B). Nevertheless, Tspan10 and Tspan17 \nappeared to relocalize ADAM10 into a Tspan10- and Tspan17-\npositive intracellular compartment marked by CD63, a marker \nof late endosomes (Fig. 5 A and Fig. S4 B), suggesting that \nTspan10 and Tspan17 might also promote the ER exit of \nADAM10. Together, these results indicated that TspanC8 \ntetraspanins promote the ER exit and, with the exception of \nTspan10 and Tspan17, cell surface accumulation of ADAM10.\n\nWe next examined the effect of TspanC8 tetraspanins on \nthe distribution of Kuz in transfected S2 Drosophila cells. \nExpression of GFP-tagged Tsp86D and Tsp3A led to a signifi-\ncant change in the distribution of Myc-tagged Kuz. In control \ncells, only 4 ± 1% of the Kuz-expressing cells exhibited a clear \nplasma membrane localization of Kuz. Expression of Tsp86D \nand Tsp3A increased the percentage of cells with Kuz localiz-\ning predominantly at the plasma membrane to 9 ± 3 and 22 ± 2%, \nrespectively (Fig. 5, B–B\ue039\ue039). We therefore propose that the \nregulation of Kuz/ADAM10 distribution by TspanC8 is con-\nserved across species.\n\nEndogenous TspanC8 tetraspanins are \nrequired for the ER exit of ADAM10\nWe next investigated whether endogenous TspanC8 are re-\nquired for the surface accumulation of ADAM10. The Tspan14 \nand Tspan15 genes were silenced using siRNAs in HCT116 \ncells and PC3 cells, respectively. Silencing was strong and \nspecific, as determined by RT-qPCR (Fig. 6 A). In both cases, \nsilencing led to decreased levels of ADAM10 at the cell surface \n(Fig. 6 B) and to the accumulation of ADAM10 in an intracellu-\nlar compartment identified as the ER using PDI as a marker \n(Fig. 6 C). This indicates that endogenous TspanC8 tetraspanins \nare required to promote the exit of ADAM10 from the ER.\n\nTspanC8 tetraspanins regulate Kuzbanian \nlocalization and Notch activity in vivo\nTo test whether TspanC8 regulate the subcellular distribution \nof ADAM10/Kuz in vivo, we turned to Drosophila. Because no \nanti-Kuz antibodies are available, we generated a GFP tagged-\nversion of Kuz (Fig. S3). Starting from a 96-kb genomic BAC \ncovering the kuz locus (Venken et al., 2006), we used recom-\nbineering to generate a Kuz-GFP BAC transgene (Fig. S2; Venken \net al., 2009). A single copy of this transgene rescued the lethality of \nkuz mutant flies, indicating that Kuz-GFP is functional and \nexpressed like wild-type Kuz. A very low level of GFP was \ndetected in most larval and imaginal tissues, indicating that Kuz \nis expressed at low levels, preventing us from studying the dis-\ntribution of Kuz in these tissues. Previous studies had, however, \n\nexperiments shown in Fig. 1. Indeed, similar amounts of ADAM10 \nwere precipitated using anti-GFP and anti-ADAM10 antibod-\nies, suggesting that a large fraction of the ADAM10 pool was in \ncomplexes with TspanC8 and reciprocally a fraction of Tspan5, \n\nFigure 3.

Thus, the intracellular Kuz-GFP dots in polar cells \ncorrelated with low levels of Tsp3A and Tsp86D. Furthermore, \nthe silencing of Tsp3A and Tsp26A in Tsp86D heterozygous \nflies in border cells led to a redistribution of Kuz-GFP into \nintracellular dots (Fig. 7, F–H; silencing was found to be both \nefficient and specific in this tissue, as determined using GFP-\nTsp3A and GFP-Tsp86D as read-outs: silencing was 80% \n[Tsp3A] and 97% [Tsp86D] efficient; see Fig. S5). We conclude \nthat TspanC8 tetraspanins regulate the distribution of Kuz in \nborder cells.\n\nA previous study has shown that Kuz regulates Notch \nin border cells (Wang et al., 2007). To test whether TspanC8 \nregulates Kuz-dependent Notch signaling in border cells, we \nused a Notch transcriptional reporter, Gbe-GFP (Housden et al., \n2012), expressed in both border and polar cells (Fig. 7, I and I\ue039). \nThe silencing of Tsp3A and Tsp26A in border cells of Tsp86D \nheterozygous flies led to a significant decrease in Gbe-GFP \nexpression in border but not polar cells (Fig. 7, I–L). Together, our \ndata indicated that TspanC8 tetraspanins regulate the subcellu-\nlar distribution of Kuz and the activity of Notch in border cells.\n\nTspanC8 tetraspanins positively regulate \nNotch activity at a pre-\ue067-secretase step\nTo test whether human TspanC8 also regulate Notch, HeLa \ncells were co-cultured with OP9 cells expressing or not the \nNotch ligand DLL1. A threefold increase in the activity of  \na CSL-luciferase Notch reporter was induced by DLL1. We \nnext measured Notch activity in HeLa cells stably expressing \n\nindicated that the kuz gene is expressed at higher levels in a \ngroup of migrating cells known as the polar/border cells  \nin ovaries (Wang et al., 2006; Fig. 7 A). Consistent with this, Kuz-\nGFP was detected in migrating polar/border cells (Fig. 7, D–D\ue039\ue039\ue039). \nIn this context, the activity of kuz is required for both Notch \nsignaling and collective cell migration (Wang et al., 2006). \nEarly silencing of the TspanC8 genes in border cells using \nthe c306 and slow border (slbo) GAL4 drivers resulted in fewer \nborder cells (Fig. 7 B) and delayed migration (Fig. 7 C). Both \nphenotypes were also observed upon silencing of kuz (Fig. 7, \nB and C). We therefore used this model system to study the \nin vivo regulation of Kuz distribution by TspanC8.\n\nFirst, we observed that Kuz-GFP distributed differently \nin polar and border cells. Kuz localized into intracellular \ndots in the two centrally located polar cells, whereas it localized \nmore diffusely at the cell periphery and in the cytoplasm in the \n6–8 border cells surrounding the two polar cells. The nature of \nthese Kuz-GFP dots is unclear. In particular, the ER or Golgi \nmarkers Sec16, Liquid facet Related, GMAP, and Ofut1 did not \nmark these dots (not depicted). Despite this, we wondered whether \ndifferent levels of TspanC8 in polar vs. border cells might \naccount for this difference in distribution. Because transcrip-\ntome analysis has suggested that the Tsp86D gene is expressed \nin these migrating cells (Wang et al., 2007), we investigated \nthe expression of Tsp86D using a 21-kb genomic BAC encoding a \nGFP-Tsp86D transgene (Venken et al., 2009). GFP-Tsp86D \nwas expressed at high levels in border cells, whereas polar cells \nhad low levels of GFP-Tsp86D (Fig. 7, E–E\ue039\ue039\ue039). Similarly, we \ngenerated a BAC-encoded GFP-Tsp3A and observed that \n\nFigure 4. Expression of TspanC8 in HeLa \ncells increases the expression of surface and \nmature ADAM10.

Double silencing of these \nTspanC8 tetraspanins led to an \ue07a60% reduction in Notch  \nreporter activity, whereas single silencing of Tspan5 or Tspan14 \nled to an \ue07a45% and \ue07a35% reduction, respectively (Fig. 8 B). \nThis effect correlated with a significant decrease in the surface \nexpression levels of ADAM10 (Fig. 8 C), but not of Notch1 \n(Fig. 8 D). As a control, the silencing of CD81 had no effect. \nThese results indicated that Tspan5 and Tspan14 promote Notch \nreceptor activity in signal-receiving cells.\n\nTo determine the step at which TspanC8 tetraspanins act, \nwe measured the effect of Tspan5 and Tspan14 silencing on two \nconstitutively activated versions of Notch1. The first one, NICD, \n\nTspan5, Tspan14, or Tspan15. HeLa cells expressing Tspan5 \nand Tspan14, but not Tspan15, showed a 50% increase in \nOP9-DLL1–induced Notch activity as compared with HeLa \ncells (Fig. 8 A). These results suggested that the levels of \nADAM10 at the cell surface may be limiting for Notch acti-\nvation in HeLa cells.

This conclusion is supported by several key findings:  \n\ncorresponds to the intracellular domain of Notch1 lacking \nthe PEST domain.

Although an \nER retention motif has yet to be defined in EWI-2 or CD19, \nboth proteins contain a putative arginine-based motif (un-\npublished data).\n\nOur results indicating that several human TspanC8 family \nmembers have a similar molecular activity on the regulation \nof ADAM10 are consistent with our RNAi analysis showing \nthat the fly TspanC8 genes act redundantly to regulate Notch. \nHowever, one limitation of this RNAi approach is that silencing \nis often incomplete (Dietzl et al., 2007), so that residual activity \nmight hinder some aspects of the null mutant phenotype. Despite \nthis limitation, our data clearly established that TspanC8 tet-\nraspanins play an essential role for proper Notch activity in \nvarious developmental settings. Kuz is likely to be the main \ntarget of TspanC8 in Drosophila. First, our clone border analysis \nindicated that the activity of TspanC8, like that of Kuz, is re-\nquired in signal-receiving cells. Second, the distribution of Kuz,  \nbut not those of Notch and Delta, appeared to be regulated  \nby TspanC8. Third, Kuz appeared to interact with Tsp3A (inter-\naction with Tsp26A and Tsp86D was not tested). Our data \nfurther indicated that the relevant target of Kuz is Notch, \nrather than its ligand Delta. Although Kuz can down-regulate \nDelta (Qi et al., 1999; Mishra-Gorur et al., 2002), hence poten-\ntially interfering with its cis-inhibitory activity (del Álamo et al., \n2011), Delta levels remained unchanged upon TspanC8 silenc-\ning. Moreover, human Tspan5 and Tspan14 positively regu-\nlated ligand-induced ADAM10-dependent Notch1 signaling at a \npre-\ue067-secretase step in an assay where ligands act in trans.  \nTogether, our data support the view that TspanC8 tetraspanins \nregulate Notch activity via the regulation of the ADAM10/Kuz-\nmediated S2 cleavage. Also consistent with this view are the \nsynergistic interactions observed between the C. elegans \nTspanC8 family member tsp-12 and sup-17, the ADAM10 or-\nthologue. tsp-12 was identified as a suppressor of a mutation \ncausing constitutive or elevated activity of GLP-1, one of two \nNotch-like receptors in C. elegans (Dunn et al., 2010). However, \nTsp-12 was proposed to act by facilitating the S3 (rather than \nthe S2) cleavage of GLP-1. This interpretation relied to a large \nextent on the observation that Tspan33 silencing in HeLa cells \nreduced the activity of Notch1-\ue044E but had no effect on NICD. \nWhether Tspan33 regulates \ue067-secretase activity indirectly via the \n\n(i) ADAM10 interacts with several TspanC8 tetraspanins in \nboth flies and mammals. (ii) ADAM10 surface expression \nlevels are controlled by TspanC8 both in human cells and in \nDrosophila. (iii) TspanC8 tetraspanins act in signal-receiving \ncells for the ligand-induced and ADAM10/Kuz-dependent \nactivation of Notch.\n\nThis study shows that ADAM10 is a specific and direct \npartner of all six human TspanC8 tetraspanins. In addition, \nTspan5, Tspan14, Tspan15, and Tspan33 increased the expression \nof ADAM10 at the cell surface and promoted its maturation. \nA similar finding was recently reported for Tspan15 (Prox et al., \n2012). Tspan12 was proposed earlier to interact closely with \nADAM10 and to promote its maturation (Xu et al., 2009). How-\never, it did not interact with ADAM10 after digitonin lysis, \nand did not increase ADAM10 surface expression level and \nmaturation when transfected in HeLa cells. These data, together \nwith the observation that the interaction of ADAM10 with \nTspan12 required its palmitoylation (Xu et al., 2009), strongly \nsuggest that Tspan12 interacts only indirectly with ADAM10. \nAdditionally, Tspan10 and Tspan17 behaved differently from \nother TspanC8 tetraspanins because their expression induced \nthe intracellular redistribution of ADAM10 in HeLa cells. \nWe therefore suggest that different TspanC8 may provide \nADAM10 with different trafficking properties.\n\nHow do Tspan5, Tspan14, Tspan15, and Tspan33 regu-\nlate the expression level of mature ADAM10? A possibility, \nconsistent with their interaction at the cell surface, is that \nthese tetraspanins act by stabilizing ADAM10 at the plasma \nmembrane. This increase in mature ADAM10 expression is also \nprobably, to some extent, a direct consequence of the ability \nof TspanC8 to mediate the ER exit of ADAM10. ADAM10 is \nretained in the ER through a mechanism involving an arginine-\nbased motif (Marcello et al., 2010) that may function as an \nER retention signal. Such arginine-based motifs are often \nfound in subunits of multi-molecular complexes and are masked \nupon complex assembly, thereby allowing ER exit of the properly \nassembled complexes (Michelsen et al., 2005). We therefore \nsuggest that TspanC8 tetraspanins allow for the ER exit of \nADAM10 by masking its arginine-based motif. A role of tet-\nraspanins in the ER exit of their molecular partner is probably \nnot restricted to TspanC8 tetraspanins, as suggested by the \ndifferential expression and/or maturation of CD19 and EWI-2 \n\nled to a reduced number of border cells (6.5 ± 0.1), similarly to kuz silencing (6.0 ± 0.2).

In wild-type ovaries, all clusters (n = 25) have completed their migration (distance \ncovered: 100%). The silencing of kuz and TspanC8 resulted in a significant migration delay because clusters covered only 45 ± 26% and 75 ± 16% of \nthe total distance, respectively, at stage 10a. (D–E\ue039\ue039\ue039) Distribution of Kuz-GFP and GFP-Tsp86D (anti-GFP in green) in stage 9 egg chambers. Kuz and \nTsp86D were expressed in migrating somatic cells consisting of two central polar cells (p; marked by Fas3, red in D\ue039\ue039 and E\ue039\ue039) surrounded by 6–8 border \ncells (b; outlined by actin, violet in D\ue039\ue039\ue039 and E\ue039\ue039\ue039). Kuz-GFP mostly localized into dots in polar cells but was diffusely distributed in border cells (D\ue039–D\ue039\ue039\ue039). \nTsp86D was expressed in border cells (E\ue039–E\ue039\ue039\ue039) and in the somatic follicular cells (fc) around the oocyte. (F–G\ue039) The silencing of TspanC8 in border cells, \ni.e., the triple Tsp3A, Tsp26A, and Tsp86D RNAi using slbo-Gal4, led to the redistribution of Kuz-GFP (green) into dots in border cells (G and G\ue039; compare \nwith control heterozygous Kuz-GFP in F and F\ue039; actin, red). (H) Quantification of the Kuz-GFP dots in border and polar cells. The silencing of TspanC8 in \nborder cells specifically increased the number of Kuz-GFP dots in these cells (14 ± 3 relative to 3 ± 1 in controls). No significant effect was seen in polar \ncells (9 ± 3 relative to 10 ± 3 in controls). (I–K\ue039) Notch reporter gene activity (green; Fas3, red; DAPI, blue) was detected in border (b) and polar (p) cells \n(I and I\ue039). TspanC8 silencing in border cells resulted in decreased Notch reporter activity. This effect varied from medium (J and J\ue039) to strong (K and K\ue039).  \n(L) Ratiometric analysis of the GFP signal from the Notch reporter Gbe-GFP in migrating border cells relative to polar cells. The silencing of TspanC8 and \nkuz genes (as in I–K\ue039) led to reduced border/polar ratios in GFP intensity (0.40 ± 0.06 and 0.10 ± 0.02, respectively; wild-type was 0.88 ± 0.07).

This new link \nhas potential implications for the interpretation of phenotypes \nassociated with defective TspanC8 activity, and further work \nshould determine whether the defect in erythropoiesis of \nTspan33 (penumbra) mutant mice is linked to a defect of \nADAM10 and/or Notch function (Heikens et al., 2007). Finally, \nbecause ADAM10 is a promising therapeutic target in various \npathologies (Saftig and Reiss, 2011) and because mouse \nTspanC8 genes display tissue-specific expression (Wu et al., \n2009), it might be envisaged to inhibit ADAM10 activity in \na tissue-specific manner by interfering with the activity of \nspecific TspanC8.\n\nMaterials and methods\nReagents for in vitro studies\nThe mouse mAb anti–human ADAM10 11G2 was described in Arduise  \net al. (2008); the mouse mAb anti–human Notch1 and anti–human ADAM17 \nwere from R&D Systems and the anti–human PDI from Abcam. The anti-tag \n\nnon-TspanC8 tetraspanins that were found associated with  \n\ue067-secretase (Wakabayashi et al., 2009) remains to be determined. \nWhatever the molecular basis, this result contrasts with our data \nshowing that the silencing of both Tspan5 and Tspan14 signifi-\ncantly decreased ligand-mediated Notch activation but had no \neffect on the activity of Notch1-\ue044E. Unfortunately, we could \nnot investigate the role of Tspan33 in the S2 and S3 process-\ning of Notch1 because none of the cell lines tested here, includ-\ning HeLa, expressed Tspan33 at a significant level.\n\nIn conclusion, this study establishes that the trafficking \nand activity of ADAM10 are regulated by tetraspanins of the \nTspanC8 family and that this regulation has important con-\nsequences in terms of Notch signaling. Further work should \ndetermine why ADAM10 associates with so many tetraspanin \npartners. We hypothesize that these different tetraspanins \nmay provide ADAM10 with different trafficking properties \n(Tspan10 and Tspan17) or differentially restrict the range of \nits substrates, as suggested by the lack of effect of Tspan15 \n\nFigure 8.

The immunoprecipitated proteins were \nseparated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions and transferred to \na PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare). Western blotting on immunoprecipi-\ntates was performed using either Alexa Fluor 680–labeled 11G2 mAb or a \ncombination of rabbit anti-GFP antibody and a secondary reagent labeled \nwith IRDye800. Acquisition was performed using the Odyssey Infrared \nImaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).\n\nFor cross-linking, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with \nHA-ADAM10 and various GFP-tagged tetraspanins. 48 h after transfec-\ntion, the cells were treated with 1 mM dithiobis[succinimidyl propionate] \n(DSP) for 30 min at 4°C, and lysed in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% \nTriton X-100 and 0.2% SDS before immunoprecipitation.\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR\nTotal RNA fraction was isolated from 5 × 106 cells of different cell lines \nusing the SV Total RNA Isolation System including an on-column DNase  \ndigest (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Subse-\nquently, cDNA was synthesized from 5 µg of total RNA from each sample \nusing 200 U of SuperScript III Reverse transcription (Invitrogen) primed \nwith random hexamer (Promega). Quantitative real-time polymerase \nchain (QPCR) reactions were then performed in a final volume of 25 µl \ncontaining 2x Brillant II SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix from Agilent \nTechnologies, 0.4 µM each forward and reverse primers and 62.5 µg of \ncDNA. Quantification was performed with the Mx3005P QPCR Systems \nand MxPro software from Agilent Technologies. For each cDNA sample, \ntriplicates were analyzed and data normalized to rpl38 expression \naccording to the \ue044Ct method. Most oligonucleotides were designed by \nprimer bank (Spandidos et al., 2010).

The cells were then incubated \nfor 1 h with 10 µg/ml of the anti-ADAM10 mAb 11G2 (IgG1) in complete \nDME at room temperature. For double labeling the cells were coincubated \nwith an antibody to the ER marker PDI (IgG2a). Primary antibodies were \nrevealed with Alexa Fluor 488– and Alexa Fluor 568–labeled goat \nanti–mouse IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies. The cells were mounted in \nMowiol 4-88 (81381; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with DABCO (D2522; \nSigma-Aldrich) and DAPI and examined at room temperature either with \na DMR fluorescence microscope (Leica) equipped with a CoolSnap HQ2 \ncamera (Photometrics) controlled by MetaMorph (Molecular devices), or \nan SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) using 63x oil objectives (NA 1.32 and \n1.40, respectively).\n\nDrosophila imaginal discs, nota, and egg chambers were dissected \nfrom staged larvae, pupae, and female flies, respectively, and stained  \nusing standard techniques. Primary antibodies used in Drosophila were: \ngoat anti-GFP (1:500; ab5450 from Abcam), guinea pig anti-Senseless \n(1:3,000; a gift from H. Bellen, HHMI, Baylor College of Medicine, \nHouston, TX; Nolo et al., 2000), rabbit anti-dGMAP (1:1,000; a gift of  \nP.

Fischer, University of Texas, Austin, \nTX; Lee et al., 2009), rat anti-Su(H) (1:2,000; Gho et al., 1996), mouse \nanti-NECD (C458.2H, 1:100; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank \n[DSHB]), mouse anti-Delta (C594.9B, 1:100; DSHB), mouse anti-Fas3 \n7G10 mAb (1:100; DSHB), mouse anti-Cut 2B10 mAb (1:500; DSHB), rat \nanti-Elav 7E8A10 mAb (1:100; DSHB), and rabbit anti-Myc (1:500; EMD \nMillipore). Secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Lab-\noratories and coupled to Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5. Atto 647N-Phalloidin \n(65906; Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 0.1 µM to stain F-actin. Nota and egg \nchambers were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (81381; Sigma-Aldrich) containing \n2.5% of DABCO (D2522; Sigma-Aldrich). Images were acquired using an \n\nantibodies used in this study were anti-GFP (a mouse mAb coktail from Roche \nand a rabbit polyclonal from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-HA \n(HA11 mouse mAb from Covance), and anti-V5 (a mouse mAb and a rabbit \npolyclonal from Sigma-Aldrich). The following siRNAs were obtained from \nInvitrogen and Eurogentec: control siRNA: Stealth RNAi Negative Control \nMedium GC; Tspan5: AUGUCAUCCCGAUAUGCUCUGAUGU; Tspan14: \nCGCCAUCUCGCUGUUGCAGAUAUUU; Tspan15: ACAACCUGUACCU-\nUCUCCAAGCAUU; and CD81: GCACCAAGUGCAUCAAGUA-dTdT.\n\nAll V5- or GFP-tagged tetraspanin cDNA were of human origin. \nCoding regions were amplified by PCR from previously described plasmids \n(Tspan1, Tspan5, Tspan9, Tspan12, and Tspan15; Serru et al., 2000), \nfrom plasmids obtained from Open Biosystems (Tspan10 and Tspan33), or \nfrom a reverse-transcription performed on HCT116 RNA (Tspan14). \nPCR products were subcloned into pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-N3, or pcDNA 3.1 \nDirectional TOPO vectors. hTspan17 and Tspan5-plm were synthesized by \nEurogentec. The mouse myc-tagged Notch1 constructs \ue044E and NICD (in \nthe pCS2+MT vector) and the HA-tagged bovine ADAM10 (in pCDNA3) \nwere described previously (Jarriault et al., 1995; Lammich et al., 1999).\n\nThe cell lines HeLa (cervical carcinoma), HCT116 (colon carci-\nnoma), PC3 (prostate carcinoma), and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) \nwere cultured in DME containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. Cells were \ntransfected with either Fugene 6 (Promega) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) \naccording to the manufacturers’ instructions. OP9 cells expressing the \nhuman Notch ligand DLL-1 (OP9-DLL-1) and the human osteosarcoma \ncell line U2OS expressing human Notch1 (U2OS-N1) were obtained by \ninfection with retroviruses carrying the DLL1 cDNA cloned in the MSCV-\nIRES-GFP vector and a human Notch1 cDNA cloned in the pBabe puro \nvector, respectively. These two cell lines are described in Moretti et al. \n(2010) and Six et al. (2004). S2 cells were transfected using FugeneHD \n(Promega) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nS2 cells were transfected with pMT-Gal4 (obtained from the Dro-\nsophila Genomics Resource Center), pUAS-GFP-Tsp3A, and Myc-tagged Kuz \nusing FugeneHD (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. \nExpression of GFP-Tsp3A in S2 cells was monitored for 16–20 h after \ninduction with 500 µm of CuSO4, and cells were immunostained following \nstandard procedures. The Tsp3A ORF was PCR amplified from cDNAs \nprepared from wild-type total embryonic RNAs and fused in-frame down-\nstream of EGFP with a YSDLR linker, sequenced and cloned into a pUASt \nvector to generate pUAS-GFP-Tsp3A. Myc-tagged Kuz corresponds to \nthe kuz ORF with a 6x Myc epitope tag at its C terminus under an actin \npromoter (Lieber et al., 2002).\n\nFlow cytometry analysis\nCells were detached, washed twice in complete DME and incubated for \n30 min at 4°C with 10 µg/ml primary antibody. After three washings, the \ncells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with a fluorochrome-conjugated \nF(ab\ue039)2 goat anti–mouse antibody (FITC or PE for single color staining of \nnontransfected cells; APC for staining of cells transfected with GFP con-\nstructs). The cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur or an Accuri C6 \nflow-cytometer (BD), using appropriate compensations. Cells were de-\ntached using a nonenzymatic solution (PAA), except for the analysis of \nNotch1 expression for which they were detached in 15 mM sodium citrate, \n0.135 mM potassium chloride.\n\nAnalysis of Notch activity in mammalian cell lines\nThis analysis was performed as described previously (Moretti et al., \n2010): U2OS-N1 or HeLa cells were seeded at the concentration of \n25,000 cells/cm2. Silencing was performed at this step using Interferin \n(PolyPlus Transfection) and 3 nM siRNA according to the manufacturer’s \nreverse procedure. Cells were transfected 24 h later with the CSL reporter \nand Renilla control plasmids using FuGENE 6 (Promega). 24 h later, \ncells were co-cultured with OP9 or OP9-DLL1 at 35,000 cells/cm2. The \nactivities of firefly and Renilla luciferases were determined using a Dual \nluciferase reporter assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s in-\nstructions. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA \nfollowed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test.\nImmunoprecipitation, chemical cross-linking, and biotin labeling of \nsurface proteins\nBiotin labeling of surface proteins and immunoprecipitations were per-\nformed as described previously (Charrin et al., 2001; Arduise et al., \n2008). In brief, biotin-labeled or nonlabeled cells were lysed in a lysis buf-\nfer containing 30 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, protease inhibitors, \nand 1% detergent (Brij 97 or digitonin). After 30 min incubation at 4°C, \nthe insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g and \nthe cell lysate was precleared by addition of heat-inactivated goat serum \nand protein G–Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). Proteins were then \n\n\n\nJCB • VOLUME 199 • NUMBER 3 • 2012 494\n\nGFP-Tsp86D BACs were inserted at the M{3xP3-RFP.attP’}ZH-51C, \nPBac{y[+]-attP-9A}VK00019 and PBac{y+-attP-3B}VK00002 sites (Venken \net al., 2006; Bischof et al., 2007).

NM_080315). shmiR-tsp3A-1 (CGACCTG-\nCAGAACTTCATTGA) and shmiR-Tsp3A-2 (GGAGCAAAAACGAGTACTTCA) \nknockdown oligonucleotides were modified to mimic the native D. mela-\nnogaster premiR-1 structure. The resultant shmiR-Tsp3A construct had mis-\nmatched bases at positions +2 and +11 as described in Haley et al.

An op-\ntimized transgenesis system for Drosophila using germ-line-specific \n\nSPE confocal microscope (Leica) using 20x (HCX PL APO CS, NA 0.6), \n40x (HCX PL APO CS, NA 1.4), and 63x (HCX PL APO CS, N.A. 1.3) ob-\njectives. Adult flies were imaged using a Discovery V20 stereomicroscope \n(Carl Zeiss) using a 1.0x objective (PlanApo S FWD 60 mm).\n\nImages were processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) \nand Adobe Photoshop software. Categorization of the plasma membrane \nvs. cytoplasmic accumulation of Kuz-Myc in S2 cells, using the cell outline \nand the nucleus as landmarks, was performed blind after randomization of \nthe images. To quantify the Gbe-GFP signal at stage 9–10a, the GFP signal \nwas measured in each polar and border cell on a single confocal section \nrunning across the nucleus using ImageJ. Values were corrected by sub-\ntracting the background signal measured outside the egg chamber. For \neach egg chamber, mean values were calculated for the 2 polar and for \nthe 6–10 border cells. These two mean values defined a border/polar  \nratio. The extent of border cell migration was measured as the percentage \nof migration within individual stage 10a egg chambers. To characterize \nthe distribution of Kuz-GFP in border and polar cells, 512 × 512 images \nacquired at 63x (zoom 6) were thresholded and the number of “objects” >8 \npixels in size were counted.\n\nDrosophila transgenes and mutations\nThe kuz[k01405] (Sotillos et al., 1997), kuz[e29-4] (Pan and Rubin, 1997), and the \ntransgenic conditional RNAi flies have been described previously: UAS-\ndsRNATsp3A (10742R-2 and 10742R-3; from R. Ueda, http://www.shigen \n.nig.ac.jp/fly/nigfly/index.jsp); 10138 and 10140 from the Vienna Drosoph-\nila Rnai Center [VDRC] (Dietzl et al., 2007); UAS-dsRNATsp86D (4591R-1 \nand 4591R-2 from R. Ueda; 102046, 42642, and 42643 from the VDRC); \nUAS-dsRNATsp26A (101473 from the VDRC); and UAS-dsRNAkuz (103555 \nfrom the VDRC). Conditional silencing was achieved using the binary UAS/\nGAL4 system in combination with the thermo-sensitive GAL80ts inhibitor. We \nused the apterous-Gal4 driver (ap-Gal4) to direct dsRNA expression in imagi-\nnal tissues giving rise to the adult dorsal thorax, and a combination of c306 \nand slow border (slbo) Gal4 drivers to direct dsRNA expression in border \ncells. (Manseau et al., 1997; Rørth et al., 1998).\n\nThe Tsp86D\ue0443 deficiency that removes the Tsp86D gene was gener-\nated by Flp-FRT as described in Parks et al. (2004). The 5\ue039- and 3\ue039-flanking \nelements were the P{XP}Fdhd04974 and PBac{RB}CG6574e00293, respec-\ntively. This 9,442-nt deletion removes the CG6574, SelR, Tsp86D, and \nFdh genes (Fig. S3). Breakpoints were confirmed by PCR (primers se-\nquences available upon request).\n\nThe kuz-GFP, GFP-Tsp3A, and GFP-Tsp86D transgenes were gener-\nated by BAC recombineering in E. coli SW102 as described at http://\nweb.ncifcrf.gov/research/brb/recombineeringInformation.aspx (Venken \net al., 2006). The starting BACs were generated by Venken et al. (2009) \nand were obtained from BACPAC (http://bacpac.chori.org).\n\nThe CH321-04I18 BAC covering the kuz locus from \ue0326,996 nt 5\ue039  \nto the transcription start site to 3,040 nt downstream of the 3\ue039UTR was \nused. PCR products corresponding to the 5\ue039 and 3\ue039 homology arms were \nproduced using the following primers: Kuz5F: GACAGCAGCAAATG-\nCAACAGCA; Kuz5Rgfp: CTTGCTCACCATTAGGACTGCATAAACGATA-\nTTTCGGCG; Kuz3Fgfp: CTGTACAAGTAAGAGCGGAACCATCACATT; \nand Kuz3R: CACATACTTGGTTAGTGCAGT. \n\nThe GFP cassette included an AVL linker.
