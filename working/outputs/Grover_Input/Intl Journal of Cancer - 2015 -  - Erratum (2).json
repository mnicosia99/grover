The authors regret that the following errors were found in the paper, and therefore would like to correct these errors.  In this article, errors were found in Fig. 3. Images of M6and M6/mock cells migration ability(shown in“72h”group); 97L and 97L/mock cells as well as M6 and M6/mock cells invasion ability have been mistakenly reused and allegedly represent different setups. The statistical data were carefully re-reviewed and ensured to be correct. Fig.3should be corrected as follows. The changes do not alter the original conclusions of this study.
