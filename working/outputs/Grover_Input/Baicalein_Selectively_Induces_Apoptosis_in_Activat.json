Selectively Induces Apoptosis in Activated\nLymphocytes and Ameliorates Concanavalin A-Induced\nHepatitis in Mice\nYan Zhang1., Lei Shan1., Yaping Hua2., Dan Wang1, Huawu Zeng1, Runhui Liu1, Weidong Zhang1*,\n\nZhenlin Hu1*\n\n1 School of Pharmacy, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China, 2 School of Pharmacy, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, China\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Insufficient apoptosis in activated lymphocytes contributes to the development of autoimmune hepatitis\n(AIH). Baicalein (BE), a flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, possesses anti-\ninflammatory properties. However, whether BE can selectively induce apoptosis in activated lymphocytes and exert\ntherapeutic effect on AIH has not been studied.\n\nMethodology/Principal Findings: The pro-apoptotic properties of BE were evaluated in vitro on different types of immune\ncells, and in vivo effects of BE were examined in a murine model of Concanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis. In vitro\ntreatment with BE resulted in a higher increase in the level of apoptosis in Con A-stimulated murine splenocytes, Con A-\nstimulated CD3+ splenocytes, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated CD19+ splenocytes, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/\nionomycin-stimulated Jurkat T cells, compared with that in unstimulated naı̈ve ones. Murine bone marrow-derived dentritic\ncells, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells, either stimulated with LPS or unstimulated, were all insensitive to the\nBE-induced apoptosis. BE treatment also led to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of cytochrome c\nrelease from mitochondria to the cytosol, a decrease in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and activation of caspase-9,-3 in Con A-\nstimulated CD3\n\n+\nsplenocytes and LPS-stimulated CD19\n\n+\nsplenocytes, while showing no impact on Fas/FasL expressions and\n\ncaspase-8 activation. In vivo administration of BE alleviated Con A-induced liver injury, suppressed serum level of TNF-a and\nIFN-c, and reduced liver infiltration of mononuclear cells (MNCs). Furthermore, BE treatment increased the incidences of\napoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3\n\n+\nand CD19\n\n+\nsplenocytes. When liver MNCs and\n\nsplenocytes from BE-treated mice were cultured in vitro for 24 h, they exhibited marked increase in apoptosis compared to\nvehicle-treated control.\n\nConclusions/Significance: The present study demonstrates the ability of BE to promote apoptosis in activated lymphocytes\nthrough mitochondrial pathway and its potential use in the treatment of AIH.\n\nCitation: Zhang Y, Shan L, Hua Y, Wang D, Zeng H, et al.

These authors contributed equally to this work.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAutoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a disease characterized by\n\nprogressive liver inflammation of unknown etiology that may\n\nadvance to fibrosis and cirrhosis [1]. The pathogenic mechanisms\n\nof AIH still remain unclear. The liver inflammation in AIH\n\nencompasses both cell-mediated cytotoxicity by infiltrating lym-\n\nphocytes and the production of autoantibodies. Therefore,\n\nabnormality in immune regulation is thought to be implicated in\n\nthe pathogenesis of this disease [2]. Currently, the only viable\n\ntreatments of AIH are immunosuppressant application and liver\n\ntransplantation. But long term applications of currently available\n\nimmunosuppressive drugs carries serious risks [3]. Therefore, it is\n\nsignificantly important to develop new specific drugs.\n\nDeletion of activated and autoreactive lymphocytes by apoptosis\n\nis a critical mechanism by which the immune system maintains\n\nhomeostasis [4,5]. There is increasing evidence that abnormalities\n\nin this process might contribute to the development of AIH. It has\n\nbeen reported that the activated lymphocytes in patients with AIH\n\nfail to down-regulate the expression of the antiapoptotic protein,\n\nbcl-2, which may protect them from apoptosis and thereby extend\n\nthe disease process [6]. Fas/Fas-ligand system is known to plays a\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592\n\n\n\nkey role in the control of activation-induced apoptosis of\n\nlymphocytes [7]. Four polymorphisms of human Fas gene have\n\nbeen associated with the occurrence of AIH in Japan [8], and one\n\npolymorphism in the Fas gene promoter at position 2670 has\n\nbeen associated with the early development of cirrhosis in white\n\nNorth American and Northern European patients with AIH [9].\n\nThese data suggests that genetic factors that affect the integrity of\n\nthe apoptotic pathway can influence the progression of AIH\n\npossibly by perpetuating the survival of activated lymphocytes.\n\nConcanavalin A (Con A)-induced hepatitis is considered to be an\n\nexperimental murine model of AIH [10,11]. A previous study\n\ndemonstrated that CD44-knockout mice exhibited enhanced\n\npathogenesis in Con A-induced hepatitis, primarily due to inability\n\nof Con A-activated CD44-deficient T cells to undergo apoptosis\n\n[11]. A more recent study demonstrated that Galectin-3 deficiency\n\nprevents Con A-induced hepatitis partly due to enhanced\n\napoptosis in both liver-infiltrated mononuclear cells (MNCs) and\n\nsplenocytes [12]. These evidence further support the notion that\n\ndysregulation of apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is involved in\n\nthe pathogenesis of AIH.\n\nSince insufficient apoptosis in activated lymphocytes is an\n\nessential factor contributing to the development of AIH, specific\n\ninduction of apoptosis in activated lymphocyte should be\n\nbeneficial in depressing excess immune responses and inducing\n\nlong-lasting immunological tolerance, and thus represents a new\n\ntherapeutic strategy for AIH. Recently, a few compounds have\n\nbeen reported to selectively induce or potentiate apoptosis in\n\nactivated T cells and inhibit the development of autoimmune\n\ndiseases in several animal models, including experimental allergic\n\nencephalitis [13,14], adjuvant arthritis [13], and Con A-induced\n\nhepatitis [15]. These studies further demonstrated the feasibility of\n\ntreatment of autoimmune diseases by agents that induce apoptosis\n\nof activated T cells.\n\nNatural compounds purified from herbal medicines that have\n\nknown indications for inflammatory disease conditions often have\n\na low toxicity profile [16,17]. Therefore, exploring new immuno-\n\nsuppressive agents that selectively induce apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes from herbal medicines is conducive to the develop-\n\nment of novel effective pharmaceuticals for AIH. Baicalein (BE) is\n\na flavonoid originally isolated from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis\n\nGeorgi, known as ‘‘Huang qin’’ in China [18]. This herb has been\n\nwidely used in treatment of various diseases such as hepatitis,\n\npneumonia, and diarrhea [19]. Previous studies have demonstrat-\n\ned that BE possesses potent anti-inflammatory properties [20–25].\n\nHowever, the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated.\n\nOf note, BE has been reported to induce apoptosis in several\n\ncancer cell lines, including human pancreatic [26], breast [27],\n\nprostate [28], and gastric [29] cancer cells. The pro-apoptotic\n\neffects of BE on both lymphocytes cell line and human peripheral\n\nblood mononuclear cells has also been shown previously [30,31].\n\nHowever, whether it can selectively induce apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes has not been studied. In present study, we at first\n\nconducted a series of in vitro experiments to investigate the pro-\n\napoptotic effect of BE on various immunocytes of different\n\nactivating status, and then used Con A-induced hepatitic mice as\n\nan animal model to determine whether BE could induce\n\nlymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has therapeutic potential for\n\nAIH. We demonstrated that BE selectively induced apoptosis in\n\nactivated lymphocytes and ameliorated Con A-induced hepatitis in\n\nmice. Our findings indicate that BE may have a therapeutic value\n\nin the treatment of AIH and provides a new cellular mechanism\n\nfor its therapeutic effect.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics Statement\nAll animal experiments were approved by the Administrative\n\nCommittee of Experimental Animal Care and Use of Second\n\nMilitary Medical University (SMMU, Licence No. 2011023), and\n\nconformed to the National Institute of Health guidelines on the\n\nethical use of animals.\n\nReagents\nBE (purity .99%) was purchased from National Institute for\n\nthe Control of Pharmaceutical and Biological Products, China.\n\nCon A, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate\n\n(PMA), and ionomycine were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis,\n\nMO, USA). PE-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (PE-mAbs)\n\nrecognizing CD3, CD19, Fas, or FasL and FITC-conjugated mAb\n\nagainst active caspase-3 were purchased from BD PharMingen.\n\nMice\nC57BL/6 mice (6-week-old, female) were purchased from\n\nShanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Co., LTD (Shanghai, China).\n\nAll animals were acclimatized under controlled temperature\n\n(2062uC), humidity (6065%) and 12 h light/12 h dark cycle for\n1 week before the experiment.\n\nCell Preparation and Culture\nAll cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma)\n\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco) at 37uC in a\n5% CO2 atmosphere. Splenocytes were prepared by passing\n\ndisrupted spleen collected from C57BL/6 mice through a 70-mm\nnylon cell strainer (BD Labware), and depleting red blood cells by\n\n5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/\n\nvolume]). CD3\n+\n\ncells and CD19\n+\n\ncells were isolated from\n\nsplenocytes by magnetic-activated cell separation (MACS)-based\n\npurification using Pan T Cell Isolation Kit and B Cell Isolation Kit\n\n(Miltenyi Biotec), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s\n\ninstructions, and the purity of obtain cells was more than 95% as\n\ndetermined by flow cytometry. Bone marrow (BM) cells were\n\nprepared by flushing the femurs of C57BL/6 mice, filtering\n\nthrough a 70-mm nylon cell strainer, and depleting red blood cells\nby 5-minute incubation with ammonium chloride (0.8% [weight/\n\nvolume]). Dendritic cells (DCs) were generated by culturing BM\n\ncells with 10 ng/ml of recombinant mouse granulocyte-macro-\n\nphage colony stimulating factor and interleukin-4 (both from R&D\n\nSystems) for 6 days as previously described [32]. To stimulate DCs\n\nmaturation, LPS (500 ng/ml) was added to the culture on day 5.\n\nPeritoneal macrophages were obtained by plating cells lavaged\n\nfrom the mouse peritoneal cavity in 24-well flat-bottomed plates\n\nand removing nonadherent cells after 3 hours of culture [33]. The\n\nobtained macrophages were stimulated with LPS (500 ng/ml) for\n\nadditional 24 h to activated them. Jurkat T cells and Raw264.7\n\nmacrophage cells were stimulated for 24 h with PMA (25 ng/\n\nmL)/ionomycin (1 mM) and LPS (500 ng/ml), respectively, to\ninduce their activation.\n\nApoptosis Assay\nCells were stained with FITC-labeled annexin V (annexin V-\n\nFITC) and propidium iodide (PI) (BD PharMingen, San Diego,\n\nCalifornia, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and\n\nanalyzed in a FACS Calibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San\n\nJose, CA, USA). The percentages of apoptotic cells were\n\ndetermined as the sum of annexin V-FITC single-positive and\n\nannexin V-FITC/PI double-positive cells. In some experiments,\n\nCaspase-3 activation was determined using the FITC Active\n\nBaicalein Induces Apoptosis in Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592\n\n\n\nCaspase-3 Apoptosis kit (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA)\n\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the cells\n\nwere fixed and permeabilized by adding 100 ml Cytofix/cytoperm\nsolution at 4uC for 20 min, and the cells were then washed with\nPerm/Wash solution. The cells were stained intracellularly with\n\nFITC-conjugated anti-active caspase-3 antibody for 30 min at\n\nroom temperature and subsequently analyzed by FACS Calibur\n\nFlow Cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nAssay for Expression of Fas and FasL\nExpression of Fas and FasL on lymphocytes was examined by\n\nflow cytometry after staining the cells with PE-conjugated mAb\n\nrecognizing Fas or FasL (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego,\n\nCA, USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nAssay for Mitochondrial Membrane Potential\nLoss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) was deter-\n\nmined by flow cytometry using J-aggregate forming lipophilic\n\ncationic probe JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA)\n\nstaining following the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nSubcellular Fractionation and Western Blotting\nThe preparation of whole cell lysates and mitochondrial and\n\ncytosolic fractions were performed as detailed previously [34]. The\n\nprotein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay (Bio-\n\nRad, Hercules, CA, USA). The proteins (20 mg) were separated by\nSDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto PVDF\n\nmembrane (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). The membranes\n\nwere probed with anti-cytochrome c, anti-COX IV, anti-a-\ntubulin, Anti-Bcl-2, anti-Bax, and anti-b-actin antibodies (Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, CA, USA) overnight at 4uC. Blots were\nvisualized using IRDye 800CW Goat Anti-Mouse Secondary\n\nAntibody (LI-COR Biotechnology, NE, USA). Detection was\n\nperformed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR\n\nBiotechnology, NE, USA).\n\nCaspase-3,8,9 Colorimetric Assay\nThe activation of caspase-3,8,9 in the cells was measured with\n\ncolorimetric assay kits (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s\n\nprotocol. The caspase activity was expressed as a fold increase of\n\ntest samples relative to non-treatment control.\n\nCon A-induced Hepatitis Model\nHepatic damage was induced by a single intravenous injection\n\nof Con A (15 mg/kg) into C57BL/6 mice. BE was administered\n\nintraperitoneally (i.p.) (100 mg/kg) immediately after Con A\n\ninjection. Control mice were given i.p. the same volume of solvent\n\ninstead of BE. Blood samples were collected from mice at 0, 8, and\n\n24 h after Con A injection. Serum levels of alanine aminotransa-\n\nminase (ALT) were measured using a colorimetric assay kit\n\n(Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).\n\nSerum levels of IFN-c, TNF-a, and IL-4 were measured using\nELISA kits (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer’s instruc-\n\ntions. For histological analysis, livers were collected at 24 h after\n\nCon A injection. Liver samples were fixed in 10% formalin\n\nsolution, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with\n\nhematoxylin-eosin. To detect the in vivo apoptosis in lymphocytes,\n\nthe liver-infiltrating MNCs and splenocytes were isolated 24 h\n\nafter Con A injection as described previously [35], and stained for\n\ndifferent markers of cell subsets (CD3 and CD19) or with FITC-\n\nannexin/PI. The stained cells were counted using a BD FACS\n\nCalibur flow cytometer. In some experiments, the liver MNCs and\n\nsplenocytes were harvested at 8 after Con A injection. The cells\n\nobtained from each mouse were firstly cultured in 24-well flat-\n\nbottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophage adherence, then the\n\nnonadherent cells were collected and further cultured in vitro for 12\n\nand 24 h, and the percentages of apoptosis at each time point were\n\ndetermined by flow cytometry using FITC-annexin V/PI staining.\n\nAfter 24 hours of in vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptotic\n\ncells in total nonadherent cells derived from liver MNCs and\n\nsplenocytes, as well as in CD3\n+\n\nT cell and CD19\n+\n\nB cell subsets,\n\nwere measured by cell counting and flow cytometry using PE-anti-\n\nCD3/FITC-annexin V staining and PE-anti-CD19/FITC-an-\n\nnexin V staining, respectively.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nData are expressed as the mean 6 SEM. Statistical analysis was\n\nperformed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test,\n\nfollowed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison post hoc test. P values\n\nless than 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nResults\n\nBE Selectively Induces Apoptosis in Mitogen-activated\nLymphocytes\n\nThe pro-apoptotic effect of BE was at first tested on splenocytes.\n\nTo determine whether BE may exert differential effects on\n\nactivated and naı̈ve immune cells, freshly isolated murine\n\nsplenocytes were cultured with BE (5–20 mM) for 24 h in the\npresence or absence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and cell death was\ndetermined using Annexin V/PI staining. The result revealed an\n\nincrease in the number of apoptotic events in splenocyte cultures\n\nupon BE treatment. Of note, the increase in the levels of apoptosis\n\nin splenocyte cultures containing both Con A and BE were\n\nmarkedly higher than that in the corresponding levels detected for\n\nthe same concentrations of BE when the cells were incubated with\n\nBE alone (Fig. 1). This result indicated that BE is more effective in\n\ninducing apoptosis in mitogen-activated splenocytes than in naı̈ve\n\nones.\n\nWe next compared the abilities of BE to induced apoptosis in\n\ndifferent types of immune cells under different activating status. In\n\nthis experiment, CD3\n+\n\ncells and CD19\n+\n\ncells were purified from\n\nmurine splenocytes and were used as T and B lymphocytes,\n\nrespectively. DCs were derived from murine BM cells and\n\nmacrophages were obtained from murine peritoneal exudate cells.\n\nBesides these primary immune cells, Jurkat T cell line and\n\nRAW264.7 cell line were also included in this experiment. For\n\ninduction of cell activation, splenocytes and T lymphocytes were\n\nstimulated with 5 mg/ml of Con A; B lymphocytes, BM-derived\nDCs, peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were stimu-\n\nlated with 500 ng/ml of LPS; Jurkat T cells were stimulated with\n\n25 ng/mL of PMA plus 1 mM of ionomycin. All of these cells were\ncultured with 10 mM of BE for 24 h in the presence or absence of\nthe respective activator and cell apoptosis was determined using\n\nAnnexin V/PI staining. Because the spontaneous apoptosis levels\n\nwere different among various types of cells, the pro-apoptotic\n\neffects of BE were indicated as increase in the percentages of\n\napoptosis in each type of cells upon BE exposure. As shown in\n\nFig. 2A, BE exposure resulted in a significantly higher increase in\n\nthe level of apoptosis in splenocytes, CD3\n+\n\nsplenocytes, CD19\n+\n\nsplenocytes, and Jurkat cells in the presence of activator compared\n\nwith that in the absence of activator. However, BE, either alone or\n\nin the presence of LPS, only induced a slight and similar increase\n\nof apoptosis in DCs, and induced almost no increase in peritoneal\n\nmacrophages and RAW264.7 cells. This result suggested BE could\n\nselectively induced the apoptosis in activated T and B lympho-\n\ncytes. We further determine the dose-dependency of BE in\n\nBaicalein Induces Apoptosis in Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592\n\n\n\ninducing apoptosis of lymphocytes by incubating CD3\n+\n\nspleno-\n\ncytes, CD19\n+\n\nsplenocytes, or Jurkat cells with increasing concen-\n\ntrations of BE for 24 hours in the absence or presence of the\n\nrespective activator and subsequently analyzing apoptosis. The\n\nresults indicated BE enhanced the apoptosis of these tested cells in\n\na dose-dependent manner within the range of 5–20 mM much\nmore profoundly in the presence of activator than in the absence\n\nof activator (Fig. 2B). Taken together, above results demonstrated\n\nthat activated T and B cells are more sensitive to BE-induced\n\napoptosis than naı̈ve ones, whereas DCs and macrophages, either\n\nactivated or naı̈ve, are insensitive to BE-induced apoptosis.\n\nBE Induces Apoptosis in Activated Lymphocytes through\nMitochondrial Pathway\n\nIn order to dissect possible pathway involved in BE-induced\n\napoptosis in lymphocytes, we next investigated the effects of BE on\n\nthe expressions of Fas/FasL, loss of DYm, and activation of\ncaspases in immunobead-purified CD3\n\n+\nsplenocytes in the absence\n\nor presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A. Consistent with the result in\nFig. 2B, BE (5–20 mM) markedly increased the percentage of\napoptotic (annexin V\n\n+\n) cells dose-dependently in the presence of\n\nCon A, while only showing slight effects in the absence of Con A\n\n(Fig. 3 A–C). At the same time, even though the presence of Con\n\nA resulted in a small increase in the expressions of Fas and FasL,\n\nthey are not further affected by BE treatment (Fig. 3A, B, D, and\n\nE). However, BE treatment led to a much more profound loss of\n\nDYm in T cells in the presence of Con A than in the absence of\nCon A (Fig. 3F and G). With the loss of DYm, the release of\ncytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol was markedly\n\nincreased in T cells upon BE treatment in the presence of Con\n\nA (Fig. 3H). In addition, BE treatment also resulted in a down-\n\nregulation in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and an\n\nup-regulation in the level of the pro-apoptotic protein, Bax, in T\n\ncells in the presence of Con A (Fig. 3I). The colorimetric assay for\n\ncaspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presence of Con A,\n\nBE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23 rather than\n\ncaspase-8 in T cells (Fig. 3J). These results not only confirmed the\n\nselectively pro-apoptotic effects of BE on activated T cells but also\n\nindicated that BE exerts it effects through mitochondrial pathway\n\nrather than death-receptor-mediated pathway.\n\nWe also tested the expressions of Fas and FasL in immunobead-\n\npurified CD19\n+\n\nsplenocytes which were treated with increasing\n\nconcentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of\n\n10 mg/ml of LPS, and found that they were not influenced by BE\ntreatment (data not shown). However, flow cytometry analysis\n\nshowed that treatment with BE increased the percentage of cells\n\nwith low DYm (Fig. 4A and B) and active caspase-3\n+\n\ncells (Fig. 4C\n\nand D) in CD19\n+\n\ncells much more profoundly in the presence of\n\nLPS than in the absence of LPS. Western blotting assays showed\n\nthat the release of cytochrome c form mitochondrion to cytosol in\n\nB cells after BE treatment in the presence of LPS was marked\n\nincreased (Fig. 4E). BE treatment also resulted in a down-\n\nregulation in the levels of Bcl-2 and an up-regulation in the level of\n\nBax in B cells in the presence of LPS (Fig. 4F). The colorimetric\n\nassay for caspase-3,8,9 further demonstrated that in the presence\n\nof LPS, BE treatment led to the activation of caspase-9 and 23\n\nrather than caspase-8 in B cells (Fig. 4G). These results further\n\nconfirmed BE selectively promotes apoptosis of activated B cells\n\nthrough mitochondrial pathway.\n\nAdministration of BE Attenuated Con A-induced\nHepatitis and Enhanced Apoptosis of Lymphocytes in\nLiver-infiltrating MNCs and Splenocytes\n\nThe finding that BE selectively induces apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes in vitro prompted us to further investigate whether BE\n\ncould also induce lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has anti-\n\nhepatitis potential using a Con A-induced hepatitis model. As\n\nshown in Fig. 5, intravenous administration of Con A resulted in a\n\nsignificant elevation in the serum ALT level at 8 and 24 h after\n\nCon A administration. BE treatment significantly reduced the\n\nALT concentrations at both time points (Fig. 5A). Serum levels of\n\nIFN-c and TNF-a were also enhanced in response to Con A\nchallenge after 8 h, which were all suppressed by BE treatment\n\n(Fig. 5B). Histologic examination of liver sections showed that Con\n\nA challenge resulted in widespread areas of necrosis and massive\n\ninfiltration of inflammatory cells in livers 24 h after Con A\n\nadministration. Treatment with BE markedly attenuated these\n\npathologic changes (Fig. 5C). Flow cytometry analysis of hepatic\n\nMNCs showed that the total numbers of liver infiltrating MNCs,\n\nCD3\n+\n\nT cells, and CD19\n+\n\nB cells were significantly lower in BE-\n\ntreated mice, compared to mice treated with Con A only, 24 hours\n\nFigure 1. BE preferentially induces apoptosis in mitogen-activated splennocytes. Murine splenocytes were treated with indicated\nconcentrations of BE for 24 h in the absence or presence of 5 mg/ml of Con A, and the percentages of apoptosis were detected using Annexin V/PI\nstaining.

Hypothesizing that the reduced\n\nnumbers of MNCs in the BE treated livers might reflect an\n\nincreased incidence of apoptosis, we analyzed the incidence of\n\napoptosis among the hepatic MNCs harvested at 24 h after Con A\n\ninjection with flow cytometry and found that the frequency of\n\napoptosis in liver-infiltrating MNCs significantly increased upon\n\nBE treatment (Fig. 5E). Further flow cytometry analysis of freshly\n\nisolated splenocytes demonstrated the percentages of apoptotic\n\n(Annexin V\n+\n) cells in splenocytes, splenic CD3\n\n+\nT cells, and\n\nCD19\n+\n\nB cell were significantly higher in BE-treated mice than\n\nthat in mice received Con A only (Fig. 5F and G). However, we\n\nnoticed that the frequency of apoptosis in liver MNCs only\n\nincreased from 23.5% to 29.0% upon BE treatment (Fig. 5E),\n\nwhile the total cell numbers of liver MNCs dramatically decreased\n\nfrom 21.86105 cells per liver decreased to 11.56105 cells per liver\nupon BE treatment (Fig. 5D). Thus the absolute number of\n\napoptotic MNCs was calculated to be fewer in BE-treated livers\n\nwhen compared to Con A only control. Nevertheless, it should be\n\nnoted that, as cells undergo apoptosis, they are recognized and\n\nrapidly cleared in vivo by phagocytic macrophages [36,37]. Thus,\n\nthe flow cytometry data in Fig. 5E did not take into consideration\n\nthe majority of the cells that had died and had been cleared in vivo,\n\nbut only represented the incidence of apoptosis among liver MNCs\n\nthat were undergoing apoptosis but had not been cleared at the\n\ntime point that the cells were harvested (24 h after Con A and BE\n\nadministration). To overcome the problem of apoptotic cells being\n\ncleared in vivo, we did ex vivo experiments in which we harvested\n\nthe hepatic MNCs and splenocytes at early stage of BE\n\nadministration (within 8 h) and cultured them in 24-well flat-\n\nbottomed plates for 2 h to allow macrophages adherence, then the\n\nnonadherent cells were collected and further cultured for 12 and\n\n24 h to investigate whether these cells would then undergo\n\nincreased apoptosis in vitro in the absence of macrophages. The\n\nresults showed that during the in vitro culture period, the frequency\n\nof apoptotic cells raised more readily in the macrophage-depleted\n\nlive MNCs and splenocytes obtained from mice treated with Con\n\nA and BE than in the cells from mice treated with Con A only, so\n\nthat by 24 h of in vitro culture, the increase in the frequency of\n\napoptotic cells in Con A+BE group became more apparent\ncompared with Con A only control (Fig. 6A). At this time point of\n\nin vitro culture, the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells detected in\n\nmacrophage-depleted live MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in\n\nCD3\n+\n\nT cell and CD19\n+\n\nB cells subsets, were significantly higher\n\nin Con A+BE group than in Con A only control (Fig. 6B). These\nresults indicated that lymphocytes exposed to BE in vivo undergo\n\nincreased apoptosis when cultured in vitro, suggesting that in vivo\n\nexposure of lymphocytes to BE makes them more susceptible to\n\napoptosis. These results support the notion that increased levels of\n\napoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction in\n\nMNCs within BE-treated livers. These data together suggested\n\nthat BE could also promote lymphocyte apoptosis in vivo and has\n\nanti-hepatitis potential.\n\nFigure 2. BE selectively induces apoptosis in activated lymphocytes.

The direct\n\nand selective pro-apoptotic effects on activated T and B cells were\n\nfurther corroborated using MACS-purified CD3\n+\n\nsplenocytes and\n\nCD19\n+\n\nsplenocytes. We demonstrated that BE significantly\n\nenhanced the apoptosis in pure CD3\n+\n\nsplenocytes stimulated with\n\nCon A, while only having little effect on naive ones. Consistently,\n\nBE was found to be much more effective in inducing Jurkat T cells\n\nto undergo apoptosis in the presence of PMA and ionomycin. In\n\npure CD19\n+\n\nsplenocytes cultures that had been treated with BE\n\nand LPS, the level of apoptosis were greater when compared to\n\nthat in cultures that treated with BE alone. These results confirm\n\nthat BE might affect activated lymphocytes to a greater degree\n\nthan naı̈ve lymphocytes. We also noted that murine BM-derived\n\nDCs, murine peritoneal macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were\n\nall insensitive to the BE-induced apoptosis, either activated or\n\ninactivated. These results suggested that BE was able to selective\n\npromote apoptosis in activated T and B lymphocytes.\n\nApoptosis is mediated primarily through intrinsic and/or\n\nextrinsic pathways [38,39]. The intrinsic pathway involves altering\n\nmitochondrial permeability and subsequent cytochrome c release\n\nand formation of the apoptosome, a catalytic multiprotein\n\nplatform that activates caspase-9. Activated caspase-9 then cleaves\n\ncaspase-3 resulting in downstream events involved in cell death\n\n[38]. The extrinsic pathway is triggered with the ligation of death\n\nreceptors, followed by the recruitment of an adaptor molecule and\n\nprocaspase-8 to form a Death-Inducing Signaling Complex, which\n\nlead to the autocatalytic cleavage and subsequent activation of\n\ncaspase-8, and in turn activates caspase-3, leading to apoptosis\n\n[39]. Fas is a major death receptor that mediates apoptosis of\n\nactivated lymphocytes. Upon activation, lymphocytes can express\n\na higher level of Fas and are more susceptible to Fas-mediated\n\napoptosis than naive cells [7]. In this study, we observed that BE\n\ndid not affects the expressions of Fas and FasL on both T and B\n\nlymphocytes, either naı̈ve or activated, but preferentially induced a\n\nloss of DYm in activated lymphocytes. BE treatment also led to the\nrelease of cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol, down-\n\nregulation of Bcl-2, and up-regulation of Bax in activated\n\nlymphocytes. Furthermore, Caspase-9 and caspase-3 but not\n\ncaspase-8 were activated in activated lymphocytes upon BE\n\ntreatment. These results indicated that BE induces apoptosis in\n\nactivated lymphocytes via intrinsic pathway rather than Fas-\n\nmediated extrinsic pathway.\n\nBE has been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory properties on\n\nvarious animal models [21–25], but the related mechanisms are\n\nonly partially understood. Previous studies have associated its anti-\n\ninflammatory activities with activation of intestinal Pregnane X\n\nReceptor [25], suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokine expres-\n\nsion [23,24], inhibition of nitric oxide production [21,40],\n\nimpairment of reactive oxygen intermediates production [20],\n\ninhibition of leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells [20], and\n\nmodification of eicosanoid synthesis [41]. Data from current study\n\nsuggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of BE can also be\n\nattributed, at least in part, to its ability to trigger apoptosis in\n\nactivated lymphocytes. This new finding not only extends our\n\nunderstanding on the cellular mechanisms underlying the anti-\n\ninflammatory activity of BE, but also raises the possibility that BE\n\nmay be useful to eliminate activated lymphocytes that contribute\n\nto autoimmune diseases.\n\nCon A-induced hepatitis in mice is a well-established mouse\n\nmodel for AIH. In this model, intravenous injection of Con A\n\nleads to systemic immune activation, resulting in acute liver injury\n\nthat resemble the pathology of immune mediated hepatitis in\n\nhumans [10]. Activated T cells have a critical role in Con A-\n\ninduced liver damage. Upon Con A challenge, T cells are initially\n\nactivated and infiltrate the liver tissue, where they induce\n\nhepatocyte death either by cell to cell contact or through secretion\n\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines, of which TNF-a and IFN-c are the\nmajor ones [42,43]. In the current study, in vivo administration of\n\nBE alleviated Con A-induced hepatitis as indicated by decreased\n\ntransaminase levels and markedly attenuated inflammatory lesions\n\nin liver. BE treatment also significantly suppressed Con A-\n\nmediated elevation in serum level of TNF-a and IFN-c, indicating\nCon A-induced immune activation was inhibited by BE.\n\nFurthermore, BE treatment markedly reduced MNCs infiltration\n\nin the liver and significantly lowered the absolute number of\n\nhepatic T and B lymphocytes. The reduction in hepatic MNCs\n\ncould possibly result from the decrease in MNCs recruitment into\n\nlivers and/or the increase in MNCs death and clearance within\n\nlivers. Since BE can selectively induced apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes in vitro, we assumed that enhanced apoptosis of\n\nlymphocytes may contribute to the reduction of MNCs in livers of\n\nBE-treated mice. Indeed, we found that BE treatment increased\n\nthe incidence of apoptosis among hepatic MNCs and splenocytes\n\nin Con A-challenged mice. Flow cytometry assay of annexin V\n\nexposure in splenic T and B cells further confirmed that the\n\nfrequency of splenic T and B lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis\n\nwas increased in ConA-injected mice upon BE treatment.\n\nFurthermore, our ex vivo experiments demonstrated that when\n\nliver MNCs and splenocytes harvested from mice treated with Con\n\nA and BE were cultured in vitro for 24 h, both the frequencies of\n\napoptosis and the absolute numbers of apoptotic cells in total liver\n\nMNCs and spelnocytes, as well as in CD3\n+\n\nT cell and CD19\n+\n\nB\n\ncell subsets, were significantly higher when compared to Con A\n\nonly control. These ex vivo data indicate that lymphocytes from BE-\n\ntreated mice become increasingly susceptible to apoptosis when\n\ncultured in vitro. Overall, these results suggest that higher level of\n\napoptosis in lymphocytes is a factor underlying the reduction of\n\nMNCs in liver of BE-treated mice, which concur with in vitro\n\nevidence that BE drives activated lymphocytes to apoptosis.\n\nAlthough we cannot exclude the possibility that BE may execute\n\nFigure 3.

It\n\nwould be expected that the oral delivery of BE may have limited\n\nutility since the oral bioavailability of BE is very low. Therefore,\n\nthe present in vivo study only shows proof of principle, but does not\n\nshow any practical utility of the BE in clinic.\n\nCurrently the only viable treatments of AIH are immunosup-\n\npressant application and liver transplantation [1,3].

On the contrary, some ISDs such as\n\ncyclosporin A and FK506 even inhibited apoptosis in activated T\n\ncells by down-regulation of FasL [47]. Although dexamethasone is\n\nknown to induce apoptosis in various immune cells, it lack of\n\nselectivity for activated lymphocytes [48]. This is why the current\n\nISDs exert global suppressing effects on the immune system, which\n\npredispose patients to the development of infection and cancer.\n\nAlternatively, selective induction of apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes might effectively deplete autoreactive T and B cells\n\nwithout affecting naı̈ve or non-activated ones to avoid intervention\n\nof normal immune responses to foreign antigens. In this context,\n\nBE would have distinct advantages over the unselective immuno-\n\nsuppressive agents currently used in the treatment of AIH.\n\nHowever, the practical uses of baicalein in pharmaceutical field\n\nwill depend on the success of attempts to enhance its oral\n\nbioavailability. Fortunately, several approaches have been recently\n\ndeveloped which could markedly improve the oral bioavailability\n\nof BE [49–51].\n\nIn conclusion, BE selectively promoted apoptosis in activated\n\nlymphocytes through intrinsic apoptotic pathway, while having\n\nlittle effect on non-activated ones. Administration of BE alleviates\n\nCon A-induced hepatitis in mice and increased the incidences of\n\napoptosis in hepatic MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3\n+\n\nand CD19\n+\n\nsplenocytes, in Con A-challenged mice. These\n\nobservations not only reveal a novel cellular mechanism for the\n\nanti-inflammatory effects of BE, but also suggest that it has\n\ntherapeutic potential for AIH.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: YZ LS YH WZ ZH.

After 2 hours of in-vitro culture, the adherent macrophages\nwere removed and the nonadherent cells were further cultured in vitro for 12 and 24 h. (A) The percentages of apoptosis in the in vitro cultured\nnonadherent cells at each time point were determined by flow cytometry using FITC-annexin V/PI staining. (B) After in vitro culture for 24 h, the\nabsolute numbers of apoptotic cells in liver MNCs and splenocytes, as well as in CD3\n\n+\nT cell and CD19\n\n+\nB cell subsets, were determined by cell\n\ncounting and flow cytometry using PE-anti-CD3/FITC-annexin V staining and PE-anti-CD19/FITC-annexin V staining, respectively. Data are mean 6\nSEM of 6–8 mice/group. *P,0.05 versus Con A only control,\n\n#\nP,0.05 versus Non-treatment control.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0069592.g006\n\nBaicalein Induces Apoptosis in Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69592\n\n\n\n7.
