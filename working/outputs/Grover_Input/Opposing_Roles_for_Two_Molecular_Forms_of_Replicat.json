Gopalakrishnan, Nirbhay Kumar\n\nDepartment of Tropical Medicine, Tulane University, School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA\n\nABSTRACT The bacterial RecA protein and its eukaryotic homologue Rad51 play a central role in the homologous DNA strand\nexchange reaction during recombination and DNA repair. Previously, our lab has shown that PfRad51, the Plasmodium falci-\nparum homologue of Rad51, exhibited ATPase activity and promoted DNA strand exchange in vitro. In this study, we evaluated\nthe catalytic functions of PfRad51 in the presence of putative interacting partners, especially P. falciparum homologues of Rad54\nand replication protein A. PfRad54 accelerated PfRad51-mediated pairing between single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and its homol-\nogous linear double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in the presence of 0.5 mM CaCl2. We also present evidence that recombinant\nPfRPA1L protein serves the function of the bacterial homologue single-stranded binding protein (SSB) in initiating homologous\npairing and strand exchange activity. More importantly, the function of PfRPA1L was negatively regulated in a dose-dependent\nmanner by PfRPA1S, another RPA homologue in P. falciparum. Finally, we present in vivo evidence through comet assays for\nmethyl methane sulfonate-induced DNA damage in malaria parasites and accompanying upregulation of PfRad51, PfRad54,\nPfRPA1L, and PfRPA1S at the level of transcript and protein needed to repair DNA damage. This study provides new insights\ninto the role of putative Rad51-interacting proteins involved in homologous recombination and emphasizes the physiological\nrole of DNA damage repair during the growth of parasites.\n\nIMPORTANCE Homologous recombination plays a major role in chromosomal rearrangement, and Rad51 protein, aided by sev-\neral other proteins, plays a central role in DNA strand exchange reaction during recombination and DNA repair. This study re-\nports on the characterization of the role of P. falciparum Rad51 in homologous strand exchange and DNA repair and evaluates\nthe functional contribution of PfRad54 and PfRPA1 proteins. Data presented here provide mechanistic insights into DNA re-\ncombination and DNA damage repair mechanisms in this parasite. The importance of these research findings in future work will\nbe to investigate if Rad51-dependent mechanisms are involved in chromosomal rearrangements during antigenic variation in\nP. falciparum. A prominent determinant of antigenic variation, the extraordinary ability of the parasite to rapidly change its\nsurface molecules, is associated with var genes, and antigenic variation presents a major challenge to vaccine development.\n\nReceived 4 April 2013 Accepted 8 April 2013 Published 30 April 2013\n\nCitation Gopalakrishnan AM, Kumar N. 2013.

Mechanisms of gene expression and rearrange-\nment during various phases of parasite development in the verte-\nbrate and invertebrate hosts and during disease and immune\nevasion are poorly understood. The virulence of Plasmodium fal-\nciparum, one of the four established parasite species causing hu-\nman malaria, is thought to result, at least in part, from the way in\nwhich parasites modify antigens on the surface of infected eryth-\nrocytes (2). This phenomenon, known as antigenic variation, has\nimplications for severe and pregnancy-associated malaria and for\nthe development of an efficient vaccine (3). DNA recombination\nis thought to play a role in generating diversity within the var gene\nfamily.\n\nThe exchange of genetic information between allelic sequences\n\nhas essential roles in eliminating deleterious lesions, such as DNA\ndouble-strand breaks (DSB), preserving replication forks for\nchromosome segregation during meiosis and for maintenance of\ngenomic integrity (4). The class of enzymes that catalyze this pro-\ncess are known as recombinases, and their assembly on homolo-\ngous DNA sequences is a rate-limiting process, mediated by a\nnumber of accessory factors (5). Eukaryotic Rad51, like its bacte-\nrial homologue RecA, is an essential protein for mitotic homolo-\ngous recombination (HR) events and catalyzes the pairing and\ninteractions between homologous DNA strands necessary for pro-\nmoting single-strand exchange (SSE). Similar to Escherichia coli\nRecA protein, ScRad51 and HsRad51 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n(yeast) and Homo sapiens, respectively, have been shown to play\nroles in promoting SSE between homologous sequences by bind-\ning to DNA and forming nucleoprotein filaments (6, 7). Previ-\nously, our lab has shown that PfRad51, the homologue of Rad51 in\n\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nMay/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13 ® mbio.asm.org 1\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nP. falciparum, exhibited ATPase activity, promoted DNA SSE in\nvitro (8), and may play a functional role(s) during HR, rearrange-\nments, and DNA damage repair.\n\nAnother key player in HR is Rad54, a member of the Swi2/Snf2\nsubfamily of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)-dependent AT-\nPases (9, 10). Rad54 interacts with Rad51 and plays roles in mul-\ntiple stages of HR (11, 12). A role for the Rad54 homologue in\nP. falciparum and its involvement in facilitating activities of\nPfRad51 are not known. Replication protein A (RPA), another\nmolecular component involved in HR, is a heterotrimeric com-\nplex, vital for DNA replication, repair, and recombination (13,\n14). RPA has been shown to consist of 70-kDa (RPA1), 32-kDa\n(RPA2), and 14-kDa (RPA3) subunits (15). Genes encoding RPA\nsubunits have been identified and described in several protozoan\nparasites, such as Cryptosporidium parvum CpRPA1 (16),\nCrithidia fasciculata CfRPA1 (17), and P. falciparum PfRPA1 (18).\nRPA1 is present in two different forms in C. parvum, Toxoplasma\ngondii, and P. falciparum. The two open reading frames (ORFs) of\nthe RPA1 gene in P. falciparum encode a truncated short RPA1S\nprotein (PFI0235w; ~50 kDa) and a longer RPA1L protein\n(PFD0475c; ~134 kDa) (18, 19), differentially expressed across the\nparasite life cycle, indicating the different possible roles during\nparasite development (19). Although the biochemical functions of\nthe RPA1 complex have been well detailed in humans and yeasts,\ntheir role in the malaria parasite is not known. Detailed biochem-\nical characterization of the recombination proteins PfRad54 and\nPfRPA1 may provide further insights into DNA recombination\nand DNA damage repair mechanisms in these organisms.\n\nIn this study, we sought to characterize molecular components\nof the recombination machinery in P. falciparum to provide a\nmechanistic understanding of recombinational DNA rearrange-\nment. We evaluated the catalytic functions of PfRad51 in the pres-\nence of the putative interacting partners PfRad54, PfRPA1L, and\nPfRPA1S and divalent cations. Our data indicate that a coordi-\nnated involvement of these proteins may play a functional role in\nHR and DNA repair mechanisms in the malaria parasite and may\nprovide additional targets for the development of novel antima-\nlaria drugs. A long-term significance of our studies lies in the po-\ntential to investigate recombinational rearrangement of the var\ngenes involved in antigenic variation, one of the major impedi-\nments in generating protective immune responses against a wide\narray of genetically diverse malaria parasites.\n\nRESULTS\nIdentification of homologues of the components of recombina-\ntion machinery in P. falciparum. We have previously cloned and\ncharacterized PfRad51, a P. falciparum recombinase (8). Mining\nthe P. falciparum genome database also revealed that Dmc1\n(MAL8P1.76), MRE11 (PFA0390w), and Rad54 are involved in\nHR; however, Rad52, whose association with DSB has been shown\nto be a prerequisite for the recruitment of Rad51 protein (20),\nappears to be absent in P. falciparum. A lack of PfRad52 stressed\nthat other interacting proteins must be influencing or regulating\nRad51-mediated SSE reactions in P. falciparum. When the\nPfRad54 sequence was aligned with other eukaryotic Rad54 se-\nquences, it revealed regions of considerable sequence similarity\nand dissimilarity, including gaps and insertions (see Fig. S1 and S2\nin the supplemental material). Figure 1A identifies the conserva-\ntion of various functional domains in PfRad54; the N-terminal\nregion is expected to contain a putative Rad51 interaction do-\n\nmain, and the functional significance of the C-terminal region in\nPfRad54 is unknown. The P. falciparum genome also encodes two\nRPA1 subunits (PFI0235w and PFD0475c), a single RPA2 subunit\n(chr11.phat_340), and a single RPA3 subunit (PF07_0039). The\nORFs of the RPA1 subunits encode a truncated short PfRPA1S\nprotein (~50 kDa) and a longer PfRPA1L protein (~134 kDa) (18,\n19), compared to only a single molecule in higher eukaryotes\n(Fig. S2). PfRPA1L contains an extended N terminus (Fig. 1B) and\na Zn finger motif in the N-terminal region lacking in PfRPA1S.\nProteomics data (http://www.plasmodb.org) and a reported\nprotein-DNA binding study (18) suggest that PfRPA1L and\nPfRPA1S bind to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with high affin-\nity. None of the molecules involved in nonhomologous end join-\ning (NHEJ) were revealed in the Plasmodium genome sequence.\n\nPurification of recombinant His-tagged PfRad51, PfRad54 (1\nto 164), PfRPA1L (678 to 1145), and PfRPA1S proteins. Recom-\nbinant PfRad51 was purified (Fig. 1C) as described previously (8).\nThe amino-terminal region (amino acid residues 1 to 164) corre-\nsponding to putative PfRad51-interacting domain A of PfRad54,\nand the ssDNA binding domains of PfRPA1L and PfRPA1S were\nexpressed as 6�His-tagged products and purified using Ni-\nnitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) beads (Fig. 1A). Figure 1C shows the\npurified PfRad54, PfRPA1L, and PfRPA1S proteins used in vari-\nous functional assays. The size and purity were confirmed by Coo-\nmassie blue staining and Western blot analysis using anti-6�His\ntag conjugate antibody (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., CA), which\nrecognizes His tag expressed in all the recombinant proteins.\n\nThe N-terminal domain of recombinant PfRad54 protein ac-\ncelerates homologous DNA SSE in the presence of recombinant\nPfRad51 and CaCl2. The role of Rad54, a protein that belongs to\nthe core enzymatic machinery of HR in eukaryotes, has been\nshown to stimulate the SSE activity of Rad51 (21). In order to\nestablish a functional role for Rad54 in the malaria parasite, we\npurified the N-terminal region of PfRad54 (amino acids [aa] 1 to\n164) and evaluated its participation in SSE catalyzed by PfRad51.\nLinear dsDNA (øX 174) and homologous circular øX 174 ssDNA\nsubstrates were incubated in the presence of ATP, MgCl2,\nPfRad51, and single-stranded binding protein (SSB), as previously\nreported (8). PfRad51-mediated SSE was noticeable at the 15-min\n(Fig. 2B, panel I) time point. We next supplemented the SSE re-\naction with purified PfRad54 (2 �M) in the presence or absence of\nCaCl2. The kinetics of PfRad51-catalyzed SSE with or without\nPfRad54 were comparable (Fig. 2B, panel II); however, the pres-\nence of 0.5 mM CaCl2 and PfRad54 accelerated the formation of\nintermediate products from 15 min in the absence of CaCl2 to\n10 min in the presence of CaCl2 (Fig. 2B, panel III; see also Fig. S3\nin the supplemental material). PfRad54 and CaCl2 in the absence\nof PfRad51 were not effective in the SSE (data not shown). This\nobservation is in agreement with the idea that Ca2� is a universal\ncofactor of DNA SSE promoted by mammalian homologous re-\ncombination proteins in vitro (22). These results also support that\nthe PfRad54 region chosen for expression for functional studies is\nindeed capable of interacting with PfRad51 during SSE.\n\nRecombinant PfRPA1L serves the function of SSB, whereas\nrecombinant PfRPA1S does not exhibit any SSB-like function.\nTo test the function of the two RPA1 subunits in SSE in Plasmo-\ndium, we performed the SSE using PfRPA1L instead of SSB. As\nshown in Fig. 3A (panel II), when PfRPA1L was used in place of\nSSB, PfRPA1L was able to efficiently initiate SSE catalyzed by\nPfRad51. The kinetics of this reaction was found to be similar to\n\nGopalakrishnan and Kumar\n\n2 ® mbio.asm.org May/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13\n\nhttp://www.plasmodb.org\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nthat of SSB, and the intermediate products were visible at the\n15-min time point of the reaction (Fig. 3A, panels I and II). On the\nother hand, PfRPA1S did not initiate a SSE reaction, even after\n45 min of the reaction (Fig. 3A, panel III). These results suggest\nthat PfRPA1L exhibits an SSB-like function in SSE initiation\nwhereas PfRPA1S does not exhibit any such function.\n\nPfRPA1S downregulates the function of PfRPA1L but not\nSSB. Intrigued by the presence of two molecular forms of RPA1 in\nP. falciparum, we performed SSE assays in the presence of both\nPfRPA1L and PfRPA1S. When equal molar amounts of PfRPA1L\nand PfRPA1S (0.5 �M) were added to initiate the reaction, there\nwas a delay in the reaction initiation (from 15 min to 30 min)\n(Fig. 3B, panel I). A further increase in the PfRPA1S concentration\nto 1 �M (2-fold molar excess over PfRPA1L) deferred the reaction\nfrom 30 min to 60 min (Fig. 3B, panel III), and no intermediate\nproducts were seen even 120 min after reaction initiation when\nPfRPA1S was increased to 2 �M (4-fold molar excess over\nPfRPA1L) (Fig. 3B, panel IV). This inhibitory activity of PfRPA1S\nwas observed even if SSE was carried out in the presence of\nPfRad54 and 0.5 mM CaCl2 (data not shown).\n\nIn view of the negative regulation of PfRPA1L by PfRPA1S, we\nalso investigated whether or not the order in which these two were\nadded to initiate the reaction would influence the outcome. The\n\nreaction was first initiated with PfRPA1S (0.5 �M) for 10 min,\nfollowed by addition of PfRPA1L (0.5 �M). The SSE was delayed\nto 30 min as previously seen (Fig. 3B, panel V) when the two were\nadded simultaneously. The negative effect of 0.5 �M PfRPA1S was\nnullified if the amount of PfRPA1L was doubled to 1 �M instead\nof the standard 0.5 �M (Fig. 3B, panel VI), suggesting titrability of\nnegative regulatory activity of PfRPA1S by PfRPA1L.\n\nRecombinant PfRPA1L can initiate SSE in the presence of\nboth PfRad51 and the bacterial homologue RecA. To further test\nwhether the inhibition of SSE by PfRPA1S was a generalized effect\nor specific to PfRPA1L, we incubated equal amounts of SSB and\nPfRPA1S (0.5 �M) to initiate the reaction. As seen in Fig. 3C,\npanel I, there was no delay in the reaction by PfRPA1S carried out\nin the presence of SSB, suggesting that PfRPA1S specifically slows\ndown or inhibits the activity of PfRPA1L. To further characterize\nthe SSB-like function of PfRPA1L, we compared SSE activity ini-\ntiated by RecA. As shown in Fig. 3C, panel II, PfRPA1L can facil-\nitate RecA-mediated SSE as efficiently as SSB, further suggesting\nthat PfRPA1L is indeed a functional homologue of SSB in P. falci-\nparum. Not surprisingly, PfRPA1S was not active in the presence\nof RecA, as there were no intermediate products formed even after\n60 min (Fig. 3C, panel III). When PfRPA1L and PfRPA1S were\nincubated together in the presence of RecA, PfRPA1S again de-\n\nFIG 1 (A) Schematic representation of ScRad54 and PfRad54 proteins.

(i) Tran-\nscriptional effects. Exposure to the DNA-alkylating agent methyl\nmethane sulfonate (MMS) has been shown to lead to overexpres-\nsion of rad51 (23–25), rad54 (26–28), and rpa1 (29, 30). These\nstudies also showed that mutation of the above-mentioned genes\nmade the cells sensitive to MMS, indicating their roles in DNA\nrepair. Previously, we have shown that Plasmodium Rad51 is up-\nregulated in response to DNA damage created by MMS. We then\nstudied MMS-induced changes in the expression of PfRad54 and\nPfRPA1 (long [L] and short [S] forms) initially by reverse\ntranscription-PCR (RT-PCR) (data not shown), followed by\nquantitative real-time PCR. Figure 4A shows relative quantifica-\ntion measured by the Pfaffl method (31) and the average threshold\ncycle (��CT) value of each gene across the different erythrocytic\nstages (rings, trophozoites, and schizonts). The average ��CT val-\nues for induced PfRad51 and PfRad54 in the ring and trophozoite\nstages of P. falciparum were 2 to 2.5 times higher than those in\nuninduced parasites. However, the highest fold induction de-\ntected was 11 to 30 times in the schizont stages. The transcrip-\ntional changes for pfrpa1L and pfrpa1S were also 10 to 100 times\n\nhigher than those for control samples, suggesting that genes for\nboth S and L forms of RPA1 are also induced during MMS treat-\nment. This finding suggests coregulation and functional involve-\nment of both RPA1L and RPA1S during the DNA damage repair\nprocess in the malaria parasites. The P values were corrected using\nthe Bonferroni method, and P values of the various samples were\n�0.0001 to 0.0016, suggesting that there was a statistically signif-\nicant difference between the uninduced and MMS-induced sam-\nples across the erythrocytic cycle for all four genes tested, indicat-\ning the functional significance of these genes in the parasites\nundergoing active DNA replication. To rule out any genomic\nDNA (gDNA) contamination in any of the samples, the unin-\nduced and induced samples were amplified with or without a re-\nverse transcription step as well as using primers for a housekeep-\ning stress-related gene, Pfgrp78 (32). Equal amounts of total RNA\nfrom control and MMS-treated parasites were used in these stud-\nies. Transcripts (amplified 434-bp product) for Pfgrp78 were of\ncomparable intensities in uninduced and induced samples in the\nlife cycle stages of the parasite (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental\nmaterial). These primers also amplify a 289-bp-larger band from\ngenomic DNA templates due to the presence of an intron, and\nthese results rule out any genomic DNA contamination in the\nRNA preparations. Likewise, no PCR products were seen when the\nreverse transcription step was omitted (Fig. S5).\n\nFIG 2 (A) Schematic representation of the SSE assay.

Western blot analysis was carried out\nto further demonstrate that MMS induction was seen at the pro-\ntein level as well. Previously, our lab has shown that MMS treat-\nment resulted in the induction of PfRad51 expression (33). We\ntreated synchronized ring-, trophozoite-, and schizont-stage par-\nasites for 6 h with 0.05% and 0.005% MMS. The expression of\nPfRad54 was assessed using the ScRad54 antibody (a generous gift\nfrom Wolf-Dietrich Heyer, UC, Davis), which recognizes recom-\nbinant truncated PfRad54 expressed in E. coli (23 kDa) (Fig. 4B,\nlane 2) and full-length PfRad54 (140 kDa) in the P. falciparum\nlysates. Pooled preimmune serum (negative controls) did not rec-\nognize any proteins in the parasite lysates (Fig. 4B, lane 1). Three\nindependent experiments were performed, and Fig. 4C shows re-\nsults of one such typical experiment. Treatment with 0.05% and\n0.005% MMS showed a marked induction in PfRad51 and\nPfRad54 expression (Fig. 4C). These results demonstrate that the\nexpression of both PfRad51 and PfRad54 is upregulated in re-\nsponse to exposure to a DNA-damaging agent, thereby strongly\nsuggesting a conserved role for PfRad54, just like PfRad51 in the\nrecombinational repair process. Similar Western blot analysis for\nRPA1 (L and S forms) could not be performed due to nonavail-\nability of specific antibodies.\n\n(iii) Evidence for DNA damage by MMS and DNA repair in\nmalaria parasites. MMS is a known DNA-damaging agent and\nhas been shown to induce PfRad51 (33). We wanted to establish\nthat such induction of recombination molecules in P. falciparum\n\nis indeed in response to actual DNA damage caused by MMS in the\nparasite. To visualize and quantify DNA damage, we performed\nComet assays and analyzed DNA damage in individual cells. The\nshapes of the DNA comet tail and migration pattern were evalu-\nated to assess the extent of DNA damage. As seen in Fig. 5A, max-\nimum comets were seen in the MMS-treated schizont stage (aver-\nage Olive tail moment [OTM], 18.1) compared to rings (1.5) and\ntrophozoites (11.8). In order to establish a functional DNA repair\nprocess in P. falciparum, we then assessed the ability of these par-\nasites to repair damaged DNA in a “return-to-growth” experi-\nment. Figure 5B illustrates a correlation between the Olive tail\nmoment (the product of the proportion of tail intensity and the\ndisplacement of tail center of mass relative to the center of the\nhead) and the parasitemia over various time points during the\nreturn-to-growth phase. Parasite growth was restored to normal\nlevels in MMS-treated samples after 42 h, and it was comparable to\nthat of control samples (mock treated) maintained in parallel. The\ncomet OTM (with a larger value indicating DNA damage) was\ninversely proportional to parasitemia, as parasites repaired dam-\naged DNA and returned to normal growth. Starting from a value\nof 56.1 immediately after MMS treatment, the OTM values de-\ncreased to 41.3 at 12 h, 21.6 at 18 h, and 2.6 at 42 h, providing\nevidence for the presence of DNA damage during the first 18 h\nfollowed by repair of DNA damage and restoration of parasite\ngrowth by 42 h (Fig. 5C and D).

The scoring included the total\nnumber of nuclei, the number of intact heads (undamaged), and\nthe number of comets (damaged), and the percentages of dam-\naged and undamaged nuclei were calculated before (0 h) and 6 h\nafter MMS treatment as well as at 12, 18, and 42 h during the\nback-to-growth condition. In parallel, control samples (mock\ntreatment) were also analyzed at the indicated time points. As seen\nin Fig. 5C and D, as the parasite growth recovered, it was accom-\npanied by repair of damaged DNA, indicated by an increase in the\npercentage of intact undamaged nuclei and a gradual decrease in\nthe OTM values. Spearman’s rank correlation analysis revealed a\nrho value of �0.96, indicating a negative correlation between\nOTM and percent parasite growth recovery. These studies provide\nexperimental evidence for MMS-induced DNA damage in the\nparasite and the involvement of functional DNA repair mecha-\nnisms in response to DNA damage.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we have provided new insights into the role of the\ninteracting partners of Rad51, Rad54, and RPA and their involve-\n\nment in HR and DNA repair in P. falciparum. Failure to identify\nhomologues of PfRad52 and the accessory proteins PfRad55 and\nPfRad57 by genome mining and the presence of two RPAs distinct\nfrom those of other higher eukaryotic cells suggest that DNA re-\npair mechanisms in Plasmodium have evolved to retain functional\nsimilarities as well as unique features compared to other species.\nPreviously, we have shown that Rad51 participates in HR mecha-\nnisms in the apicomplexan parasite P. falciparum. Rad51 has been\nshown to be present in other parasites: Leishmania Rad51 (Lm-\nRad51) and Entamoeba histolytica Rad51 (EhRad51) have been\nshown to bind to DNA and exhibit DNA-stimulated ATPase ac-\ntivity (34, 35), and Trypanosome Rad51 has been suggested to play\na regulatory role in variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) switching\n(36). In other species, Rad54 and Rad51 form a complex nucleo-\nprotein filament which stimulates Rad51, leading to translocation\nof target DNA to the site of homology search (37, 38). The absence\nof Rad52 and accessory proteins emphasizes the importance of the\nfunctional role of PfRad54 in facilitating PfRad51-mediated re-\ncombination and DNA repair. Unlike PfRad51, PfRad54 did not\ninitiate SSE by itself; rather, it accelerated the reaction when com-\nbined with PfRad51 and Ca2�. Deletion analysis has shown that\n\nFIG 4 Induction of recombination molecules by MMS. (A) Transcriptional changes upon MMS treatment, analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. Parasite cultures\nwere synchronized by the sorbitol method, and cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA from rings, trophozoites, and schizonts. Untreated and 0.05% and\n0.005% MMS-treated samples from each stage were collected for analysis. cDNA was then amplified by PCR using gene-specific primers (see Table S2 in the\nsupplemental material) using the Bio-Rad IQ5 real-time PCR detection system. P. falciparum seryl tRNA synthetase was used as an internal control gene. All\nP values lie between �0.0001 and 0.0016. The error bars represent the standard error of the mean (SEM).

The lower panel serves as a loading control showing comparable expression of\nPfHSP70 protein (75 kDa) in uninduced and induced parasites from each stage.\n\nGopalakrishnan and Kumar\n\n6 ® mbio.asm.org May/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nthe Rad54 N-terminal domain is chiefly accountable for interac-\ntions with Rad51 (39) and thereby plays a key role in the function\nof the protein. We therefore focused our initial attempts on the\nN-terminal domain of PfRad54, a region homologous to ScRad54\nwhich interacts with ScRad51, to study its role in SSE. Due to its\nlarge size (153 kDa), we did not attempt to express full-length\nPfRad54, which would have also included the DNA binding do-\nmain. We are not sure if this might account for the lack of SSE\nactivity of PfRad54 alone.\n\nThe recruitment of Rad51 and Rad54 to the site of HR depends\nsolely on the mode of action of single-stranded binding proteins\n(SSB), replication proteins (RPA eukaryotic homologues), and\nthe DNA repair protein Rad52, all of which bind and stabilize\nsingle-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The P. falciparum genome en-\ncodes two RPA1 subunits (http://www.plasmodb.org), PfRPA1L\nand PfRPA1S, expressed differentially across the parasite life cycle,\nsuggesting different possible roles of these subunits during para-\nsite development (19). The absence of the Rad52 homologue in\nP. falciparum also suggests the importance of PfRPA1 proteins in\nengaging PfRad51 and PfRad54 at the site of recombination. Our\nresults demonstrated an SSB-like function for PfRPA1L, whereas\nthe role of PfRPA1S remains intriguing. PfRPA1S alone did not\n\nexhibit any SSE activity, and importantly, it resulted in a\nconcentration-dependent inhibition of the activity of PfRPA1L,\nsuggesting that PfRPA1S may be a regulator for PfRPA1L and SSE\nactivity in P. falciparum. Considering that a Rad52 homologue is\nabsent in Plasmodium and RPA1S does not exhibit SSE activity,\nthe role of PfRPA1L becomes more critical in initiating SSE via\nremoval of secondary structures from ssDNA. The observation\nthat PfRPA1S specifically delayed or inhibited the reaction of\nPfRPA1L and not the bacterial homologue SSB further indicates\nthat PfRPA1S likely interacts with PfRPA1L directly. These find-\nings are significant, keeping in mind that Rad52 recruits Rad51,\nwhich interacts with ssDNA by displacing RPA (40, 41). In the\nabsence of Rad52 in Plasmodium, we speculate that, depending\nupon the stoichiometry of available RPA1S and RPA1L, an inter-\naction between RPA1S and RPA1L acts to limit the recruitment of\nPfRad51 to DNA and, hence, reduced SSE. We do not know if\nPfRPA1S prevents PfRad51 from binding to ssDNA or interacts\nwith PfRPA1L directly and modulates its function. Since PfRPA1S\nis upregulated at the transcriptional level in response to a DNA-\ndamaging agent, it is expected to participate in DNA damage\nrepair and may even play an important role at a DNA damage\ncheckpoint. We are investigating the biochemical nature and stoi-\n\nFIG 5 Evidence for DNA damage and DNA repair.

The majority of parasites (97%) were recovered at 18 h, with only 3% of parasites exhibiting a high OTM value (21.6). The error bars represent the SEM.\n(D) Parasite recovery visualization by Comet assay at 12 h, 18 h, and 42 h (no visually detectable tail) during the return to growth after MMS treatment.\n\nRecombination and DNA Damage Repair in Parasite Growth\n\nMay/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13 ® mbio.asm.org 7\n\nhttp://www.plasmodb.org\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nchiometry of this interaction, suggested by our studies to be an\nimportant regulator in Plasmodium HR and DNA damage repair.\n\nIn response to a serious threat like DNA damage, cells are en-\ndowed with an elaborate battery of DNA repair machinery that is\ntriggered by unrepaired DSBs. In Trypanosoma and Leishmania,\nRad51 has been shown to play a critical role in DNA repair path-\nways (34, 36). Previously, our lab has presented evidence for in-\nduction of PfRad51 in response to the DNA-damaging agent\nMMS (33), suggesting a conserved role for this gene in recombi-\nnational repair processes in the protozoan parasites. Results now\npresented in the current study demonstrate that in addition to the\ninduction of PfRad51, expression of PfRad54, PfRPA1L, and\nPfRPA1S was significantly upregulated in response to MMS. Since\nmaximum response was seen in the mitotically active trophozoites\nand schizonts, it also suggests a link between the activity of recom-\nbination molecules and DNA replication.\n\nIn addition, we have also shown that MMS does indeed cause\nDNA damage in P. falciparum. Using a Comet assay, we observed\nmaximum values for comet tails in the schizont stage (Fig. 5A)\nthat are undergoing DNA replication. In order to establish a func-\ntional DNA repair process in P. falciparum, we performed return-\nto-growth experiments. Further evidence for functional DNA re-\npair in response to DNA damage through analysis of recovery of\nparasites in culture and reversal of DNA damage was revealed by\ncomet tail shortening. Both parasite growth and MMS-induced\nDNA damage returned to normal values within 24 to 42 h of the\nrecovery phase.\n\nResults of the studies presented suggest a role for Rad51,\nRad54, RPA1L, and RPA1S in DNA repair and DNA recombina-\ntion. One point of regulation may be exerted at the level of\nPfRPA1S. PfRPA1S was found to negatively regulate the function\nof PfRPA1L, and during MMS-induced DNA damage, expression\nof both PfRPA1L and PfRPA1S was markedly upregulated. Fur-\nther studies are needed to define these molecular interactions. Our\ncurrent observations allow us to speculate the following possible\nroles of PfRPA1S, which are represented in Fig. S6 in the supple-\nmental material. In the absence of PfRPA1S, PfRPA1L efficiently\ninitiates SSE catalyzed by PfRad51 and, hence, serves the function\nof SSB (Fig. S6A). When PfRPA1S is also present, it likely interacts\nwith PfRPA1L either directly or through yet-unknown mediators\nor cofactors and slows down the SSE, delaying product formation\n(Fig. S6B). In the presence of �4-fold molar excess of PfRPA1S\ncompared to PfRPA1L, no SSE occurs, indicating the titrability of\nPfRPA1L by the negative regulatory activity exerted by PfRPA1S\n(Fig. S6C). The nature of the interaction of these macromolecular\ncomplexes in the parasites through various life cycle stages is cur-\nrently under investigation. Since the short form of RPA1 is present\nin a few other apicomplexan parasites, e.g., Cryptosporidium and\nToxoplasma, our studies with PfRPA1S may provide an excellent\nmodel system to study DNA damage and repair as well as a poten-\ntial checkpoint in HR and DNA repair in these medically impor-\ntant apicomplexan parasites and other biological systems in which\nmultiple forms of RPA1 are present.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCloning, expression, and purification of recombinant PfRad51,\nPfRad54, PfRPA1L, and PfRPA1S. Recombinant PfRad51 was purified as\ndescribed previously (8). The N-terminal (putative Rad51 interacting do-\nmain) coding sequence of PfRad54 (GeneID Pf08_0126; bp 1 to 492 of the\ncoding sequence) was cloned into the expression vector pRsetA (Invitro-\n\ngen), giving rise to a product containing a 6-histidine tag at the N termi-\nnus of the expressed protein, referred to throughout as PfRad54. After\nverifying the sequence, the plasmid was transfected in Escherichia coli\nhost strain BL21* (DE3)-pLys S (Invitrogen). Gene-specific oligonucleo-\ntides used for amplification are shown in Table S1 in the supple-\nmental material. Cultures were grown at 37°C in Luria broth containing\n50 �g/ml ampicillin to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.6. Ex-\npression of recombinant protein was induced by IPTG (isopropyl-�-D-\nthiogalactopyranoside) (1 mM), and incubation continued for 3 h. Cells\nwere harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM phosphate\nbuffer, pH 8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 0.1% lysozyme) per gram\nof bacterial pellet, incubated on ice for 30 min, and lysed by sonication (3\nbursts of 1-min pulse at 4°C). The lysate was centrifuged at 17,500 � g for\n30 min, and the pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of 100 mM Tris, pH 7.5,\nand 4 M urea, stirred at 4°C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 17,500 � g. The\nsupernatant was loaded over a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen) and\nwashed with phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8) containing 20 mM imida-\nzole, and bound protein was eluted with elution buffers (25 mM Tris-HCl,\npH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) containing increasing amounts of imidazole (50,\n100, 150, or 200 mM). The 200 mM imidazole elution fractions contain-\ning recombinant proteins were pooled and dialyzed against the dialysis\nbuffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol\n[DTT], 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) to remove imidazole. The purified\nprotein was tested by Coomassie blue staining and Western blot analysis\nusing antibody specific for the 6�His tag. The protein concentration was\nmeasured by the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method and stored at �80°C\nuntil further use.\n\nThe 3= end of the PfRPA1L gene (GeneID PfD0470c; bp 2035 to\n3438 of the coding sequence, referred as PfRPA1L) and the full coding\nsequence of the PfRPA1S gene (GeneID PFI0235w; bp 1 to 1455) were\neach cloned into the expression vector pRsetA. Gene-specific oligonucle-\notides used for amplification are shown in Table S1 in the supplemental\nmaterial. Cultures were grown at 30°C in Luria broth containing 50 �g/ml\nampicillin to an OD600 of 0.6. Expression of recombinant protein was\ninduced by IPTG (0.5 mM), and incubation continued for 2 h at 25°C.\nCells were harvested and resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris,\npH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% lysozyme) per\ngram of bacterial pellet. The cultures were incubated on ice for 30 min and\nlysed by sonication (3 bursts of 1-min pulse at 4°C). The lysate was then\ncentrifuged at 17,500 � g for 20 min, and the supernatant was loaded over\na Ni-NTA-agarose column after column equilibration with 25 mM Tris,\npH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM imidazole.\nThe column was washed with 25 column volumes of wash buffer (25 mM\nTris, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole),\nand bound protein was eluted with elution buffers (25 mM Tris-HCl,\npH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) containing increasing amounts of imidazole (50,\n100, 150, 200, and 250 mM). The 250 mM imidazole elution fractions\nwere pooled and dialyzed against the dialysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl,\npH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol) to remove imidazole.\nThe purified protein was tested by Coomassie blue staining and Western\nblot analysis using antibody specific for the 6�His tag. The protein con-\ncentration was measured by the BCA method and stored at �70°C until\nfurther use.\n\nSingle-stranded exchange assay. The assay mixture contained reac-\ntion buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 5% glycerol), 10 mM MgCl2,\n5 �M circular �X 174 RF I dsDNA (New England Biolabs [NEB]), 15 �M\n�X virion dsDNA (NEB), 1 mM DTT, and 2 �M concentrations of the\nproteins (RecA obtained from NEB M0249S, PfRad51, or PfRad54) to be\ntested for functional activity. The reaction mixture (135 �l) was preincu-\nbated at 37°C for 10 min, followed by addition of 15 �l of an initiation\nmixture (final concentration of 25 mM Tri-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol,\n3 mM ATP, and 0.5 �M single-stranded binding protein [SSB from Strat-\nagene or PfRPA1L or PfRPA1S]). Aliquots were collected at indicated\ntime points and quenched with stop solution (1% SDS, 15 mM EDTA),\nand the products were analyzed by 1% Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) agarose\n\nGopalakrishnan and Kumar\n\n8 ® mbio.asm.org May/June 2013 Volume 4 Issue 3 e00252-13\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\ngel electrophoresis. The gel was run overnight at 18V, stained for 1 h with\nethidium bromide (final concentration, 0.5 �g/ml), and visualized after\ndestaining in water.\n\nParasite culture, RNA extraction, and cDNA synthesis. P. falciparum\nclone 3D7 was grown at 4% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium supple-\nmented with 10% O� normal human serum and red blood cells. Parasites\nwere cultured at 37°C using the candle jar method (42) and visualized by\nGiemsa stain (43). Parasite cultures were synchronized by the sorbitol\nmethod as described previously (44). Synchronized ring-, trophozoite-,\nand schizont-stage parasites were treated with 0.005% and 0.05% methyl\nmethane sulfonate (MMS) in the culture medium at 37°C, and aliquots\nwere collected for RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. RNA was extracted\nfrom MMS-treated and untreated parasites using Trizol reagent (Invitro-\ngen), and the concentration of RNA was measured using NanoDrop\n(model 2000/2000c). One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed\nusing oligo(dT)18 primer, a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche Diag-\nnostics GmbH), and cycler protocol conditions as described by the man-\nufacturer. The resulting cDNAs were subjected to PCR amplification for\n30 cycles using gene-specific primers. Control reactions without reverse\ntranscriptase were carried out to confirm that no DNA contamination was\npresent in the RNA samples. The products were run on 1% agarose gel and\nstained with ethidium bromide.\n\nWestern blot analysis. MMS-treated synchronized parasites were re-\nleased from red cells by 0.01% saponin lysis for 5 min at 0°C and washed\ntwo times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The samples were\nanalyzed by Western blotting using a 1:5,000 dilution of mouse anti-\nPfRad51 (M. Bhattacharyya and N. Kumar, unpublished data), a 1:5,000\ndilution of mouse anti-ScRad54 (a kind gift from Wolf-Dietrich Heyer,\nUC, Davis), and a 1:7,500 dilution of mouse anti-PfHsp70 (45) antibody\nusing enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)-based detection methods\n(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).\n\nComet assays and DNA damage repair. MMS-treated synchronized\nparasites corresponding to 4 � 105 infected red blood cells were collected,\nlysed with 0.01% saponin, washed three times with cold PBS, and finally\nresuspended in 1.0 ml PBS for single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet as-\nsays) (46). Diluted cells (30 �l) were mixed with 300 �l Comet LMAga-\nrose (1% low-temperature melting agarose [Trevigen, Gaithersburg,\nMD]), and the mixture was added to wells of a Trevigen slide, incubated at\n4°C for 30 min, and immersed in chilled lysis solution (2.5 M NaCl,\n100 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris base, 1% N-lauryl-sarcosine, 1% Triton\nX-100) at 4°C for 60 min. Excess lysis solution was removed from slides\nand then transferred to a clean tray immersed in alkaline lysis solution\n(200 mM NaOH and 1 mM EDTA), rinsed for 5 min in 1� Tris-borate-\nEDTA (TBE), and electrophoresed for 10 min at 1 volt/cm in 1� TBE.\nSlides were fixed in 70% ethanol and dried overnight. Wells were stained\nwith 50 �l freshly prepared SYBR green I and photographed at �200\nmagnification using a Nikon Eclipse 80i (Nikon) with a Sensicam QE\nhigh-performance camera (Cooke Corporation). Comets were scored for\nall samples using Comet assay IV software. Control parasites exposed to a\n5-Gy dose of radiation (cesium 137; Gammacell-40 by NordIon Interna-\ntional) were used to guide Comet assay software (Trevigen, Gaithersburg,\nMD) for quantitation of DNA damage. An automatic scoring method\nmeasured comet head and tail lengths, head and tail percent intensity, tail\nmigration, and Olive tail moment (OTM) (the product of the tail length\nand the fraction of total DNA in the tail). To study the efficiency of the\nDNA damage repair process in P. falciparum, parasites were treated with\n0.05% MMS (6 h at 37°C), washed, and recultured in the presence of fresh\ngrowth medium and uninfected erythrocytes for 42 h. Cultures were har-\nvested at various intervals (12, 18, and 42 h) to prepare blood smears to\ncheck parasite growth and DNA damage by Comet assays. For each sam-\nple (control and MMS treatment) and each time point, three replicates\nwere performed and an average of their OTM values was used for data\nanalysis.\n\nReal-time quantitative PCR. RNA preparation and cDNA synthesis\ndetails were as explained above. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) samples were\n\nprepared in IQ SYBR green Supermix containing SYBR green dye, iTaq\nDNA polymerase, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), and buffers\n(Bio-Rad), 0.4 �M concentrations of each oligonucleotide primer (see\nTable S2 in the supplemental material), and a 1:100 dilution of the cDNA\nreaction. Amplification was performed on a Bio-Rad IQ5 real-time PCR\ndetection system using 95°C for 2 min for initial denaturation and enzyme\nactivation, followed by a further incubation at 95°C for 3 min and 45\ncycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s. P. falciparum seryl\ntRNA synthetase (GeneID PF07_0073) was used as an internal control\ngene. A set of three independent replicates was obtained, and the average\nvalue from that was taken for data analysis.\n\nData analysis and statistical evaluation. Relative CT values from real-\ntime RT-PCR in the induced and uninduced samples were calculated by\nusing the Pfaffl method (31). Briefly, the average CT value from three\nindependent replicates of the internal control gene (seryl tRNA synthe-\ntase) was subtracted from the average CT value for each sample (control or\ninduced) to calculate the �CT. The �CT for each sample was divided by\nthe �CT of the control (uninduced sample) to obtain the ��CT. The\ninverse of ��CT raised to the power of two determines the initial amount\nof DNA in each sample. The experimental standard deviation (SD) was\ncalculated by the square root of the sum of the squares of the SD of each\nsample and the internal control. Finally, using the �CT and the experi-\nmental SD, the induced sample was compared with the respective unin-\nduced sample using InStat software (GraphPad) to calculate P values. The\nstatistical adjustment for the multiple comparisons was accommodated\nby correcting the P value by the Bonferroni method.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\nSupplemental material for this article may be found at http://mbio.asm.org\n/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00252-13/-/DCSupplemental.\n\nFigure S1, PDF file, 0.2 MB.\nFigure S2, PDF file, 0.3 MB.\nFigure S3, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S4, PDF file, 0.2 MB.\nFigure S5, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S6, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nTable S1, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nTable S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Mrinal Bhattacharyya for discussions during the early stages of\nthese studies, Wolf-Dietrich Heyer, UC, Davis, for the generous gift of the\nScRad54 antibody, William Wimley, Tulane School of Medicine, for help-\nful discussions on statistical analyses, Joni Emmons for editorial com-\nments, and Melody C.
