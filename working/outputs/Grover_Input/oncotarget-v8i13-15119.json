2017    Published: February 06, 2017\n\nABSTRACT\nCancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), as the activated fibroblasts in tumor stroma, \n\nare important modifiers of tumor progression. However, the molecular mechanisms \nunderlying the tumor-promoting properties of CAFs in gastric cancer remain unclear. \nHere, we show that CAFs isolated from gastric cancer produce significant amounts of \ninterleukin-6 (IL-6). CAFs enhances the migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells through \nthe secretion of IL-6 that activates Janus kinase 2/signal transducers and activators \nof transcription (JAK2/STAT3) pathway in gastric cancer cells, while deprivation of \nIL-6 using a neutralizing antibody or inhibition of JAK/STAT3 pathway with specific \ninhibitor AG490 markedly attenuates these phenotypes in gastric cancer cells induced by \nCAFs. Moreover, silencing IL-6 expression in CAFs or inhibiting JAK2/STAT3 pathway in \ngastric cancer cells impairs tumor peritoneal metastasis induced by CAFs in vivo. Taken \ntogether, these results suggest that CAFs in the tumor microenvironment promote the \nprogression of gastric cancer through IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling, and IL-6 targeted \ntherapy could be a complementary approach against gastric cancer by exerting their \naction on stromal fibroblasts.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nGastric cancer, one of the most common primary \nmalignant tumors, is the third leading cause of cancer \ndeath in worldwide with the highest estimated mortality \nrates in Eastern Asia [1]. Despite advances in early \ndetection, diagnosis, and treatment of gastric cancer, the \noverall prognosis is still poor and the 5-year survival for \npatients with gastric cancer has remained 20â€“25%, which \nis due to the recurrence and metastasis after surgery [2].\nThus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms \nin promoting the progression of gastric cancer will \nbe helpful to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and \ntreatment of gastric cancer.\n\nEpithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a well-\ncharacterized embryological process, has been identified \nto play a critical role in tumor progression, including \ninvasion and metastasis, by which cancer cells could \ngain more aggressive properties. In the process of EMT, \nepithelial cells undergo a phenotypic switch by lossing \n\ntheir cell polarity and the epithelial markers (E-cadherin, \nÎ²-catenin), to form mesenchymal cells through acquiring \nthe mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, vimentin, ZEB2), \nthus these transformed epithelial cells acquire fibroblast-\nlike properties and exhibit reduced cell-cell adhesion \nand increased motility [3â€“5]. The enhanced motility and \ninvasiveness afforded by EMT is critical in the initiation of \nmetastasis for cancer progression, and the acquisition of a \nmesenchymal phenotype has been also enhanced resistance \nto chemotherapy and poor prognosis [6, 7].The expression \nof these EMT markers can be induced by a number of \ngrowth factors/cytokines such as hepatocyte growth factor \n(HGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-Î², CXCL12 and \nhypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± (HIF-1Î±) [8â€“11].\n\nAccumulating evidence has indicated that \ninteractions between tumor and stromal cells create a \nunique microenvironment that is essential for tumor growth, \ninvasion, and metastasis [12, 13]. Therefore, epithelial cell-\nstromal cell interactions usually act as the regulators of EMT, \nand the factors inciting EMTs are often originated from the \n\nResearch Paper\n\n\n\nOncotarget20742www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\n\nstromal cells creating the tumor microenvironment. Cancer-\nassociated fibroblasts (CAFs), the important components \nof tumor stroma, are the key players in regulating tumor \nprogression [12, 13]. It has been observed that CAFs actively \ncommunicate with cancer cells through growth factors or \ninflammatory cytokines such as HGF, IL-6, TGF-Î², VEGF, \nFGF, and CXCL12 that can promote tumorigenesis and \nprogression [12â€“16]. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that \nwas originally determined to be a regulator of immune and \ninflammatory responses [17] and has been also reported to \nbe associated with certain epithelial tumors such as colon \ncancer, prostate cancer [18, 19]. Aberrant production and \nsignaling of IL-6 is tightly linked to tumor generation and \npoor disease outcome in many cancer types, including gastric \ncancer. IL-6 exerts its effects by binding to IL-6Î± chain and a \ncommon cytokine receptor signal-transducing subunit gp130, \nwhich leads to activation of the Janus kinases (JAKs) family \nof tyrosine kinases and the signal transducers and activators \nof transcription (STAT) family, particularly STAT3 [20]. \nActivation of IL-6-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathway plays an \nactive role in the oncogenesis of a variety of tumors [21â€“23]. \nPrevious studies have demonstrated that STAT3 is activated \nin gastric cancer tissues. Menheniott TR, et al. detected \nSTAT3 in antral biopsies, and have demonstrated that \nboth total STAT3 and phosphorylated STAT3 increased in \nintestinal-type gastric cancer compared with normal stomach. \nZhang XM et al also found that activated STAT3 is positive \nin early gastric cancer, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma \nand metastatic lymph node tissues [24, 25]. However, the \nrole of CAFs and IL-6 in gastric cancer has not been well \naddressed. Therefore, our aim was to determine how CAFs \ncan enhance tumor metastasis and EMT changes of gastric \ncancer cells, and link CAFs with activation of the IL-6-JAK-\nSTAT3 signaling pathway in the progression of gastric cancer.\n\nIn this study, we find that CAFs isolated from gastric \ncancer produce considerable amounts of IL-6. CAFs-derived \nIL-6 enhances the migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells \nby the activation of JAK2/STAT3 pathway in gastric cancer \ncells, while deprivation of IL-6 using a neutralizing antibody \nor inhibition of JAK2/STAT3 pathway with specific inhibitor \nAG490 markedly reduces these phenotypes in gastric \ncancer cells induced by CAFs. Moreover, knockdown the \nexpression of IL-6 in CAFs by RNAi or inhibiting JAK2/\nSTAT3 pathway in gastric cancer cells by the specific \ninhibitor AG490 significantly retards the tumor peritoneal \nmetastasis induced by CAFs in vivo. These results suggest \nthat suppressing IL-6 or its downstream targets could serve \nas an effective therapeutic strategy against gastric cancer by \nexerting their action on stromal fibroblasts.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIL-6 is highly expressed in CAFs in the tumor \nmicroenvironment of gastric cancer\n\nCancer-associated stroma secretes a plethora of \nfactors such as HGF, IL-6, TGF-Î² to promote the growth \n\nand invasion of the underlying tumor [16]. It has been \nreported that IL-6 is associated with certain epithelial \ntumors. To determine the expression level and cellular \nsource of IL-6 in gastric cancer, we first detected IL-6 \nexpression in both serum and cancer tissues in gastric \ncancer patient by ELISA. As shown in Figure 1A, \nIL-6 levels in the serum of gastric cancer patients were \nsignificantly elevated in comparison with healthy \nvolunteers. Similarly, the expression level of IL-6 was \nalso significantly higher in the cancer tissues compared \nwith adjacent non-cancerous tissues (Figure 1B). To \nfurther illustrate which cell component(s) in gastric \ncancer tissues is (are) responsible for the high expression \nof IL-6, we detected IL-6 expression in tissues by \nimmunofluorescence staining. As shown in Figure 1C, \nthe expression of IL-6 was noted in stromal cells of peri- \nand intra-tumoral areas rather than in the cytoplasm or \nthe nucleus of the cancer cells. Anti Î±-SMA antibody \nare used to identify CAFs. Upon immunofluorescence \nstaining, we identified both Î±-SMA and IL-6 expressing \nstromal cells in peri- and intra-tumoral areas (Figure 1C). \nWe further quantified expression levels of IL-6 in CAFs, \nnormal fibroblasts (NFs) and gastric cancer cells (SNU-1, \nMKN45, SGC7901 and MKN28) by ELISA. We found \nIL-6 level were significantly higher in CAFs compared to \nNFs and gastric cancer cells (Figure 1D). These findings \nsuggest that IL-6 is overexpressed in gastric cancer and \nCAFs is one major cell source in producing IL-6 in the \ntumor microenvironment of gastric cancer.\n\nCAFs enhance the migration of gastric cancer \ncells via the secretion of IL-6\n\nWe examined the migration of gastric cancer cells \ninduced by CAFs, a key determinant of metastasis in \ntumor progression. As shown in Figure 2A and 2B, SGC-\n7901 cells co-cultured with CAFs showed enhanced \nability of migration than SGC-7901 cells alone (SGC-\n7901 cells alone, 15.8 Â± 5.0 cells per field; SGC-7901 \ncells co-cultured with CAFs, 156.4 Â± 55.5 cells per field; \nP < 0.01). However, adding neutralizing IL-6 antibody \ninto the co-culture system led to significantly decreased \nmigration (neutralizing IL-6 group, 93.6 Â± 24.9 cells per \nfield; isotype control group, 179.0 Â± 41.9 cells per field; \nP < 0.01) of SGC-7901 cells. Similarly, MKN28 cells \nco-cultured with CAFs also exhibited higher ability of \nmigration than MKN28 cells alone (MKN28 cells alone, \n10.6 Â± 7.3 cells per field; MKN28 cells co-cultured with \nCAFs, 48.8 Â± 15.4 cells per field; P < 0.01), while the \nmigratory ability of MKN28 cells co-cultured with CAFs \nwas significantly reduced by the addition of anti-IL-6 \nneutralizing antibody (neutralizing IL-6 group, 27.2 Â± \n17.7 cells per field; isotype control group, 53.0 Â± 20.8 \ncells per field; P < 0.01) (Figure 2A and 2C). Moreover, \nwe determined the migration ability of gastric cancer \ncells induced by exogenous IL-6. Gastric cancer cells \nstimulated by IL-6 showed enhanced ability of migration \n\n\n\nOncotarget20743www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\n\ncompared with gastric cancer cells alone (Supplementary \nFigure 1). Thus, these data suggest that CAFs enhance the \nmigration of gastric cancer cells via the secretion of IL-6.\n\nCAFs promote EMT changes of gastric cancer \ncells via the secretion of IL-6\n\nEMT, a well-characterized embryological process, \nhas been identified to play a critical role in tumor \nmetastasis, which is characterized by losing epithelial \nmarkers (e.g. E-cadherin), and acquiring of mesenchymal \nmarkers (e.g. N-cadherin, ZEB2) [5].To examine the role \nof CAFs in mediating EMT in gastric cancer cells, we \ncultured SGC-7901 cells or MKN28 cells with CAFs in \na previous described co-culture system [14]. As shown in \n\nFigure 3A and 3B, co-culture of CAFs with SGC-7901 \ncells markedly decreased the expression of E-cadherin \nand simultaneously increased the expression of N-cadherin \nand ZEB2 in SGC-7901 cells. The similar phenotype \nchanges of EMT were also occurred in MKN28 cells after  \nco-cultured with CAFs (Figure 3A and 3B). To determine \nwhether IL-6 contributes to the EMT effect of CAFs \non gastric cancer cells, we added the IL-6 neutralizing \nantibody into the co-culture system. As shown in \nFigure 3A and 3B, EMT induced by CAFs was impaired \nwhen the IL-6 was abolished by its specific neutralizing \nantibody, which was demonstrated by inhibition of \nE-cadherin decrease, and N-cadherin or ZEB2 increase. \nThese data suggest that CAFs promote the EMT of gastric \ncancer cells via the secretion of IL-6.\n\nFigure 1: IL-6 is highly expressed in gastric CAFs.

To interrogate the role of \nIL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway in mediating CAFs-induced \nmigration and EMT changes of gastric cancer cells, we \nfirst explored the activation of IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway \nin gastric cancer cells after co-culture with CAFs. As \n\nshown in Figure 4Aâ€“4D, CAFs significantly induced \nthe phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in both SGC-\n7901 cells and MKN28 cells. In contrast, adding IL-6 \nneutralizing antibody or JAK-2 protein tyrosine kinase \ninhibitor AG490 into the co-culture system significantly \nreversed CAF-mediated phosphorylation of JAK2 and \nSTAT3 in gastric cancer cells (Figure 4Aâ€“4D). We further \nexamined whether block the JAK2/STAT3 pathway by \nAG490 could also inhibit the tumor-promoting effects on \ngastric cancer cells via the secretion of IL-6 by CAFs. As \nshown in Figure 4B and 4D, inhibition of JAK2-STAT3 \n\nFigure 4: CAFs-derived IL-6 enhances the migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells via the activation of JAK2/\nSTAT3 pathway. (A, B) Protein levels of p-STAT3, STAT3, p-JAK2 and JAK2 in both SGC-7901 and MKN28 co-cultured with CAFs \nin the presence of IL-6 neutralizing antibody or AG490 were analyzed by western blot.

(C, D) Densitometric analysis of p-STAT3, STAT3, p-JAK2 and JAK2 expression is shown.  \n(E) The effect of CAFs on cell migration was assayed in the presence of AG490.

(F) Protein expression of E-cadherin, \nN-cadherin and ZEB2 in gastric cancer cells SGC-7901 and MKN28 co-cultured with CAFs in the presence of AG490 or equivalent \nconcentration of DMSO was analyzed by western blot.

These results indicate that IL-6-JAK2-\nSTAT3 signal pathway plays an important role in CAFs-\ninduced migration and EMT of gastric cancer cells.\n\nBlocking IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway impairs \nthe peritoneal dissemination and metastasis of \ngastric cancer cells induced by CAFs in vivo\n\nPeritoneal metastasis is a prevalent form of \nrecurrence and metastasis in advanced gastric cancer. We \nfurther determined the contribution of IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 \npathway to the peritoneal dissemination and metastasis \nof gastric cancer cells in vivo. CAFs were transiently \n\ntransfected with human IL-6 siRNA (siIL-6) or with \ncontrol scrambled siRNA (siNC). Knockdown of IL-6 \nexpression in CAFs with IL-6 siRNA was confirmed by \nqRT-PCR and ELISA assay (Figure 5A and 5B). We then \nmixed CAFs with gastric cancer cells in a 1:4 ratio and \nintraperitoneally inoculated them into immunodeficient \nnude mice. As shown in Figure 5C and 5D, SGC-7901 \ncells mixed with CAFs-siIL-6 developed fewer peritoneal \nmetastases than those developed by SGC-7901 cells mixed \nwith CAFs-siNC (P < 0.05). We next examined whether \ninhibiting the activation of JAK2-STAT3 pathway by \nAG490 could also impair peritoneal metastasis induced by \nCAFs in vivo. We observed fewer peritoneal metastases of \nthe CAFs/SGC-7901/AG490 group but not in CAFs/SGC-\n7901 group (Figure 5C and 5D). These results indicate \n\nFigure 5: Blocking IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway impairs tumor peritoneal dissemination and metastasis induced by \nCAFs in vivo. (A) IL-6 mRNA levels in CAFs treated with siRNA or siNC were detected by qRT-PCR. (B) IL-6 protein concentration \nin the medium conditioned by CAFs treated with (siIL-6) or control siRNA (siNC) were measured by ELISA. (C) SGC-7901 cells and \nSGC-7901 cells mixed with CAFs that were transfected with IL-6 siRNA (siIL-6) or control siRNA (siNC) were inoculated into nude mice. \nMice co-injected with SGC-7901 cells and CAFs were administered i. p with AG490 (500 Î¼g/100 ul/mouse) or equivalent concentration of \nDMSO once a week. The peritoneal nodules (red arrows) were observed after 30 days (N = 5 per group). (D) Average peritoneal nodules \nfrom nude mice are shown. Data are representative of three independent experiments. *P < 0.05.\n\n\n\nOncotarget20747www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\n\nthat IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 pathway is required for peritoneal \ndissemination and metastasis of gastric cancer cells \ninduced by CAFs in vivo, and pharmacologic blocking \nIL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric cancer \ncould reduce peritoneal dissemination and metastasis \ninduced by CAFs.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nCAFs, the activated fibroblasts in cancer stroma, are \nthe most abundant cells in the tumor microenvironment. \nAccumulating evidences demonstrate that CAFs play \na prominent role in tumor growth and progression, and \ncould be a promising tool to cancer therapeutics [26]. \nTherefore, a better understanding of the molecular \nmechanism for the tumor-promoting prosperities of CAFs \nis of obvious importance for understanding in gastric \ncancer progression and finding novel strategies to it. In this \nstudy, we demonstrate that IL-6 secreted by CAFs plays \nan important role in the progression of gastric cancer. We \nshow that CAFs derived-IL-6 promoted the migration and \nEMT of gastric cancer cells via the activation of JAK2-\nSTAT3 pathway, and blocking this pathway with IL-6 \nneutralizing antibody or JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490 \nimpaired gastric cancer metastasis induced by CAFs \nin vivo. Therefore, the activation of JAK2-STAT3 pathway \nby IL-6 may play a central role in the interplay between \nCAFs and gastric cancer cells.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that cancer-associated \nstroma secretes a plethora of factors which promote \nthe growth and invasion of the underlying tumor [16]. \nIL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that was originally \ndetermined to be a regulator of immune and inflammatory \nresponses [17]. Increasing evidences have suggested that \nIL-6 plays a critical role in modulating the function and \nactivity of tumor-associated immune cells. For example, \nIL-6 inhibits the differentiation of dendritic cells, activates \na Th17 cell response promoting tumorigenesis and \nexpands myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) [27]. \nIn contrast to the effects of IL-6 on tumor-associated \nimmune cells, IL-6 is also a direct critical driver of tumor \ngrowth and metastasis. Recent studies have shown that \naberrant expression of IL-6 is tightly linked to tumor \ngeneration and poor disease outcome in many cancer \ntypes, including gastric cancer [18, 19, 28]. In this study, \nwe reveal that IL-6 was overexpressed in both serum and \ncancer tissue of gastric cancer patients, and significantly \nhigher expression was found in stromal fibroblasts. These \nresults indicate CAFs is the major cell source in producing \nIL-6 in the tumor microenvironment of gastric cancer. \n\nInterestingly, although NFs secreted lower IL-6 \nthan CAFs, it also produced abundant IL-6 and significant \nhigher than that from gastric cancer cells. Cancer-\nassociated fibroblasts can be activated in incipient \nneoplasia to orchestrate tumor-promoting inflammation in \nan NF-kB-dependent manner [12, 29, 30]. Tissue-resident \n\nfibroblasts are suggested as precursors for CAFs, activated \nby tumor and immune cell-derived factors to express pro-\ninflammatory genes such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and SDF-1. \nWe previously showed that H. pylori infection induces \nthe secretion of PGE2 by gastric epithelial cells that \nconsequently silences stromal miR-149. The silence of \nmiR-149 removes the suppression of its target gene IL-6,  \nleading to elevated level of IL-6 that acts on fibroblasts to \nstimulate the transformation of NF into CAF [31]. Thus, \ncancer cells take advantage of the enormous plasticity \nof stromal fibroblasts and produce multiple signals that \ngenerate a tumor-promoting microenvironment.\n\nEMT is an important embryonic process that is \nhijacked by tumor cells to facilitate execution of most of \nthe invasion-metastasis cascade. Recently, Yadav et al. \nhave shown that IL-6 induces EMT changes in head \nand neck tumor by up-regulating snail expression [32]. \nBreast cancer cells that constitutively expressed Twist, \na EMT regulator and direct transcriptional repressor of \nE-cadherin, exhibited aberrant IL-6 production and STAT3 \nactivation [33]. Initiation of metastasis requires tumor \ncell migration and invasion, which is enabled by EMT. \nIn the present study, we have shown that IL-6 secreted \nby CAFs induced EMT of gastric cancer cells, which is \ncharacterized by losing epithelial markers E-cadherin and \nacquiring of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and ZEB2. \nThen these EMT changes contribute to the enhanced \ncapability of active locomotion of gastric cancer cells, \nwhich is demonstrated by increased migratory ability \ntriggered by CAFs.\n\nIL-6 exerts its effects by binding to a cell-surface \ntype I cytokine receptor complex consisting IL-6a \nchain (CD126) and a common cytokine receptor signal-\ntransducing subunit gp130, which forms a complex to \nactivate STAT3 with the phosphorylation of Tyr705 \nvia the JAK signaling pathway [20, 34]. Accumulating \nevidences show that activation of IL-6-JAK2-STAT3 \nsignaling pathway by growth factors or cytokines plays \nan active role in tumor growth and progression. However, \nthe role of CAFs and IL-6 in gastric cancer has not \nbeen well addressed. Our present study has shown that \nCAFs induced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 \nof gastric cancer cells via the secretion of IL-6, and \ninhibiting JAK2-STAT3 pathway activation with AG490 \nsignificantly impaired cell migration and EMT, as well as \nperitoneal dissemination and metastasis in vivo induced by \nCAFs. CAFs are known to secrete multiple growth factors \nand chemokines such as SDF-1, VEGF, FGF, and CXCL14 \ninto the tumor microenvironment that promote the growth \nand invasion of the underlying tumor by triggering \nmultiple pathways [14, 35â€“37]. In the present study, we \nfound that IL-6 neutralizating antibody partly suppressed \nthe STAT3 or JAK2 phosphorylation, which suggested that \nIL-6 contributed partially to the tumor-promoting effect of \nCAFs on GC cells. Although we cannot preclude the likely \ninvolvement of other growth factors and/or cytokines, the \n\n\n\nOncotarget20748www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\n\nstudies of neutralizing IL-6 or inhibiting JAK2-STAT3 \npathway activation with AG490 reveal that IL-6 is an \nimportant mediator in tumor-promoting effects of gastric \nCAFs that promotes EMT and peritoneal metastasis via \nthe activating JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway in gastric \ncancer. \n\nIn summary, we find that the crosstalk between \ngastric cancer cells and their stromal cells-CAFs \ncontributes to tumor progression through IL-6-JAK2-\nSTAT3 signaling. Recently, anti-IL6 directed therapies \nhave been used clinically to treat various diseases, such \nas rheumatoid arthritis [38]. Thus, our results suggest that \nIL-6 targeted therapy could be a complementary approach \nagainst gastric cancer by exerting their action on stromal \nfibroblasts.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPatient samples and cell lines\n\nPlasma samples were collected from 66 preoperative \ngastric cancer patients, and 24 age-matched healthy \nvolunteers. Gastric cancer tissues were obtained from \n73 patients, between 2009 and 2012 at Ruijin hospital, \nSchool of Medicine, Shanghai Jiaotong University. None \nof the gastric cancer patients received radiotherapy or \nchemotherapy before surgery. Informed consent was \nobtained from each patient and healthy control for the use \nof their blood samples in this study. All the tissue samples \nwere identified by clinical pathologist.\n\nGastric cancer cell lines SNU-1, MKN45, SGC7901 \nand MKN28 were purchased from Shanghai Institutes \nfor Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, \nand were cultured at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere \nof 5% CO2 with RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% \nfetal calf serum with 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml \nstreptomycin. Fibroblasts were isolated from 4 independent \ngastric cancer patients during radical gastric resection as \nprevious described [14].\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\n\nThe protein levels of IL-6 in plasma and tissue \nlysates were measured by an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, \nMinneapolis, MN, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s \ninstructions.\n\nImmunofluorescence\n\nTissues were fixed in 10% neutralized formalin \nand embedded in paraffin blocks. Sections (4 Î¼m) were \ndewaxed with xylene and rehydrated with gradient \nethanol, and then gently rinsed with phosphate buffered \nsaline (PBS) for three times. After blocking with normal \nnonimmune goat serum for 30 min, tissue sections were \nincubated with anti-Î±-smooth-muscle actin and anti-IL-6 \n\nantibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, USA) at 37Â°C for 2 h. \nAfter 5 times rinses with PBS, cells were stained with \nappropriate Alexa dye-conjugated secondary immune \nreagents, Alexa dye-conjugated phalloidin, and Hoechst \n33342 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Negative control \nstaining was performed by omission of the primary \nantibody. \n\nQuantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR)\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent \n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the \nmanufacturerâ€™s manual. RNA (1 Âµg) was reverse transcribed \ninto cDNA using Reverse Transcription system (Promega, \nMadison, WI, USA). QRT-PCR was performed to \nquantify IL-6 mRNA level with the SYBR Green PCR \ncore Reagent kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster city, CA, \nUSA). GAPDH was used as the endogenous reference. \nData were analyzed by using the comparative Ct method. \nSpecificity of resulting PCR products was confirmed \nby melting curves. The primers used in this assay were:  \nIL-6: 5â€²-CGGTCCAGTTGCCTTCTCCC-3â€² (upper) and \n5â€²-GAGTGGCTGTCTGTGTGGGG-3â€² (lower); GAPDH: \n5â€²-GGACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAG-3â€² (upper) and \n5â€²-GTAGCCCAGGATGCCCTTGA-3â€² (lower).\n\nCell migration assay\n\nCell migration assays were performed by using 8 Î¼m \ntranswell chambers (Corning Life Science, MA, USA). \nCells were incubated in serum-free medium for 24 h and \nthen were added to the upper chamber, and 5 Ã— 104 CAFs \nin 500 Î¼l in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS \nwere added to the lower chamber. Non-migrating cells \nfrom the interior of the inserts were removed with cotton-\ntipped swabs 48 h later, and cells that migrated to the \nbottom of the membranes were stained with 0.1% crystal \nviolet for 30 min. The stained cells were counted and \nphotographed. At least ten randomly selected fields were \ncounted and the average number was presented. \n\nWestern blot analysis\n\nCells were lysed with RIPA cell lysis buffer in \nthe presence of protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, \nUSA). The same amount of protein samples were \nloaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto \nPVDF membranes. After blocked by skim milk, the \nmembranes were incubated in the primary antibodies \ndiluted by TBST buffer for overnight at 4Â°C and then \nin the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at \nroom temperature. Finally the protein bands images were \ncaptured by a Tanon detection system with ECL reagent \n(Thermo). The primary antibodies used in the experiments \nwere Anti-GADPH, anti-E-cadherin, anti-N-cadherin, and \nanti-ZEB2 antibodies were purchased from Proteintech.\n\n\n\nOncotarget20749www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget\n\nRNA interference \n\nHuman IL-6 siRNA and scrambled siRNA (Santa \nCruz, CA, USA) at the final concentration of 100 nmol/L \nwere transfected into CAFs cells with Lipofectamine \n2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells \nwere collected for further assay at 24 h and 48 h after \ntransfection.\n\nTumor xenograft model and tumorigenicity \nassay\n\nMale BALB/c nu/nu nude mice at the age of \n4â€“5 weeks (Institute of Zoology Chinese Academy \nof Sciences), were housed at a specific pathogen-free \nenvironment in the Animal Laboratory Unit, Shanghai Jiao \nTong University School of Medicine, China. Fibroblasts \nand SGC-7901cells were mixed at the ratio of 1:4 within \n0.25 ml PBS and inoculated peritoneally. Some mice were \nadministered i.p with AG490 (500 ug/100 ul/mouse) or \nequivalent concentration of DMSO once a week. All mice \nwere sacrificed after 30 days and peritoneal metastasis \nnodules were counted. All animal studies were conducted \nwith the approval of the Committee on Animal Care in \nShanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nResults were summarized as means Â± SD. Student  \nt test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was \nused to analyze the data and the significance level was set \nat P ï¼œ 0.05.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nThe authors made no disclosures.\n\nGRANT SUPPORT\n\nThis study was supported by grants from National \nNatural Science Foundation of China (No.81272749, \nNo.81572798 and No.91529302), and Shanghai Municipal \nEducation Commission-Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant \nSupport (20152505).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n 1.
