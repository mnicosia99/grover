Rood,b and Bruce A. McClanea,b\n\nDepartment of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA,a and Australian Research Council,\nCentre of Excellence in Structural and Functional Genomics, Department of Microbiology, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australiab\n\nABSTRACT Clostridium perfringens type B and D strains cause enterotoxemias and enteritis in livestock after proliferating in the\nintestines and producing epsilon-toxin (ETX), alpha-toxin (CPA), and, usually, perfringolysin O (PFO). Although ETX is one of\nthe most potent bacterial toxins, the regulation of ETX production by type B or D strains remains poorly understood. The pres-\nent work determined that the type D strain CN3718 upregulates production of ETX upon close contact with enterocyte-like\nCaco-2 cells. This host cell-induced upregulation of ETX expression was mediated at the transcriptional level. Using an isogenic\nagrB null mutant and complemented strain, the agr operon was shown to be required when CN3718 produces ETX in broth cul-\nture or, via a secreted signal consistent with a quorum-sensing (QS) effect, upregulates ETX production upon contact with host\ncells. These findings provide the first insights into the regulation of ETX production, as well as additional evidence that the Agr-\nlike QS system functions as a global regulator of C. perfringens toxin production. Since it was proposed previously that the Agr-\nlike QS system regulates C. perfringens gene expression via the VirS/VirR two-component regulatory system, an isogenic virR\nnull mutant of CN3718 was constructed to evaluate the importance of VirS/VirR for CN3718 toxin production. This mutation\naffected production of CPA and PFO, but not ETX, by CN3718. These results provide the first indication that C. perfringens\ntoxin expression regulation by the Agr-like quorum-sensing system may not always act via the VirS/VirR two-component sys-\ntem.\n\nIMPORTANCE Mechanisms by which Clostridium perfringens type B and D strains regulate production of epsilon-toxin (ETX), a\nCDC class B select toxin, are poorly understood. Production of several other toxins expressed by C. perfringens is wholly or par-\ntially regulated by both the Agr-like quorum-sensing (QS) system and the VirS/VirR two-component regulatory system, so the\npresent study tested whether ETX expression by type D strain CN3718 also requires these regulatory systems. The agr operon\nwas shown to be essential for signaling CN3718 to produce ETX in broth culture or to upregulate ETX production upon close\ncontact with enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells, which may have pathogenic relevance since ETX is produced intestinally. However,\nETX production remained at wild-type levels after inactivation of the VirS/VirR system in CN3718. These findings provide the\nfirst information regarding regulation of ETX production and suggest Agr-like QS toxin production regulation in C. perfringens\ndoes not always require the VirS/VirR system.\n\nReceived 14 November 2011 Accepted 17 November 2011 Published 13 December 2011\n\nCitation Chen J, Rood JI, McClane BA. 2011.

McClane, bamcc@pitt.edu.\n\nThe Gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium Clos-tridium perfringens is an important pathogen of humans and\nlivestock, causing clostridial myonecrosis and numerous diseases\noriginating in the intestines (1, 2). C. perfringens virulence is\nlargely dependent upon prolific toxin production, with this bac-\nterium capable of producing at least 17 different toxins. However,\nonly portions of this toxin arsenal are produced by individual\nstrains, which allows for a toxinotyping classification (A to E)\nsystem based upon the production of alpha-toxin (CPA), beta-\ntoxin, epsilon-toxin (ETX), and iota-toxin (1, 2).\n\nBy definition, C. perfringens type D strains must produce\nalpha-toxin (CPA) and epsilon-toxin (ETX). Some type D strains\nalso produce additional toxins, such as perfringolysin O (PFO),\n\nthat are not used for toxin typing (3). C. perfringens type D isolates\ncause often fatal enterotoxemias in several livestock species, as\nwell as acute or chronic enteritis in goats (1, 4). During type D\nenterotoxemias, toxins are produced in the intestines and then\nabsorbed through the intestinal mucosa into the circulation,\nwhere they spread to other internal organs (1). This enterotox-\nemia then causes edema in several organs, notably the brain, kid-\nneys, lungs, and liver.\n\nAn important feature of C. perfringens pathogenicity is the cor-\nrelation between different toxin types and pathologies, strongly\nsuggesting that particular toxins are important for certain dis-\neases. ETX, an ~30-kDa pore-forming protein, is considered a\nmajor virulence factor of both type B and D strains (3, 5). Ranking\n\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nNovember/December 2011 Volume 2 Issue 6 e00275-11 ® mbio.asm.org 1\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nas the third most potent clostridial toxin after the botulinum and\ntetanus toxins, ETX is listed as a class B CDC select toxin. Epsilon-\ntoxin is normally produced as an inactive ~33-kDa prototoxin,\nbut after proteolytic hydrolysis by intestinal proteases (such as\ntrypsin and chymotrypsin) or lambda-toxin produced by C. per-\nfringens, this prototoxin is converted into a fully active toxin (6, 7).\n\nIntensive studies over the past 20 years have provided an un-\nderstanding of the structure, mode of action, and genetics of many\nC. perfringens toxins (8, 9). However, detailed information about\nthe regulation of expression for several C. perfringens toxins re-\nmains rudimentary, at best. In particular, little or no information\nis available regarding the regulation of toxin production by C. per-\nfringens type D strains.\n\nA common trait of bacteria is their adaptive ability to environ-\nmental changes. Quorum sensing (QS) is used by many bacteria to\ncontrol gene expression in a cell density-dependent manner that is\noften influenced by environmental fluctuations (10, 11). QS sys-\ntems typically utilize extracellular signaling molecules named au-\ntoinducers; in Gram-positive bacteria, these QS autoinducers are\nusually secreted peptides processed from larger propeptides (12).\nThe Agr QS system has been found exclusively amongst certain\nGram-positive bacteria (12–15) but is best studied in Staphylococ-\ncus aureus (12), where the signaling molecule is referred to as\nautoinducing peptide (AIP). AIP is encoded by the agrD gene,\nwhile the S. aureus agr operon also encodes the AgrB protease,\nwhich is required for modification of the AgrD propeptide to ma-\nture AIP. Once AIP reaches a threshold level, it activates the AgrC\nsensor histidine kinase. The activated AgrC sensor then phosphor-\nylates AgrA, a transcriptional regulator, which increases the tran-\nscription of a regulatory RNA named RNAIII. Increased levels of\nRNAIII then modulate the expression of various S. aureus viru-\nlence genes.\n\nRecently, evidence was reported for an Agr-like quorum sens-\ning system in C. perfringens (13, 14). Interestingly, while the agrB\nand agrD genes are present, no agrA or agrC orthologs have been\nidentified in this bacterium. The agr locus, apparently acting via\nan Agr-like QS system, was recently implicated in positive control\nof PFO and CPA production by C. perfringens type A strains (13,\n14) and was also shown to influence sporulation and the produc-\ntion of beta2-toxin and enterotoxin by C. perfringens type A strain\nF5603, a non-food-borne human gastrointestinal disease isolate\n(16).\n\nThe apparent absence of agrA and agrC genes from the C. per-\nfringens genome suggests that this bacterium uses some other two-\ncomponent regulatory system to mediate Agr-like QS effects.\nConsequently, it was proposed that the C. perfringens Agr-like QS\nsystem interacts with the VirS/VirR two-component system (13),\nwhich is comprised of the VirS membrane sensor histidine kinase\nand the VirR response regulator (17–19). Consistent with this\nhypothesis, both the Agr-like QS system and VirS/VirR system are\nknown to positively regulate several toxins produced by C. perfrin-\ngens type A, including CPA, beta2-toxin, and PFO (13, 14, 16–18).\n\nSince little is known about the regulation of ETX production,\nthe present study investigated whether toxin, particularly ETX,\nproduction by C. perfringens type D isolate CN3718 is regulated by\nthe Agr-like QS system, the VirS/VirR two-component regulatory\nsystem, or both systems. These studies revealed that ETX produc-\ntion in this strain requires the agr operon acting via a diffusible\nsignaling molecule, a result consistent with QS regulation. How-\never, while the VirR/VirS two-component system regulated pro-\n\nduction levels of PFO and CPA production by CN3718, its inac-\ntivation surprisingly had no effect on ETX production by this\nstrain. In addition, the Agr-like QS system was shown to upregu-\nlate ETX production when CN3718 contacts Caco-2 cells. This\nrapid host cell-induced stimulation of ETX production had cyto-\ntoxic consequences for host MDCK cells, suggesting potential dis-\nease relevance.\n\nRESULTS\nAnalysis of the agr locus in CN3718. The present study first ex-\namined whether type D strain CN3718 carries an agr locus similar\nto that present in type A strain 13 (13, 14). PCR using primers that\namplify the ~2.9-kb strain 13 agr locus also produced a similar size\nproduct using CN3718 DNA (data not shown). When this\nCN3718 PCR product was sequenced, it revealed the presence of\nan agr locus with 99% identity, at the nucleotide level, to the strain\n13 agr locus. When translated, this sequence indicated that the\nCN3718 agr locus encodes CPE1562 and CPE1563 hypothetical\nproteins and an AgrB protein that are each �99% identical to the\ncorresponding proteins encoded by the strain 13 agr locus. In\naddition, the predicted amino acid sequence of the AgrD proteins\nencoded by strains 13 and CN3718 were 100% identical at the\namino acid level.\n\nConstruction and genotypic characterization of a CN3718\nagrB null mutant. To evaluate whether the agr operon is necessary\nfor toxin regulation in CN3718, the agrB gene of this C. perfringens\ntype D strain was inactivated by using a Clostridium-modified\ntargetron vector (20) that inserted, in the sense orientation, a\ngroup II intron (~900 bp) between nucleotides 566 and 567 in the\nagrB gene. Confirmation of this agrB mutant, named CN3718::\nagrB, was first shown by PCR using primers specific for internal\nagrB sequences (Fig. 1A). In wild-type CN3718, these internal\nPCR primers specifically amplified a PCR product of ~650 bp.\nHowever, consistent with the insertion of the ~900-bp intron into\nagrB, the same primers amplified a PCR product of ~1.6 kb from\nthe putative agrB mutant. Southern blot analyses using an intron-\nspecific probe then demonstrated the presence of only a single\nintron insertion in CN3718::agrB (Fig. 1B). As expected, no intron\nsignal was detected using DNA from the wild-type isolate in this\nSouthern blot procedure (Fig. 1B). To complement the CN3718\nagrB mutant, an agrB operon-carrying plasmid named p3 (14) was\ntransformed into the CN3718::agrB mutant by electroporation.\nPCR demonstrated the presence of the wild-type agrB gene in the\ncomplemented strain, which was named CN3718::agrB(p3)\n(Fig. 1A).\n\nTo evaluate whether AgrB expression was silenced in the puta-\ntive agrB null mutant, a reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as-\nsay was performed since no anti-AgrB antibody was available.\nWild-type CN3718 and the complemented strain were both able\nto express agrB transcripts. However, no agrB transcription was\ndetectable for the agrB null mutant (Fig. 1C).\n\nThe agr operon positively regulates in vitro ETX production\nby CN3718. To evaluate whether the agr operon, which encodes\nthe agrB gene, is involved in regulating ETX production during in\nvitro growth of CN3718 in TGY broth (tryptic soy broth, glucose,\nyeast extract, with thioglycolate), Western blotting and RT-PCR\nanalyses were performed with the wild-type parent, agrB null mu-\ntant, and CN3718::agrB(p3) complementing strain to compare\nETX expression at the protein and transcriptional levels, respec-\ntively. When these strains were grown in TGY broth for 4 h (early-\n\nChen et al.\n\n2 ® mbio.asm.org November/December 2011 Volume 2 Issue 6 e00275-11\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nlog-phase growth), Western blotting detected ETX production by\nwild-type CN3718, but not by the agrB mutant (Fig. 2A). This loss\nof ETX production by TGY cultures of the agrB mutant was re-\nversible by complementation. In 8-h (late-log-phase growth) TGY\ncultures, ETX production by the agrB mutant was reduced com-\npared to that of the strong ETX production noted for both the\nwild-type and CN3718::agrB(p3) complemented strains (Fig. 2A).\nBy quantitative analysis and statistical comparison, ETX produc-\ntion by the wild type and agrB mutant showed a statistically sig-\nnificant difference with both 4-h and 8-h TGY cultures (P � 0.01)\n(Fig. 2B).\n\nRT-PCR studies then indicated that the reduced ETX produc-\ntion by the agrB null mutant involves regulation at the transcrip-\ntional level (Fig. 2C). In order to determine whether the decreased\nETX production by the agrB mutant is simply due to impaired\nbacterial growth, growth curve experiments were performed.\nMeasurement of culture optical density at 600 nm (OD600) at dif-\nferent time periods revealed no differences in growth between the\nwild-type parent, agrB mutant, and CN3718::agrB(p3) comple-\nmented strain (Fig. 2D).\n\nThe agr operon also positively regulates in vitro CPA and\nPFO production by CN3718. To evaluate the role of the agr\noperon in regulating in vitro production of CPA and PFO by\nCN3718, CPA activity was first measured using egg yolk agar\nplates (Fig. 2E). When grown on these plates, colonies of the wild-\ntype and CN3718::agrB(p3) complemented strain were both sur-\nrounded by a zone of insoluble diacylglycerol precipitation, which\nis indicative of lecithin breakdown due to the phospholipase C\nactivity of CPA (21, 22). However, the CN3718::agrB mutant\nfailed to produce this characteristic precipitation zone around its\ncolonies, indicating that the agr operon can regulate CPA activity\nby this type D strain.\n\nWild-type CN3718, CN3718::agrB, and CN3718::agrB(p3)\nwere also grown on sheep blood agar plates to begin evaluating\ntheir PFO activity (Fig. 2F). Colonies of wild-type CN3718 and the\ncomplemented strain were surrounded by a double zone of hemo-\nlysis, including the inner zone of beta-hemolysis indicative of\nC. perfringens PFO activity (21, 23, 24). In contrast, colonies of the\nagrB null mutant were not closely surrounded by this inner beta-\nhemolytic zone, suggesting their loss of PFO activity.\n\nTo specifically demonstrate that the agr operon positively reg-\nulates the CPA or PFO activity of CN3718, Western blots were\nperformed on the same supernatants used for detecting ETX pro-\nduction in Fig. 2A. These Western blots (Fig. 2G and H) using\nanti-CPA or anti-PFO specific antibodies showed that CPA and\nPFO were produced by both wild-type CN3718 and the CN3718::\nagrB(p3) complemented strain. However, CPA was absent and\nPFO levels sharply decreased in the supernatants of the agrB null\nmutant strain.\n\nThe agr operon is necessary for upregulation of ETX produc-\ntion when CN3718 contacts Caco-2 cells. In previous studies, we\nreported that contact with enterocyte-like cells induces rapid up-\nregulation of toxin production by C. perfringens type C isolates\n(25). While type C isolates do not produce ETX, they resemble\ntype D strains by causing disease that originates in the intestines,\nwhere their vegetative cells contact enterocytes (1). Therefore, we\nasked whether ETX production might also be upregulated when\nvegetative cells of the type D strain CN3718 contact enterocyte-\nlike Caco-2 cells.\n\nWhen CN3718 or the CN3718::agrB(p3) complementing\nstrain was used to infect Caco-2 cell cultures under anaerobic\nconditions, rapid ETX production was detected (Fig. 3A). In con-\ntrast, only weak ETX production was observed when these strains\nwere similarly incubated in minimal essential Eagle’s medium\n(MEM) (no Caco-2 cells present) under similar anaerobic condi-\ntions. While the presence of Caco-2 cells caused wild-type\nCN3718 to upregulate ETX production, production of this toxin\nwas barely detectable when the isogenic agrB null mutant was used\nto infect Caco-2 cultures under these conditions. This deficiency\nwas reversible by complementation, indicating that the Agr-like\nquorum-sensing system is necessary for mediating the upregula-\n\nFIG 1 Construction of a CN3718 agrB null mutant by intron-based inser-\ntional mutagenesis.(A) PCR analyses using DNA from wild-type CN3718, the\nagrB null mutant (CN3718::agrB), or the complemented strain [CN3718::\nagrB(p3)].

When MEM\nfrom 4-day-old Caco-2 cell cultures was\ncollected and coincubated with washed\nCN3718 cells for 2 h under anaerobic\nconditions, no ETX expression was de-\ntected. Similar results were observed\nwhen CN3718 was grown in only fresh\nMEM. In contrast, direct contact between\nCN3718 and Caco-2 cells resulted in ETX\nproduction, whether using fresh or\n4-day-old MEM (Fig. 3B).\n\nResults from two other experiments\nfurther supported a need for direct con-\ntact with Caco-2 cells to trigger upregula-\ntion of ETX production by CN3718. First,\nETX production was not observed if the\nbacteria and host cells were anaerobically\ncultured in separate chambers of a Trans-\nwell plate (data not shown). However,\nETX production was detected when both\nCN3718 and Caco-2 cells were anaerobi-\ncally cocultured in the same Transwell\nchamber (data not shown). Second, filter-\nsterilized MEM supernatants that had\nbeen removed from Caco-2 cells infected\nwith the CN3718 agrB mutant were un-\nable to upregulate ETX production\n(Fig. 3C).\n\nThe agr operon mediates control of\nETX production via a diffusible mole-\ncule. No ETX production was observed\nwhen either CN3718::agrB or a CN3718\netx null mutant (JIR4982) was incubated\nalone in Transwells (Fig. 4). To address\nwhether agr operon regulation of ETX\nproduction by CN3718 involves a se-\ncreted signaling molecule, as would be ex-\npected if this was a QS effect, these two\nstrains were coincubated in the same\nTranswell, but separated by a membrane\nthat is impermeable to bacteria yet allows\npassage of small signaling molecules.

For this\nexperiment, an in vitro cell culture model was developed to mimic\ntype D enteric disease, where C. perfringens contacts enterocytes\nand produces toxins that are then absorbed into the circulation to\ndamage nonintestinal internal organs, such as the kidneys or\nbrain. In our in vitro model of type D disease, enterocyte-like\nCaco-2 cells (which are naturally ETX insensitive) were anaerobi-\ncally infected with wild-type CN3718, the isogenic CN3718::agrB\nnull mutant, or the CN3718::agrB(p3) complemented strain for\n2 h. Supernatants from those infected cultures were collected and\nfilter sterilized, and the sterile supernatants were then treated with\ntrypsin to activate the ETX prototoxin, as would occur in the in-\ntestines during natural disease. The trypsin-treated ETX in these\nsamples produced a slightly lower-molecular-mass (~30-kDa)\nETX species on Western blots than did non-trypsin-treated ETX\n(data not shown), confirming that trypsin-induced cleavage of\nETX had occurred.\n\nThe trypsin-activated supernatants were then applied to\nMDCK cells for 2 h, mimicking enterotoxemic effects of type D\ninfection on the kidney (Fig. 5A). Under these conditions, the\nactivated supernatants from the wild-type strain caused morpho-\nlogical changes, including rounding and swelling of the MDCK\ncells. On prolonged incubation, detachment of cells from the cell\nculture dish was also observed. This damage could be inhibited by\npretreating these supernatants with an ETX-neutralizing mono-\nclonal antibody (MAb), confirming the involvement of ETX in\nthis cytotoxicity. In contrast, the activated supernatants from the\nagrB null mutant caused little or no detectable damage; this loss of\ncytotoxicity was reversible by complementation of the mutant\nwith a wild-type agr operon.\n\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from damaged or de-\nstroyed cells was then measured to quantify cytotoxicity with this\nmodel (Fig. 5B). Rates of cell death caused by the wild-type and\nCN3718::agrB(p3) complemented strain were similarly high. In\ncontrast, there was significantly less cytotoxicity caused by the\nagrB null mutant. When the sterile supernatants were preincu-\nbated with an ETX-neutralizing MAb, cytotoxicity caused by the\nwild-type or complemented strains decreased significantly, con-\nfirming a substantial role for ETX in the cytotoxic activity of these\nsupernatants.\n\nFIG 3 Upregulated ETX production by CN3718 during infection of human\nintestinal Caco-2 cells involves AgrB. (A) ETX production is upregulated when\nCN3718 contacts Caco-2 cells. Cell culture dishes containing MEM (no cells)\nor Caco-2 cells were infected for 1 h or 2 h with 1.5 � 107 CFU of CN3718, the\nCN3718::agrB isogenic agrB null mutant, or the CN3718::agrB(p3) comple-\nmented strain at 37°C under anaerobic conditions. Culture supernatants were\nthen removed and subjected to Western blotting using an ETX MAb. Purified\n33-kDa ETX was also included as a control.

As negative controls, only fresh MEM (f-MEM) or filter-\nsterilized MEM removed from 4-day old Caco-2 cell cultures (o-MEM) was\nadded to CN3718 cells in the absence of Caco-2 cells. Culture supernatants\nwere then removed and subjected to ETX Western blotting. (C) Prior to ETX\nWestern blotting, washed CN3718 cells were suspended for 2 h in filter-\nsterilized MEM culture supernatants removed from Caco-2 cells that had been\ninfected for 5 h with wild-type CN3718 (Caco-2 � f-MEM), filter-sterilized\nMEM culture supernatants removed from Caco-2 cells that had been infected\nfor 5 h in CN3718::agrB (MEM of Caco-2/CN3718::agrB), MEM culture su-\npernatants removed from Caco-2 cells grown for 5 h in the absence of bacteria\n(MEM of Caco-2), and filter-sterilized MEM culture supernatants removed\nfrom CN3718::agrB that had been grown in the absence of Caco-2 cells (MEM\nof CN3718::agrB). All cultures were incubated anaerobically.\n\nFIG 4 The agr quorum-sensing system uses a diffusible signaling molecule to\ncontrol CN3718 toxin production.

The VirS/VirR two-component regulatory system pos-\nitively controls production of several toxins by C. perfringens type\nA strains (17, 18, 25). To address whether the VirS/VirR regulatory\nsystem might also be involved in regulating toxin production by a\ntype D isolate, a CN3718 virR mutant (named CN3718::virR) was\nconstructed using the Escherichia coli-based suicide plasmid\npKOR (17) and confirmed by PCR (Fig. 6A). As shown by West-\nern blotting using an anti-VirR antibody, the VirR protein was not\nproduced by CN3718::virR. In contrast, this analysis detected\nVirR production by wild-type CN3718 (Fig. 6B). To complement\nCN3718::virR, pTS405 (containing the whole virR-S operon [26])\n\nwas transformed into the CN3718 virR null mutant by electropo-\nration to create CN3718::virR(pTS405). Western blotting con-\nfirmed VirR protein expression by this complemented strain\n(Fig. 6B). Growth rates of the wild-type parent, virR null mutant,\nand CN3718::virR(pTS405) complemented strain were compared\nin TGY medium and were found to be nearly identical (Fig. 6C).\n\nTo begin evaluating whether VirS/VirR can regulate toxin pro-\nduction in CN3718, the wild-type, CN3718::virR mutant, and\nVirS/VirR complemented strain were each streaked onto sheep\nblood agar plates. Colonies of wild-type CN3718 and the\nCN3718::virR(pTS405) complemented strain, but not the\nCN3718::virR mutant, were surrounded by an inner zone of beta-\nhemolysis indicative of PFO production (Fig. 7A).

When VirR expression was restored by complementa-\ntion, PFO production was also restored (Fig. 7B).\n\nWhen grown on egg yolk agar plates, colonies of both the wild-\ntype parent and the CN3718::virR(pTS405) complemented strain\nwere surrounded by the precipitation zone, indicative of lecithin\nbreakdown due to the phospholipase C activity of CPA (21, 22). In\ncontrast, the CN3718::virR mutant produced a much smaller halo\nzone around its colonies when growing on this medium (Fig. 7C).\nThis result demonstrated that the VirS/VirR two-component reg-\nulatory system only partially regulates CPA production by\nCN3718. When TGY culture samples were subjected to Western\nblot analysis, the results directly demonstrated that CPA produc-\ntion was decreased compared to that of wild-type CN3718 or the\nCN3718::virR(pTS405) complemented strain (Fig. 7D).\n\nTo evaluate whether the VirS/VirR two-component regu-\nlatory system can positively regulate ETX production, Western\nblot analyses were performed to evaluate ETX production by wild-\ntype CN3718, the CN3718::virR mutant, and the CN3718::\nvirR(pTS405) complemented strain. Surprisingly, silencing of\nVirR protein production in the CN3718::virR mutant had no ef-\nfect on ETX expression compared to the wild-type and VirR com-\nplemented strains (Fig. 7E).\n\nPrevious studies (24, 27) had shown that the positive regula-\ntion of PFO and NetB production, as well as all directly VirR-\nregulated genes (28), by the VirS/VirR two-component system in\n\nC. perfringens type A strains involves virR boxes, which are two\nimperfect 12-bp directly repeated sequences located upstream of\nsuch genes. However, when the region upstream of the etx gene in\nCN3718 was sequenced and subjected to bioinformatics analysis,\nno obvious virR box sequence was identified.\n\nMDCK cell cytotoxicity of the virR mutant. As described ear-\nlier in this study using the agrB mutant, sterile supernatants from\nCaco-2 cell cultures infected with wild-type CN3718, the\nCN3718::virR null mutant, or the CN3718::virR(pTS405) comple-\nmented strain were collected and then treated with trypsin to ac-\ntivate ETX. After inactivation of trypsin, these supernatants were\ntested in our MDCK cytotoxicity assay to evaluate whether\ntrypsin-activated supernatants from the virR null mutant have\nsimilar cytopathic effects to the activated wild-type supernatants.\nObservation of morphological changes by microscopic examina-\ntion revealed that the activated supernatants from the virR null\nmutant can still clearly damage MDCK cells, similar to the effects\ncaused by activated supernatants from the wild-type CN3718 and\nthe virS/virR complemented strain (Fig. 5C). This damage in-\nvolves ETX production since preincubating any of these activated\nsupernatants with an ETX-neutralizing MAb blocked the devel-\nopment of cytotoxicity (Fig. 5C).\n\nAn LDH release assay then confirmed that there were no quan-\ntitative differences in MDCK cytotoxicity between the activated\nsupernatants of CN3718, the isogenic virR mutant, or the comple-\nmented strain (Fig. 5D). The LDH release induced from MDCK\ncells by these activated supernatants involves ETX since this effect\nwas blocked by preincubation of any of these activated superna-\ntants with an ETX-neutralizing MAb (Fig. 5D).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nC. perfringens type B or D strains cause enteritis or enterotox-\nemias, both of which start with the presence of vegetative bacteria\nin the intestines, where they contact host enterocytes (1). Recent\nin vitro studies showed that C. perfringens type C vegetative cells,\nwhich also cause disease when present in the intestines, upregulate\ntheir production of beta-toxin (CPB) when those bacteria en-\ncounter cultured enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells (25). Since type C\nstrains do not produce ETX, the present study performed a similar\nanalysis using a type D strain and found that the ETX-producing\nstrain CN3718 substantially upregulated its ETX production upon\nencountering Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that, during in\nvivo disease, ETX-producing strains like CN3718 could sense the\npresence of host cells and then respond by upregulating their ETX\nproduction to facilitate the pathogenesis of infections such as en-\nterotoxemia and enteritis, which involves bacterial production of\nETX in the intestines.\n\nThe present work has identified the agr locus as the first regu-\nlator that can control ETX production. When the agrB gene in\nCN3718 was disrupted, the resultant isogenic null mutant failed to\nproduce ETX in broth culture due to impaired etx transcription.\nConsistent with previous studies analyzing C. perfringens type A\nstrain 13 (13, 14), the CN3718 agrB mutant also produced sharply\nreduced amounts of PFO and CPA during growth in broth cul-\nture. Complementation of the CN3718 agrB mutant restored\nnearly wild-type levels of toxin production, including ETX, during\ngrowth in broth cultures. The agrB null mutant was also unable to\nupregulate its ETX production upon close contact with Caco-2\ncells, and this defect was completely reversible by complementa-\ntion with the wild-type agr operon, indicating it was not attribut-\n\nFIG 6 Construction of a CN3718 virR null mutant. (A) PCR was performed\nusing virR gene primers and genomic DNA. Using DNA from the wild-type\nCN3718, a 600-bp virR gene product was amplified. However, larger bands\nwere amplified from the CN3718::virR null mutant because the pKOR mu-\ntagenesis vector (6 kb) had inserted into the virR ORF by homologous recom-\nbination.

Furthermore, the ability of the agr\noperon to control ETX production by CN3718 was shown to in-\nvolve a diffusible signal, consistent with a QS effect. Collectively,\nthese in vitro results suggest the agr operon, apparently acting via\na QS effect, might function as an important regulator of ETX\nproduction during natural disease caused by isolates like CN3718,\nwhich are in contact with host enterocytes.\n\nIt has now been shown that the agr operon, apparently acting\nby a QS effect since it involves a secreted signal, can positively\nregulate the production of many C. perfringens toxins, including\nETX, PFO, CPA, beta2-toxin, and CPE (13, 14, 16). Thus, there is\nincreasing evidence that the Agr-like QS system is a global regula-\ntor of C. perfringens toxin production. Agr-mediated control of\nclostridial toxin production is not restricted to C. perfringens since\nthis QS system has also been implicated in positive control of\nbotulinum toxin production by C. botulinum (29). Since toxins\nplay a critical role in numerous clostridial infections, the apparent\nability of the Agr-like QS system to regulate production of such\ndifferent toxins suggests this QS system could be a master viru-\nlence regulator for several pathogenic clostridial species. The abil-\nity of the Agr-like QS system to regulate production of many clos-\ntridial toxins also suggests that this QS system could represent a\npotential target for therapeutic development.\n\nThere appear to be important differences between the agr oper-\nons in S. aureus and C. perfringens. Most notably, due to the ab-\nsence of orthologs of the AgrA/AgrC two-component regulatory\nsystem in the agr operon of C. perfringens, it has been suggested\nthat the Agr-like QS system of C. perfringens works through an-\nother two-component regulatory system, namely, the VirS/VirR\nsystem (13). Consistent with this possibility, other studies have\nshown that production of PFO, CPA, and beta2-toxin is under the\n\ncomplete or partial positive control of\nboth the Agr-like QS system and the VirS/\nVirR two-component regulatory system\n(14, 16, 17, 19, 24, 30–32).\n\nIn contrast, the present study found\nthat vegetative cells of type D strain\nCN3718 still made wild-type levels of\nETX after inactivation of the virS-R\noperon. This continued ETX production\nwas not explainable by a failure to in-\nactivate virS and virR genes during in-\nsertional mutagenesis since Western\nblotting confirmed the loss of VirR ex-\npression by the virR null mutant and this\nregulatory effect was reversible by com-\nplementation with the wild-type virS-R\noperon. Also supporting successful inac-\ntivation of the virS-R operon in the\nCN3718 virR null mutant are this strain’s\ninability to produce PFO and its reduced\nproduction of CPA, which is fully con-\nsistent with previous reports that PFO\nproduction and CPA production are\ncompletely or partially (respectively) con-\ntrolled by the VirS/VirR two-component\nsystem (17, 24). Nor was the continued\nproduction of wild-type ETX levels by the\nvirR mutant due to reversion of the virR\nmutation based upon Western blotting\n\nresults (data not shown), which using the same overnight culture\nsupernatant, detected virtually no PFO production, but wild-type\nlevels of ETX production, by the virR mutant.\n\nThus, the finding that CN3718 still produces agr locus-\nregulated ETX in the absence of a functional VirS/VirR two-\ncomponent system appears to conflict with the recent hypothesis\n(13) proposing that Agr QS-mediated regulation of toxin produc-\ntion involves the VirS/VirR two-component regulatory system.\nOne possibility is that another two-component regulatory system\ncan also regulate ETX production by CN3718 in a redundant\nmanner. Alternatively, ETX production by this strain may be\ncompletely VirS/VirR independent, possibly involving instead an-\nother of the ~20 two-component regulatory systems present in\nC. perfringens (33, 34). Consistent with that second possibility, no\nvirR boxes were detected upstream of the etx gene in CN3718.\nHowever, some C. perfringens genes lacking virR boxes are still\nindirectly regulated by VirS/VirR via a regulatory RNA named\nVR-RNA (31), so the absence of detectable virR boxes upstream of\nthe etx gene in CN3718 could still be compatible with the redun-\ndant regulation of ETX expression by both VirS/VirR and another\ntwo-component regulatory system. The current demonstration of\nwild-type levels of ETX production by the isogenic virR null mu-\ntant of CN3718 may suggest that future studies examining the\ninvolvement of other C. perfringens two-component systems in\nETX regulation are warranted. In addition, it will be important to\nexplore toxin regulation in other ETX-producing strains, includ-\ning type B strains.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrains, media, and culture conditions.

Con-\nstruction and characterization of the CN3718 etx null mutant (JIR4982)\nwere performed as reported previously (35). For use, a cooked-meat-stock\nculture of these strains was first streaked onto a Shahidi-Ferguson perfrin-\ngens (SFP) agar plate and then grown overnight at 37°C under anaerobic\nconditions. Bacterial culture media used in this study included fluid thio-\nglycolate medium (FTG) (Difco Laboratories), TGY (3% tryptic soy broth\n[Becton-Dickinson], 2% glucose [Sigma Aldrich], 1% yeast extract\n[Becton-Dickinson], and 0.1% sodium thioglycolate [Sigma Aldrich]),\ntryptose-sulfite-cycloserine (TSC) agar medium (SFP agar [Difco Labo-\nratories], supplemented with 0.04% of D-cycloserine [Sigma Aldrich]),\nand brain heart infusion (BHI) agar (Becton-Dickinson). When indi-\ncated, tetracycline (Tet; 2.5 �g/ml) or chloramphenicol (Cm; 15 �g/ml)\nwas added to the culture medium.\n\nSequencing of the CN3718 agr locus and the region upstream of the\netx gene. DNA was purified from CN3718 using the MasterPure Gram-\npositive DNA purification kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI).\nPCR was then performed on this DNA using previously described ampli-\nfication conditions with primers designed using the strain 13 agr locus\nsequences. The ~2.9-kb PCR product amplified from CN3718 DNA was\nthen sequenced by Genewiz, Inc. (South Plainfield, NJ).\n\nTo evaluate whether virR boxes are present, DNA sequences located\n0.8 kb upstream of the etx gene were amplified by PCR under the same\nconditions used for amplifying the agr locus, except with two different\nprimers (VirSeq1F [5=-CCTTATTCACTTGTAATGCGTGTCCC-3=]\nand VirSeq1R [5=-ATATCACGCTGATGCGAT-TGCTAAA-3=]). The\nPCR product was then sequenced by Genewiz, Inc., and the resultant\nCN3718 etx upstream sequence was deposited in GenBank.\n\nConstruction of a CN3718 agrB null mutant. The previously con-\nstructed, agrB-targeted intron donor plasmid pJIR750agrBi (16), which\nspecifies insertion (in a sense orientation) of a group II intron between\nagrB nucleotides 566 and 567, was used to inactivate the chromosomal\nagrB gene of CN3718. After pJIR750agrBi was electroporated into wild-\ntype CN3718, transformants were selected on BHI agar plates containing\n15 �g/ml of chloramphenicol.\n\nPutative agrB null mutants were then screened by PCR using the prim-\ners AgrBKO-F and AgrBKO-R (16). PCRs were performed in a Techne\n(Burkhardtsdorf, Germany) thermocycler using the following PCR am-\nplification conditions: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for\n30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 2 min, followed by a 10-min extension at\n68°C. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% gel and stained with\nethidium bromide for visualization. The confirmed mutant carrying an\nintron insertion in the agrB gene was then grown in FTG medium without\nantibiotics and subcultured daily for ~10 days to cure the intron-carrying\ndonor plasmid pJIR750agrBi. Curing was initially shown by susceptibility\nto chloramphenicol and then confirmed by Southern blotting, which\ndemonstrated the presence of a single intron in the mutant, named\nCN3718::agrB.\n\nTo complement the CN3718::agrB null mutant strain, a previously\nconstructed E. coli-C. perfringens shuttle plasmid, CPJVp3 (14), which\ncontained the wild-type agr operon, was introduced into the CN3718::\nagrB null mutant strain by electroporation. This complemented strain was\nnamed CN3718::agrB(p3).\n\nInactivation of the virR gene in CN3718. To inactivate the virR gene\nin CN3718, the E. coli-based, C. perfringens suicide plasmid pKOR (17)\nwas used.

Transformants were selected on BHI agar\nplates containing tetracycline (2.5 �g/ml). Several tetracycline-resistant\ncolonies were observed on the plates, and their identity as virR mutants\nwas confirmed by PCR and Western blotting.\n\nTo construct a VirR/VirS complementing strain, the previously con-\nstructed E. coli-C. perfringens shuttle vector pTS405 (26), encoding the\n\nvirR-S operon, was electroporated into the virR null mutant strain, and\ntransformants were then selected on BHI-Cm plates.\n\nSouthern blot assay.

Briefly, C. perfringens genomic\nDNA from wild-type CN3718, the agrB or virR null mutants, or the com-\nplementing strains was extracted using the MasterPure Gram-positive\nDNA purification kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies). The purified DNA was\nthen digested with EcoRI (New England Biolabs) and separated by elec-\ntrophoresis on a 0.8% agarose gel. The DNA in the gel was transferred to\na positively charged nylon membrane (Roche) and then probed with a\ndigoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probe specific for the intron sequence. This\nprobe was prepared using the primer pair AgrB-IBS and AgrB-EBS1d (16)\nand then DIG labeled with a DIG labeling kit obtained from Roche Ap-\nplied Science. CSPD substrate (Roche Applied Science) was used for de-\ntection of probe hybridization according to the manufacturer’s instruc-\ntions.\n\nWestern immunoblot assay. Each sample was mixed with 5� loading\nbuffer and electrophoresed on an SDS-containing, 12% polyacrylamide\ngel. The separated proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose\nmembrane, and the blot was incubated for 1 h with blot washing buffer\n(20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 0.3 M NaCl, 0.5% [vol/vol] Tween 20) con-\ntaining 5% (wt/vol) nonfat dry milk before incubation with primary an-\ntibody overnight at 4°C. The toxin antibodies used in these analyses have\nbeen described previously (3, 14, 16). Blots were then washed three times\nwith Tris buffer and incubated with goat anti-mouse– horseradish perox-\nidase (HRP) or anti-rabbit–HRP for 1 h at room temperature. After three\nmore washes, the blots were treated with the ECL (enhanced chemilumi-\nnescence) Western blotting detection kit (Amersham) and exposed to\nX-ray film (Life Science Products) to detect the immunoreactive protein\nbands.\n\nTo quantify ETX secretion levels at different time points, C. perfringens\nTGY culture supernatant samples and a range of purified ETX standards\n(31.25, 62.5, 125, 187.5, 250, and 312.5 ng) were run on an SDS-\ncontaining, 12% polyacrylamide gel and then Western blotted. Those im-\nmunoblots were quantified using a scanning densitometer in conjunction\nwith NIH ImageJ software.\n\nRT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted from C. perfringens cultures ac-\ncording to a previously described procedure (16). Briefly, 2 ml of 3-h TGY\nC. perfringens cultures was centrifuged at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended\nin 200 �l of acetate solution (20 mM sodium acetate [pH 5], 1 mM EDTA,\n0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS; Bio-Rad]). That suspension then re-\nceived 200 �l of saturated phenol (Fisher Scientific), and the mixture was\nthoroughly resuspended before incubation at 60°C in a water bath with\nvigorous shaking for 5 min. After centrifugation at 4°C for 5 min, the\nnucleic acid-containing supernatant received cold ethanol, and the sam-\nple was mixed well. The mixed sample was then centrifuged at 4°C for\n5 min to obtain the RNA pellet. This pellet was washed two times with cold\n70% ethanol and finally resuspended in 100 �l of DNase-free, RNase-free\nwater. All RNA samples were additionally treated with 2 U of DNase I\n(Promega) at 37°C for 30 min. To stop DNase I activity, DNase I inhibitor\n(Promega) was added to each reaction tube. RNA was quantified by ab-\nsorbance at 260 nm and stored at �80°C.\n\nRT-PCR was performed using the AccessQuick RT-PCR system (Pro-\nmega). Briefly, the RT-PCR mixture (25 �l) contained the following com-\nponents: 50 ng of each RNA sample, 20 pmol each of the forward and\nreverse primers, and 1 U of reverse transcriptase. cDNA synthesis was\nconducted at 45°C for 45 min. The following cycle conditions were used\nfor PCR: 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 60 s at 72°C for extension. A DNA\npolymerase III (polC) housekeeping gene served as an internal control to\nnormalize the expression levels between samples.\n\nCell culture. Human-derived, enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells were rou-\ntinely maintained in minimal essential Eagle’s medium (MEM) (Sigma)\ncontaining 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies), 1% minimal\nessential medium with nonessential amino acids (Sigma), 100 U/ml of\npenicillin, and 100 �g/ml of streptomycin. Madin-Darby canine kidney\n\nRegulation of Epsilon-Toxin Production\n\nNovember/December 2011 Volume 2 Issue 6 e00275-11 ® mbio.asm.org 9\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\n(MDCK) cells were cultured in a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco’s modified\nEagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma) and Ham’s F-12 (Sigma) supple-\nmented with heat-inactivated 3% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% nonessential\namino acids, 1% glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin\n(100 �g/ml). Each cell line was normally harvested with 0.25% trypsin\n(Gibco), resuspended in the cell culture medium, and maintained in a\nhumidified incubator at 37°C in 5% CO2.\n\nC. perfringens infection of Caco-2 cell cultures. For in vitro infection\nexperiments, Caco-2 cells were routinely cultured (4 to 5 days) in MEM\nuntil reaching confluence in either 100-mm tissue culture plate or 12-well\nmicroplates. Caco-2 cells were then washed 3 times with prewarmed\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS [pH 7.4]). The washed cells were incu-\nbated in serum-free and antibiotic-free MEM before C. perfringens infec-\ntion. As a control, the same volume of serum-free and antibiotic-free\nMEM (no Caco-2 cells included) was added to the microplate wells.\n\nFor some experiments, overnight cultures of wild-type CN3718, the\nisogenic agrB null mutant, or the complemented strain were pelleted and\nwashed three times with prewarmed PBS. Caco-2 cells were infected with\nthe washed C. perfringens cells in cell culture medium at a multiplicity of\ninfection (MOI) of 20 bacteria per cell and then incubated for the indi-\ncated times at 37°C under anaerobic conditions using an anerobic pouch\nwith the GasPak EZ anaerobe container system (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ).\nAfter that challenge, the infected supernatants were collected, centrifuged\nat 4°C for 30 min, and analyzed by Western blotting for ETX levels using\na mouse monoclonal anti-ETX antibody.\n\nTo further assess whether the upregulation of ETX noted in the above\nexperiments (see Results) was caused by secreted factors, overnight cul-\ntures of CN3718 were pelleted and washed three times with prewarmed\nPBS. Those washed CN3718 cells were then resuspended in one of the\nfollowing: (i) filter-sterilized serum- and antibiotic-free MEM superna-\ntants removed from Caco-2 cell cultures that had been infected with the\nCN3718 agrB mutant for 5 h, (ii) filter-sterilized serum- and antibiotic-\nfree MEM supernatants removed from noninfected Caco-2 cells that had\nbeen grown for 5 h, or (iii) filter-sterilized serum- and antibiotic-free\nMEM supernatants that had been removed from the CN3718 agrB mutant\n(no Caco-2 cells) grown for 5 h. All incubations were performed under\nanaerobic conditions.\n\nCytotoxicity of C. perfringens type D strains. (i) Visualization of\nmorphological damage. To evaluate the cytotoxic consequences of the\ntoxin upregulation detected upon contact of a type D strain with Caco-2\ncells (see Results), Caco-2 cell cultures were first challenged with washed\ncells of wild-type CN3718, the agrB null mutant, or the CN3718::agrB(p3)\ncomplemented strain. After a 2-h anaerobic infection at 37°C, the culture\nsupernatants were removed and filter sterilized using a 0.22-�m filter\n(Millipore). Those sterile supernatants, containing secreted proteins,\nwere concentrated 10� using an Amicon Ultra-4 10K device. To activate\nthe epsilon prototoxin present in the supernatants, the concentrated su-\npernatants were treated with trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) at a concentration of\n12.5 �g/ml at 37°C for 1 h. The trypsin was then inactivated by adding an\nequal volume of trypsin inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature\nfor 30 min. After centrifugation, the activated supernatants were applied\nto MDCK cells.\n\nTo verify that upregulation of ETX production by the Agr-like QS\nsystem was involved in causing any observed MDCK cell damage, a sero-\nneutralization approach was applied. Briefly, a neutralizing MAb against\nETX was added to the trypsin-activated supernatants, and the superna-\ntants were then incubated at room temperature for 15 min.\n\nAfter a 2-h treatment, the cytopathic effects caused by the toxin were\nanalyzed in terms of morphological changes. Control or damaged cells\nwere photographed using a Canon Powershot G5 fitted to the Zeiss Axio-\nvert 25 microscope, and images were processed using Adobe Photoshop\n8.0.\n\n(ii) Evaluation of MDCK cytotoxic effects. A lactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) release assay kit (Invitrogen) for mammalian cell death was used to\nassess the involvement of the Agr-like QS system or VirR/VirS two-\n\ncomponent regulatory system in CN3718-induced MDCK cell cytotoxic-\nity. The assay was performed as described by the supplier, after treatment\nof MDCK monolayers for 2 h at 37°C with trypsin-activated Caco-2 cell\nsupernatants, prepared as described above. The absorbance of each sam-\nple was measured at 490 nm with an iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad).\nThe results are expressed as the percentage of LDH release versus the total\nLDH present in cells.\n\nAnalysis of cross talk signaling. Wild-type CN3718, a previously pre-\npared etx null mutant (35), and the agrB null mutant were each grown in\nTGY broth at 37°C overnight. All strains were centrifuged at 4°C, and the\npellets were washed 3 times with warmed PBS. After resuspension in fresh\nTGY medium, the washed bacterial cells were seeded, as specified, into the\ntop or bottom chambers of Transwell plates (0.4 �m pore size; Corning).\nThe ratio of agrB null mutant to etx null mutant inoculated into the\nchambers in this cross talk experiment was 1:3. After a 3.5- or 5-h incu-\nbation, the supernatants were collected and subjected to Western blot\nanalysis using anti-ETX MAb.\n\nNucleotide sequence accession number.
