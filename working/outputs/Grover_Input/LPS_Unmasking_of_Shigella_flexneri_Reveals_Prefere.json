Unlike IcsA however, the\nspecific localisation of IcsP on the cell surface is unknown. To determine the distribution of IcsP, a haemagglutinin (HA)\nepitope was inserted into the non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 using Splicing by Overlap Extension (SOE) PCR, and IcsPHA was\ncharacterised. Quantum Dot (QD) immunofluorescence (IF) surface labelling of IcsPHA was then undertaken. Quantitative\nfluorescence analysis of S. flexneri 2a 2457T treated with and without tunicaymcin to deplete lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O\nantigen (Oag) showed that IcsP\n\nHA\nwas asymmetrically distributed on the surface of septating and non-septating cells, and\n\nthat this distribution was masked by LPS Oag in untreated cells. Double QD IF labelling of IcsPHA and IcsA showed that\nIcsPHA preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells and to the septum of septating cells. The localisation of\nIcsPHA in a rough LPS S. flexneri 2457T strain (with no Oag) was also investigated and a similar distribution of IcsPHA was\nobserved. Complementation of the rough LPS strain with rmlD resulted in restored LPS Oag chain expression and loss of\nIcsPHA detection, providing further support for LPS Oag masking of surface proteins. Our data presents for the first time the\ndistribution for the Omptin OM protease IcsP, relative to IcsA, and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.\n\nCitation: Tran ENH, Doyle MT, Morona R (2013) LPS Unmasking of Shigella flexneri Reveals Preferential Localisation of Tagged Outer Membrane Protease IcsP to\nSepta and New Poles.

IcsA (VirG) is a 120 kDa outer membrane (OM) protein\n\nlocalised at the cell pole [3]. It mediates intracellular cytoplasmic\n\nmovement of S. flexneri in epithelial cells, and cell-to-cell spread, by\n\nthe assembly of an F-actin comet-tail at one pole of the bacterium\n\n[4–6]. This type of movement is described as actin-based motility\n\n(ABM). IcsA is secreted primarily at the ‘old pole’ of Shigellae [7]\n\nwhich is opposite the ‘new pole’ (the pole derived from the site of\n\nseptation of the parent cell [8]. The 36.9 kDa IcsP (SopA) OM\n\nprotease of S. flexneri slowly cleaves IcsA at the Arg758– Arg759\nbond position [9] resulting in the release of a 95 kDa amino-\n\nterminal IcsA fragment that can be detected in culture superna-\n\ntants [5,10]. Analysis of icsP/sopA mutants has shown that IcsA is\n\ndetected across the entire surface of these bacteria with polar\n\nreinforcement [11,12]. Over-expression of IcsP results in the\n\ncomplete removal of IcsA from the cell surface [13].\n\nIcsP belongs to the Omptin family of proteases which consists of\n\n6 members; OmpT and OmpP of Escherichia coli, Pla of Yersinia\n\npestis, PgtE of Salmonella enterica, Pla endopeptidase A of Erwinia\n\npyrifoliae, and IcsP of Shigella flexneri. Immunogold labelling of\n\noverexpressed OmpP has shown that OmpP is symmetrically\n\ndistributed over the cell surface [14]. However to date, no studies\n\nhave attempted to describe the surface localisation of Omptins\n\nexpressed at native levels. While it has been suggested that IcsP\n\nmay also be located uniformly across the cell surface [13], its\n\nspecific distribution is currently unknown. In contrast to many\n\ninner membrane proteins, such as FtsZ [15] and MreB [16]\n\ninvolved in cell division and cell shape, few OM proteins have had\n\ntheir subcellular distribution determined. An exception to this is\n\nthe E. coli OM protein LamB which has been characterised to exist\n\nas two populations: one that diffuses in a helical pattern, and one\n\nthat is relatively immobile [17,18]. The E. coli Iss and Bor proteins\n\nhave been detected on the cell surface with no distinct pattern\n\n[19]. A number of non-specific E. coli OM proteins were suggested\n\nto be organised in stable helical swaths [20], and data by Shiomi\n\net al. (2006) suggested that the general protein translocation Sec\n\nmachinery itself may also be arranged in a helical array. Whether\n\nIcsP possesses a distribution similar to these OM proteins, or has\n\nan asymmetric distribution like IcsA, is the subject of this study.\n\nIn addition to the above, mutations affecting lipopolysaccharide\n\n(LPS) have also been shown to affect the observed distribution of\n\nOM proteins [21–24]. LPS is composed of three distinct regions:\n\nlipid A, core sugars and O antigen (Oag) polysaccharide chains.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70508\n\n\n\nStrains with LPS containing all 3 regions intact are known as\n\nsmooth LPS strains. Shigella mutants lacking Oag are known as\n\nrough LPS strains. Such strains have been shown to have high\n\nlevels of circumferentially distributed IcsA on the cell surface (at\n\nboth cell poles and on lateral regions) [25,26], compared to the\n\npolar localisation of IcsA seen in smooth LPS strains. Treatment of\n\nY serotype derivatives of smooth LPS S. flexneri with bacteriophage\n\nSf6 tailspike protein (TSP) endorhamnosidase results in the\n\nhydrolysis of Oag chains and an increase detection of circumfer-\n\nential IcsA on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence (IF)\n\nstaining [21]. This suggests that the presence of LPS Oag masks\n\nthe observed distribution of IcsA on the cell surface and supports\n\nthe idea that LPS Oag structure may block antibody accessibility\n\nto the detection of surface proteins [22,23]. The effect of LPS Oag\n\nstructure on the detection and distribution of IcsP has not been\n\ninvestigated.\n\nIn this study, we investigated the distribution of IcsP by cell\n\nsurface quantum dot (QD) IF labelling of functional, HA-tagged\n\nIcsP (IcsP\nHA\n\n) in S. flexneri 2457T and establish that LPS Oag masks\n\ndetection of IcsP\nHA\n\non the cell surface by using tunicamycin to\n\ninhibit Oag synthesis. Additional IF labelling with anti-IcsA\n\nantibodies to mark the location of the old pole suggested that IcsP\n\nis preferentially localised to the new pole of non-septating cells and\n\nto the septa of septating cells. We also investigated the distribution\n\nof IcsP in a rough LPS 2457T strain to provide further support for\n\nthe LPS Oag masking hypothesis. Overall, our data presents for\n\nthe first time the cell surface distribution of the Omptin OM\n\nprotease IcsP and the effect of LPS Oag masking on its detection.\n\nThis distribution has implications for IcsA polarity determination,\n\nand a model is described to explain IcsP’s contribution to IcsA\n\npolarity in S. flexneri.\n\nMethods\n\nEthics Statement\nThe anti-IcsP and anti-IcsA antibodies were produced under\n\nthe National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)\n\nAustralian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for\n\nScientific Purposes and were approved by the University of\n\nAdelaide Animal Ethics Committee.\n\nBacterial Strains, Plasmids and Media\nBacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in\n\nTable 1. Bacteria were routinely grown at 37uC in Luria-Bertani\n(LB) broth with aeration or on Congo red agar [26]. Antibiotics\n\nused were as follows: 50 mg ampicillin (Amp) ml21; 25 mg\nchloramphenicol (Cml) ml\n\n21\n; 50 mg kanamycin (Kan) ml21.\n\nDNA Methods\nE. coli K-12 DH5a was used for all cloning experiments. DNA\n\nmanipulation, PCR, transformation and electroporation was\n\nperformed as previously described [27,28]. Anti-HA monoclonal\n\nantibody (#H3663) was purchased from Sigma. Rabbit anti-IcsP\nand anti-IcsA antibodies were prepared as described previously\n\n[26,29]. The antibodies were produced under the National Health\n\nand Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Australian Code of\n\nPractice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes\n\nand were approved by the University of Adelaide Animal Ethics\n\nCommittee.\n\nInsertion of HA Epitope into IcsP\nThe sequence encoding the HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was\n\ninserted into the putatively non-essential IcsP OM loop 5 (based\n\non sequence alignments with E. coli OmpT) using SOE PCR\n\n[30,31]. In the first part of this two-step PCR technique, upstream\n\nand downstream amplicons were amplified from S. flexneri 2457T\n\ngenomic DNA using HA encoding primers (ET18/ET19) and icsP\n-\n\nspecific primers (ET3/ET10) (Table 2). The two amplicons from\n\nthis primary PCR were then mixed and used as a DNA template\n\nfor the second round of PCR with primers ET3/ET10. In this\n\nsecond reaction, the HA encoding regions of the primary PCR\n\namplicons overlap and prime one another to give the final icsP\n\nPCR product with an inserted HA epitope. The icsP\nHA\n\nfragment\n\nwas then cloned into pGEMT-Easy and primers ET22/ET25\n\n(Table 2) were used to amplify an icsP\nHA\n\nproduct with KpnI and\n\nHindIII restriction enzyme sites from this construct. The resultant\n\nKpnI-HindIII fragment was digested and sub-cloned into likewise\n\ndigested pBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsP\nHA\n\n, also referred to as\n\npIcsP\nHA\n\nin text (Table 1). Primers ET22/ET25 were also used to\n\namplify the icsP gene from 2457T genomic DNA, and cloned into\n\npBAD30 to give pBAD30::icsP, referred to as pIcsP in text\n\n(Table 1). DNA sequencing was used to confirm that no mutation\n\nhad been introduced by PCR into the sequence, and the presence\n\nof the in-frame HA epitope tag sequence.\n\nConstruction of S. flexneri icsP mutant\nThe S. flexneri 2457T icsP\n\n-\nmutant strain was constructed using\n\nallelic exchange mutagenesis [27] to inactivate the icsP gene by\n\ninsertion of a kanamycin resistance gene (kan\nR\n). Initially, the icsP\n\ngene was PCR amplified with primers ET3/ET4 containing\n\nBamHI and SacI restriction sites from 2457T genomic DNA. The\n\nresultant PCR fragment was digested with BamHI and SacI and\n\nsub-cloned into likewise digested pSL1180 (Table 1). Further\n\ndigestion with ClaI allowed insertion of the AccI-AccI digested kan\nR\n\ngene from pKTUWE (Table 1) to give pSL1180-icsP::kan\nR\n\n(Table 1). Following re-digestion with BamHI and SacI, the\n\nicsP::kan\nR\n\nfragment was cloned into pCACTUS (Table 1) and\n\ntransformed into S. flexneri 2457T via electroporation. Allelic\n\nexchange mutagenesis was performed as previously described [27].\n\nThe icsP::kan\nR\n\nmutation in the virulence plasmid was confirmed by\n\nPCR with primers ET3/ET4 (Table 2) to give the 2457T icsP\n-\n\nmutant ETRM22 (Table 1).\n\nConstruction of S. flexneri icsP2/rmlD- Double Mutant\nThe S. flexneri 2457T icsP\n\n2\n/rmlD\n\n-\nmutant strain was constructed\n\nusing a modification of the l Red recombinase system to initially\ndelete the rmlD gene [32]. Primers ET28/ET29 containing NheI\n\nrestriction enzyme sites (Table 2) were used to PCR amplify the\n\nkan\nR\n\ngene from pKD4 (Table 1). The amplified product was\n\nligated into pGEMT-Easy and pGEMT-Easy::kan\nR\n\nwas digested\n\nwith NheI. The NheI-kan\nR\n-NheI fragment was then subcloned into\n\nlikewise digested pRMA718 [26] to give pRMA718-rmlD::kan\nR\n\n(Table 1). This plasmid was then digested with BamHI and the\n\nrmlD::Kan\nR\n\nfragment was cloned into the BamHI site of\n\npCACTUS. The pCACTUS-rmlD::Kan\nR\n\nconstruct was then\n\nelectroporated into S. flexneri 2457T and allelic exchange\n\nmutagenesis was induced to give the 2457T rmlD::kan\nR\n\nmutant\n\nETRM230 (Table 1). ETRM230 was transformed with pCP20 at\n\n30uC to flip out the FRT flanked kanR gene and give the 2457T\nrmlD\n\n-\nmutant ETRM233 (Table 1). The rmlD mutation was\n\nconfirmed by LPS analysis. ETRM233 was further electroporated\n\nwith pCACTUS-icsP::kan\nR\n\n(Table 1) and another round of allelic\n\nexchange mutagenesis was performed to give the final 2457T\n\nrmlD\n2/\n\nicsP\n-\n\ndouble mutant ETRM240 (Table 1).\n\nAnalysis of IcsP/IcsPHA Protein Production\nFor detection of native IcsP, strains were grown at 37uC in LB\n\nbroth with aeration for 16 h, subcultured 1/20 into fresh broth\n\nDistribution of the Outer Membrane Protease IcsP\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e70508\n\n\n\nand grown for another 3 h to an OD600 of ,1. Strains harbouring\npIcsP or pIcsP\n\nHA\nwere grown in LB broth containing 0.2% (w/v)\n\nglucose for 16 h with aeration, subcultured 1/20 into fresh broth\n\nand grown for 1.5 h to an OD600 reading of ,0.4. Cultures were\nthen pelleted by centrifugation (22196g, 10 min, Sigma 3K15\ncentrifuge), washed 3 times in LB, and unless otherwise stated,\n\ninduced with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose for 1 h to an OD600 of ,1.\nCells (56108) were then harvested by centrifugation and\nresuspended in 2X sample buffer [33]. Protein samples were\n\nsolubilised at 100uC for 5 min, separated on SDS 15% polyacryl-\namide gels, and stained with Coomassie R-250, or subjected to\n\nWestern immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membrane (Medos)\n\nwith either polyclonal rabbit anti-IcsP antiserum (at 1/250\n\ndilution) or monoclonal mouse anti-HA (at 1/500 dilution).\n\nDetection was performed with goat anti-rabbit (or anti-mouse)\n\nhorseradish-peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (KPL) and chemi-\n\nluminescence reagent (Sigma). Benchmark prestained molecular\n\nweight markers (Invitrogen) were used as molecular size markers.\n\nSucrose Gradient Density Fractionation\nFractionation of the cell whole membrane (WM) into cytoplas-\n\nmic membrane (CM) and OM fractions was performed by sucrose\n\ngradient centrifugation according to the method of Osborn and\n\nMunson [34]. In brief, 200 ml cultures were grown and induced\n\nwith arabinose as described above, harvested by centrifugation\n\n(9,8006g, 15 min, 4uC, JA14 rotor, Beckman centrifuge J2-21M),\nwashed in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and resuspended in 5 ml\n\n10 mM HEPES in 1 mM MgCl2. The bacterial suspension was\n\nthen passed through a pre-cooled French Pressure cell (SLM\n\nAminco) once and re-centrifuged to remove cell debri.

We reasoned that IcsP levels at this time point were\n\nhigh enough for subsequent immunofluorescent detection of IcsP.\n\nNo expression of IcsP was observed for icsP\n-\n\nas expected (Fig. 1A,\n\nlanes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 & 12). Subsequent attempts to detect IcsP on\n\nthe surface of 2457T with rabbit anti-IcsP however were\n\nunsuccessful, even in a rough LPS strain (data not shown). We\n\nspeculate that as the IcsP protein used to raise antisera was\n\npurified under denaturing conditions, this may have affected the\n\nresulting antibody’s ability to detect native IcsP. However,\n\ndifficulties with IF detection of cell surface IcsP with a polyclonal\n\nantibody have also been reported by others [13]. Hence, in an\n\nalternative approach to investigate the distribution of IcsP on the\n\nbacterial cell surface, a HA epitope was inserted into the IcsP\n\nprotein.\n\nFigure 4.

These results suggest that the insertion of\n\nthe HA tag into the OM loop 5 of IcsP does not affect its ability to\n\ncleave IcsA, and hence the IcsP\nHA\n\nprotein is functional.\n\nLocalisation of IcsP/IcsPHA Protein to the OM\nSince IcsP\n\nHA\nwas modified compared to IcsP and expressed\n\nfrom the pBAD promoter, the presence of IcsP\nHA\n\nprotein\n\nexclusively in the OM was confirmed by using sucrose density\n\ngradient centrifugation. The WM of icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP] were fractionated into CM and OM on sucrose gradients,\n\nand fractions subjected to SDS 15% polyacrylamide gel electro-\n\nphoresis, prior to visualisation by Coomassie Blue staining and\n\nWestern immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-IcsP. Analysis of\n\nthe sucrose gradient samples showed that fractions which were\n\nenriched with OM proteins (OmpF, OmpC, and OmpA) [40]\n\ncontained the majority of the 36 kDa IcsP\nHA\n\nand IcsP proteins\n\n(Fig. 3A & B, lanes 2 to 5). These results indicate that IcsP\nHA\n\nis\n\nlocalised to the OM similar to IcsP, and that the HA insertion did\n\nnot result in any dramatic disruption of IcsP protein localisation.\n\nDetection of Arabinose Induced IcsPHA Expression by\nWestern Immunoblotting\n\nWild-type S. flexneri 2457T showed optimal expression levels of\n\nnative IcsP at 3 h (Fig. 1A). To investigate the conditions required\n\nfor comparable IcsP\nHA\n\nexpression, whole cell lysate samples were\n\nprepared from icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30] induced with\n\n0%, 0.003%, 0.006%, 0.0125%, 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% or 0.2%\n\n(w/v) arabinose for 1 h. Western immunoblotting with anti-IcsP\n\nshowed that a band of ,36 kDa was detected for 2457T and icsP-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] induced with 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2% (w/v) (w/\n\nv) arabinose (Fig. 1C, lanes 1, 3–6), with expression levels\n\ncomparable to native IcsP for icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] observed between\n\n0.025%–0.05% (w/v) arabinose induction (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 & 6).\n\nInduction at 0.03% (w/v) arabinose was hence chosen for all\n\nsubsequent experiments.\n\nCell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in S. flexneri\n2457T and the Effect of Tunicamycin Treatment\n\nHaving established an induction protocol that closely approx-\n\nimates the level of expression of IcsP\nHA\n\nto native IcsP, we next\n\nattempted to detect IcsP\nHA\n\nat these levels on the surface of 2457T\n\nicsP\n-\n\nusing indirect QD IF microscopy. Strains icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and\n\nicsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30] were cultured with 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, fixed,\n\nand then probed for HA using a primary anti-HA antibody and a\n\nsecondary QD 525 conjugated antibody. However, no IcsP\nHA\n\nwas\n\ndetected on the cell surface, and intensity scans of icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n]\n\nwere equivalent to icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30] (Fig. S1).\n\nSince IcsP\nHA\n\ncould not be detected on the cell surface of icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n], we reasoned that the presence of LPS Oag may mask\n\nthe detection of surface IcsP as this has previously been shown for\n\nIcsA [21]. An LPS Oag depletion-regeneration assay [29] was\n\nhence carried out on icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30] induced\n\nwith 0.03% (w/v) arabinose, followed by IF labelling. This assay\n\ninvolves the use of an inhibitor of the WecA enzyme necessary for\n\nOag subunit biosynthesis using tunicamycin, and polymyxin B\n\nnonapeptide (PMBN) was used to improve OM penetration. Upon\n\nremoval of these two chemicals from growing bacteria, LPS Oag is\n\nregenerated [29]. Analysis of the resulting LPS by SDS-PAGE and\n\nsilver staining showed that icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30]\n\nsamples treated with tunicamycin/PMBN (TP) had depleted LPS\n\nOag (Fig. 4A, lanes 5 & 6), with Oag production restored (R) upon\n\nremoval of TP (Fig. 4A, lanes 7 & 8). Untreated (U) and PMBN\n\ntreated (P) samples showed no inhibition of Oag biosynthesis as\n\nexpected (Fig. 4A, lanes 1–4).\n\nFollowing successful depletion of LPS Oag, QD IF microscopy\n\nwas performed on the above mentioned samples. IcsP\nHA\n\ncould not\n\nbe detected on untreated or PMBN treated icsP\n-\n[pIcsP\n\nHA\n] cells, as\n\nexpected (Fig. S2A). However, surface IcsP\nHA\n\nwas detected on\n\nicsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] cells treated with TP, suggesting that LPS Oag is\n\nable to mask antibody accessibility to IcsP\nHA\n\n(Fig. S2A).\n\nInterestingly, IcsP\nHA\n\nappeared to be distributed asymmetrically\n\nover the cell surface of the majority of cells examined and\n\nfluorescence intensity line-scans revealed that IcsP\nHA\n\nlocalised\n\npreferentially to one pole of non-septating cells and the septa of\n\nseptating cells (Fig. S2A). To determine if the distribution of\n\nIcsP\nHA\n\non the cell surface segregated to either the new pole or the\n\nold pole, additional staining of the bacteria was conducted with\n\nanti-IcsA antibodies since IcsA is known to localise to the old cell\n\npole [5]. Again, IcsP\nHA\n\ncould not be detected on untreated or\n\nPMBN treated icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] cells (Fig. 5A & B) but could be\n\ndetected after TP treatment (Fig. 5C). Peak IcsP\nHA\n\ndetection was\n\nconsistently observed at the new pole (opposing IcsA at the old\n\npole) and at the septum of septating bacteria as shown by line-\n\nscans (Fig. 5C). As expected, no surface IcsP\nHA\n\nwas detected for\n\nuntreated, PMBN treated, or TP treated samples of icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30] when stained for IcsP\nHA\n\n(Fig. S2B) or double stained\n\nfor IcsP\nHA\n\nand IcsA (Fig. S3). Notably, IcsA on icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30]\n\nwas detected at higher amounts laterally and at the septa of\n\nbacteria (Fig. S3) as previously seen for DicsP strains [13].\n\nCell Surface Detection of IcsPHA Distribution in Rough\nLPS S. flexneri 2457T\n\nTo further investigate the effect of Oag on IcsP distribution, a\n\n2457T icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\ndouble mutant was constructed to indepen-\n\nold poles of septating bacteria. Student’s two-tailed t-tests (D) were also conducted on the fold differences of mean IcsPHA intensities between\ndiscrete positions (new pole, old pole, and septum) of Oag-depleted icsP- and icsP-/rmlD- bacteria.

Mutation of the rmlD gene in S. flexneri results in a\n\nstrain which is unable to synthesise the precursor deoxythymidine\n\ndiphosphate (dTDP)- rhamnose required for Oag repeat units and,\n\nhence, results in a rough LPS phenotype [29,41]. Analysis of the\n\nresulting LPS conferred by icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\nstrains expressing pIcsP\nHA\n\nand pBAD30 showed that rough LPS was observed for both (Fig.\n\n4B, lanes 1 & 2), with a band consistent with the size of the IcsP\nHA\n\nprotein (36 kDa) detected only in the icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n]\n\nsample by Western immunoblotting, as expected (Fig. 4C, lane 1).\n\nFixed samples of icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\n[pBAD30] cells were then probed for both IcsP\nHA\n\nand IcsA using\n\nthe same QD IF staining protocol as previously conducted for\n\nsmooth strains. Similarly to LPS Oag-depleted icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n],\n\nIcsP\nHA\n\nwas detected on the bacterial surface most predominately\n\nat the new pole (Fig. 6A) and the septum (Fig. 6B). Again, the\n\nmajority of septating cells had higher peak IcsP\nHA\n\nintensity at the\n\nseptum than new poles of non-septating cells (line-scans Fig. 6A &\n\nB). Single staining of these cells for IcsP\nHA\n\nwas also conducted and\n\nyielded the same localisation results (Fig. S4). As expected, IcsP\nHA\n\nwas not detected on the icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\n[pBAD30] strain in IF\n\nmicroscopy experiments when either single (Fig. S4) or double\n\nstained (Fig. 6B). Again, IcsA on icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\n[pBAD30] was\n\ndetected at higher amounts laterally and at the septum (Fig. 6A &\n\nB).\n\nTo again demonstrate the effect of LPS Oag masking of IcsP\nHA\n\n,\n\nsmooth LPS structure was restored in the icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\nstrain\n\nexpressing pIcsP\nHA\n\nby transforming pRMA727 carrying a\n\nfunctional rmlD gene. Analysis of the resulting LPS conferred by\n\nicsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n[pIcsP\n\nHA\n][pRMA727] showed restored smooth LPS\n\nphenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 3), and when probed for IcsP\nHA\n\nby QD\n\nIF microscopy, was barely detectable (Fig. 7A). The control icsP\n2\n\n/\n\nrmlD\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] strain carrying pACYC184 conferred a rough\n\nLPS phenotype (Fig. 4B, lane 4) and IcsP\nHA\n\nwas detected by IF\n\nmicroscopy with the same distribution observed previously (Fig.\n\n7B).\n\nMulti-cell Line-scan Analysis of IcsPHA Surface\nDistribution\n\nTo determine if the observed sub-cellular preference of IcsP\nHA\n\nto the new poles and septa is a statistically significant phenom-\n\nenon, cumulative QD IF line-scan analyses on both IcsP\nHA\n\n/IcsA\n\ndouble stained LPS Oag-depleted icsP\n-\n\nstrains and rough icsP\n2\n\n/\n\nrmlD\n-\n\nstrains was conducted for a larger population of cells.\n\nScanning was initiated from the new pole to the old pole (as\n\nmarked by IcsA) for non-septating cells, and from the septum to\n\nthe old pole for septating cells (Fig 8C). From 9 independent\n\nsamples of LPS Oag-depleted icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30],\n\na total of 450 non-septating cells each were line-scanned.\n\nAdditionally a total of 355 and 256 septating cells were scanned\n\nfor icsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] and icsP\n-\n\n[pBAD30] respectively. The resultant\n\nmean fluorescence intensity profiles show that IcsP\nHA\n\nis preferen-\n\ntially localised at the new pole and tends to gradually decrease\n\ntowards the old pole on non-septating cells expressing pIcsP\nHA\n\n(Fig. 8A). For septating cells, IcsP\nHA\n\nmean intensity is localised\n\nhighest at the septum and declines more steeply towards the old\n\npole (Fig. 8A). As expected, the intensity profiles of icsP\n-\n[pBAD30]\n\ncells were at a negligible level (Fig. 8A). Statistical analysis of mean\n\nIcsP\nHA\n\nintensity at discrete bacterial positions of LPS-depleted\n\nicsP\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] confirmed that the localisation of IcsP\nHA\n\nis: (i) 2-\n\nfold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole\n\n(P = 0.004), (ii) 2.9-fold higher at the septum of septating cells than\n\nthe old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.5-fold higher at septa of\n\nseptating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells\n\n(P = 0.038) (Fig. 8D).\n\nFor the rough LPS strains, 9 independent samples of icsP\n2\n\n/\n\nrmlD\n-\n[pIcsP\n\nHA\n] and icsP\n\n2\n/rmlD\n\n-\n[pBAD30] were investigated with\n\na total of 450 non-septating cells each line-scanned.

Likewise,\n\nIcsP\nHA\n\nmean intensity of septating cells is localised highest at the\n\nseptum and declines very steeply towards the old pole (Fig. 8B). As\n\nexpected, the mean intensity profiles of icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\n[pBAD30]\n\nwere at a negligible level (Fig. 8B). Statistical analysis of mean\n\nIcsP\nHA\n\nintensity at discrete bacterial positions of icsP\n2\n\n/rmlD\n-\n\n[pIcsP\nHA\n\n] again confirmed that the localisation of IcsP\nHA\n\nis: (i) 2.2-\n\nfold higher at the new pole of non-septating cells than the old pole\n\n(P,0.0001), (ii) 3.6-fold higher at the septum of septating cells than\n\nthe old pole (P,0.0001), and (iii) 1.7-fold higher at septa of\n\nseptating cells compared to new poles of non-septating cells\n\n(P = 0.0002) (Fig. 8D).

In this study we investigated the distribution of IcsP\n\non the cell surface of S. flexneri 2a 2457T using a HA-tagged IcsP\n\nprotein (Fig. 2) under pBAD control. Characterisation of IcsP\nHA\n\nshowed that it was functionally able to cleave IcsA, and was\n\nsecreted into the OM comparably to IcsP (Fig. 1B & 3). However,\n\nwhen IcsP\nHA\n\nwas expressed at native IcsP equivalent levels (Fig.\n\n1A & C), it was undetectable in the OM via QD IF microscopy in\n\nsmooth LPS S. flexneri (Fig. S1) but detectable on both LPS Oag-\n\ndepleted and rough LPS Shigella bacteria (Fig. 4, 5 & 6).\n\nFurthermore, this masking effect was restored in rough strains\n\nupon complementation of rmlD (Fig. 4B & 7). We suggest that the\n\nlong LPS Oag chains of smooth strains sterically hinder the\n\naccessibility of antibodies to the OM surface. This type of protein\n\nmasking by LPS Oag has also been shown for IcsA in 2457T [21],\n\nand several other OM proteins [22,23]. It is interesting to note that\n\nmulti-cell line-scan analysis of IcsP\nHA\n\ndetection on the cell surface\n\nshowed that IcsP\nHA\n\nfluorescence intensity was higher for rough\n\nLPS cells than for LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8). Similar to its\n\nOmptin homolog, OmpT, IcsP possesses most of the putative LPS-\n\nbinding sites found in OmpT (Fig. 2C) [38] and may also interact\n\nwith LPS. Since TP is only partly effective at blocking LPS Oag\n\nsynthesis, it is possible that the few LPS Oag molecules synthesised\n\nare still closely bound to IcsP. This may cause a small amount of\n\nmasking and may explain the lower fluorescence intensity\n\nobserved on LPS Oag-depleted cells (Fig. 8A) compared to the\n\nrough LPS cells (Fig. 8B).\n\nIcsA distributions in DicsP strains previously provided indirect\nevidence to suggest that IcsP is distributed equally over the cell\n\nsurface of S. flexneri [12,13,42]. However, once the masking effect\n\nof LPS Oag was circumvented, we were able to extensively study\n\nthe distribution profile of IcsP\nHA\n\nin the OM. This work has shown\n\nthat IcsP\nHA\n\n(and likely IcsP) has an asymmetrical distribution\n\nwhich may be cell cycle dependent. On dividing cells IcsP\n\naccumulates at high concentration at the septum and then declines\n\nsteeply towards the old pole of the emerging daughter cell.\n\nHowever, once divided, detection of IcsP at the new pole (the pole\n\nderived from the septum) of daughter cells decreased significantly\n\nand then the decline towards the old pole is more moderate. To\n\nexplain this, we propose that IcsP is directed to septa of dividing\n\ncells and that daughter cells ‘inherit’ a higher concentration of IcsP\n\nat new poles (model Fig. 9). As the daughter cell elongates, IcsP is\n\nlaterally diluted, resulting in the gentle gradient on non-septating\n\ncells. In this model, lateral dilution of IcsP may occur by\n\nmembrane insertion events during cell elongation similarly to that\n\ndescribed for E. coli LamB [43]. This model predicts increased\n\ncleavage of IcsA at the septum and lateral regions of the cell in\n\norder to help set up a relatively higher concentration of IcsA at the\n\nold pole and to maintain the old pole preference of IcsA in\n\ndaughter cells. Additionally, the model may explain, and also fits,\n\nthe common observation that IcsA distributions and intensities\n\nvary between cells in a given population of the same strain.\n\nMany proteins are known to accumulate at the inner membrane\n\nof the mid-cell in order to mediate septum formation and cell\n\ndivision – for instance, FtsZ polymerises at the cytoplasmic face to\n\nform the Z-ring and attract further divisome components [44].\n\nHowever, few OM proteins have been shown to concentrate to the\n\nseptum. A notable exception to this is the OM lipoprotein LpoB\n\nwhich localises as distinct foci at septa and complexes with\n\nperiplasmic penicillin binding protein 1B tethering it to other\n\ndivisome components [44,45]. Interestingly, septal localisation of\n\nLpoB is lost when peptidoglycan synthesis is inhibited [45].\n\nWhether the localisation of integral OM protein IcsP to the septal\n\nOM requires similar interactions with divisome components, or is\n\ndependent on peptidoglycan synthesis, remains to be investigated.\n\nIn summary, this work has shown for the first time the surface\n\nlocalisation of IcsP, a member on the Omptin family of OM\n\nproteases. We have observed that: (i) the distribution of IcsP is\n\nmasked by LPS Oag in S. flexneri 2457T, and (ii) IcsP is\n\nconcentrated at new poles and at the septum of dividing cells.\n\nThis distribution of IcsP explains the observed IcsA localisation\n\ndefect in DicsP strains [11,12]. We have also proposed a model to\nexplain the inheritance of OM proteins IcsP and IcsA through\n\ngenerations of cell division. Finally, unmasking of surface antigens\n\nvia LPS Oag-depletion may be useful in the study of other\n\nminimally exposed OM proteins.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Inability to detect IcsP\nHA\n\non the cell surface of\n2457T icsP\n\n-\n.
