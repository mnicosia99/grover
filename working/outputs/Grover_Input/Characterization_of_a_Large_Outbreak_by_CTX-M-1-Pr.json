The involvement of a single K. pneumoniae clone was demonstrated by pulsed-field gel electro-\nphoresis. In addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance, the epidemic strain uniformly showed cross-\nresistance to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline,\nwhereas resistance to the �-lactam–�-lactamase inhibitor combinations was variable. The ESBL involved\nwas CTX-M-1, as demonstrated by isoelectric focusing, PCR amplification, and sequencing. CTX-M-1 as\nwell as the aminoglycoside resistance determinants were encoded in a 50-kb plasmid that could be\ntransferred to Escherichia coli only by transformation. In two of the infected patients, carbapenem\nresistance development (MICs of 8 to 12, 16, and >32 �g/ml for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem,\nrespectively) was documented, both in clinical samples and in intestinal colonization studies. The analysis\nof the outer membrane proteins of the carbapenem-susceptible and -resistant isolates revealed that the\nformer expressed only one of the two major porins, OmpK36, whereas the latter did not express either of\nthem. In one of the cases, the lack of expression of OmpK36 was demonstrated to be mediated by the\ninterruption of the coding sequence by the insertion sequence IS26. This is the first report of a large\noutbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented description in the\nliterature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, despite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple\nspecies. Furthermore, we document and characterize for the first time carbapenem resistance development\nin CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nSince plasmid-mediated extended-spectrum �-lactamases\n(ESBLs) were first detected in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate\nin 1983 in Germany (22), they have been increasingly reported\nworldwide (5). The classical ESBLs are those derived from the\nbroad-spectrum enzymes TEM-1, TEM-2, and SHV-1 by the\nacquisition of specific point mutations which expand their\nspectrum of hydrolysis to oxyimino-cephalosporins and aztreo-\nnam (7). Nevertheless, the most widespread plasmid-mediated\nESBLs nowadays are the CTX-M enzymes, which are directly\nderived from the chromosomal �-lactamases of several species\nof the genus Kluyvera (3). Five different groups of CTX-Ms\ncontaining a total of over 30 different variants have been de-\nscribed so far, with CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2, CTX-M-8, CTX-\nM-9, and CTX-M-25 being the first reported representatives.\nCTX-M-1 (also known as MEN-1) was the first reported variant,\ndetected from an Escherichia coli strain in 1989 in Germany (2),\nbut CTX-M-2, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M-15 are the\nmost widespread enzymes (3).\n\nThe production of ESBLs in Enterobacteriaceae confers re-\nsistance to all penicillins and cephalosporins (with the excep-\ntion of cephamycins), with the organism generally remaining\nsusceptible only to �-lactam–�-lactamase inhibitor combina-\ntions, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate, and the carbapenems,\nwhich are frequently the only therapeutic options available for\ntreatment of hospital-acquired severe infections caused by\nthese microorganisms (25). Coresistance to non-�-lactam an-\ntibiotics is also frequent, either by the cotransfer of the resis-\ntance determinants in the same genetic elements (such as ami-\nnoglycoside resistance) or simply by the coselection of both\nresistance mechanisms, as occurs with fluoroquinolones (32).\n\nIn this work we characterized a large outbreak caused by a\nCTX-M-1-producing multiresistant K. pneumoniae strain in a\nSpanish intensive care unit (ICU). Although CTX-M-1 was the\nfirst CTX-M described, over 15 years ago, and has been de-\ntected in various countries, including at least Germany and\nFrance (14), Italy (31), and recently, in a single E. coli isolate\nfrom cattle milk, Spain (6), and in several species, including E.\ncoli, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, and Citrobacter\namalonaticus (28), reports of CTX-M-1-producing K. pneu-\nmoniae strains have not yet been published, and this is the first\nreport of a large outbreak of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobac-\n\n* Corresponding author.

Furthermore, in this work we document\nand characterize for the first time in vivo resistance develop-\nment to carbapenems in CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacteria-\nceae due to the selection of mutations leading to the lack of\nexpression of porins.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nClinical strains and antibiotic susceptibility testing. All ESBL-producing\nEnterobacteriaceae isolates from patients admitted to the adult ICU (30 beds\ndivided in three contiguous units) from Hospital Son Dureta (900 beds;\nreference public hospital from the Island of Mallorca, Spain) have been\nprospectively documented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak caused\nby multiresistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was detected. Bacterial\nidentification and initial susceptibility testing were performed with the\nWIDER semiautomatic system (Francisco Soria Melguizo, Madrid, Spain)\n(8). Double-disk synergy testing (DDST) for the detection of ESBL produc-\ntion was performed using amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,\ncefepime, and aztreonam disks that were applied 30 and/or 20 mm apart (20).\nAdditionally, the MICs of several antibiotics were determined for selected\nisolates by using Etest strips (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden), following the\nmanufacturer’s recommendations. For the screening of intestinal coloniza-\ntion by the epidemic K. pneumoniae ESBL-producing strain, from May to\nDecember 2005, rectal swabs, collected weekly, were plated on MacConkey\nagar supplemented with 2 �g/ml of cefotaxime and 10 �g/ml of gentamicin.\nThe screening for intestinal colonization was carried out for all patients with\npositive clinical samples as well as those patients present in the same unit at\nthe time of isolation. For those patients, weekly rectal swabs were obtained\nuntil discharge or until three consecutive negative colonization results.\n\nMolecular strain typing. The clonal relationship between the different isolates\nwas studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Agarose plugs contain-\ning total bacterial DNA were prepared as described elsewhere (21). Plugs were\nthen digested with XbaI and loaded into a 1% Megabase agarose (Bio-Rad, La\nJolla, Calif.) gel. DNA separation was performed in a CHEF-DRIII apparatus\n(Bio-Rad, La Jolla, Calif.) under the following conditions: 6 V/cm2 for 20 h at\n14°C, with initial and final pulse times of 2 s and 35 s, respectively. The results\nwere interpreted following the criteria of Tenover et al. (37).\n\nCharacterization of �-lactamases and their genes. The pIs of the �-lactamases\nwere determined by isoelectric focusing (IEF), applying the supernatants of\ncrude sonic cell extracts to Phast gels (Pharmacia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with a\npH gradient of 3 to 9 in a Phast system (Pharmacia). �-Lactamases with known\npI values (TEM-1, TEM-2, TEM-4, TEM-3, SHV-1, CTX-M-10, and CTX-M-1)\nwere included as controls. Gels were stained with 500 �g/ml of nitrocefin (Oxoid)\nto identify the bands corresponding to �-lactamases. PCRs for genes encoding\nTEM, SHV, CTX-M-9, and CTX-M-10 �-lactamases were performed using\nprimers and conditions described previously (10). Primers CTX-MF (5�-GACT\nATTCATGTTGTTGTTATTTC-3�) and CTX-MR (5�-TTACAAACCGTTGG\nTGACG-3�) were used for the amplification of a 923-bp DNA fragment (nucle-\notides �48 to the stop codon) from the genes encoding CTX-M-1 or closely\nrelated ESBLs. Taq Gold polymerase (PE-Applied Biosystems) was used for\nPCR amplification under the following conditions: 12 min at 94°C, 35 cycles of\namplification (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C, and 1 min at 72°C), and a final\nextension step of 10 min at 72°C. Two independent PCR products were se-\nquenced on both strands, using the BigDye terminator kit (PE-Applied Biosys-\ntems) for performing the sequencing reactions, which were analyzed with the\nABI Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (PE-Applied Biosystems).\n\nConjugation, transformation, and plasmid analysis. Conjugation experiments\nwere performed by filter mating using a rifampin-resistant mutant of E. coli strain\nHB101 as the recipient in 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, triparenteral crossings using\nthe same recipient and E. coli HB101(pRK2013) as a mobilization helper (12) in\na 1:1:1 ratio were attempted. Transconjugants were selected in Luria-Bertani\n(LB) agar plates containing 100 �g/ml of rifampin and 2 �g/ml of cefotaxime. For\ntransformation experiments, plasmid DNAs from the ESBL-producing K. pneu-\nmoniae isolates obtained using the QIAGEN plasmid Midi kit (QIAGEN,\nHilden, Germany) were transformed into the E. coli XL1-Blue strain made\ncompetent by CaCl2 treatment. Transformants were selected in LB agar plates\ncontaining 50 �g/ml of ampicillin. Transconjugants or transformants were\nchecked by DDST followed by IEF, PCR amplification of the appropriate ESBL-\nencoding gene, and Etest testing of susceptibility to all �-lactams and non-�-\nlactams (to determine the resistance determinants cotransferred with the ESBL)\ndefined above. For the estimation of the plasmid size, plasmid DNA obtained\nfrom one of the transformants was digested with EcoRI, BamHI, and EcoRI plus\n\nBamHI, and the restriction fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 1%\nagarose gel. The sizes of the different fragments were estimated by plotting\nagainst the standard curve obtained with the Superladder-Mid1 100-bp ladder\nmolecular weight markers (Gensura) and the lambda HindIII digest (New\nEngland Biolabs).\n\nIsolation and analysis of OMP. Cell envelopes were isolated from K. pneu-\nmoniae strains grown in LB medium by centrifugation at 100,000 � g for 1 h at\n4°C after French press cell lysis. Outer membrane proteins (OMP) were isolated\nas sodium lauryl sarcosynate-insoluble material (15). Electrophoretic analysis of\nOMP by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-\nPAGE) was performed with 11% acrylamide–0.35% bisacrylamide–0.1% SDS by\nusing Laemmli’s buffers (24) and Coomassie blue staining. Samples were boiled\nfor 5 min in sample buffer before electrophoresis. Western blot analysis of\nSDS-PAGE-separated OMP was carried out with the buffers and conditions\ndescribed by Towbin et al. (38), Immobilon P membranes (Millipore), rabbit\nantiserum raised against purified OmpK36 porin (1), and alkaline phosphatase-\nlabeled anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Sigma). Enzyme was detected with 5-bromo-\n4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate toluidinium–nitroblue tetrazolium. K. pneumoniae\nLB1, which expresses only one porin, was used as a control (26).\n\nPCR amplification of porin genes. The primers used to amplify the OmpK36\nporin gene were OmpK36-0 (5� AAGCTTGTTGGATTATTCTGC-3�) and\nOmpK36-end (5�-CAAGCTTAGAACTGGTAAACC-3�). They anneal specifi-\ncally to sequences of ompK36 located 116 bp upstream and 1,084 bp downstream\nof the ompK36 start codon (26), respectively. PCR amplifications were per-\nformed in a Thermoline Amplitron 1 thermal cycler by using Taq polymerase\n(Pharmacia) with 30 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1\nmin at 72°C). Amplicons were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and\nethidium bromide staining and sequenced as described above.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAll ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates from pa-\ntients admitted to an adult ICU were prospectively docu-\nmented from 2002 to 2005, when a large outbreak of multi-\nresistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae infection was detected.\nThe incidence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolated\nduring this period is shown in Fig. 1A. As can be observed, a\ndramatic increase in the number of patients infected by ESBL-\nproducing K. pneumoniae was documented during 2005, with a\ntotal of 52 cases, in contrast to the 1 case documented in either\n2003 or 2004 and the 0 cases documented in 2002. Figure 1B\nshows the distribution of new cases on a monthly basis during\n2005, clearly showing that the epidemic started in February\nand reached its peak during May and June, with 13 and 12 new\ncases, respectively. From then on, the incidence of new cases\non a monthly basis fluctuated from zero to six new cases per\nmonth. Since five new cases were detected in December, the\noutbreak still cannot be considered to have been controlled at\nthe end of the year. In May 2005, in addition to measures for\nthe contact isolation of infected patients, a protocol for routine\ndetection and isolation of patients with intestinal colonization\nwas established; rectal swabs were collected weekly and plated\nin selective media, and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae was\nidentified as described in Materials and Methods. The out-\nbreak had a dramatic impact on the prevalence of ESBL-\nproducing K. pneumoniae in the ICU, reaching 60.3% of pa-\ntients infected (not including patients with only intestinal\ncolonization) by K. pneumoniae during 2005, in contrast to 0%,\n4.5%, and 3.8% for the years 2002, 2003, and 2004, respec-\ntively.\n\nAll but one of the K. pneumoniae isolates recovered from the\n52 patients had the same pattern of multiresistance as initially\ndocumented with the WIDER microdilution-based semiauto-\nmatic system for bacterial identification and susceptibility test-\ning (8), showing, in addition to the ESBL-mediated resistance\n\n2832 MENA ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\nto penicillins and cephalosporins, cross-resistance to cipro-\nfloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethox-\nazole, and tetracycline. All isolates with this pattern of multi-\nresistance were uniformly susceptible, when first recovered\n(see below), only to amikacin and carbapenems. The single\nisolate with a different resistance pattern was ciprofloxacin\nsusceptible and amikacin resistant.\n\nAll ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (one randomly\nselected isolate from each of the 52 patients) were confirmed\nto belong to a single epidemic, multiresistant clone, with the\nexception of that isolate with a different resistance pattern, by\nPFGE. Furthermore, the single isolate from 2003 was found to\nbe nonrelated to the epidemic clone by PFGE, but the isolate\nfrom 2004 (detected in November, 3 months before the initi-\nation of the outbreak) was found to be highly related to the\nepidemic clone, as shown in Fig. 2.\n\nThe sources of the ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae epi-\ndemic clone for the 51 ICU patients during the 2005 outbreak\n\nare shown in Table 1. In 44 (86.3%) of the patients the epi-\ndemic clone was isolated from clinical samples, most fre-\nquently from the respiratory tract (30 patients; 68.2%),\nwhereas in 7 (13.7%) of them it was detected only in intestinal\ncolonization studies. Intestinal colonization studies were per-\nformed for 34 of the 44 infected patients (77.3%), with a\npositive result obtained for 32 (94.1%), thus showing that in-\ntestinal colonization occurs in most infected patients.\n\nTo characterize the ESBL produced by the epidemic K.\npneumoniae clone, IEF was performed with three random iso-\nlates, revealing in all cases the presence of a �-lactamase band\nwith a pI of �8.4 cofocusing with the CTX-M-1 control. PCR\namplification was found to be positive only when using the\nprimers for the gene encoding CTX-M-1 or related enzymes\nand sequencing of the PCR products confirmed the presence\nof blaCTX-M-1. As could be expected, the single ESBL-produc-\ning K. pneumoniae isolate from 2004 (clonally related to the\n2005 outbreak isolates) also produced CTX-M-1. On the other\n\nFIG. 1. A.

Nevertheless, the plasmid\nlocation of blaCTX-M-1was demonstrated by transformation ex-\nperiments. Plasmid DNA was transformed into E. coli, and\nthree transformants growing on LB agar plates containing 50\n�g/ml of ampicillin were first checked by DDST followed by\nIEF, which revealed the presence of a single �-lactamase band\nwith a pI of �8.4, and then by PCR amplification with the\nspecific primers. The size of the plasmid determined by the\nanalysis of the EcoRI and BamHI restriction fragments was\nestimated to be approximately 50 kb.\n\nIn two of the patients infected by the epidemic multiresistant\nK. pneumoniae clone, development of carbapenem (imipenem,\nmeropenem, and ertapenem) resistance was documented. For\none of them, the carbapenem-resistant isolate was recovered\nfrom respiratory samples after treatment with imipenem, and\nfor the other the isolate was recovered from urine after treat-\nment with meropenem. In both patients, the carbapenem-re-\nsistant isolates were additionally detected in the intestinal col-\nonization studies. PFGE macrorestriction patterns of the two\ncarbapenem-resistant isolates were found to be identical to\n\nthose of the carbapenem-susceptible isolates, and the acquisi-\ntion of additional �-lactamases was ruled out by IEF.\n\nTable 2 shows the MICs (determined by Etest) of several\n�-lactam and non-�-lactam antibiotics for five representative\nisolates of the epidemic clone recovered from different pa-\ntients and during different periods and for the two carbap-\nenem-resistant isolates. The MICs in both resistant isolates\nwere slightly higher for ertapenem (MIC of �32 �g/ml), fol-\nlowed by meropenem (MIC of 16 �g/ml) and imipenem (MIC\nof 8 to 12 �g/ml). The MICs for the E. coli transformant\nharboring the blaCTX-M-1-carrying plasmid (pAMR-1) are also\nshown in Table 2. As can be observed, in addition to the\nESBL-mediated resistance pattern, aminoglycoside (gentami-\ncin and tobramycin) resistance was cotransferred in the same\nplasmid. As for carbapenems, pAMR-1 significantly raised the\nMICs for E. coli XL1-Blue of ertapenem (from 0.012 to 0.125\n�g/ml) and, to a lesser extent, of meropenem (from 0.016 to\n0.047 �g/ml) but not of imipenem (0.38 �g/ml) (harboring or not\npAMR-1). Nevertheless, the MICs of the three carbapenems\nremained far below the resistance breakpoints.\n\nIn order to investigate whether carbapenem resistance was\ncaused by alterations of the outer membrane permeability, we\nanalyzed the outer membrane proteins of susceptible and re-\nsistant pairs of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates from two pa-\ntients. SDS-PAGE analysis of the OMP of K. pneumoniae\ngrown in LB showed only two major proteins, of about 33 and\n36 kDa, in the 31- to 45-kDa range for the carbapenem-sus-\nceptible isolates, corresponding to OmpA and OmpK36, re-\nspectively. On the other hand, the 36-kDa protein was absent\nin both carbapenem-resistant isolates (Fig. 3A). The porin\nnature of the 36-kDa protein present in the carbapenem-sus-\nceptible isolates and absent in the resistant ones was confirmed\nby Western blot analysis using specific antibodies (Fig. 3B).\nThe specific antiserum reacted with the band present in the\nsusceptible isolates and the control K. pneumoniae LB1 but\nfailed to detect the protein in the resistant isolates.\n\nTo investigate the cause of the porin deficiency observed in\nthe carbapenem-resistant isolates, we amplified the entire\n\nFIG. 2.

Multiple\noutbreaks of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae have indeed\nbeen reported over the past two decades, and certainly K.\npneumoniae has been the most frequently involved organism\n(33, 35, 36). Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first report of a large outbreak by CTX-M-1-producing\nEnterobacteriaceae and, curiously, the first documented de-\nscription in the literature of CTX-M-1 in K. pneumoniae, de-\nspite the fact that this enzyme has been found in multiple\nspecies, including E. coli, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, and C.\namalonaticus. A hospital outbreak due to a K. pneumoniae\nstrain producing an ESBL related to CTX-M-1 was described\nin Japan (23), but since the gene encoding the ESBL was not\nsequenced and CTX-M-1 has not been reported in the Far\nEast, it is more likely that the enzyme involved was actually one\nof its close relatives, either CTX-M-3 or CTX-M-15, both of\nwhich were already found in Japanese hospitals (3).\n\nCTX-M-2, CTX-M-3, CTX-M-14, and CTX-M.15 are the\nmost widespread CTX-M enzymes (3). As for Spanish hospi-\ntals, most CTX-M ESBLs found in a nationwide study were\n\nFIG. 3.

At this stage, the only\npublished documentation of CTX-M-1-producing Enterobacte-\nriaceae in Spain is the report of a single E. coli isolate detected\nin cattle milk (6).\n\nCarbapenems are frequently the only therapeutic options\navailable for treatment of hospital-acquired severe infections\ncaused by multiresistant ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae\nsuch as the strain described in this work. Nevertheless, univer-\nsal susceptibility to these last-line antimicrobials in Enterobac-\nteriaceae is no longer guaranteed. Indeed, several carbapen-\nemases have been described as occurring in Enterobacteriaceae,\nincluding representatives from classes A, such as the highly\ndisseminated KPC enzymes; B, such as IMP or VIM metallo-\n�-lactamases; or D, such as OXA-48 (29, 34, 39). Additionally,\ncarbapenem resistance development in strains producing\nESBLs or AmpC �-lactamases due to the selection of mutants\nwith reduced permeability to these antimicrobials is being in-\ncreasingly reported (4, 9). Previous work has shown that the\nexpression of both major K. pneumoniae porins, OmpK35 and\nOmpK36, plays a role in the susceptibility to carbapenem an-\ntibiotics and that mutants lacking expression of both outer\nmembrane proteins show reduced susceptibility to these anti-\nmicrobials, especially when combined with AmpC enzymes and\nsome class A ESBLs (11, 13, 19, 27). Nevertheless, in this work\nwe document and characterize for the first time the develop-\nment of in vivo resistance to carbapenems in CTX-M-1-pro-\nducing Enterobacteriaceae due to the selection of mutations\nleading to the lack of porin expression. As frequently occurs in\nclinical ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates (18), the epi-\ndemic strain described in this work did not express OmpK35,\nfavoring carbapenem resistance development through the in-\nactivation of OmpK36. Inactivation of OmpK36 in one of the\nstrains was demonstrated to be mediated by the interruption of\nthe coding sequence by an insertion sequence, as has been\npreviously reported for other clinical strains (17). As for the\nsecond carbapenem-resistant isolate, the failure of ompK36\namplification could suggest that the mechanism for inactiva-\ntion was either a deletion of part or the complete coding\nsequence or its interruption by an insertion sequence too large\nto be amplified by conventional PCR.\n\nOverall, CTX-M-1-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from 2\nof the 44 infected patients (4.5%) developed carbapenem re-\nsistance in clinical samples. Nevertheless, both patients had\nintestinal colonization by the carbapenem-resistant isolate\nwhen it was detected in the clinical samples, which could sug-\ngest that resistance development may have taken place in the\nintestines of the colonized patients. Since the development of\ncarbapenem resistance was not systematically explored in the\nintestinal colonization studies, we may indeed be underesti-\nmating the magnitude of the potential problem of carbapenem\nresistance development in colonized patients as a source of\ncarbapenem-resistant isolates.\n\nIn summary, we have described a large outbreak due to a\nmultiresistant CTX-M-1-producing and OmpK35-deficient K.\npneumoniae strain in an ICU and have characterized the mech-\nanisms leading to in vivo carbapenem resistance development\n\nthrough the inactivation of OmpK36 in two of the infected\npatients.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful to Enrique Ruiz de Gopegui for collecting the\ndata on the prevalence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae infec-\ntions in the ICU.\n\nThis work was partially supported by the “Red Española de Inves-\ntigación en Patologı́a Infecciosa” (C03-014) and grant PI040339 from\nthe Fondo de Investigaciones Sanitarias from the Ministerio de\nSanidad and grant SAF2005-01466 from the Ministerio de Educación\ny Ciencia of Spain.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
