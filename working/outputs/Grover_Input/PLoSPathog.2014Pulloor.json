However, the global regulation of RIG-I\nsignaling is only partially understood. Using a human genome-wide RNAi-screen, we identified 226 novel regulatory\nproteins of RIG-I mediated interferon-b production. Furthermore, the screen identified a metabolic pathway that synthesizes\nthe inositol pyrophosphate 1-IP7 as a previously unrecognized positive regulator of interferon production. Detailed genetic\nand biochemical experiments demonstrated that the kinase activities of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 (which convert IP5 to1-\nIP7) were critical for both interferon induction, and the control of cellular infection by Sendai and influenza A viruses.\nConversely, ectopically expressed inositol pyrophosphate-hydrolases DIPPs attenuated interferon transcription. Mechanistic\nexperiments in intact cells revealed that the expression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 was needed for the phosphorylation\nand activation of IRF3, a transcription factor for interferon. The addition of purified individual inositol pyrophosphates to a\ncell free reconstituted RIG-I signaling assay further identified 1-IP7 as an essential component required for IRF3 activation.\nThe inositol pyrophosphate may act by b-phosphoryl transfer, since its action was not recapitulated by a synthetic\nphosphonoacetate analogue of 1-IP7. This study thus identified several novel regulators of RIG-I, and a new role for inositol\npyrophosphates in augmenting innate immune responses to viral infection that may have therapeutic applications.\n\nCitation: Pulloor NK, Nair S, Kostic AD, Bist P, Weaver JD, et al.

The first step in the innate immune response\n\ninvolves recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by\n\nseveral host encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRR). A key\n\nmediator of antiviral immunity is the type-I interferon family of\n\ncytokines, which are transcribed upon detection of RNA viruses by\n\nthe pattern recognition receptors [1–3]. Cells have developed\n\nPRRs that are specialized for detecting pathogens in the cytosol,\n\nthe site where many RNA viruses replicate. One such PRR is the\n\nretinoic acid inducible gene - I (RIG-I) [1–3]. RIG-I recruits the\n\nadaptor protein MAVS to activate a signaling pathway that causes\n\nTBK1 to phosphorylate the latent transcription factor IRF3 [4–7].\n\nSignaling cascades triggered by multiple PRRs indeed converge to\n\nactivate IRF3. Once phosphorylated, IRF3 dimerizes and\n\ntranslocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the\n\ntranscriptional coactivators CBP/p300, which together stimulate\n\nthe expression of type-I interferon [1]. This initiates the antiviral\n\nimmune responses [8–10].\n\nAn optimal interferon response is essential to control viral\n\ninfections; however, excessive interferon exposure is detrimental to\n\nthe human body [11]. Significant research effort has been invested\n\nin determining the nature of the positive and negative signaling\n\npathways which regulate the responses that RIG-1 elicits following\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nviral infection [1,2,5,6,12–18]. Yet, there are significant gaps in\n\nour understanding of how an appropriate interferon response is\n\nregulated. For example, the regulation of the coupling of RIG-I\n\nstimulation to the activation of IRF3 is not completely understood.\n\nIn particular, it has not previously been well determined if any\n\ndiffusible second messenger molecules have signaling roles in this\n\npathway. In addition, a comparative understanding of the\n\nregulation of the unique RIG-I specific upstream and the\n\nconserved (across PRRs) downstream steps of interferon produc-\n\ntion is still lacking. In any case, the innate immune system is a\n\ncomplex, multifactorial network of interconnected pathways that\n\nexhibit combinatorial effects and emergent properties [19]; this is\n\nan entity that is much more than the sum of its individual\n\ncomponents. Systems-level analysis therefore offers the most\n\npromising approach to a comprehensive understanding of the\n\nregulation of innate immune pathways such as the interferon\n\nresponse; this information can also be exploited for the develop-\n\nment of novel therapeutic targets [20]. Some previous studies used\n\nproteomics and gene expression profiling approaches to under-\n\nstand the global regulation of innate immune response during\n\nseveral RNA viral infections [21,22]. However, a systematic\n\ninterrogation of the role of all of the annotated genes of human\n\ngenome in the RIG-I signaling and interferon production is yet to\n\nbe reported.\n\nIn this study, through a systems level approach using human\n\ngenome wide RNA-interference (RNAi) screen, bioinformatics\n\nanalysis and mechanistic validations, we generated an expanded\n\nunderstanding of the regulation of RIG-I mediated interferon\n\nresponse. We have identified 226 novel components of the RIG-1\n\npathway. In particular, the approach we took in the current study\n\nled us to identify that a class of kinases that synthesizes inositol\n\npyrophosphates are important positive regulators of the type-I\n\ninterferon response. The inositol pyrophosphates (also known as\n\ndiphosphoinositol polyphosphates) are a specialized subgroup of\n\nthe inositol phosphate signaling family that is distinguished by the\n\npresence of high-energy diphosphate groups [23–25]. The inositol\n\npyrophosphates are known to regulate DNA damage repair [26],\n\napoptosis [27,28], insulin exocytosis [29], and insulin signaling\n\n[30]. Although a role for inositol pyrophosphates in regulating\n\nneutrophil function has also recently emerged [31], it has not\n\npreviously been reported whether they play any role in antiviral\n\nimmunity. Now, we demonstrate for the first time that the\n\nsynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates is critical for type-I interferon\n\ntranscription and antiviral immunity.\n\nResults\n\nGenome-Wide Screening Identifies Regulators of\nRIG-I-Mediated IFNb Production\n\nTo discover novel genes regulating the RIG-I mediated\n\ninterferon response, we performed a human genome wide RNA-\n\ninterference (RNAi) screen. A quantitative fluorescence microsco-\n\npy based assay was adopted for the screen using human interferon-\n\nb (IFNb) promoter- driven green fluorescent protein reporter\n(IFNb-GFP) (Figure 1A). The assay used human embryonic kidney\n(HEK) 293 cell line, a widely used model system to dissect RIG-I\n\nsignaling [15,32,33]. As HEK293 cells do not have a robust TLR3\n\nexpression, the use of this cell line would minimize the effects from\n\nnon-RIG-I pathways [34]. As reported earlier [33], because\n\nHEK293 cells express only moderate levels of RIG-I, transfection\n\nof IFNb-GFP reporter along with the RIG-I ligand Polyinosinic:-\npolycytidylic acid (poly (I:C)) into these cells leads to only a modest\n\nincrease in the GFP signal (Figure S1A). However, transfection of\n\nRIG-I expression plasmid into these cells leads to a very robust\n\nactivation of GFP signal, both with and without poly (I:C)\n\nstimulation (Figure S1A). In control experiments, silencing of RIG-\n\nI, MAVS and IRF3, drastically reduced the RIG-I transfection\n\nmediated IFNb-GFP signal, but there was no effect upon silencing\neither TRIF (TLR3 adaptor) or MDA5 (another cytosolic PRR of\n\nviruses) (Figure S1B). These experiments prove that the observed\n\nreporter activity was originating specifically through RIG-I.\n\nFor the RNAi screen, we selected a condition where, 24 hr after\n\nthe transfection of a RIG-I expression plasmid (with poly (I:C)\n\nstimulation), IFNb-GFP transcription was observed in approxi-\nmately 25% of the cells. In comparison, only 1–2% of the total\n\ncells were GFP-positive after silencing of the positive control genes\n\nMAVS and IRF3, representing a 26.5- and 14.3-fold decrease in\n\nIFNb-GFP reporter activity respectively (Figure S1B). High\ncontent microscopy based imaging was used to detect and quantify\n\nthe degree of activation of the IFNb reporter. For every image, we\ncalculated the GFP intensity per cell (defined as a DAPI stained\n\nnucleus), after setting an intensity threshold to identify the GFP\n\nexpressing cells. The final readout of the assay was the percent of\n\nGFP-positive cells per well.\n\nThe screen was conducted in two stages (Figure 1A). The\n\nprimary screen involved silencing 18,120 human genes using a\n\npool of four unique siRNAs (from Dharmacon) targeting each\n\ngene. Later, the ‘‘hit genes’’ from the primary screen were further\n\nvalidated for on-target specificity by testing each of the four\n\nindividual siRNAs of the pool separately, and only those for which\n\nat least two independent siRNAs impacted on reporter signal were\n\nselected. A Z-score of (2/+) 2.5 was taken as cut-off for putative\npositive or negative regulators, respectively. The analytic param-\n\neters for the siRNA screen including the signal intensity and\n\nZ-score distributions are given in the Figures S2A–D. We re-\n\nidentified several previously known regulators of RIG-I pathway\n\nsuch as RIG-I, IRF3, TRIM21, PRKR and MAVS as hits,\n\nvalidating the ability of the screen to discover proteins that\n\nregulate the interferon response [35,36]. More importantly, the\n\nRNAi screen led to the identification of a total of 226 additional\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nThe innate immune system is critical for viral infection\ncontrol by host organisms. The type I interferons are a\nfamily of major antiviral cytokines produced upon the\nactivation of innate immune pattern recognition receptors\n(PRRs) by viruses. The RIG-I is a major PRR that uniquely\ndetects RNA viruses within the cytoplasm. In this study, we\naimed to discover cellular genes and pathways that play\nregulatory roles in the transcriptional induction of type I\ninterferon-b (IFNb). Using a human genome wide RNA\ninterference (RNAi) screening, we identified 226 genes\nwhose expression is important for proper IFNb production.\nThrough bioinformatics-based mining of the RNAi screen\nresults, we identified that the cellular pathway synthesiz-\ning inositol pyrophosphates, a class of inositol phosphates\nwith high-energy diphosphates, is a key positive regulator\nof RIG-I mediated IFNb production. The kinases IPPK,\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2, that synthesize inositol pyrophos-\nphate 1-IP7, regulated IFNb response in a catalytically\ndependent manner. Mechanistic studies identified that 1-\nIP7 synthesis pathway was needed for efficient phosphor-\nylation of IRF3. The DIPP family of inositol pyrophosphate\nhydrolases negatively regulated the IFNb response, upon\nectopic expression. In summary, this study generated a\nglobal view of the regulation of RIG-I signaling, and\nidentified inositol pyrophosphates as important regulators\nof antiviral response.\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nnovel regulators of RIG-I mediated IFNb response (Table S1). Out\nof these, 220 and 6 genes respectively were positive and negative\n\nregulators of RIG-I signaling.\n\nWe subsequently performed detailed bioinformatics analysis to\n\nmine the information contained within the RNAi screen results. A\n\nmeta-analysis using the Gene Expression Omnibus database\n\nrevealed that 33 of the identified RNAi hits were previously\n\nobserved as host genes upregulated upon exposure to various RNA\n\nviruses, interferon or poly (I:C) [21,37–40] (Table S1). Network\n\nanalysis of the obtained hit genes revealed that several proteins\n\npreviously implicated to interact with components of interferon\n\nresponse, but not determined yet to serve a regulatory role in\n\ninterferon response, (e.g, ADAP2 [41]) are indeed needed for\n\noptimal interferon induction (Figure 1B). In addition, genes\n\nserving different functions such as those regulating nuclear\n\ntransport (RAN, XPO1), ubiquitin like proteins (UBQLN2, UBL5)\n\nand transcription (e.g., DLX3) were also among the identified hits\n\n(Table S1). Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified several\n\nstatistically significant cellular functional categories of genes\n\nregulating interferon production (Figure 1C). Most of the top-\n\nranked GO categories identified were those related to antiviral\n\ninnate immune signaling. Remarkably, gene ontology analysis also\n\nidentified the pathway involving biosynthesis of inositol pyrophos-\n\nphates as a novel cellular process associated with interferon\n\nresponse regulation (Figure 1C). Overall, our functional genomics\n\ninterrogation revealed that genes and pathways from diverse\n\nfunctional categories are regulators of RIG-I mediated interferon\n\nproduction.\n\nRIG-I Regulators Act at Multiple Steps of the PRR\nSignaling Cascade\n\nIn order to begin to generate a global mechanistic understand-\n\ning of the newly discovered regulators of IFNb response, we\nattempted to place these genes in the known framework of RIG-I\n\nsignaling. It is known that ectopic expression of MAVS, TBK1\n\nand a constitutively active mutant of IRF3 (termed IRF3-5D) can\n\nstimulate IFNb transcription, independent of RIG-I [9,17,42]. By\ncoupling the ectopic expression of these genes with individual\n\nsilencing of the newly identified regulators, we generated a detailed\n\nmap of the functional localization of their action within the RIG-I\n\nFigure 1.

The results of the ‘‘stage determination assays’’ are\n\nshown in Figure 1A (displayed inside the brown box) and Table\n\nS1. Among the 226 hit genes, the greatest number (55%) was\n\nidentified to serve a regulatory role upstream of MAVS. Among\n\nthe rest, 5.5%, 11.3% and 25% of the total hit genes were found to\n\nfunction between MAVS and TBK1, between TBK1 and IRF3,\n\nand downstream of IRF3, respectively. In summary, this forward\n\ngenetics study revealed a global picture of the stage wise\n\ndistribution of 226 novel regulators of RIG-I signaling cascade.\n\nThe Inositol Pyrophosphate Biosynthesis Pathway Is\nEssential for RIG-I Dependent Interferon Production\n\nBioinformatics analysis of the RNAi screening results identified\n\nthe kinase PPIP5K2 as a positive regulator of RIG-1 signaling\n\n(Figure 1A, and 1B). PPIP5K2 is one of the enzymes that directly\n\nsynthesizes inositol pyrophosphates (Figure 1D). In relation to this,\n\nIPPK is another kinase that was also identified in the screen as a\n\npositive regulator of RIG-1 signaling; IPPK synthesizes IP6, which\n\nserves as the common precursor material for inositol pyrophos-\n\nphate synthesis. The key steps and enzymes involved in inositol\n\npyrophosphate biosynthesis are shown in Figure 1D. The best\n\nstudied inositol pyrophosphates in mammals are the two IP7\n\nisomers (1-IP7 and 5-IP7) and IP8 [43]. These are synthesized by\n\ntwo classes of enzymes, the IP6Ks and the PPIP5Ks [44–49].\n\nThe inositol pyrophosphate pathway has not previously been\n\nimplicated as participating in antiviral responses, so we set out to\n\nfurther characterize its role in innate immunity. We first validated\n\nthat the siRNAs against IPPK efficiently knocked down gene\n\nexpression (Figure 2A). Moreover, Following stimulation of these\n\ncells by transfection with RIG-I ligand poly (I:C), the knock-down\n\nof IPPK expression was confirmed to cause a major reduction of\n\nIFNb-promoter driven luciferase activity (Figure 2A). We also used\nq-RTPCR based quantification of IFNb transcripts to verify the\nrole of IPPK in influencing IFNb transcript synthesis (Figure 2B).\nFinally, transfection of siRNA resistant IPPK cDNA expressing\n\nplasmid into endogenous IPPK silenced cells using 39-UTR\n\ntargeting siRNA led to the recovery of the IFNb response to a level\ncomparable to that in normal cells, indicating the on-target\n\nspecificity of gene silencing (Fig. S3A).\n\nThe silencing of IPPK will not only reduce the formation of IP6\n\nbut also the synthesis of the inositol pyrophosphates 1-IP7, 5-IP7\n\nand IP8 (Figure 1D). The kinases PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 catalyze\n\nthe synthesis of 1-IP7 and IP8, but not 5-IP7 (Figure 1D). Indeed,\n\nthe RNAi screen also identified PPIP5K2, but not PPIP5K1, as a\n\nRIG-1 regulator (see above). So we next investigated if the inositol\n\npyrophosphates play roles in innate immunity. Silencing of the\n\nPPIP5K2 gene strongly reduced RIG-I driven IFNb transcription\nand IFNb promoter driven luciferase activity (Figure 2B,C). We\nalso retested PPIP5K1 since it was possible that the latter was\n\nmissed in the primary screen. Notably, PPIP5K1 gene silencing\n\nalso reduced the IFNb reporter activity. Gene silencing was\nverified by both Western blot (Figure 2C) and q-RTPCR (Figure\n\nS3B). The q-RTPCR based quantification also showed a notable\n\ndecrease in the IFNb transcript production in PPIP5K2 silenced\ncells (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure S3A, ectopic expression of\n\nsiRNA resistant PPIP5K2 rescued the loss of IFNb response\ncaused by ablation of endogenous PPIP5K2 using 39-UTR\n\ntargeting siRNA, confirming the on-target specificity of the\n\nknockdown. The knockdown of IPPK and PPIP5Ks did not\n\nsignificantly affect basal-level IFNb or IFNa production when\nHEK293 cells were not stimulated by either RIG-I ectopic\n\nexpression or transfection with poly (I:C) or infection with virus\n\n(Figure S3C, S3D). Using JAK1 silenced cells, it was further\n\ndetermined that the observed effects of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 silencing on interferon response are independent of the\n\nautocrine amplification of the pathway (Figure S3E).\n\nWe next investigated the possible roles of the IP6Ks (IP6K1,\n\nIP6K2 and IP6K3) which participate in the synthesis of 5-IP7 and\n\nIP8, but not 1-IP7 Figure 1D). Although none of these genes were\n\nidentified from our genome-wide RNAi screen, we re-investigated\n\ntheir role in RIG-I signaling with validation of gene silencing. It\n\nwas observed that both individual and simultaneous silencing of\n\nIP6K1, IP6K2 and IP6K3 genes did not affect the interferon\n\ntranscription (Figure 2D). Furthermore, consistent with the gene\n\nknockdown data, fibroblasts from IP6K1 gene deficient mouse did\n\nnot show any defect in the IFNb response (Figure S3F) [50]. The\nfact that the IFNb response is inhibited by knock-down of PPIP5Ks\nbut not IP6Ks (Figure 2) suggests that 1-IP7, but not 5-IP7\n\n(Figure 1D), has functional significance in the innate immune\n\nresponse. Complete loss of expression of murine IP6K1 (or the\n\nKcs1 homologue in yeast) was previously shown to adversely affect\n\nthe functioning of mitochondria, and alters ATP levels [51].\n\nHowever, no significant general cytotoxicity, mitochondrial\n\ntoxicity or change in the levels of cellular ATP was found in cells\n\ntransiently silenced for IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 (Figure\n\nS4A).\n\nThe experiments described above used poly (I:C) in order to\n\nmimic a cellular viral infection. It is therefore significant that we\n\nalso found silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 dampened\n\nIFNb transcription during infection of HEK293 cells by Sendai\nvirus (SeV), a known stimulator of RIG-I [52] (Figure 2E). To\n\nfurther validate the physiological relevance of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 in IFNb production, we also silenced the expression of\nthese kinases in human primary monocyte derived macrophages,\n\nand then challenged them with Sendai virus. We found a\n\nsignificant decrease in IFNb transcription in these RNAi-targeted\nhuman primary macrophages (Figure 2F). No notable difference in\n\nSeV induced IFNb response was observed when IP6K1-3 genes\nwere silenced (not shown). These experiments further indicate that\n\nthe expression of the kinases involved in the synthesis of 1-IP7 is\n\nimportant for an effective interferon response.\n\nThe Inositol Pyrophosphate Synthesis Pathway\nSpecifically Regulates the Interferon Axis from Multiple\nPRRs\n\nIn addition to the transcriptional induction of IFNb, signaling\nfrom several of the PRRs that sense RNA viruses also result in the\n\nproduction of another class of type-I interferons, the IFNa, as well\nas activation of the transcription factor NFkB [5]. Therefore it was\nimportant to determine whether inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-\n\npathway kinases are also required for the IFNa and NFkB response\nfrom RIG-I. We observed that silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 in HEK293 cells led to a reduction in RIG-I mediated\n\ntranscription of IFNa, determined using a luciferase reporter\ndriven by the IFNa4 promoter (Figure 2G). However, inositol\npyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases were not required for\n\nRIG-I triggered NFkB activation (Figure 2H). This data indicated\nthat these kinases regulate a step of RIG-I signaling that happens\n\nafter the bifurcation of interferon and NFkB branches.\nIn addition to RIG-I, there are several other PRRs such as\n\nTLR3 (an endosomal PRR) and MDA5 (another cytosolic PRR),\n\nwhich also induce IFNb transcription [1]. Therefore we investi-\ngated the specificity of the inositol pyrophosphates-synthesis-\n\npathway kinases with regards to signaling by other PRRs. We\n\nfound that repression of the expression of either IPPK, PPIP5K1\n\nor PPIP5K2 attenuated the IFNb response elicited by both TLR3\nand MDA5, to a level comparable to that observed in the case of\n\nRIG-I (Figure 2I). These results demonstrated that inositol\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

Indeed, the\n\nIFNb induction arising from ectopic expression of MAVS and\nTBK1, two key downstream components of RIG-I pathway, was\n\ndiminished when IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 were silenced\n\n(Figure 3A). These data further indicate that the inositol\n\npyrophosphates most likely regulate a step at the level or\n\nimmediately downstream of TBK1. Because activation of IRF3\n\nhappens immediately downstream of TBK1, we next investigated\n\nthe effect of interference with inositol pyrophosphate synthesis\n\npathway gene expression on IRF3 functioning. The IRF3 exists as\n\na monomer in its unstimulated state in the cytosol. When PRRs\n\nare stimulated, the phosphorylation of monomeric IRF3 leads to\n\nits homo-dimerization, followed by nuclear migration. We first\n\ninvestigated whether inositol pyrophosphate synthesis was needed\n\nfor the nuclear translocation of activated endogenous IRF3. In\n\ncontrol experiments, the negative control siRNA treated HEK293\n\ncells were stimulated with poly (I:C), which led to a prominent\n\nnuclear accumulation of phosphorylated IRF3 (pIRF3; Figure 3B).\n\nIn additional control experiments, silencing of MAVS, the key\n\nadaptor of RIG-I, reduced the nuclear levels of pIRF3 (Figure 3B).\n\nNotably, there was also a major reduction in the intra-nuclear\n\nlevels of endogenous pIRF3 following silencing of IPPK, PPIP5K1\n\nand PPIP5K2 (Figure 3B, 3C).\n\nNext, we investigated whether the depletion of IPPK, PPIP5K1\n\nand PPIP5K2 altered endogenous IRF3 dimerization. The\n\nknockdown of all three of these genes strongly reduced the degree\n\nof IRF3 dimerization that was induced by poly (I:C)(Figure 3D,E),\n\ncompared to that observed in negative control siRNA treated cells.\n\nThe levels of GAPDH and Tubulin proteins were unaffected by\n\nthe knockdown of these kinases, indicating there was not a global\n\nperturbation of protein expression (Figures 3B, 3F).\n\nWe finally determined whether poly (I:C) induced phosphory-\n\nlation of endogenous IRF3 was affected by silencing of inositol\n\npyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases. Notably, it was found\n\nthat knock-down of the expression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and\n\nPPIP5K2 caused a reduction in the phosphorylation of endoge-\n\nnous IRF3 (Figure 3F, 3G). In summary, the experiments\n\ndescribed above argue that the expression of inositol pyrophos-\n\nphate-synthesis pathway kinases is required for the TBK1-IRF3\n\naxis to function; the absence of inositol pyrophosphate synthesis\n\ncompromised IRF3 phosphorylation and dimer formation.\n\nInositol Pyrophosphate Synthesis Pathway Regulates\nInterferon Response in a Catalytically Dependent Manner\n\nHaving established the involvement of the inositol pyrophos-\n\nphate-synthesis-pathway as a regulator of antiviral response, we\n\nfurther sought to identify the mechanism by which this pathway\n\nmodulates interferon signaling. We first investigated whether\n\nenhancing the cellular expression of these kinases has any effect on\n\nthe interferon response. Indeed it was determined that the ectopic\n\nexpression of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 induced a significant\n\ndose dependent enhancement of RIG-I driven IFNb promoter\nreporter activity, in both the cells that were either stimulated or\n\nunstimulated with poly (I:C) (Figure 4A). However, the enhancing\n\neffect of ectopic expression of these genes on the IFNb reporter\nactivity in cells pre-transfected with RIG-I and poly (I:C) was\n\ngreater than that in the unstimulated cells (Figure 4A). Both\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 ectopic expression caused a greater\n\nenhancement of the IFNb response than did by IPPK. Even\nthough silencing of IP6Ks did not affect IFNb response, we also\ninvestigated whether the ectopic expression of IP6K1-3 has any\n\neffect on IFNb response. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of\nIP6K1, IP6K2 and IP6K3 also enhanced the IFNb response\nsignificantly, although to a lesser degree than that promoted by\n\noverexpression of either PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 (Figure 4B). These\n\ndata revealed that the interferon response could be augmented by\n\nover-expression of any of the tested kinases in the inositol\n\npyrophosphate synthesis pathway.\n\nIn order to determine whether the kinase activity of these\n\nproteins is important for the interferon transcription, we next\n\ntransfected cells with catalytically-inactive mutants. These mutant\n\nproteins were found to express at levels comparable to the\n\ncorresponding wild type kinases. Remarkably, the kinase deficient\n\nmutants of IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 all exhibited a\n\ndecreased ability to facilitate the interferon response upon over\n\nexpression, when compared with the corresponding wild type\n\nproteins (Figure 4C). In addition, we noted an earlier report that\n\nthe kinase domain of PPIP5K1 (PPIP5K1-KD) and PPIP5K2\n\n(PPIP5K2-KD) was able to catalyze the formation of 1-IP7, with\n\ngreater efficiency than the full-length protein [47]. As shown in\n\nFigure 4D, indeed we found that over expression of both\n\nPPIP5K1-KD and PPIP5K2-KD enhanced the IFNb reporter\nactivity to an extent greater than that induced by full length\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2. We also found that inactivation of the\n\ncatalytic activity of IP6K1 significantly diminished its ability to\n\nenhance IFNb response upon ectopic expression (Figure 4C).\nHowever, consistent with the gene knockdown data showing no\n\nrole for endogenous IP6Ks in RIG-I signaling, HEK293 cells\n\ntreated with IP6K kinase inhibitor TNP (N2-[m-Trifluorobenzyl],\n\nN6-[p-nitrobenzyl] purine) did not show any defect in IFNb\nresponse (Figure S3G) [53]. These experiments demonstrated that\n\nthe inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway kinases regulated\n\nIFNb transcription through their catalytic activities. That is, one or\nmore of the soluble inositol pyrophosphates products are required\n\nfor IFNb production.\nThe ability of ectopically expressed PPIP5K1/2 to stimulate\n\ninterferon transcription (Figure 4A) could result from increased\n\nsynthesis of either 1-IP7 and/or IP8 (Figure 1D). For IP8 to be\n\ninvolved, IP6K activity would also be required. However, the\n\nstimulatory effects of over-expressed PPIP5K1/2 were not affected\n\nby either individual or simultaneous silencing of IP6K1-3\n\n(Figure 3E). Moreover, in control experiments, silencing of IPPK\n\nnearly completely abolished the ability of ectopically expressed\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 to enhance interferon transcription\n\n(Figure 4F). That result is consistent with the requirement for\n\nIP6 as the precursor molecule for phosphorylation by PPIP5K1/2\n\nto synthesize 1-IP7 (Figure 1D). It was also observed that the\n\ndiminished interferon response caused by PPIP5K1 silencing\n\ncould be compensated by over expressed PPIP5K2, or vice versa\n\n(Figure 4G). These data indicate that 1-IP7 mediates the interferon\n\ntranscriptional effects of the PPIP5K1/2.\n\nNevertheless, even though the aforementioned experiments\n\nidentify 1-IP7 as being more important for enhancing interferon\n\ntranscription than IP8, the ectopic expression of IP6K1, IP6K2\n\nand IP6K3 also enhanced the IFNb response significantly\n(Figure 4B). These results raise the possibility that, at elevated\n\nIP6K1-3 expression levels, IP8 (and/or possibly even 5-IP7) might\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 6 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nFigure 3.

However,\nenhanced IFNb reporter activity induced by ectopic expression of\nIP6K1-3 was mostly lost in the absence of expression of PPIP5K1\n\nand PPIP5K2 (Figure 4H). Thus, it is more likely that, at high\n\nlevels of expression of IP6K1-3, it is IP8 rather than 5-IP7 that\n\nsubstitutes for the actions of 1-IP7. In this respect, it is notable that\n\none of the diphosphate groups on IP8 is also attached to the 1-\n\nposition.\n\nTo further establish the role of inositol pyrophosphates in the\n\nimmune response, we also studied a class of enzymes that\n\ndephosphorylates inositol pyrophosphates. In humans, the hydro-\n\nlysis of short-lived inositol pyrophosphates has been attributed to\n\nthree classes of diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate phosphohydro-\n\nlase proteins (DIPPs) encoded by four genes belonging to the\n\nNudix hydrolase family [44,54,55]. These hydrolases remove the\n\nterminal phosphate from inositol pyrophosphates. If inositol\n\npyrophosphates regulate RIG-I signaling, then removal of their\n\ndiphosphate would inhibit the interferon response. To test this\n\nprediction, we determined the effect of over expression of DIPP1,\n\nDIPP2a and DIPP3a on RIG-I induced IFNb promoter driven\nreporter activity. In agreement with our hypothesis, cells\n\nectopically expressing either DIPP1, DIPP2a or DIPP3a indeed\nshowed a significantly attenuated interferon response (Figure 4I;\n\nthe rank order of efficacy of the DIPPs followed their reported\n\nrank order of catalytic activity (DIPP1.DIPP3a.DIPP2a [54].\nThese data also further argued that the synthesis of inositol\n\npyrophosphates is critical for the induction of IFNb. In summary,\nthe experiments described in this section argue that inositol\n\npyrophosphates –particularly 1-IP7 - are important for the\n\ninterferon response.\n\n1-IP7 Directly Mediates IRF3 Activation\nThe data described above, obtained from experiments using\n\ngene silencing and catalytically inactive mutants of IPPK,\n\nPPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2, provided strong yet indirect evidence\n\nfor the involvement of inositol pyrophosphates themselves in the\n\ninterferon response. To further test this hypothesis, we employed a\n\ncell-free, virus-dependent assay for IRF3 activation. This was\n\ndeveloped in an earlier study which reported that a purified\n\nmitochondrial fraction from Sendai virus infected cells could\n\ninduce IRF3 phosphorylation in a cytoplasmic fraction prepared\n\nfrom uninfected cells [56]. We reproduced these results (Figure 5A)\n\nusing similar subcellular fractions (Figure S4B). It was significant\n\nthat the degree of IRF3 phosphorylation was strongly reduced\n\nwhen the cytoplasmic fraction was prepared from PPIP5K2-\n\nsilenced cells (Figure 5A). Next, we reasoned that if inositol\n\npyrophosphates were directly involved in IRF3 phosphorylation,\n\ntheir addition to the in vitro assay system would rescue the loss of\n\nIRF3 activation caused by the silencing of PPIP5K2. For these\n\nexperiments we added samples of either 1-IP7, 5-IP7 or IP8 that\n\nwere prepared enzymatically and purified electrophoretically [57],\n\nto the cell free IRF3 phosphorylation assays. Remarkably, 5 min\n\nafter the addition of 1-IP7 in the range of its projected\n\nphysiological concentration (0.5 uM [54]) the loss of IRF3\n\nphosphorylation that resulted from PPIP5K2 silencing was rescued\n\nto a level that was equivalent to that in wild type cells (Figure 5B).\n\nAt this time point, IP8 had no significant effect (Figure 5C).,\n\nHowever, IP8 was found to substitute for 1-IP7 in promoting IRF3\n\nphosphorylation, at the 10 min time point (Figure 5C,E). The\n\neffect of 1-IP7 on IRF3 phosphorylation is consistent with the\n\nconclusions drawn from the above described kinase silencing and\n\nectopic expression experiments. Next, we tested 5-IP7 which from\n\ngenetic experiments (see above) was predicted not to regulate the\n\ninterferon response. Indeed, we found that 5-IP7 did not promote\n\nIRF3 phosphorylation (Figure 5D). The observation that IP8 acted\n\nless efficiently than 1-IP7 in supporting IRF3 phosphorylation in\n\nvitro, is consistent with that activity in intact cells only emerging in\n\nan over-expression paradigm (Figure 4). In the latter case, IRF3\n\nphosphorylation was stimulated upon ectopic expression of IP6Ks\n\nin a manner that was also dependent upon endogenous PPIP5Ks\n\n(Figure 4H), and hence the synthesis of IP8 (Figure 1D). In\n\nconclusion, these cell free system based experiments considerably\n\nstrengthened our hypothesis (see above) that among the inositol\n\npyrophosphates, it is 1-IP7 that is the more physiologically-\n\nrelevant mediator of IRF3 phosphorylation and activation.\n\nEarlier studies had indicated that one mechanism by which the\n\ninositol pyrophosphates regulates signaling pathways involves the\n\ntransfer of the b-phosphoryl of their diphosphate group to\nphosphorylated serine residues on target proteins (termed protein\n\npyrophosphorylation) [58,59]. We therefore investigated whether\n\nthe mechanism of action of inositol pyrophosphates in the\n\ninterferon response could be dependent on the transfer of their b-\nphosphate. For these experiments we used synthetic analogues of\n\n1-IP7 and IP8, in which the diphosphate was replaced with a\n\nphosphonoacetic acid (PA) ester [60]. Although the PA ester\n\nresembles a diphosphate group in several respects, its terminal\n\nphosphonate group (equivalent to the b-phosphate of a diphos-\nphate) cannot be transferred, due to the stability of the P-C bond\n\nit contains. Interestingly, we found that addition of the PA\n\nanalogues of 1-IP7 and IP8 failed to recapitulate the actions of\n\nthe natural 1-IP7 and IP8 molecules (Figure 5F, 5G). These data\n\nare consistent with potential phosphoryl transfer underlying the\n\nmechanism of action of inositol pyrophosphates in regulating\n\ninterferon signaling.\n\nInositol Pyrophosphates Synthesis Pathway is Required\nfor Cellular Antiviral Resistance\n\nWe also investigated whether inositol pyrophosphate-synthesis-\n\npathway kinases contribute to the immune resistance of human\n\ncells to viral infection. For this, we used Sendai virus to infect\n\nHEK293 cells in which either IPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 was\n\nknocked-down. In each case, the kinase knock-down led to an\n\nincreased viral load, as determined by q-RTPCR (Figure 6A).\n\nFurthermore, we also found that HEK293 cells were more\n\nresistant to infection with influenza A virus upon over expression\n\nof either IPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 (Figures 6B and 6C).\n\nInterestingly, ectopic expression of IP6K1 also enhanced the\n\ncellular immunity to influenza A virus infection, in agreement with\n\ntheir ability to increase the interferon response upon ectopic\n\nPPIP5K2 on p(I:C) induced phosphorylation of IRF3, shown by Western blot and densitometry, respectively. A representative Western blot for each\nexperiment is shown. The IFNb-luciferase values were normalized with Renilla luciferase reporter values, and expressed as fold change from\nuninduced NT-si samples. Densitometry values represent measured intensities of the indicated bands from three different Western blots, shown as\nmean 6 SD. The significance of densitometry data was calculated by comparing the values obtained from gene silenced conditions with that of\nstimulated NT-si controls. For panel A, the significance was determined by comparing the values of IFNb-luciferase activity obtained upon over\nexpression of RIG-I/MAVS/TBK1 in IPPK, PPIP5K1 and PPIP5K2 gene silenced samples with that of corresponding NT-si samples.

As shown in Figure 6D, knock-down of either\n\nIPPK, PPIP5K1 or PPIP5K2 attenuated the induction of ISG15.\n\nThis was specifically due to a defect in interferon production or\n\nindirect induction of ISG15 by IRF3, because the inositol\n\npyrophosphate-synthesis-pathway did not show any role in\n\nexogenous IFNb induced, JAK/STAT signaling mediated ISRE\nactivation (not shown).

A particularly significant finding of\nthis genomic study was the identification of the pathway\n\nsynthesizing inositol pyrophosphate 1-IP7 as being essential for\n\nthe interferon response. Moreover, this is the first time that a\n\nspecific function for 1-IP7 has been identified in mammalian cells,\n\nthereby opening up a new area of research in the inositol\n\npyrophosphate field.\n\nThe importance of a genome-wide, systems-biology approach to\n\nunderstanding the innate immune response was outlined in the\n\nIntroduction. Among these newly identified genes, several may be\n\n‘‘pan-regulators’’ of interferon induction. Indeed, our secondary\n\nassays revealed that 36.3% of the identified genes act downstream\n\nof TBK1, a common component of several antiviral PRR\n\npathways. It is interesting to note that more than half (60.5%) of\n\nthe hit genes regulated a segment of the signaling chain that is\n\nlikely unique to RIG-I pathway (upstream of TBK1), and not\n\ncommon with other interferon inducing PRR pathways. This\n\nindicates that the regulation of the proximal steps of PRR signaling\n\nleading to interferon induction is more complex than the\n\ncommonly shared steps. Given their distinct compartmentalized\n\ncellular localizations, it is not surprising that the PRRs undergo\n\nmore intricate regulation at their proximal signaling steps, than the\n\ndownstream conserved steps.\n\nThe meta-analysis demonstrated that at least 33 of the obtained\n\nhit genes were previously reported to show transcriptional up-\n\nregulation during challenge with various immune stimuli that\n\nactivates interferon response. However the functional relevance of\n\nthe differential expression of these 33 genes during interferon\n\nresponse was not known previously. Our identification of these\n\ngenes as important regulators of the interferon response demon-\n\nstrates that the current systems biology based approach to study\n\nRIG-I signaling also helps to functionally interpret genomics\n\nstudies of host responses to infection. We further anticipate that\n\nour data-set will facilitate future studies in this field. Given that\n\nPRRs also recognize damage-associated molecular patterns\n\nproduced by endogenous stress signals [61], it is intriguing that\n\ninositol pyrophosphates have also been implicated in mediating\n\nresponses to a variety of stress responses, including osmotic stress,\n\nthermal challenges and metabolic stress [43]. Our study opens up\n\npossible new directions for identifying the mechanisms of action of\n\ninositol pyrophosphates in combating these stresses.\n\nOur study characterized an essential regulatory role for inositol\n\npyrophosphates in the interferon production. Although an earlier\n\nstudy had identified PPIP5K2 as an interferon inducible gene [39],\n\ninositol pyrophosphates themselves have not been shown before to\n\nplay any direct role in antiviral innate immune response.\n\nStructural analysis of PPIP5K2 [62] has revealed that it has an\n\nexquisitely specific active site that can only phosphorylate IP6 and\n\n5-IP7, to yield 1-IP7 and IP8 respectively. The in vitro reconstituted\n\nRIG-I signaling assay using purified inositol pyrophosphates\n\nidentified that both 1-IP7 and IP8 are capable of regulating the\n\ninterferon response. However, based on the comparative analysis\n\nof the results of experiments involving silencing of the key enzymes\n\nin this pathway along with effects of over-expression of wild-type\n\nkinases, we propose that 1-IP7 would most likely be the\n\nphysiologically-relevant regulator of IFNb transcription (among\ninositol pyrophosphates).\n\nThe results of the virus-dependent cell free reconstitution\n\nassays (Figure 5) provided additional direct evidence that 1-IP7 is\n\nneeded for the functioning of TBK1-IRF3 axis leading to the\n\nphosphorylation of IRF3, a precondition for its competence to\n\nstimulate IFNb transcription. Currently it is proposed that\ninositol pyrophosphates may regulate cellular pathways either\n\nby b-phosphoryl transfer to host proteins (protein pyropho-\nsphorylation), or as cofactors that may bind to target proteins\n\n[43,58,59,63–65]. We found that synthetic, metabolically stable\n\nanalogues of 1-IP7 and IP8 failed to recapitulate the effects of the\n\nphysiological isomers (Figure 5), consistent with a mechanism of\n\naction involving phosphoryl transfer. Nevertheless, given that in\n\nearlier studies [59] all of the inositol pyrophosphates were equally\n\ncompetent at b-phosphoryl transfer to proteins, it is intriguing\nthat 5-IP7 did not support IRF3 phosphorylation, suggesting that\n\nthe potential target protein may also exhibit stereo-selective\n\nbars) or without (black bars) p(I:C)stimulation.

In summary, this study provided\n\nvaluable insights into the global regulation of interferon response,\n\nand identified a novel role for inositol pyrophosphates in antiviral\n\nimmunity.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nRNA Interference Screen and Bioinformatics Analysis\nThe RNAi screening employed a siRNA library from\n\nDharmacon/ThermoFischer scientific (human whole genome\n\nsiGENOME siRNA Library, Cat#GU-005005-02) targeting\n18,164 annotated human genes was used the RNAi screening.\n\nThe screen was performed in 384 well imaging compatible plates\n\n(Corning cat#3712). Briefly, 2500 HEK293 cells (in 20 ml of\nDMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum) were seeded in each well\n\nhaving 50 nM siRNA complexed with 0.05 ml lipid Dharmafect1\n(in 20 ml of serum free DMEM) (ThermoFischer scientific). At\n46 hr, 40 ng RIG-I and 50 ng human IFNb-GFP reporter\nplasmids (in 5 ml of serum free DMEM) were transfected with\nFugene (Roche). At 52 hr, 2 ml of a 10 mg/ml stock of poly (I:C)\ncomplexed with the lipid Fugene (Roche) in serum free DMEM\n\nwas added to each well. At 72 hr, the cells were fixed with 3%\n\nparaformaldehyde, followed by washing with phosphate buffered\n\nsaline and nuclear staining with DAPI. Using high content\n\nfluorescence microscopy (ImageXpress Micro, Molecular Devices\n\nCorporation), images of each well was captured at 46 magnifi-\ncation. The number of cells, and number of GFP positive cells\n\nwere determined by algorithm-driven data analysis using the\n\nMetaXpress software (Version 3, Molecular Devices Corporation).\n\nAny gene silencing that reduced cell number by greater than\n\napproximately 50% was eliminated for potential toxicity. siRNAs\n\ntargeting IRF3 and MAVS were used as positive controls, and a\n\nnon-targeting (NT) siRNA served as the negative control.\n\nThe bioinformatics analysis of the siRNA screen was facilitated\n\nby the RNAither package of Bioconductor in R [67]. The screen\n\nwas performed in duplicate. The mean percent GFP-positive cells\n\nwas calculated for each gene (the screen was performed in\n\nduplicate), and then a Z-score normalization was performed by\n\nsubtracting the median of the plate and dividing by the median\n\nabsolute deviation per plate.\n\nGene ontology enrichment analysis and network analysis was\n\nconducted on the 226 novel regulators that were identified in the\n\nsecondary siRNA screen using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)\n\nsoftware.\n\nGene Expression Meta-Analysis\nGene expression datasets were accessed from the NCBI Gene\n\nExpression Omnibus in series matrix file format from five previous\n\nstudies [21,37–40]. Raw expression values were log2-transformed.\n\nTwo-group comparisons were made between sample sets using\n\nStudent’s t-test followed by the false-discovery rate (FDR) method\n\nto correct for multiple hypothesis testing, setting the cut-off at\n\nFDR,0.05. Significantly differentially expressed genes from each\n\nstudy were then queried against the list of 226 genes identified\n\nfrom the RNAi screen.\n\nReporter Assays\nThe reporter assays were performed as previously reported\n\n[9,42]. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression\n\nplasmids of human PRRs (RIG-I or TLR3 or MDA5), human\n\nIFNa4 promoter, or human IFNb promoter or NFkB-target\npromoter driven luciferase reporters (pGL2 vector, Promega) and\n\na constitutively transcribed Renilla luciferase reporter (p-RL-TK,\n\nPromega) for 24 hr. Cells were then either directly assayed for\n\nluciferase activity, or were stimulated with poly (I:C) by either\n\ntransfecting (500 ng/ml for RIG-I assay) or by adding to the\n\nmedium (20 mg/ml for TLR3) for additional 18 hr, and luciferase\nreading was performed using Dual-Glo assay kit (Promega). For\n\nectopic expression assays, HEK293 cells grown overnight were\n\ntransfected with the indicated plasmids for 24 hr with or without\n\nRIG-I and poly (I:C), and luciferase assays were performed.\n\nValues were normalized to that of Renilla luciferase internal\n\ncontrol.\n\nViral Infection and Viral Load Determination\nHEK293 cells or primary macrophages were infected with\n\nSendai virus (Cantell strain, Charles River Laboratories) at 30–80\n\nHA units for 18 hr, and processed for q-RTPCR. A genetically\n\nmodified Influenza A virus (IAV) (A/Puerto Rico/8/34) with\n\ngreen fluorescent protein insertion was propagated in MDCK cells\n\nand used for the studies [68]. The HEK293 cells were infected\n\nwith IAV at an MOI of 2 for 12 hr, fixed and microscopy was\n\nperformed.\n\nIRF3 Phosphorylation, Dimerization and Nuclear\nMigration Assays\n\nThe IRF3 activity was determined using previously reported\n\nprotocols [42,69,70]. Detection of IRF3 phosphorylation: Over-\n\nnight grown 56105 HEK293 cells in 6-well plates were transfected\nwith 500 ng of RIG-I for 24 hr, and stimulated with 4 mg of poly\n(I:C) for 4 hr. The clarified cell lysate in RIPA buffer (50 mM\n\nTrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 0.1%\n\nSDS, protease and phosphatase inhibitors) (pooled from three wells,\n\nfor each condition) were separated by Sodium dodecyl sulphate\n\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and probed with\n\nanti-pIRF3 (Serine 396) and anti-IRF3 antibodies. For the detection\n\nof IRF3 dimers, after 4 hr stimulation, the cells were lysed in mild\n\ncold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA\n\nand 1% NP-40), and the protein was separated on native acrylamide\n\ngel, with 1% sodium deoxycholate in the cathode buffer. The IRF3\n\ndimer was visualized by Western blot. For the detection of IRF3\n\nnuclear migration by Western blot, after 4 hr stimulation, nuclei\n\nwere isolated using Nuclear extraction Kit (Activemotif), and\n\ncytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE\n\nand detected by Western blot. For the Western blot, the proteins\n\nwere transferred on to nitrocellulose membranes using Transblot\n\n(Biorad), and detected by immuno-detection with appropriate\n\nprimary antibodies. The transferred proteins of interest were\n\nvisualized using Licor infrared imaging system, with IRDye\n\n800CW and 680RD as secondary antibodies (Licor).\n\nIn Vitro Reconstituted IRF3 Phosphorylation Assay\nThis assay was performed as reported earlier [56]. Briefly,\n\ncytoplasm from uninfected cells was incubated with isolated\n\nmitochondrial fraction from Sendai virus infected cells at 30uC,\nand pIRF3/IRF3 were detected by Western blot (visualized using\n\nHRP conjugated secondary antibody) at different time points. The\n\nassay buffer was 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 2 mM ATP,\n\n5 mM MgCl2, and 0.25 M D-mannitol.\n\nSynthesis and Purification of 1-IP7, 5-IP7 and IP8\nThe methodology was reported previously [57]. The inositol\n\npyrophosphates were prepared enzymatically, using 1.2 mM\n\nInsP6 as starting substrate. The synthesis of 1-InsP7, 5-InsP7\n\nand InsP8 were carried out by incubating (at 37uC) IP6 with\nrespectively 0.12 mg/ml PPIP5K2KD for 22.5 h, 0.17 mg/ml\n\nIP6K1 for 3 h or 0.17 mg/ml IP6K1 and 0.11 mg/ml\n\nInterferon Response and Inositol Pyrophosphates\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 February 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 2 | e1003981\n\n\n\nPPIP5K2KD together for 3 h. The reaction buffer composition\n\nwas 20 mM Hepes, pH 6.8, 50 mM NaCl, 6 mM MgSO4, 1 mM\n\nDTT, 6 mM phosphocreatine, 24 unit/ml creatine kinase and\n\n5 mM ATP disodium salt. The reactions were quenched and\n\nneutralized with, respectively, 0.2 volumes 2 M HClO4 and 0.34\n\nvolumes 1 M K2CO3, 40 mM EDTA or placed at 100uC for 3–\n5 min. The synthesized inositol pyrophosphates were purified\n\nusing a previously reporter polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-\n\nbased method that was modified for scale up [71]. The inositol\n\npyrophosphates were detected by staining with Toluidine Blue\n\n[71], and quantified through mass assay of the released\n\northophosphate upon complete hydrolysis by wet-ashing at\n\n120uC for 48 h [72]. The phosphonoacetic acid (PA) analogues\nof 1-IP7 and IP8 were chemically synthesized using a similar\n\nstrategy to that previously reported for 5-IP7 [60].
