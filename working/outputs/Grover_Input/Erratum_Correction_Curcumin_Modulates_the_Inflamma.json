London,\n\nLucille London*\n\nDepartment of Oral Biology and Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nAcute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a clinical syndrome characterized by diffuse alveolar damage usually\nsecondary to an intense host inflammatory response of the lung to a pulmonary or extrapulmonary infectious or non-\ninfectious insult often leading to the development of intra-alveolar and interstitial fibrosis. Curcumin, the principal\ncurcumoid of the popular Indian spice turmeric, has been demonstrated as an anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agent in a\nbroad spectrum of diseases. Using our well-established model of reovirus 1/L-induced acute viral pneumonia, which\ndisplays many of the characteristics of the human ALI/ARDS, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects of\ncurcumin. Female CBA/J mice were treated with curcumin (50 mg/kg) 5 days prior to intranasal inoculation with 10\n\n7\nPFU\n\nreovirus 1/L and daily, thereafter. Mice were evaluated for key features associated with ALI/ARDS. Administration of\ncurcumin significantly modulated inflammation and fibrosis, as revealed by histological and biochemical analysis. The\nexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, and MCP-1, key chemokines/cytokines implicated in the development of ALI/ARDS, from both\nthe inflammatory infiltrate and whole lung tissue were modulated by curcumin potentially through a reduction in the\nphosphorylated form of NFkB p65. While the expression of TGFß1 was not modulated by curcumin, TGFß Receptor II, which\nis required for TGFß signaling, was significantly reduced. In addition, curcumin also significantly inhibited the expression of\na-smooth muscle actin and Tenascin-C, key markers of myofibroblast activation. This data strongly supports a role for\ncurcumin in modulating the pathogenesis of viral-induced ALI/ARDS in a pre-clinical model potentially manifested through\nthe alteration of inflammation and myofibroblast differentiation.\n\nCitation: Avasarala S, Zhang F, Liu G, Wang R, London SD, et al.

Pulmonary\n\nfibrosis, itself, is a devastating disease with an almost universally\n\nterminal outcome affecting five million people worldwide,\n\nincluding some 200,000 cases culminating in 40,000 deaths/year\n\nin the US [3]. Factors that predispose to ARDS are diverse and\n\ninclude sepsis, aspiration, and pneumonias [1,2]. Although\n\nsupportive therapy has improved survival somewhat, there are\n\nno effective therapeutic agents for improving clinical outcomes in\n\nARDS patients [1,2]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the\n\ndevelopment of treatments to halt the progression of this\n\ndevastating syndrome.\n\nThere are limited models to study ALI/ARDS and no good\n\nmodel systems currently available to study ALI/ARDS and/or\n\npulmonary fibrosis initiated by an infectious (viral) insult [4].\n\nPulmonary infection of CBA/J mice with 10\n7\n\nPFU reovirus\n\nserotype 1, strain Lang (reovirus 1/L) induces ALI/ARDS,\n\nproviding a model that recapitulates both its acute exudative\n\nphase, including the formation of hyaline membranes, as well as its\n\nregenerative phase with healing by repair, leading to intra-alveolar\n\nand interstitial fibrosis [5,6]. As with ARDS in human patients,\n\ncorticosteroids were ineffective in attenuating the infiltration of\n\ninflammatory leukocytes, suppressing key cytokine/chemokine\n\nexpression, and inhibiting the development of fibrotic lesions in\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS [7,8]. Finally, aberrant apoptosis has\n\nbeen proposed as one mechanism leading to fibrotic lesion\n\ndevelopment in ALI/ARDS, and we have demonstrated an\n\nindirect role for the Fas/FasL pathway in reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS [9]. Therefore, our model provides a very clinically\n\nrelevant model for infection-induced acute viral pneumonia\n\nleading to ALI/ARDS.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57285\n\n\n\nCurcumin, a natural phytochemical present in turmeric, the\n\nground powder of the rhizomes of Curcuma longa, has been\n\ndescribed as having anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-\n\ncarcinogenic properties and has been used to treat cancer,\n\narthritis, digestive and liver abnormalities, and respiratory\n\ninfections [10–16]. Toxicity studies conducted on animals have\n\nindicated no adverse effects with prolonged use [14,17–19]. While\n\ncurcumin’s effects have been studied in many diseases, the full\n\npotential benefits of curcumin and its mechanisms of action have\n\njust begun to be elucidated for the treatment of pulmonary\n\ndiseases including fibrosis and ALI/ARDS [20–28]. Pretreatment\n\nwith curcumin showed beneficial effects on ALI induced by oleic\n\nacid [29], by paraquat toxicity [26], by sepsis-induced ALI [30–\n\n34] and by aspiration-induced ALI [35]. Although the precise\n\nmechanism by which curcumin mediated it’s beneficial effects in\n\nthese model systems is not clear, it has been suggested that the\n\nmodulation of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory\n\nfactors may be involved in curcumin’s effects [14,17–19]. In this\n\nstudy, curcumin treatment in vivo effected both inflammatory\n\n(diffuse alveolar damage, DAD) and fibrotic lesion development\n\nleading to a significant reduction in the development of ALI/\n\nARDS in reovirus 1/L-infected mice in this pre-clinical model,\n\nwhich may be manifested, at least in part, through the modulation\n\nof cytokine/chemokine expression through NFkB and through\nmodulation of myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis through\n\nthe regulation of TGFß receptor II (RII).\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals\nFour to five week-old female CBA/J mice were obtained from\n\nJackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and maintained in\n\nmicro-isolator cages under specific pathogen free conditions in a\n\nBL-2 facility. Cages were housed in a HEPA-filtered animal\n\nisolator clean room (Nuaire Inc., Plymouth, MN, USA) and all\n\nanimal manipulations were performed in class II biological safety\n\ncabinets. Virally primed mice were kept physically isolated from all\n\nother experimental and stock mice.\n\nEthics Statement\nThis study was carried out in strict accordance with the\n\nrecommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of\n\nLaboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The\n\nprotocol was approved by the Stony Brook University Institutional\n\nAnimal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (Protocol # 235392-\n5).\n\nVirus\nReovirus 1/L was originally obtained from Dr. W. Joklik (Duke\n\nUniversity School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA). Third-\n\npassage gradient-purified stocks were obtained by re-cloning and\n\namplifying parental stocks on L-929 fibroblast cells (American\n\nType Culture Collection, Rockville, MD, USA) [5,6]. Following\n\nthe purification of new stocks, infectious viral titers were obtained\n\nby limiting dilution on L-929 monolayers [5,6].\n\nInoculation Protocol\nAnimals were lightly anesthetized with an i.p. injection of 100 ml\n\nof 18% Ketamine (Vetalar 100 mg/ml; Fort Dodge Laboratories,\n\nInc., Fort Dodge, IA, USA) and 10% Xylazine (Xylazine HCl\n\n20 mg/ml; Phoenix Scientific, Inc., St. Joseph, MO, USA) in\n\nsterile injectable grade 0.9% NaCl (Baxter Healthcare Corp.,\n\nDeerfield, IL, USA) prior to immunization. Animals were\n\ninoculated by the intranasal (i.n.) application of 10\n7\n\nPFU of reovirus\n\n1/L in 30 ml (15 ml in each nostril) in 0.9% NaCl. Control animals\nwere inoculated with 30 ml (15 ml in each nostril) 0.9% NaCl. Mice\nwere treated with curcumin ($94% curcuminoid content) (Sigma-\n\nAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) at a concentration of 50 mg/kg in\n\n2% carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) in a total volume of 100 ml\ndelivered by an i.p. injection 5 days prior to infection and daily,\n\nthereafter. A curcumin dosage of 50 mg/kg was chosen after a\n\nseries of initial experiments analyzing histologically the inflamma-\n\ntory infiltrate and fibrotic lesions using curcumin concentrations\n\nranging from 50 mg/kg to 200 mg/kg (data not shown). As\n\ncontrols, either saline or reovirus 1/L-infected mice received a\n\ndaily i.p. injection of 2% CMC (vehicle). Saline mice treated with\n\n2% CMC (vehicle) did not develop any significant pathology (not\n\nshown). Likewises, reovirus 1/L-infected mice treated with 2%\n\nCMC (vehicle) did not show any significant improvement in lung\n\npathology (not shown). Since our initial finding indicated that\n\nvehicle treatment alone does not modulate key features of reovirus\n\n1/L-ALI/ARDS (inflammation and fibrosis), we compared\n\nuntreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS to curcumin-treated reovirus\n\n1/L-ALI/ARDS to minimize stressing the animals unnecessarily.\n\nAfter the indicated time points, animals were sacrificed via carbon\n\ndioxide inhalation (Euthanex\nTM\n\nCO2 system).\n\nTitration of infectious virions\nFreshly harvested lungs (without the associated lymph nodes)\n\nwere flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280uC until use.\nFrozen lungs were freeze-thawed three times in 1 ml MEM\n\ncontaining 10% FBS followed by homogenization for 1.5 minutes\n\nwith a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK). Lung\n\nsupernatants were then subjected to centrifugation at 2000 g for\n\n10 minutes at 4uC. Serial dilutions of tissue homogenates (100 ml)\nin gel-saline were used in a standard plaque assay to determine\n\nreovirus 1/L PFU/ml on L-929 cell monolayers as previously\n\ndescribed [36].\n\nHistology\nLungs were inflated in situ with 2% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-\n\nAldrich) by intra-tracheal intubation, removed, and suspended in\n\nan additional 2% paraformaldehyde for 2 hours at 4uC before\nbeing embedded in paraffin. Histological staining was performed\n\non 4-micron sections by McClain Laboratories (Smithtown, NY,\n\nUSA). Mason’s Trichrome and Sirius red staining were used to\n\nvisualize collagen deposition. With Mason’s Trichrome, the nuclei\n\nstain a dark red/purple, muscle stains red, and connective tissue\n\nincluding collagen stains blue. With Sirius red, in bright-field\n\nmicroscopy, collagen is red on a yellowish background. Nuclei, if\n\nstained, are black but may often be grey or brown. To score lung\n\ninflammation and fibrosis, lung samples were screened for the\n\nfollowing three histopathological parameters: (a) deposition of\n\nextracellular matrix; (b) leukocyte infiltration (interstitial inflam-\n\nmation); and (c) airway obliteration due to granulation tissue\n\nformation and/or fibrosis. Each slide was blindly evaluated using\n\nlow (4X and 10X) and high (20X and 40X) magnification and\n\nscored on a scale of 0–3 with 0 as absent (normal); 1 as mild; 2 as\n\nmoderate; and 3 as severe [5,6]. The final histology score was\n\nbased on evaluation of whole lung sections (one section per mouse)\n\nand values reported are an average of 18 (reovirus 1/L–ALI/\n\nARDS d9 and d14), 12 (curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS d9) and 28 (reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS d14) individual\n\nassessments. Images from low (20X) and high (40X) magnification\n\non an Olympus BX40 microscope (Olympus, Melville, NY, USA)\n\nwere captured with a Polaroid digital microscope camera and\n\nedited using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 software.\n\nCurcumin Inhibits Reovirus 1/L-ARDS Development\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57285\n\n\n\nSircol Assay for Collagen Content\nSoluble lung collagen was measured in lung homogenates using\n\nthe Sircol Assay (Biocolor Ltd, UK), following manufacturer’s\n\ninstructions. Briefly, the right lobe of the lung was suspended at\n\n30 mg/tissue/ml in 0.5 M acetic acid and homogenized for 3 min\n\nwith a Mini-Beadbeater (Biospec Products, Bartlesville, OK,\n\nUSA). Cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation and 100 ml\nof the supernatant was mixed with the Sircol dye and centrifuged.\n\nThe pellets were dissolved with alkaline reagent, as directed.\n\nAbsorbance was read at 540 nm. Total soluble collagen was\n\ndetermined using a standard curve. The Sircol Assay is suitable for\n\nmonitoring collagen produced in situ where collagen that is soluble\n\nin cold acid/pepsin can be recovered and measured from\n\nmammalian soft tissues, cartilages and fluids.\n\nFlow Cytometric Analysis\nLungs were harvested and digested with 5 ml 1 mg/ml\n\ncollagenase H (Roche, Nutley, NJ, USA) at 37uC for single cell\nisolation. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 5%\n\nFCS and 0.05% azide, and resuspended at 10\n6\n\ncells/ml. Cells were\n\nstained for surface markers as described previously [5,6]. The\n\nfollowing antibodies (Abs) were purchased from BD Biosciences\n\n(San Jose, CA, USA) and used in this analysis: CD4 (GK1.5,\n\nL3T4; R-PE-labeled); CD8a (53–6.7, PerCP-labeled); CD11b/\n\nMac-1 (M1/70, integrinam chain, Mac-1 a chain, APC-labeled);\nCD19 (1D3, FITC-labeled); Ly6G (RB6-8C5, Gr-1, PerCP-\n\nCy5.5-labeled); and R-PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse Pan-NK\n\ncells (DX5). Isotype matched controls were run for each sample\n\n(not shown). Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a dual-\n\nlaser Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Accuri, Ann Arbor, MI, USA)\n\nand data was analyzed using FlowJo Analysis Software (Tree Star\n\nInc., Ashland, OR, USA).\n\nImmunofluorescence (IF)\nImmunostaining of paraformaldehyde-fixed and paraffin em-\n\nbedded lung sections was performed by IF procedures. Five to\n\neight-micron sequential sections were collected on poly-L-lysine\n\ntreated slides (Sigma-Aldrich), deparaffinized in xylene and\n\ndehydrated in graded alcohol. Tissue sections were then heat\n\ntreated for 10 minutes with a Target Retrieval Solution (Dako\n\nCorp. S1700; Carpinteria, CA, USA) following manufacture’s\n\ninstructions. Tissue sections were permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-\n\n100 in PBS for 45 minutes at room temperature, followed by\n\nincubation in 10% BSA for 1 hr. The sections were then\n\nincubated overnight at 4uC with a rat anti-tenascin-C (TN-C)\nAb (1:200, Sigma-Aldrich), a mouse anti-a-smooth muscle actin\n(a-SMA) Ab (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich), or a goat anti-E-cadherin Ab\n(1:200, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). After three\n\nwashes in PBS, slides were incubated with the corresponding\n\nsecondary Abs conjugated with photostable Alexa FluorH dye\n(1:1000, Life Technologies Corporation, Grand Island, NY, USA)\n\nfor 1 hr at room temperature. Slides were treated with Vectashield\n\nanti-fade mounting medium with DAPI to stain nuclei (Vector\n\nLaboratories) and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S\n\nmicroscopy system. For control incubations, primary Abs was\n\nreplaced by normal mouse, goat, or rat serum (Vector Labora-\n\ntories).\n\nSerum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine\naminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP)\nactivities\n\nSerum was collected by cardiac puncture at the time of\n\neuthanasia and was stored at 280uC until use. Serum AST, ALT\n\nand AP activities were measured enzymatically using standardized\n\nenzyme assays kits obtained from Stanbio Laboratory (Boerne,\n\nTX, USA).\n\nRNA Preparation and Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nLung tissue was homogenized in the presence of TRI ReagentH\n\nSolution and total RNA was isolated according to the manufac-\n\nturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies,\n\nCarlsbad, CA, USA). qRT-PCR was carried out in 20 ml total\nvolume containing 100 ng of RNA and 200 nM of each primer\n\nusing a Power SYBRH Green RNA-to-CT\nTM\n\n1-Step Kit (Applied\n\nBiosystems). After reverse transcription for 30 min at 48uC and a\nstarting denaturation for 10 minutes at 95uC, 40 PCR cycles (15 s\n95uC and 1 min 60uC) were performed using the ABI StepOne\nPlus\n\nTM\nReal-Time PCR SystemH (Applied Biosystems). Oligonu-\n\ncleotide primers used in qRT-PCR are listed in Table 1. Each\n\nsample was evaluated in triplicate. Specificity of PCR products was\n\nevaluated at the end of each run by melt curve analysis. A non-\n\ntemplate control and an endogenous control (GAPDH) were used\n\nfor relative quantification. All quantitations (threshold cycle [CT]\n\nvalues) were normalized to that of GAPDH to generate DCT, and\nthe difference between the DCT value of the sample and that of\nthe reference (saline (control)) was calculated as DDCT. The\nrelative level of gene expression was expressed as 2\n\n2DDCT\n[R].\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nFor western blotting, lungs were removed and homogenized in\n\n1.5 ml Tissue PE LB\nTM\n\ntissue protein extraction lysis buffer\n\ncontaining a cocktail of protease inhibitors (N-Ethylmaleimide\n\n[10 mM], benzamidine [5 mM], leupeptin [50 mg/ml], pepstatin\nA [5 mg/ml], PMSF [2 mM]) using a Mini-Beadbeater (Geno\nTechnology, St. Louis, MO, USA). Total protein was determined\n\nusing a modified Bradford protein assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Twenty\n\nmicrograms of total protein were mixed with 4X sample buffer\n\ncontaining 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, resolved by SDS-PAGE\n\n(Ready Gels Tris HCl 10%; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and\n\ntransferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were then blocked\n\nfor 2 hours in 5% non-fat milk in TBST, and incubated overnight\n\nat 4uC with either a rat anti-TN-C (Sigma-Aldrich), a mouse\nmonoclonal anti-a-SMA (Sigma-Aldrich), a polyclonal goat anti-\nE-cadherin (R&D Systems), a rabbit anti-phosph-p65-NFkB, a\nrabbit anti-phosph-p38 or a rabbit anti-ß actin (Cell Signaling\n\nTechnology, Danvers, MA, USA) Ab. The membranes were then\n\nwashed 3X and incubated with the appropriate secondary Abs\n\nconjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Thermo-Scientific) for one\n\nand a half hours at room temperature. Western analysis using an\n\nanti-ß actin Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was performed to\n\ndemonstrate equal loading. Immunostained bands were visualized\n\nwith SuperSignalH West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit\n(Thermo-Scientific) followed by exposure to HyBlot CL\n\nTM\n\nAutoradiography Film (Denville Scientific Inc, Metuchen, NJ,\n\nUSA). Band intensities on scanned gels were analyzed using the\n\npublic domain National Institutes of Health ImageJ program.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analyses were performed by using an ANOVA with\n\ntreatment and time of study included as factors. When appropri-\n\nate, comparisons between two variables were performed using a\n\nStudent’s t test. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant.\n\nCurcumin Inhibits Reovirus 1/L-ARDS Development\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e57285\n\n\n\nResults\n\nAdministration of Curcumin protects CBA/J mice from\nthe Development of ALI/ARDS in Response to reovirus 1/\nL\n\nIn order to determine the efficacy of treatment with curcumin\n\non the development of either ARDS associated DAD or fibrosis,\n\nCBA/J mice were inoculated i.n. with 10\n7\n\nPFU reovirus 1/L and\n\nwere either untreated or treated with 50 mg/kg curcumin by i.p.\n\ninjection 5 days prior to infection and daily, thereafter. We first\n\nevaluated whether daily curcumin treatment of mice in vivo\n\naffected the ability of reovirus 1/L to infect or replicate in reovirus\n\n1/L-inoculated mice (Fig. 1). We demonstrate on day 9 post-\n\nreovirus 1/L-inoculation that both the number of reovirus 1/L\n\ninfectious virions (Fig. 1A) as well as the ability of reovirus 1/L to\n\nreplicate in vivo (Fig. 1B) are not affected by curcumin treatment.\n\nThus, we demonstrate that the mechanism of action of curcumin\n\nin this model is not due to affects on replication or clearance of\n\nreovirus 1/L from infected lungs. To determine the extent of\n\ninflammation and fibrosis, paraffin-embedded lung sections were\n\nstained with H&E, Sirius Red, or Masson’s Trichrome (Fig. 2).\n\nInflammation (as evidenced by DAD) was evaluated on day 9 and\n\nfibrosis was evaluated on day 14. All untreated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS mice developed a viral pneumonia including symptoms\n\nand histological features of ARDS, as previously described [5,6].\n\nSpecifically, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice developed a signifi-\n\ncant diffuse cellular infiltrate leading to DAD and severe\n\npneumonia (Fig. 2A; day 9, grade: 2.3 +/20.46). Accompanying\nthis DAD are edema, capillary dilation and hemorrhage, and the\n\nformation of hyaline membranes (not shown). Those mice that\n\nsurvive the acute phase of the disease develop interstitial fibrosis\n\nand intra-alveolar fibrosis (Fig. 2A; day 14, grade: 2.1 +/20.50).\nIn contrast, curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice\n\ndeveloped significantly less of a cellular infiltrate with a patchy\n\ndistribution and formation of condensed focal lymphocytic\n\naccumulations (Fig. 2A; day 9, grade: 1.31 +/20.44; p,0.05\nversus reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS). In addition, the intra-alveolar\n\nand interstitial fibrosis associated with the late phase of reovirus 1/\n\nL-ALI/ARDS was also significantly inhibited by treatment with\n\ncurcumin (Fig. 2A; day 14, grade: 1.31 +/20.49; p,0.05 versus\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS). To more clearly demonstrate the\n\npresence of fibrotic lesions histologically, tissue sections were\n\nstained with Mason’s Trichrome or Sirius red on day 14 post-\n\ninfection (Fig. 2B). In normal or saline (control) lung sections,\n\nSirius red or Mason’s Trichrome staining for collagen is evident\n\nonly within the walls of the bronchioles and arterioles, which\n\ncontain connective tissue including collagen, while the lung\n\nalveolar airspaces are not stained (Fig. 2B). As can be observed,\n\nsignificant staining for collagen via either Mason’s Trichrome\n\n(blue) or Sirius red (bright red) is evident in reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS mice, which is dramatically reduced in curcumin-treated\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 2B).\n\nTo support the histological evaluation of fibrosis, the Sircol\nTM\n\nCollagen Assay demonstrated significant collagen accumulation in\n\nthe lungs at day 14-post infection in untreated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS mice as compared to saline (control) lungs (approximately a\n\n2-fold increase) (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the amount of collagen\n\naccumulation in the lungs of curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS mice is significantly reduced versus the reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS mice, even though they still accumulate more collagen than\n\nsaline (control) mice (Fig. 3A). As an additional measure of\n\ncollagen accumulation, mRNA for pro-collagen I was measured\n\non day 14 post-infection (Fig. 3B). Reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice\n\nexpressed a significantly higher level of pro-collagen I mRNA as\n\ncompared to saline (control) mice, which was significantly reduced\n\nin curcumin-treated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 3B).\n\nTo provide further evidence for the anti-fibrogenic action of\n\ncurcumin in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, we analyzed pulmonary\n\nexpression of TN-C, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is\n\nhighly expressed in adult lung parenchyma following acute lung\n\ninjury [37–40] and pulmonary levels of a-SMA and E-cadherin,\ntwo well-established markers of epithelial to mesenchymal\n\ntransition (Fig. 4). As evaluated by western, TN-C is minimally\n\nexpressed in adult saline (control) lung tissue (Fig. 4A). In\n\nuntreated, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS lung tissue, the 190-kDa\n\nisoform of TN-C is highly expressed on day 14 post-infection.\n\nHowever, in the presence of curcumin, induction of TN-C is\n\nsignificantly reduced on day 14 post-reovirus 1/L inoculation\n\n(Fig. 4A). Western analysis data for TN-C expression was\n\nconfirmed by mRNA expression via qRT-PCR (Fig. 4B). By IF,\n\nTN-C expression is minimal in saline (control) lung (Fig. 4C).\n\nHowever, TN-C is highly induced in untreated, reovirus 1/L-\n\nTable 1.

In curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS mice, the presence of TN-C was significantly reduced\n\n(Fig. 4C). Similarly by IF, expression of a-SMA was negligible in\nsaline (control) mice being observed only within the walls of the\n\nbronchioles and vasculature (Fig. 4C, red). However, a marked\n\ninduction of a-SMA expression was observed in reovirus 1/L-\nALI/ARDS, in agreement with the increased deposition of fibrotic\n\ntissue (Fig. 4C, red). In contrast, curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-\n\nALI/ARDS mice demonstrated a marked reduction in a-SMA\nexpression (Fig. 4C). The expression of a-SMA was confirmed by\nprotein expression via western analysis and by mRNA expression\n\nvia qRT-PCR (Fig. 4A and B). In saline (control) lungs, E-cadherin\n\nis clearly expressed by the alveolar epithelial cells (Fig. 4C, green).\n\nHowever, during post injury, lung remodeling is associated with\n\nincreased E-cadherin expression, which occurs simultaneously\n\nwith the peak of cellular proliferation and repair and E-cadherin\n\nexpression is reduced in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS (Fig. 4C, green).

In saline or saline + curcumin-treated\n(control) mice, approximately 0.77+/20.206106 cells were\nrecovered from the interstitial spaces with macrophages and\n\nPMNs being the predominate cells present (Table 2; not shown). A\n\nsignificant increase in the total number of inflammatory cells was\n\nrecovered from either untreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS or\n\ncurcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice on days 5, 9, or\n\n14 as compared to saline or saline + curcumin-treated (control)\nmice (Table 2). Further, the number of recovered cells on days 5\n\nand 14 from curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice was\n\nsignificantly less than the number recovered from untreated\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS (Table 2). In regards to phenotype, a\n\nsignificant decrease in the number of PMNs (GR1\n+\n) and CD4\n\n+\n\ncells on day 5 and CD19\n+\n\nB cells on day 9 was observed in\n\ncurcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice versus untreated\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 6A and B). On day 14, as\n\ncompared to reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, a significant decrease in\n\nPMNs, NK cells, CD8+ T cells and CD19+ B cells was observed in\ncurcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 6C).\n\nTo determine whether the cytokine/chemokine expression\n\nprofile of the infiltrating cells from reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice\n\nwas modulated during curcumin treatment, RNA from infiltrating\n\ncells on days 5, 9, and 14 was evaluated for expression of key\n\ncytokines/chemokines including IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, G/M-CSF,\nand MCP-1 via qRT-PCR (Fig. 7). Interestingly, an early\n\nsignificant increase in the expression of IL-6, G/M-CSF and\n\nMCP-1 was observed on day 5 in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-\n\nALI/ARDS as compared to untreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS\n\nmice or saline (control) mice (Fig. 7A). However, by day 9 post-\n\ninoculation, the expression of IL-6, G/M-CSF and MCP-1 was\n\nsignificantly higher in both untreated versus curcumin treated\n\nreovirus 1/l-ALI/ARDS mice as compared to saline (control) mice\n\n(Fig. 7A). In addition, on day 9 the expression of IFNc, was\nsignificantly increased in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/\n\nARDS mice as compared to untreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS\n\nmice and saline (control) mice (Fig. 7A). By day 14 in either\n\nuntreated or curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, the\n\nexpression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, GM-CSF and MCP-1 were\nsimilar to that of saline (control) mice (Fig. 7A). In addition,\n\ncytokine/chemokine mRNA expression from whole lung tissue\n\n(including the infiltrating cells) was also evaluated on days 9 and 14\n\npost-inoculation by qRT-PCR. Expression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc,\nand MCP-1 was significantly increased over saline (control) in both\n\nuntreated and curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS on day\n\n9 post-inoculation (Fig. 7B). However, at day 14 post-inoculation,\n\nthe expression of IL-6, IL-10, IFNc, and MCP-1 in reovirus 1/L-\nALI/ARDS mice was still significantly increased over saline\n\n(control) mice, which was significantly inhibited in curcumin-\n\ntreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice (Fig. 7B).\n\nCurcumin differentially modulates the TGFß1 NFkB, and\nthe p38 signaling pathways\n\nThree key pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ALI/\n\nARDS, TGFß1, NFkB, and p38 were investigated in reovirus 1/\nL-ALI/ARDS. RNA from whole lung tissue on days 9 and 14 post\n\ninoculation was evaluated for expression of TGFß1 and TGFß RII\n\nby RT-PCR or qRT-PCR (Fig. 8) and protein extracts from whole\n\nlung tissue were evaluated for expression of the phosphorylated\n\nform of the p65 subunit of NFkB or the phosphorylated form of\np38, an additional key molecule in the TGFß signaling pathway\n\n(Fig. 9). While the expression of TGFß1 was not modulated by\n\ncurcumin on either day 9 or day 14 in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS\n\n(Fig. 8A and B), TGFß RII, which is required for TGFß signaling,\n\nwas significantly reduced on day 9 in the presence of curcumin\n\n(Fig. 8B).

Treatment of reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS\nwith curcumin resulted in a significant increase in P-p38 evident\n\non day 9 post-inoculation as compared to untreated reovirus1/L-\n\nALI/ARDS (Fig. 9A and B). However, treatment of reovirus 1/L-\n\nALI/ARDS with curcumin resulted in a significant reduction of P-\n\np65 NFkB as compared to untreated reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS\n(Fig. 9A and B).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study was conducted in a mouse model of infection\n\n(reovirus 1/L)-induced acute viral pneumonia, which leads to ARDS,\n\nthe most severe form of ALI. Reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice\n\ndemonstrated severely damaged lungs as evidenced by DAD\n\nfollowed by infiltration of the interstitium and alveolar spaces with\n\nfibroblasts with excessive collagen deposition [5–8]. However, in\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS undergoing treatment with curcumin in\n\na pre-clinical model, these inflammatory and fibrotic changes were\n\nsignificantly reduced. Key markers of fibrosis including expression\n\nof a-SMA, TN-C and E-cadherin were modified by curcumin.\nCurcumin also modulated the expression of key chemokines/\n\ncytokines implicated in the development of ALI/ARDS including\n\nIL-6, IL-10, IFNc, and MCP-1 from both the inflammatory\ninfiltrate and from whole lung tissue potentially through the\n\nmodulation of NFkB. While the expression of TGFß1 was not\nmodulated by curcumin, TGFß RII, which is required for TGFß\n\nsignaling, was significantly reduced. In reovirus 1//L-ALI/ARDS,\n\nwe also observed dramatic increases in systemic levels of liver\n\nenzymes including AST, ALT, and AP especially on day 14 when\n\nsignificant fibrotic lesions are observed. This is similar to many\n\npatients with ARDS who die not from hypoxemia but from\n\nmultiple organ failure [41,42]. However, curcumin-treated reovi-\n\nrus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice demonstrated a significant decrease is\n\nall three systemic indicators suggesting that curcumin prevents not\n\nonly the inflammatory reaction but also the later systemic\n\nreactions due to continued lung fibrosis and hypoxemia. We also\n\ndemonstrate in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS an increase in expression\n\nof ãSMA and TN-C especially visible in areas of lung injury in\n\nagreement with the increased deposition of fibrotic tissue. In\n\ncontrast, reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice treated with curcumin\n\ndemonstrated a marked reduction in a-SMA and TN-C. These\ndata confirm that curcumin induces anti-fibrogenic actions, related\n\nat least in part to a lower accumulation of myofibroblasts during\n\nthe course of the fibrogenic process. Our results also suggest that\n\nthe curcumin further manifests its effects through the induction of\n\nthe p38 MAPK, a subfamily of serine-threonine protein kinases,\n\nhaving pro-apoptotic effects in response to extracellular stimuli\n\n[43]. Since the effects of curcumin are likely pleotropic and\n\ncomplex, determining the downstream effectors of curcumin will\n\nbe crucial in analyzing the full potential value of curcumin as a\n\npotential therapeutic.\n\nIn this report, we demonstrate a differential effect of curcumin\n\non the inflammatory infiltrate versus whole lung tissue, which\n\nwould include an inflammatory response associated with resident\n\nepithelial, endothelial and/or fibroblast cells. We demonstrate\n\nfrom the inflammatory infiltrate an early (day 5) and significant\n\nrise in IL-6, G/M-CSF, and MCP-1 in curcumin-treated reovirus\n\n1/L-ALI/ARDS which is not mirrored by untreated reovirus 1/L-\n\nALI/ARDS until day 9.

These results suggest a consistent and\nprolonged inflammatory response most likely initiating from\n\nresident pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts in\n\nuntreated reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS, contributed to the pathology\n\nassociated with ALI/ARDS. We have previously demonstrated a\n\nrole for IFNc in the pathophysiology of reovirus 1/L pulmonary\npathologies and suggest that prolonged and high levels of IFNc are\nassociated with more severe pulmonary pathologies [7,8]. The\n\nreduced pathology associated with curcumin treatment and the\n\nreduced expression of IFNc by curcumin would support this\nhypothesis. We have also demonstrated the potential effect of\n\ncurcumin on NFkB activation by a decrease in the levels of the P-\np65. This result is clearly consistent with the decreased expression\n\nof IFNc and MCP-1, which is observed in curcumin-treated\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS. The literature clearly links canonical\n\nactivation of NFkB in cells to the pathogenesis of inflammatory\ndiseases [44–48]. NFkB is activated in the lungs of patients with\nALI [49,50] and persistent elevation of NFkB in patients with\nsepsis-induced ALI is associated with poor outcome [51,52].\n\nCurcumin has been demonstrated to modulate NFkB activation in\ncell systems as well as in vivo model systems [16,18,53–57]. As an\n\nanti-inflammatory agent in association with lung diseases curcu-\n\nmin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-8, IL-1,\n\nand TNF through the inhibition of the transcription factors NFkB\nand AP-1 [26,28]. However, although NFkB plays a major role in\nregulating expression of cytokines/chemokines, the effects of\n\ncurcumin in reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS cannot solely be attributed\n\nto its effect on NFkB since glucocorticoids also inhibit NFkB but\ndo not suppress the development, progression, and mortality\n\nassociated with reovirus1/L-ALI/ARDS [7,8].\n\nTGFß and its signaling pathways have also been implicated in\n\nlung fibrosis [58–60] and TGFß over expression is associated with\n\npoorer prognosis in ARDS [61–63] as well as in our model [5,6].\n\nWhile curcumin has been demonstrated to reduce collagen in\n\nexperimental pulmonary fibrosis induced by cyclophosphamide,\n\nwhole-body irradiation, and bleomycin, little mechanistic studies\n\nhave been performed [20,22–27,64,65]. Here, we demonstrate in\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS that while treatment with curcumin did\n\nnot inhibit the expression of TGFß1 itself, expression of TGFß RII\n\nwas significantly reduced especially on day 9 post-induction where\n\nthe transition between inflammation and fibrosis is most evident.\n\nAlthough the precise mechanism remains unclear, in other\n\npulmonary fibrotic models including in bleomycin-induced fibrosis\n\n[22,25,66–69], in SiO2-induced fibrosis [70], and in amiodarone-\n\ninduced fibrosis [23], curcumin has been shown to reduce either\n\nTGFß protein or mRNA expression. In amiodarone-induced\n\nfibrosis, this reduction in TGFß is potentially through a decrease\n\nin c-Jun expression [23]. Aberrant activation of TGFß signaling\n\nhas also been implicated in scleroderma fibrosis [20,21,71,72] and\n\nin keloid, a fibrotic disease characterized by abnormal accumu-\n\nlation of ECM in the dermis via reduction in TGFß/p-SMAD-2\n\n[73]. Over expression of TGFß has also been implicated in fibrotic\n\nkidney disease and curcumin inhibited TGFß signaling and\n\nreduced TGFß induced increases in PAI-1, TGFß1, collagen,\n\nand fibronectin through a reduction in both TGFß RII and\n\nphosphorylation of Smad2/3 in renal cells [74,75]. In hepatic\n\nfibrosis curcumin activated PPARc which contributed to apoptosis\nand a reduction in extracellular matrix expression in hepatic\n\nstellate cells through the interruption of TGFß signaling and\n\nsuppression of CTGF [76–78].\n\nThere is convincing evidence in patients that increased lung\n\nepithelial apoptosis is associated with poor outcomes in ALI/\n\nARDS [51,79–81]. Pathways involving both the p38 MAP or Akt\n\nkinases are important in PMNs and macrophages, the major\n\ninfiltrating cells in ALI/ARDS [49,50,82]. Diminished transloca-\n\ntion of NFkB and phosphorylation of Akt but not p38 in PMNs of\npatients with sepsis-induced ALI was associated with improved\n\nsurvival [49]. It has also been demonstrated that activation of p38\n\nMAPK or an increase in caspase-3 activity appears to contribute\n\nto the proapoptotic effect of human neutrophil apoptosis by\n\ncurcumin [83]. Curcumin has been shown to modulate apoptosis\n\nin a number of different cell types. In scleroderma, it was shown\n\nthat scleroderma lung fibroblasts, which are deficient in PKCe, are\nsensitive to curcumin-induced apoptosis, whereas normal lung\n\nfibroblasts are insensitive to curcumin [20,21]. The importance of\n\nFigure 9. Administration of curcumin modulates the phosphorylation status of the p65 subunit of NFkB and p38 MAPK.

(A) On day 9 post-inoculation, protein was extracted from whole lung tissue from untreated (2) or curcumin-\ntreated (+) reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice and analyzed for the expression of phosphorylated p38 (P-p38) and phosphorylated p65-NFkB (P-p65-NFkB)\nby western analysis.

In pleural mesothelioma cells,\n\ncurcumin was shown to activate p38 MAPK, caspases 9 and 3,\n\ncaused elevated levels of proapoptotic proteins Bax, stimulated\n\nPARP cleavage, and induced apoptosis [84]. Curcumin has also\n\nbeen shown to attenuate gefitinib-induced cell proliferation and\n\nenhances apoptosis through altering p38 MAPK activation in\n\nintestinal epithelia cell [85]. In the reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS\n\nmodel, we have clearly demonstrated a role for apoptosis in\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS [9]. Although we demonstrated both\n\napoptosis of the alveolar epithelium via TUNEL analysis and the\n\nup regulation of Fas and FasL in situ in alveolar epithelium and in\n\ncells of the inflammatory infiltrate, modulation of reovirus 1/L-\n\nALI/ARDS was not linked to the inhibition of the Fas/FasL\n\npathway suggesting the involvement of additional apoptosis\n\npathways [9]. Here, we demonstrate in curcumin-treated reovirus\n\n1/L-ALI/ARDS, an increase in P-p38, which has been linked to\n\nenhanced PMN apoptosis. While we demonstrated a significant\n\ndecrease in the total number of infiltrating cells and a decrease in\n\nthe number of PMN on day 14 in curcumin-treated reovirus 1/L-\n\nALI/ARDS, whether this decrease is reflected in an increase in\n\napoptosis is yet to be determined.\n\nIn conclusion, our model provides a very relevant model for\n\ninfection (viral)-induced ALI/ARDS and for deciphering the\n\nmechanism(s) of action of agents that show promising efficacy\n\nagainst ALI/ARDS such as the potent anti-inflammatory agent,\n\ncurcumin. Our data strongly support the hypothesis in a pre-\n\nclinical model that treatment of reovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS with\n\ncurcumin inhibits the host inflammatory response potentially\n\nthrough the modulation of cytokine/chemokine expression\n\nthrough the NFkB pathway as well as the host fibrotic response\nduring the regeneration phase of the disease through modulation\n\nof the TGFß pathway. Our results also suggest that curcumin may\n\nmodulate apoptosis pathways mediated through the p38 MAPK\n\npathway. Thus, understanding curcumin’s mechanism of action\n\nmay elucidate compounds that would further improve it’s\n\ninhibitory activity in an additive or synergistic manner leading\n\nto combination studies involving curcumin and other anti-viral\n\nagents and/or anti-fibrotic agents. A water soluble curcumin\n\ncomplex has recently been described that attenuated multiple\n\nmarkers of inflammation and injury, including pulmonary edema\n\nand neutrophil infiltration in an ALI model [86]. An additional\n\nstudy demonstrated the potential use of curcumin as an adjunct\n\ntherapy as an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory agent along\n\nwith antibiotics in the case of acute lung infection induced by K.\n\npneumonia [87]. We are currently conducting additional exper-\n\niments to characterize the mechanism of curcumin’s affect on\n\nfibrotic lesion development in a therapeutic model. We have\n\npreliminary histological data that demonstrates treatment of\n\nreovirus 1/L-ALI/ARDS mice with curcumin beginning on day\n\n7 post reovirus 1/L infection (after the onset of inflammation but\n\nbefore significant development of fibrotic lesions) inhibits fibrotic\n\nlesion development as evaluated on day 14 (unpublished results).\n\nThus, continued studies of the potent anti-oxidant, anti-microbial,\n\nanti-inflammatory agent, curcumin, will likely improve the\n\nidentification of key study endpoints that may be manipulated to\n\nslow or reverse the relentless progression of pulmonary inflam-\n\nmation/fibrosis in acute viral-induced ALI/ARDS, ultimately,\n\nleading to new novel treatments to reduce pulmonary dysfunction\n\nand improve outcome for critically ill patients.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Ms. Lindsey Bishop-Jutzeler for assistance\n\nwith the tenascin-C western.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: SA FZ SDL LL.
