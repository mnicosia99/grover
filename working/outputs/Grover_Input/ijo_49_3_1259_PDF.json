We  sincerely apologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our  article who drew this matter to our attention. furthermore, we  regret any inconvenience this mistake has caused.   figure 3. macroscopic and microscopic features of the liver at 10 weeks. representative macroscopic (a) and microscopic (b) features of the liver at 10 weeks  are demonstrated. (a) macroscopic features of the liver from control rats (g1-10w), Den-treated rats (g2-10w), Den-treated rats administered with curcumin  (g3-10w) and Den-treated rats administered with caffeine (g4-10w) for 10 weeks are demonstrated. arrows indicate the representative nodules. (b) histological  analysis by hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that hyperplastic nodules (arrows) were developed in G2-10w, G3-10w and G4-10w. Original magnification,  x200. w, weeks.   '}
