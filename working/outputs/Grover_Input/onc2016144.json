(a) Upper panel: Detection of Ago proteins in immuno- precipitates with an anti Ago (pan) antibody. Whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a mouse anti Ago (pan) antibody or purified mouse IgG (as a control). The resulting precipitates were subjected to western blot analysis of Ago proteins. The data shown are representative of three individual experiments.  -ERK 37KDa-  PLX4720 U0126  - -  + -  - -  - +  Mel-CV Mel-RM - +  37KDa-  PLX4720 U0126  - -  + -  - -  - +  Mel-CV Mel-RM - +  -ERK  Full gel  Processed figure  Figure 6.
