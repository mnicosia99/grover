Regulation of Cardiac Progenitor Cells Marker\nc-kit by Stromal Cell Derived Factor-1a\nZhongpu Chen, Xiaodong Pan, Yuyu Yao, Fengdi Yan, Long Chen, Rong Huang, Genshan Ma*\n\nDepartment of Cardiology, Zhongda Hospital, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) have been proven suitable for stem cell therapy after myocardial infarction,\nespecially c-kit(+)CPCs. CPCs marker c-kit and its ligand, the stem cell factor (SCF), are linked as c-kit/SCF axis, which is\nassociated with the functions of proliferation and differentiation. In our previous study, we found that stromal cell-derived\nfactor-1a (SDF-1a) could enhance the expression of c-kit. However, the mechanism is unknown.\n\nMethods and Results: CPCs were isolated from adult mouse hearts, c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs were separated by magnetic\nbeads. The cells were cultured with SDF-1a and CXCR4-selective antagonist AMD3100, and c-kit expression was measured\nby qPCR and Western blotting. Results showed that SDF-1a could enhance c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs, made c-\nkit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, and AMD3100 could inhibit the function of SDF-1a. After the intervention of SDF-1a and\nAMD3100, proliferation and migration of CPCs were measured by CCK-8 and transwell assay. Results showed that SDF-1a\ncould enhance the proliferation and migration of both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs, and AMD3100 could inhibit these\nfunctions. DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) mRNA were measured by qPCR, DNMT activity was measured using the DNMT\nactivity assay kit, and DNA methylation was analyzed using Sequenom’s MassARRAY platform, after the CPCs were cultured\nwith SDF-1a. The results showed that SDF-1a stimulation inhibited the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b, which are critical\nfor the maintenance of regional DNA methylation. Global DNMT activity was also inhibited by SDF-1a. Lastly, SDF-1a\ntreatment led to significant demethylation in both c-kit(+) and c-kit(2) CPCs.\n\nConclusions: SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs\nexpressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation and migration ability improvement, through the inhibition of DNMT1\nand DNMT3b expression and global DNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-kit gene.\n\nCitation: Chen Z, Pan X, Yao Y, Yan F, Chen L, et al.

In 2003, cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) were first\n\nreported to reside in the adult heart [1–3]. Resident CPCs may\n\nbe particularly suitble for resurrecting dead myocardium because\n\nthey are endogenous components of the adult heart and appear to\n\nbe respnsible for the physiological and pathological turnover of\n\ncardiac myocytes and other cardiac cells. The heart have several\n\npopulations of CPCs, which are self-renewing, clonogenic, multi-\n\npotent and have the ability to proliferate and differentiate into\n\nfunctional cardiomyocytes, smooth muscle cells, and other kinds of\n\ncells [2,4–6]. Among these CPCs, c-kit(+)CPCs are especially\nsuitable in cell therapy for the recovery of injured cardiomyocytes\n\n[2,4]. c-kit(+)CPCs have the larger numbers than other types of\nCPCs, and have stronger proliferation and differentiation ability to\n\nrepair the injured myocardium [7].\n\nc-kit is a proto-oncogene and a tyrosine kinase growth factor\n\nreceptor, expressed on several types of cells, including CPCs [8–\n\n11], with the stem cell factor (SCF) as its ligand. c-kit expression is\n\nrelated to the regulation of cell proliferation, and migration [12–\n\n15]. Stromal cell-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) is a member of the\nCXC chemokine family, and CXCR4 is its receptor, which are\n\nexpressed in a variety of cell types, including CPCs [16]. SDF-1a\nexpression has been reported to increase after an acute myocardial\n\ninfarction [17]. SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could prompt stem cell\nhoming to damaged cardiac tissue [16,18]. AMD3100 is a specific\n\nantagonist to SDF-1a, which binds to CXCR4 competitively for\npreventing the combination of SDF-1a and CXCR4. Recent\nstudies have indicated that SDF-1a/CXCR4 and c-kit/SCF axes\nare closely linked [19]. Our study found that SDF-1a could\nenhance c-kit expression. However, limited information is known\n\non the regulation of SDF-1a on c-kit.\nDNA methylation is one of the important research content of\n\nepigenetics, which cytosine is methylated in a reaction catalyzed\n\nby DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), with S-adenosyl methionine\n\n(SAM) as a methyl donor [20]. In mammalian cells, three\n\nDNMTs, namely, DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b, are\nresponsible for DNA methylation. DNMT1 is a maintenance\n\ntype methyltransferase, responsible for copying DNA methylation\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69134\n\n\n\npatterns during DNA replication, whereas DNMT3a and\nDNMT3b are essential for de novo methylation [20–25]. DNA\nmethylation is an important method in the regulatory mechanisms\n\nof gene expression [20–29]. In several diseases such as cancer,\n\ngene promoter CpG islands result in abnormal silencing [27–29].\n\nA recent study has found that TGFb1 could regulate CD133\nexpression through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b\nexpressions, and subsequently, the demethylation of promoter-1\n\n[30]. However, the influence of SDF-1a on the expression of c-kit\nby DNA methylation is unknown.\n\nThe present study demonstrates that SDF-1a combined with\nCXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and\nmake c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs\n\nproliferation and migration ability improvement, through the\n\ninhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression and global\nDNMT activity, as well as the subsequent demethylation of the c-\n\nkit gene.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics Statement\nAll animal studies were carried out using a method approved\n\nby the the Care of Experimental Animals Committee of the\n\nSoutheast University, and conform with the guidelines of the\n\nNational Research Council (approval ID: SYXK-2010.3908).\n\nIsolation and culture of CPCs\nFor the isolation and culture of CPCs in our laboratory [31],\n\nCPCs were acquired from the hearts of two-month-old wild-type\n\nmale C57BL/6 mice (Yangzhou Laboratory Animal Center).\n\nThe hearts were acquired using a method approved by the Care\n\nof Experimental Animals Committee of the Southeast University,\n\nNanjing, China (Laboratory Animal Center of Southeast\n\nUniversity). CPCs were isolated following the standard method\n\ndescribed previously. After one or two weeks of growth, a layer\n\nof fibroblast-like cells were generated from the adherent\n\nmyocardial tissue. On these fibroblast-like cells, several small,\n\nround, and phase-bright cells emerged, which were collected by\n\nthe digestion of accutase enzyme, which did not affect the cell\n\nsurface markers (at room temperature, under direct visualization,\n\nfor a maximum of 3 min). The obtained cells were separated by\n\nmagnetic-activated c-kit cell sorting magnetic beads (Miltenyi\n\nBiotec Inc., GER) following the instructions of the manufactur-\n\ners. Cells were seeded at 26104 cells/ml on poly-D-lysine\n(Sigma, USA) coated dishes in cardiosphere growing medium\n\n(CGM; 35% IMDM/65%DMEM-Ham’s F-12 [Hyclone, USA]\n\nmixture containing 10% fetal calf serum [Hyclone, USA],\n\n2 mmol/L L-glutamine [Hyclone, USA], 0.1 mmol/L 2-mecrap-\n\ntoethanol [Sigma, USA], 2% B27 [Gibco, USA], 5 ng/ml basic\n\nfibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [R&D, USA], 10 ng/ml epider-\n\nmal growth factor (EGF) [Peprotech, USA], 40 nmol/L cardio-\n\ntrophin-1 [Peprotech, USA], 1 unit/ml thrombin [Sigma, USA],\n\nFigure 1.

In the flow cytometric\n\nanalysis, CPCs were trypsinized and re-suspended in phosphate\n\nbuffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 3% FBS for 15 min. CPCs\n\nwere then labeled with PE-conjugated rat anti-mouse c-kit. FITC-\n\nconjugated rat anti-mouse Sca-1 (BD Biosciences, USA) was\n\nobtained at 4uC in a dark room for 30 min and then washed twice\nwith cold PBS. Data were collected from 16105 cells on a\nFACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, USA) and analyzed\n\nusing the WinMDI software.\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTrizol reagent (Invitrogen, CA) was used to isolate total RNA\n\nfrom cells, according to the instructions of the manufacturer.\n\nFirst Strand cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription using\n\nthe cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas, CA), according to the\n\ninstructions manufacturer. The cDNA were stored at 220uC\nuntil use. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was performed\n\nusing IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, USA). qPCR\n\nexperiments were also performed using BIO-RAD MJ Mini\n\nOpticon Real-Time PCR System, and the matching analysis\n\nsoftware was the BIO-RAD CFX Manager. Relative gene\n\nexpression levels were calculated by normalization to GAPDH.\n\nSequences of each primer were designed as follows: GAPDH\n\nforward primer: CAAGGTCATCCATGACAACTTTG and\n\nreverse primer: GTCCACCACC- CTGTTGCTGTAG, c-kit\n\nforward primer: ACATCGCCAGAGCCAACG and reverse\n\nprimer: ATCCACTTTAATTTCGGGTCAA, DNMT1 forward\n\nprimer: GAGCCCA- GCAAAGAGTAT and reverse primer:\n\nATGGTAGAAGGAGGAACAG, DNMT3a forward primer:\nCTGTCCCATCCAGGCAGTAT and reverse primer;\n\nCTTAGCGG- TGTCTTGGAAGC, DNMT3b forward primer:\nAGATGATGGGAATGGCTCTG and reverse primer:\n\nTGCTGAAGATGATGCTCGAC.\n\nWestern blotting\nWestern blotting was performed as described in the following\n\nsentences. An equal amount of cell lysates (40 mg protein) was\ndenatured in 26 SDS-PAGE sample buffer and electrophoresed\nfor 3 h at 20 mA on 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated\n\nproteins were then transferred into polyvinylidene difluoride\n\n(PVDF) membranes blocked by TBST solution (10 mM Tris-\n\nHCl, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20), containing 5%\n\nnonfat dry milk for 4 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the\n\nproteins were incubated with primary antibodies (Santa Cruz,\n\n1:1000 dilution), and placed on a rocker at 4uC overnight.\nAfterward, the proteins were washed three times with TBST for\n\n15 min, and mixed with IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz, 1:5000) for 2 h at\n\nroom temperature, which was also washed three times with TBST\n\nfor 15 min. GAPDH was used as loading control (Santa Cruz,\n\n1:1000). The membranes were incubated in an enhanced\n\nchemiluminescence detection system for 5 min, and imaged using\n\na five- minute exposure film. Protein expression was quantified by\n\nscanning densitometry.\n\nCPCs proliferation and migration\nCell proliferation assay was performed using CCK-8 kit (cell\n\ncounting kit-8) (Dojido, Japan). According to the manufacture’s\n\ninstruction, 5,106103 cells were seeded into 96-well culture\nplates. Adhesion was verified once (about 12 h later), the cells\n\nwere incubated with SDF-1a (100 ng/ml for 48 h, Sigma) and\nAMD3100 (5 mg/ml for 48 h, Sigma). Next, cells in each well\nwere incubated with 10 ml of CCK-8 at 37uC for 2 h. Then the\noptical density (OD) for each well was measured at 450 nm using\n\na microplate reader (Bio-Rad Model 550, CA).\n\nA cell migration assay was performed in 24-well Transwell\n\nplates (8.0 mm, pore size) (Millipore, Billerica). The cells after\nintervented with SDF-1a and AMD3100 were seeded into the\nupper chamber of the transwell system at a concentration of\n\n26104cells/well in 100 ml medium, and the lower chamber was\nfilled with 100 ng/ml SCF (Sigma) in 600 ml medium. After 6 h\nof incubation at 37uC, 5% CO2, the upper sides of the filters\nwere carefully washed with PBS, and cells remaining were\n\nremoved with a cotton wool swab.

The instruction of the manufacturer was followed,\n\nusing 1 mg of genomic DNA and the alternative conversion\nmethod (a two-temperature DNA denaturation).\n\nMethylation analysis: Quantitative methylation analysis was\n\ncarried out with Sequenom’s MassARRAY platform, using\n\nMALDI-TOF mass spectrometry in combined with RNA base-\n\nspecific cleavage (MassCLEAVE). When feasible, amplicons were\n\ndesigned to cover CpGs in the same region as the 59 untranslated\n\nregions (59UTR). PCR primers were designed using Methprimer\n\n(www.urogene.org/methprimer/). For each reverse primer, an\n\nadditional T7 promoter tag for in vivo transcription was added,\n\nwhereas a 10-meter tag on the forward primer was used to adjust\n\nmelting-temperature differences. MassCLEAVE biochemistry was\n\nperformed as described previously [32].

After approximately\n\n10 days of culture, a layer of fibroblast-like cells emerged from\n\nadherent myocardial tissues, followed by small, round and phase-\n\nbright cells (Figures 1A). The inverted phase-contrast microscope\n\nexaminations showed that CPCs presented clone-like proliferation\n\n(Figure 1B). c-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs were characterized by\nflow cytometric analysis of the cell surface markers, namely, c-kit\n\nand Sca-1 (Figure 1C and 1D).\n\nSDF-1a up-regulates c-kit expression in CPCs\nC-kit-positive CPCs were divided into three groups, namely,\n\ncontrol, SDF-1a (treated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a for 48 h), and\nSDF-1a + AMD3100 groups (treated with 100 ng/ml SDF-1a\nand 5 mg/ml AMD3100 for 48 h). The groups were analyzed\nusing western blotting and qPCR to identify protein and mRNA\n\nlevel. We found that SDF-1a could up-regulate c-kit expression\nof c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit at both\n\nprotein and mRNA levels, whereas AMD3100 could inhibit this\n\nfunction (Figures 2A and 2B).\n\nSDF-1a enhances proliferation and migration of CPCs\nTo determine whether SDF-1a will influence CPCs prolifera-\n\ntion and migration toward SCF, we performed an in vitro CCK-8\n\nassay and migration assay, and CPCs were placed under SDF-1a\nwith or without the CXCR4 specific antagonist AMD3100. The\n\nresults indicated that c-kit(+)CPCs proliferation rates of SDF-1a\ngroup (0.16260.008 OD) increase significantly, compared with\n\nthat of control group (0.11460.002 OD) and SDF-\n\n1a+AMD3100group (0.12560.003 OD), and c-kit(2) CPCs\nproliferation rates of SDF-1a group (0.13560.004 OD) increase\nsignificantly, compared with that of control group (0.06360.004\n\nOD) and SDF-1a+AMD3100group (0.08060.006 OD)\n(Figure 3A). And c-kit(+)CPCs migration rates of SDF-1a group\n(SCF+SDF-1a) (602.3620.0 cells) also increase significantly,\ncompared with that of control group (with SCF, without SDF-\n\n1a) (85.0611.8 cells), and inhibition group (with SCF+SDF-\n1a+AMD3100) (138.7614.6 cells), and c-kit(-)CPCs migration\nrates of SDF-1a group (SCF+SDF-1a) (272.0650.7 cells) also\nincrease signicantly, compared with that of control group (with\n\nSCF, without SDF-1a) (37.065.0 cells), and inhibition group (with\n\nFigure 4.

We found that SDF-1a could significantly reduce the\nmethylation percentage of c-kit(+)CPCs in five out of seven, and all\nof seven for c-kit(2)CPCs, analyzed CpG sites after incubation.\n\n(Figures 5A and 5B).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe key findings in our study are listed as follows: (1) An\n\nadequate amount of CPCs could be obtained from adult mouse\n\nheart tissue using enzymatic digestion, and c-kit(+)CPCs and c-\nkit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic-activated cell sorting,\n\n(2) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could up-regulate c-kit\nexpression of c-kit(+) CPCs and make c-kit(2)CPCs expressing\nc-kit, this regulation could be suppressed by ADM3100, an\n\ninhibitor of SDF-1a, (3) SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could\nenhance the proliferation and migration abilities of CPCs, and\n\nthese fuctions could be suppressed by AMD3100, (4)SDF-1a\ncombined with CXCR4 could up-regulated c-kit expression\n\nthrough the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression\nand global DNMT activity, as well as through subsequent\n\ndemethylation of the c-kit gene.\n\nIn regenerating the functional cardiac tissue, stem cell therapy is\n\nan effective method for the recovery of the injured myocardium.\n\nWe selected CPCs because of their incomparable cardiac\n\nregenerative capacity [33–34]. Presently, CPCs are based exclu-\n\nsively on the expression of a stem cell-related surface antigen,\n\nnamely, c-kit and Sca-1. CPCs are multipotent, self-renewing, and\n\nclonogenic, which have the ability to transform cardiomyocytes in\n\nnormal, as well as in aging and diseased hearts. CPCs apparently\n\nhave a mixture of different subpopulations. Among these CPCs, c-\n\nkit(+)CPCs showed better cardiac repair capability thus are\nconsidered as the most suitable cells for myocardial regeneration\n\ntherapies [35]. Hence, in this study, we selected the marker, c-kit,\n\nas the identification index of CPCs, as observed in the heart. Our\n\nstudy verified that, an adequate amount of CPCs could be\n\nacquired from an adult mouse heart through enzymatic digestion,\n\nc-kit(+)CPCs and c-kit(2)CPCs could be separated by magnetic-\nactivated cell sorting. CPCs within 10 generations, which we had\n\nactually examined for c-kit expression, were used for these\n\nexperiments. Researches showed that c-kit (+)CPCs could be\npassaged to the 40 generation, and still had kept the stem cell\n\nsurface markers [36].\n\nc-kit is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase factor receptor. Its\n\nligand, SCF, is an early hemopoietic growth factor. c-kit/SCF axis\n\nsupports the proliferation and migration of multiple hemopoietic\n\nlineages [37–39]. SDF-1a belongs to the CXC subfamily, which\nhas the ability to facilitate the transmigration of hematopoietic\n\ncells through endothelial cell barriers [40]. CXCR4 is its receptor,\n\na seven- transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor. SDF-1a\nexpression is aimed to protect against myocardial ischemic injury\n\n[41], which is critical in progenitor cell tissue retention, trafficking,\n\nand homing [42]. SDF-1a expression has been shown to enhance\nthe survival of progenitor cells in several stimuli such as in\n\nischemia/reperfusion injury [43–44], serum withdrawal and\n\napoptotic cell death, through interaction with CXCR4 [45].\n\nAMD3100 is a specific antagonist to SDF-1a, which competitively\nbinds to CXCR4 to prevent the combination of SDF-1a and\nCXCR4, effectively blocking.90% of binding SDF-1a [46]. A\nrecent study showed that AMD3100 with the concentration of\n\n5 mg/ml could efficiently prevent the SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis [47].\nIn our study, we found that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 could\n\nup-regulate c-kit expression of c-kit(+)CPCs and make c-\nkit(2)CPCs expressing c-kit, which result in the CPCs proliferation\n\nand migration abilities improvement. Research showed\n\nVEGFMSCs could induced SDF-1a and CXCR4 expression,\nand promoted CSCs proliferation and migration, whereas\n\nblockade of SDF-1a or its receptor CXCR4 by RNAi or\nantagonist significantly diminished these beneficial effects of\n\nVEGFMSCs [48]. Our results were similar to these results, and\n\nthe conclusion was that SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis could affect CSCs\nproliferation and migration. However, the mechanism is not quite\n\nclear.\n\nDNA methylation is an important mechanism for gene\n\ntranscriptional silencing. CpG hypermethylation in DNA pro-\n\nmoter regions is responsible for gene silencing [49–51]. DNA\n\nmethylation status was regulated by DNMT, which has de novo\n\nmethylation activity. We found that SDF-1a combined with\nCXCR4 could inhibit global DNMT activity. Furthermore,\n\nDNMT expression, include DNMT1, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b,\nwas significantly higher in c-kit(2)CPCs compared to c-\n\nkit(+)CPCs, and DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was\nsuppressed by the stimulation of SDF-1a combined with\nCXCR4. Therefore, DNMT1 and DNMT3b are critical\nenzymes in the mechanism of SDF-1a combined with CXCR4\ninduced c-kit expression. Meanwhile, Bisulfite sequencing anal-\n\nysis was chosen to quantify the promoter methylation degree in\n\nmultiple CpG sites. Our data demonstrated that SDF-1a\nsignificantly reduces c-kit promoter methylation of c-kit(+)CPCs\nin five out of seven CpG sites, and all of seven CpG sites for c-\n\nkit(2)CPCs. Therefore, the 7th and 15th CpG sites probably\n\nplay an important role in the expression of c-kit gene in c-\n\nkit(2)CPCs. Although the effect of SDF-1a on methylation in\nindividual CpG sites is relatively small, the overall effect of\n\naccumulated demethylation induced by SDF-1a in multiple CpG\nsites has significant influence on c-kit transcription. Therefore,\n\nSDF-1a induced demethylation in the c-kit promoter is\nimportant in the regulation of c-kit transcription.\n\nOur study demonstrated that SDF-1a combined with CXCR4\ncould regulate c-kit expression, which result in the CPCs\n\nproliferation and migration ability improvement, and this function\n\ncould be suppressed by ADM3100. Furthermore, the up-\n\nregulation of c-kit expression by SDF-1a combined with CXCR4\nis through the inhibition of DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression\nand the global DNMTs activity, as well as through the subsequent\n\ndemethylation of the c-kit gene. In summary, this study described\n\na mechanism by which SDF-1a combined with CXCR4 regulates\nc-kit expression through promoter demethylation. However, no\n\nclue about the mechanism of the inhibiting effect of SDF-1a\ncombined with CXCR4 to DNMT was found so far. We will\n\ncontinue to search for the possible mechanism. Our current\n\nfindings provided a novel strategy for stem cell therapy in\n\nrecovering damaged myocardium through the modification of the\n\nstatus of c-kit promoter methylation by potentially targeting SDF-\n\n1a or DNMTs.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Dr. Yao Liang Tang for his valuable technical\n\nassistance.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: ZC GM.
