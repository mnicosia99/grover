However, the mechanisms necessary for the protective host response, or those\nresponsible for pathogen-induced bone loss, are not clear. Recent evidence demonstrates that bacterially\ninfected osteoblasts secrete chemokines and cytokines, suggesting that these cells may have an unappreciated\nrole in supporting localized inflammation. In this study, mouse and human osteoblasts were investigated for\ntheir ability to express functional CD40 upon exposure to two important pathogens of bone, Staphylococcus\naureus and Salmonella enterica serovar Dublin. Bacterial infection of cultured mouse or human osteoblasts\nresulted in increased CD40 mRNA and CD40 protein expression induced by either pathogen. Importantly,\nCD40 expression by osteoblasts was functional, as assessed by ligation of this molecule with recombinant,\nsoluble CD154. CD40 activity was assessed by induction of interleukin-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-\nstimulating factor in osteoblasts following ligation. Cocultures of activated CD4� T lymphocytes and osteo-\nblasts could interact via CD40 and CD154, since an antibody against CD40 could block macrophage inflam-\nmatory protein-1� secretion. Taken together, these studies conclusively demonstrate that infected osteoblasts\ncan upregulate expression of functional CD40 molecules which mediate cytokine secretion. This surprising\nresult further supports the notion that bone-forming osteoblasts can directly interact with CD154-expressing\ncells (i.e., T lymphocytes) and can contribute to the host response during bone infection.\n\nInteractions between CD40 and CD40 ligand (CD154) have\nbeen implicated as being critical for the initiation of T-lym-\nphocyte-dependent humoral and cell-mediated immune re-\nsponses (44). In particular, much attention has been given to\nthe ability of CD154-expressing T lymphocytes to ligate CD40\non B lymphocytes (8), macrophages (51, 52), and dendritic\ncells (10). Such interactions provide strong activation signals\nfor these professional antigen-presenting cells and, in effect,\nallow T lymphocytes to significantly influence the activity of\nCD40-positive cells. In the absence of such interactions, hu-\nmoral (8) and cell-mediated (17, 44, 62) immune responses are\nsignificantly impaired.\n\nRecent studies have demonstrated that a variety of cell types\ncan express functional CD40 molecules. Endothelial cells (40),\nsmooth muscle cells (40), epithelial cells (61), and even some\nfibroblasts (21, 48, 67) have been shown to be CD40 positive,\nsuggesting that this molecule has a more ubiquitous role in\ncellular activation beyond that documented for professional\nantigen-presenting cells. The ability of a diverse population of\ncell types to express CD40 also raises the important possibility\nthat CD154-expressing T lymphocytes might interact with\nCD40 on these cells, initiating cellular activation and focusing\nthe T-lymphocyte response to a particular site.\n\nDuring diseases of bone and joints, infiltrating T lympho-\ncytes and macrophages are observed (55, 58) and are thought\n\nto contribute to the protective immune response and also to\nthe destruction of host tissues (7, 34, 37). The infiltration of\nantigen-presenting cells into sites of bone disease would seem\nimportant, since the cellular components of bone (i.e., oste-\noclasts and osteoblasts) are not thought to provide efficient\nantigen presentation or costimulation for infiltrating T lym-\nphocytes. Osteoclasts are derived from myeloid precursors (47,\n56) and are, therefore, of a lineage that might function to\ndirectly interact with T lymphocytes. Conversely, osteoblasts\nare derived from a mesenchymal bone marrow precursor (3)\nand have been described as a sophisticated fibroblast (18). As\nsuch, the potential of osteoblasts for interacting with T lym-\nphocytes to initiate an immune response against pathogens of\nbone, such as Staphylococcus and Salmonella, would seem to be\nlimited. If true, the inability to interact with T lymphocytes\nposes a significant problem for the protective host response\nagainst bacterial pathogens during bone diseases, unless other\nantigen-presenting cells are functional in bone. In addition to\ntight associations with bone matrices (13, 15), it is likely that\nbacteria can survive within osteoblasts (32). If osteoblasts can-\nnot effectively interact with T lymphocytes, this limitation\nmight explain why bone infections are difficult to resolve and\noften recur.\n\nRecent studies have suggested, however, that this view may\nnot be completely accurate. Following interaction with bacteria\nor bacterial products, bone-forming osteoblasts have been\nshown to possess a surprising ability to upregulate expression\nof cytokines (6, 12, 33, 53, 59) and chemokines (5, 25), which\ncould augment T-lymphocyte-mediated inflammatory re-\nsponses. This recent realization is somewhat surprising, since\n\n* Corresponding author.

This surprising result further supports the notion\nthat these bone-forming cells can directly interact with T lym-\nphocytes during bone infection.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIsolation and culture of mouse osteoblasts. Two-day-old BALB/c or C57BL/6\n\nneonates were euthanized and calvaria were removed. Primary osteoblasts were\nisolated from calvaria by sequential collagenase-protease digestion as previously\ndescribed by our laboratory (4, 5). Using immunofluorimetric analysis, osteoblast\ncultures were considered to be �99% pure as determined by cells staining\npositive for type I collagen, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase.\n\nNormal human osteoblast cultures. Normal human osteoblast cultures (Clo-\nnetics, San Diego, Calif.) were purchased and propagated as described by the\nmanufacturer. Cells were seeded in 25-cm2 flasks and incubated at 37°C in 5%\nCO2 with osteoblast growth medium (Clonetics) containing 10% fetal bovine\nserum, ascorbic acid, gentamicin, and amphotericin B. When approximately 80%\nconfluent, cells were trypsinized (0.025% trypsin–0.01% EDTA), washed in me-\ndium, and seeded into 6-well or 24-well plates. These commercially available cells\nhave previously been characterized as being authentic osteoblasts (26).\n\nExposure of cultured mouse and human osteoblasts to bacteria, LPS, or\npeptidoglycan. S. aureus strain UAMS-1 (ATCC 49230; American Type Culture\nCollection, Rockville, Md.) is an osteomyelitis clinical isolate. S. enterica serovar\nDublin (strain SL 1363) is a wild-type pathogenic strain. Both bacterial strains\nwere grown overnight in tryptic soy broth at 37°C with shaking. Bacteria were\nharvested by centrifugation at 4,300 � g for 10 min, and bacterial pellets were\nwashed once with Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). The final pellet was\nsuspended in osteoblast growth medium without antibiotics. Osteoblast cultures\nwere briefly exposed (45 min) to various numbers of bacteria, followed by\nwashing three times with HBSS and then addition of medium containing genta-\nmicin (25 �g/ml), to eliminate any viable extracellular bacteria. At various times\npostinfection, cells or culture supernates were taken for the indicated analyses.\nThe ratios of Staphylococcus or Salmonella cells to osteoblasts used for exposure\nin these studies were 250:1, 75:1, and 25:1, or 30:1, 10:1, and 3:1, respectively.\nThese ratios were empirically determined to result in a limited intracellular\ninfection (i.e., less than 1%) and in limited cell death (i.e., less than 5%) during\nthe indicated times in culture. In some experiments, osteoblasts were exposed to\npurified peptidoglycan or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), and\nRNA was harvested 6 h after exposure.\n\nRNA isolation, reverse transcription, and semiquantitative PCR for CD40. At\nvarious times following exposure to bacteria, RNA was extracted from cultured\nmouse or human osteoblasts, and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) was\nperformed to detect the presence of CD40 mRNA using methodologies similar\nto those previously reported by our laboratories (4, 5). After PCR, amplified\nproducts were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide\nand visualized under UV illumination. Densitometric analyses were performed\nfollowing import of each gel image (Adobe Photoshop; Adobe Systems, San Jose,\nCalif.) into NIH Image (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image). A gel-plotting macro\nwas used to outline the bands, and the intensity was calculated on the uncali-\nbrated OD setting. The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-\ndrogenase (G3PDH) was used to normalize PCR products to verify equal input\nof RNA and similar efficiencies of reverse transcription. Results reported here\nwere always in the linear range of amplification for this message (data not\nshown). Positive and negative PCR primers used in this study included the\nfollowing: G3PDH, CCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGAG and CACAGTCT\nTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT, respectively; mouse CD40, CACTGACAAACAG\nTACCTCCACGATGG and TGGGCAGGGATGACAGACGGTATC; and hu-\nman CD40, AGCTCGGAATATCTAGCATCCC and TTACTTTGGCTACGA\nATGGCTGATG.\n\nImmunocytochemical staining of cultured osteoblasts to detect CD40 protein\nfollowing infection. Mouse or human osteoblasts were cultured onto glass cov-\nerslips in 24-well plates. Twenty-four hours after exposure to various numbers of\nbacteria, osteoblasts were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at �20°C\nand washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific and Fc receptor binding\nwas blocked with bovine immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1 mg/ml; Sigma) and 1%\n\nbovine serum albumin (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, Ga.) for 15 min at room\ntemperature. Rat anti-mouse CD40 (1:100; clone 3/23; PharMingen, San Diego,\nCalif.) or mouse anti-human CD40 (1:100; clone 5C3; PharMingen) was added to\nthe appropriate coverslips for 2 h at room temperature. Duplicate coverslips\nwere also stained using identical concentrations of isotype-matched control an-\ntibodies, including rat IgG2a (1:100; clone R35-95; PharMingen) or mouse IgG1\n(1:100, clone A112-2; PharMingen), respectively. Following incubation with the\nprimary antibodies, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline–\n0.1% bovine serum albumin and incubated with a biotin-conjugated anti-rat\nantibody or biotin-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:500; PharMingen), respec-\ntively, for 2 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed and incubated with\nstreptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:200) for 20 min at room temperature.\nDiaminobenzidine with nickel substrate reagent (Vector Laboratories, Burlin-\ngame, Calif.) was added for 20 min, followed by washing and counterstaining\nwith hematoxylin (Fischer Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pa.). Cells were dehydrated, and\ncoverslips were mounted on slides with Permount (Fischer Scientific) for micros-\ncopy.\n\nQuantification of the percentage of cultured osteoblasts expressing CD40 by\nusing FACS analysis. Immunofluorescence analyses were performed to deter-\nmine the percentage of mouse or human osteoblasts expressing CD40. Cultured\nosteoblasts were uninfected or exposed to Staphylococcus (ratio of 75:1 bacteria\nto cells) or Salmonella (ratio of 3:1 bacteria to cells) for 45 min, followed by\nremoval of extracellular bacteria. At 24 h postinfection cells were removed from\nflasks by brief exposure to 0.025% trypsin–0.01% EDTA and fixed using 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 10 min at 4°C. Mouse or human osteoblasts were then\nincubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse CD40\n(clone HM40-3; PharMingen) or FITC-conjugated anti-human CD40 (clone\n5C3; PharMingen) for 1 h at 4°C, respectively. Duplicate cell preparations were\nalso stained using identical concentrations of isotype-matched control antibod-\nies, including FITC-conjugated hamster IgM (clone G235-1; PharMingen) or\nFITC-conjugated mouse IgG1 (clone A112-2; PharMingen), respectively. After\nwashing off unbound antibody, 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed by using a\nfluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; FACSCalibur; Becton Dickinson, San\nJose, Calif.).\n\nCytokine secretion following ligation of CD40 on mouse or human osteoblasts.\nTo demonstrate that ligation of CD40 on mouse or human osteoblasts could\nresult in a functional response, cytokine secretion by these cells was quantified.\nFor these studies, mouse or human osteoblasts were uninfected, or infected by\nexposing cells to Staphylococcus or Salmonella to upregulate CD40 expression.\nFollowing infection, mouse or human osteoblasts were treated with the agonists,\nsoluble trimeric murine CD154 (26 �g/ml; Immunex, Seattle, Wash.) or soluble\nhuman CD154/TRAP fusion protein (2 �g/ml; Chemicon International, Te-\nmecula Calif.), respectively. Supernates were collected 24 h later, and capture\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) were performed to quantify\nmouse interleukin-6 (IL-6; PharMingen), or human IL-6 and human granulo-\ncyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF; Research Diagnostics,\nInc., Flanders, N.J.), respectively, using methodologies previously described (5).\nCytokine concentrations in culture supernates were determined by extrapolation\nfrom standard curves.\n\nMIP-1� secretion in mixed cultures of osteoblasts and mitogen-activated\nCD4� T lymphocytes. Cocultures of mouse osteoblasts and mitogen-activated\nCD4� T lymphocytes were established in the presence of an antagonistic anti-\nbody against CD40 or an isotype-matched control antibody. For these cultures,\nBALB/c splenic leukocytes were isolated (19) and stimulated for 24 h in the\npresence of concanavalin A (1 �g/ml; Sigma Chemical Co.). Following activa-\ntion, CD4� T lymphocytes were purified by magnetic-activated cell sorting, using\nferritin-conjugated anti-CD4 beads (Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, Calif.) as previ-\nously described (19). These activated CD4� T lymphocytes were added to cul-\ntured BALB/c osteoblasts in the presence of anti-CD40 (10 �g/ml; clone\nHM40-3; PharMingen), which has been shown to be an antagonist of CD40-\nCD154 interactions, or in the presence of an isotype-matched control antibody\n(10 �g/ml; clone G235-1; PharMingen). Supernates were collected 24 h later for\nquantification of macrophage inflammatory protein-1� (MIP-1�) secretion using\nan ELISA (PharMingen).\n\nRESULTS\n\nCD40 mRNA expression is upregulated in cultured mouse\nand human osteoblasts following infection with Staphylococcus\nor Salmonella. Since the T-lymphocyte response during bone\ninfection is not clear, and since bone cells are not recognized as\nbeing capable of providing significant costimulation, this study\n\n1210 SCHRUM ET AL.

After primary mouse osteoblasts were ex-\nposed to S. aureus or S. enterica serovar Dublin, colony counts\nwere performed to quantify the numbers of intracellular bac-\nteria at 24 h postinfection. Less than 1% of the input bacteria\nused to infect osteoblasts remained viable at this time point,\ndemonstrating that the intracellular bacterial burden in these\ncultures was modest (data not shown). In addition, greater\nthan 95% of the osteoblasts remained viable throughout the\nculture period regardless of the level of bacterial exposure, as\npreviously reported (4).\n\nHaving defined the pathogen burden in these cultures, we\nbegan studies to define the potential of these cells to regulate\nexpression of CD40 following infection. For these studies,\nRNA was isolated from osteoblasts exposed to various num-\nbers of Staphylococcus or Salmonella organisms and semiquan-\ntitative RT-PCR was performed for CD40 mRNA expression.\nAs shown in one representative study (Fig. 1A), constitutive\nlevels of CD40 mRNA expression were detected in uninfected\nmouse osteoblasts. However, exposure to either Staphylococ-\ncus or Salmonella significantly increased expression of this\nmessage. From three separate RT-PCR analyses, fold in-\ncreases � standard deviations in CD40 mRNA expression\nwere 4.2 � 1.6 and 5.9 � 1.7 for Staphylococcus- (250:1) and\nSalmonella- (10:1) infected osteoblasts, respectively, compared\nto CD40 message expression in uninfected cultures. Differ-\nences in CD40 mRNA expression in Fig. 1A could not be\nascribed to differences in input RNA, or to differences in the\nefficiency of reverse transcription as evidenced by RT-PCR\namplification of the housekeeping gene G3PDH for each sam-\nple. Kinetic analyses demonstrated that as early as 4 h after\nexposure to Staphylococcus (Fig. 1B) or Salmonella (Fig. 1C),\nsignificant increases in CD40 mRNA expression were ob-\nserved. Therefore, despite the limited bacterial infection of\nthese cultured osteoblasts, CD40 mRNA expression was rap-\nidly induced in these cells. Salmonella-derived LPS, but not\npeptidoglycan, could stimulate cultured mouse osteoblasts to\nexpress CD40 mRNA (Fig. 1D). Thus, it was not necessary to\nhave intact, viable Salmonella to stimulate osteoblasts to ex-\npress CD40.\n\nThe surprising ability of these bacterial pathogens to up-\nregulate CD40 mRNA expression was also observed in primary\ncultures of human osteoblasts (Fig. 2). Following bacterial\ninfection, RNA was isolated and semiquantitative RT-PCR\nwas performed for CD40 mRNA expression. Figure 2 shows\none representative study demonstrating constitutive CD40\nmRNA expression that was upregulated following bacterial\ninfection. These results were strikingly similar to those ob-\ntained for mouse osteoblasts and together demonstrate the\nconserved nature of the response. Additional studies were also\nperformed on NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. NIH 3T3 cells were\nexposed to either Staphylococcus or Salmonella as described\nabove and monitored for CD40 mRNA expression. Unlike\nosteoblasts, these conventional fibroblasts did not express\nCD40 mRNA either constitutively or upon exposure to bacte-\nria (data not shown).\n\nImmunocytochemical staining of cultured osteoblasts to de-\ntect CD40 protein following infection. To determine if in-\ncreased mRNA expression translated into CD40 protein ex-\npression, immunocytochemical analyses were performed. The\n\nrepresentative micrographs for mouse osteoblasts (Fig. 3, top\npanels) clearly demonstrate an increase in CD40 immunostain-\ning in Salmonella-infected (panel B) and Staphylococcus-in-\nfected (panel C) mouse osteoblasts, compared to uninfected\nosteoblasts (panel A). Importantly, immunocytochemical\nstaining of duplicate cultures using an isotype-matched control\nmonoclonal antibody showed no such reactivity (panels D, E,\n\nFIG. 1. CD40 mRNA expression is upregulated in cultured mouse\nosteoblasts following infection with Salmonella, S. aureus, or LPS, but\nnot peptidoglycan. (A) Mouse osteoblast cultures were exposed to\nvarious numbers of bacteria. The ratios of Salmonella or S. aureus cells\nto osteoblasts used for exposure in these studies were 30:1, 10:1, and\n3:1 or 250:1, 75:1, and 25:1, respectively. At 6 h postinfection, RT-PCR\nanalysis was performed to detect expression of CD40 mRNA. These\nstudies were performed three times with similar results. (B) To inves-\ntigate the kinetics of the response, RNA was isolated at the indicated\ntimes after exposure (0, 2, 4, and 6 h) to S. aureus (75:1) and RT-PCR\nwas performed. This study was performed twice with similar results.\n(C) Similarly, RNA was isolated at the indicated times after exposure\n(0, 2, 4, and 6 h) to Salmonella (3:1) and RT-PCR was performed. This\nstudy was performed twice with similar results. (D) Mouse osteoblasts\nwere exposed to either LPS or peptidoglycan (PGN) (1,000, 100, or 10\nng/ml) for 6 h and RT-PCR was performed to detect CD40 mRNA\nexpression. All results are presented as amplified PCR fragments elec-\ntrophoresed on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels. RT-PCR am-\nplification of the housekeeping gene, G3PDH, was performed for\nnormalization.\n\nVOL. 71, 2003 CD40 EXPRESSION BY BACTERIALLY INFECTED OSTEOBLASTS 1211\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\n\n\nand F). Similar results were obtained when immunocytochem-\nical analyses were performed on cultures of uninfected and\nbacterially infected human osteoblasts (bottom panels). West-\nern blot analysis also showed an increase in CD40 protein\nexpression in mouse osteoblasts exposed to either Staphylococ-\ncus or Salmonella (data not shown).\n\nQuantification of the percentage of cultured osteoblasts ex-\npressing CD40 by using FACS analyses. To determine the\npercentage of osteoblasts that expressed CD40, FACS analyses\nwere performed using mouse and human osteoblasts exposed\nto bacteria. FACS analysis (Fig. 4A) showed an increase in the\npercentage of CD40-positive mouse osteoblasts following ex-\nposure to Staphylococcus (52% positive cells) or to Salmonella\n(66% positive cells) compared to the uninfected osteoblasts\n(19% positive cells).\n\nSimilar results were obtained when FACS analyses were\nperformed on human osteoblasts exposed to bacteria. An in-\ncrease in the percentage of CD40-positive human osteoblasts\nwas observed (Fig. 4B) following exposure to Staphylococcus\n(20% positive cells) or to Salmonella (30% positive cells) com-\npared to uninfected osteoblasts (12%) (Fig. 4B).\n\nCytokine secretion following ligation of CD40 on mouse or\nhuman osteoblasts. Increased CD40 expression suggested that\nthis molecule might be capable of signaling osteoblast respons-\nes; therefore, studies were performed to demonstrate the func-\ntionality of CD40 present on these cells. Mouse osteoblasts\nwere exposed to Staphylococcus or Salmonella, with the intent\nof increasing expression of CD40 in the cultures exposed to\nthese bacteria. As expected (6), bacterial infection by itself was\na potent stimulus for inducing IL-6 secretion by these cells\n(Fig. 5A). Importantly, however, ligation of CD40 by soluble\ntrimeric CD154 significantly enhanced IL-6 secretion by bac-\nterially infected osteoblasts (Fig. 5A). These results clearly\ndemonstrate CD40-mediated augmentation of the osteoblast\nresponse to these bacterial pathogens. Interestingly, soluble\ntrimeric CD154 had little effect on the ability of uninfected\nosteoblasts to induce IL-6 secretion (Fig. 5A), suggesting that\nbacterial infection contributed in some manner to CD40-me-\ndiated responsiveness.\n\nLigation of CD40 also resulted in increased cytokine secre-\ntion from bacterially infected human osteoblasts (Fig. 5B and\n\nC). In the presence of the CD40 agonist, CD154/TRAP, Sal-\nmonella-infected osteoblasts had increased levels of IL-6 that\nwere significantly above that of infected osteoblasts alone (Fig.\n5B). Furthermore, in the presence of CD154/TRAP, GM-CSF\nsecretion was significantly increased over that observed in Sal-\nmonella-infected cultures alone (Fig. 5C). Together, these re-\nsults clearly demonstrate that mouse and human osteoblasts\ncan express functional CD40 molecules.\n\nAnti-CD40 antibody limits MIP-1� secretion in mixed cul-\ntures of osteoblasts and mitogen-activated CD4� T lympho-\ncytes. When mitogen-activated CD4� T lymphocytes are cocul-\ntured with mouse osteoblasts, a variety of cytokines and\nchemokines are secreted (our unpublished observations). The\ninteractions between osteoblasts and T lymphocytes responsi-\nble for this observation are not clear. However, since osteo-\nblasts can express functional CD40, interaction with CD154 on\nactivated T lymphocytes might represent one such mechanism.\nTo begin to address this possibility, cocultures of mouse osteo-\nblasts and mitogen-activated CD4� T lymphocytes were estab-\nlished in the presence of an antagonistic antibody against\nCD40. Figure 6 shows one representative experiment demon-\nstrating a limited secretion of MIP-1� by activated CD4� T\nlymphocytes alone or by osteoblasts alone. However, when\ncocultures of these two cell populations were established, sig-\nnificant levels of MIP-1� were present in supernates. Impor-\ntantly, addition of an anti-CD40 antibody, which is known to\nantagonize CD40-CD154 interactions, blocked a significant\nportion of MIP-1� secretion. An isotype-matched control an-\ntibody was unable to block secretion. However, it should be\nnoted that although CD40 antagonistic antibody significantly\nblocked MIP-1� secretion, secretion was not completely\nblocked. This suggests that the addition of the CD40 antago-\nnistic resulted in an incomplete block or only partial antago-\nnistic activity, or that some other soluble factors or interactions\nmay be involved in the initiation of the immune response in\ninfected osteoblasts. These results are consistent with the no-\ntion that osteoblasts and activated T lymphocytes can interact\nvia CD40 and CD154 to augment MIP-1� secretion.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nStrong support for the importance of CD40-CD154 interac-\ntions in the immune response against bacterial infections\ncomes from clinical observations and from studies using exper-\nimental animal models. Patients with hyper-IgM syndrome do\nnot express functional CD154, and they not only develop in-\nfections to encapsulated bacteria due to ineffective antibody\nproduction but are also susceptible to the intracellular patho-\ngens Pneumocystis carinii (45) and Cryptosporidium parvum\n(27). In support of these clinical observations, mice genetically\ndeficient in CD154 expression have limited T-lymphocyte-de-\npendent macrophage-mediated immune responses (52), and in\nparticular have limited cellular immune responses to the intra-\ncellular pathogens Leishmania major (9) and Leishmania ama-\nzonensis (49). Furthermore, genetic disruption of CD40 or\nCD154 expression in mice results in the inability of these\nanimals to clear C. parvum (14). Studies have demonstrated a\nprotective role for ligation of CD40 during mycobacterial in-\nfections (30). In addition, CD40 interactions were required for\nan antibody response against gram-positive Streptococcus (66).\nFurther, our laboratory has provided evidence for a significant\n\nFIG. 2. CD40 mRNA expression is upregulated in cultured human\nosteoblasts following infection with Salmonella or S. aureus. Human\nosteoblast cultures were exposed to various numbers of bacteria.

To demonstrate the functionality of\nCD40 ligation, we focused on the secretion of two cytokines,\nIL-6 and GM-CSF, that are know to be secreted by osteoblasts\n(4) and that are known to be induced in other cell populations\nfollowing ligation of CD40 (28). It should be noted that these\ntwo cytokines were not the only ones induced by CD40 ligation\n(data not shown), but they serve to demonstrate the function-\nality of CD40 expression in these studies. However, the fact\nthat CD40-mediated signaling in osteoblasts resulted in cyto-\nkine secretion may have important implications for the protec-\ntive host response, as well as bone resorption that often ac-\ncompanies bone infections. IL-6 (2, 29, 35) and GM-CSF (20)\nare important mediators of the protective immune response\nagainst bacterial pathogens. Therefore, if osteoblasts can be\nactivated to secrete such mediators during bone infections, this\ncould be a significant source of cytokine production to drive\nthe local inflammatory response. Conversely, IL-6 (16, 33) and\nGM-CSF (43) can also contribute to osteoclastogenesis, which\nultimately leads to bone resorption. Since bone infections are\noften accompanied by loss of bone at the site of infection (24,\n64), it is possible that osteoblast-derived cytokines might exac-\nerbate activation of surrounding osteoclasts. The fact that\nfunctional CD40 molecules are present on infected osteoblasts\nsuggests a likely mechanism for osteoblast-induced cytokine\nsecretion.\n\nT lymphocytes infiltrate sites of bone infection (7, 50), and it\nis tempting to speculate that ligation of induced CD40 on\nosteoblasts by infiltrating T lymphocytes can contribute to the\nhost response against bacterial pathogens.

Cultured mouse (A) or\nhuman (B) osteoblasts were uninfected or exposed to S. aureus (75:1)\nor Salmonella (3:1). At 24 h postinfection, cells were removed from\nflasks and stained with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse CD40 or with\nFITC-conjugated anti-human CD40, respectively. Duplicate cell prep-\narations were also stained using identical concentrations of isotype-\nmatched control antibodies. Cells (10,000/sample) were analyzed by\nFACS analysis. Histographs show the percentage of CD40-positive\nosteoblasts determined by comparison to cells stained in an identical\nmanner with the appropriate control antibody. These studies were\nperformed twice with similar results.\n\nFIG. 5. Cytokine secretion following ligation of CD40 on osteo-\nblasts.

Human osteoblasts (B and C) were\nuninfected or infected by exposing cells to Salmonella to upregulate\nCD40 expression. Following infection, cells were treated with soluble\nCD154/TRAP fusion protein, and supernates were collected 24 h later.\nCapture ELISAs were performed to quantify human IL-6 (B) and\nhuman GM-CSF (C) secretion.

Recent studies have focused on the positive contribu-\ntion that T lymphocytes can have on bone resorption (39, 54,\n57, 60) and in stimulating osteoclastogenesis (55). Conversely,\nsome studies have suggested that activated T lymphocytes can\nstimulate bone formation (31). In view of the results presented\nhere, T-lymphocyte-mediated ligation of CD40 expressed by\nosteoblasts is one additional mechanism that should be ex-\nplored as a possible cause for bone gain or loss during infection\nwith bacterial pathogens.\n\nWhile much attention has been given to CD154 expression\nby T lymphocytes, it is now clear that cells from other lineages\nexpress, or can be induced to express, this molecule. In partic-\nular, a variety of leukocytes, including cells of myeloid lineage\n(1, 22), can express CD154. Since osteoclasts are derived from\nmyeloid precursors (47, 56), it would be important to deter-\nmine if these cells could express CD154 during bone disease. If\nso, such osteoclasts would be in close proximity to ligate CD40\nexpressed by osteoblasts.\n\nThe recent realization that osteoblasts can express a variety\nof molecules capable of modulating the immune response sug-\ngests that these cells may have an unappreciated role in the\nhost response, especially during infections of bone. Reports in\nthe literature have demonstrated that osteoblasts have the\npotential to secrete certain cytokines and chemokines. A re-\nview of the literature includes the secretion of the proinflam-\nmatory cytokines IL-1 (38), IL-6 (6, 33, 38), tumor necrosis\nfactor alpha (23), IL-12 (6), and IL-18 (59). Osteoblasts can\nalso secrete the colony-stimulating factors GM-CSF (4, 42),\nG-CSF (4, 53), and M-CSF (4, 63), as well as the chemokines\nmonocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (5, 65), MIP (36), and\n\nIL-8 (11). Interestingly, these cells have also been shown to\nsecrete transforming growth factor \t1 (46), which can be an-\ntiinflammatory. The present study demonstrates that osteo-\nblasts can also be induced to express CD40 in response to a\nbacterial infection. Taken together, these studies suggest that\nactivated osteoblasts are not passive participants in the host\nresponse to infection, but rather have the potential to respond\nto such pathogens. In particular, the abilities of osteoblasts to\nexpress cytokines like IL-12 and IL-18 and to express CD40\nsuggest that these cells may be able to provide signals for\nT-lymphocyte activation or to receive stimulation from infil-\ntrating T lymphocytes.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants\nAR47585, GM58042, and AR47585.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
