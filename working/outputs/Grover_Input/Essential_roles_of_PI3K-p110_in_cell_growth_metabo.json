Recent studies have demonstrated specific roles for p110α in growth factor\nand insulin signaling6–8. To probe for distinct functions of p110β, we constructed conditional\nknockout mice. Ablation of p110β in the livers of the resulting mice led to impaired insulin sensitivity\nand glucose homeostasis, while having little effect on Akt-phosphorylation, suggesting involvement\nof a kinase-independent role of p110β in insulin metabolic action. Using established mouse\nembryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), we found that removal of p110β also had little effect on Akt-\nphosphorylation in response to insulin and EGF stimulation, but resulted in retarded cell proliferation.\nReconstitution of p110β-null cells with a wild-type or kinase-dead allele of p110β demonstrated that\np110β possesses kinase-independent functions in regulating cell proliferation and trafficking.\nHowever, the kinase activity of p110β was required for LPA triggered GPCR signalling and played\na role in oncogenic transformation. Most strikingly, in an animal model of prostate tumor formation\ninduced by PTEN loss, ablation of p110β, but not p110α, impeded tumorigenesis with concomitant\ndiminution of Akt-phosphorylation. Taken together our findings demonstrate both kinase-dependent\nand -independent functions for p110β, and strongly point to the kinase-dependent functions of\np110β as a promising target in cancer therapy.\n\nClass IA PI3Ks are heterodimeric lipid kinases consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit\ncomplexed to one of several regulatory subunits, collectively called p854, 5.

The lipid second messenger PIP3 in turn activates\nthe serine/threonine kinase Akt and other downstream effectors 9, 10. Knockout mice for either\np110α or p110β die early in embryonic development11, 12. However, recent studies using\nconditional knockout strategies8 and via isoform-specific small molecule inhibitors7\ndemonstrated that p110α plays an important role in growth factor signalling, while a kinase-\ninactive knockin mouse model showed that insulin responses depended on the catalytic activity\nof p110α6.\n\nTo investigate the role(s) of p110β in cell, tissue and organismal physiology and to examine\nit as a potential therapeutic target in cancer, we generated mice carrying a conditional\nPIK3CB allele (Supplementary Fig. 1). We first investigated the role of p110β in insulin action.\nSince liver is the major insulin responsive organ, we examined the effects of p110β loss on\nhepatic insulin function. To achieve liver-specific deletion of p110β, we injected the tail veins\nof p110βflox/flox mice with adenoviruses expressing β-galactosidase (Ade-LacZ) or Cre\nrecombinase (Ade-Cre) to generate matched cohorts of control mice and mice with hepatocyte-\nspecific deletion of p110β. Additional cohorts of wildtype animals were subjected to Ade-Cre\nor Ade –LacZ, allowing us to rule out potential non-specific Cre effects (data not shown).\nGreater than 90% reduction of p110β protein was seen in the livers of Ade-Cre injected mice,\nwhile p110β expression remained unchanged in the livers of the control mice and muscle tissues\nfrom both groups as measured by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 2a and b). Consistent\nwith previous findings6, 7 that the kinase activity of p110β plays only a minor role in insulin\nsignaling, we saw no significant change in Akt-phosphorylation in response to insulin\nchallenge in livers lacking p110β (Supplementary Fig. 2a). However, mice deficient in hepatic\np110β displayed higher blood insulin levels than control animals when fasted (Fig. 1a). These\nanimals also exhibited reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity upon challenge by\nintraperitoneal injection of glucose or insulin (Fig. 1b and c). Mice deficient in hepatic\np110β produced more glucose than control animals in a pyruvate challenge test (Fig. 1d). An\nanalysis of lipogenesis showed no significant changes in serum triglycerides, fatty acids and\ncholesterol levels when p110β was deleted from liver (Supplementary Fig. 3), but leptin levels\nwere elevated compared with control animals, as was seen in p110α kinase-dead knockin\nanimals 6 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Of a panel of gluconeogenic genes, only\nphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) was increased in p110β deficient livers\n(Supplementary Fig. 4). PEPCK promotes glucose production and synthesis in liver, resulting\nin more glucose release into blood. Therefore, this data provides at least a partial explanation\nfor the metabolic phenotypes observed. While these findings suggest that p110β might\ncontribute to metabolic regulation via a kinase-independent mechanism, we cannot rule out\nthe involvement of p110β’s catalytic role in insulin responses. Our observations are in line\nwith the earlier work by Knight et al7, who used a p110β-specific small molecule inhibitor to\ndemonstrate that acute blockage of p110β’s kinase activity had little effect on insulin action.\nIn addition, the Cantley lab found that mice doubly heterozygous for knockout of p110α and\np110β showed reduced insulin sensitivity with no apparent changes in Akt-\nphosphorylation13.\n\nTo obtain cells for detailed signalling studies, MEFs were isolated from floxed embryos and\ntheir wild-type littermates, as described in the supplementary information (Supplementary Fig.\n5a, b and c). MEFs lacking p110β proliferated significantly slower than parental\n(p110βflox/flox) or wild-type (p110β+/+ after Cre) MEFs (Fig. 2a). To obtain a second, more\neasily renewed supply of knockout cells, we established immortalized p110βflox/flox and\np110β+/+ MEFs via infection with a retrovirus encoding a dominant negative form of p53\n(DNp53)14. We also generated an add-back line by introducing HA-tagged human p110β to\nDNp53-immortalized p110βflox/flox MEFs. These immortalized MEFs were then treated with\nAde-Cre to yield the following MEF lines: βKO (from p110βflox/flox) and βKO+β (from the\nadd-back). For wild-type control MEFs, designated WT in the figures, we used DNp53-\n\nJia et al. Page 2\n\nNature.

Deletion of p110β had no obvious negative effect on the Akt-\nphosphorylation in either primary MEFs or DNp53-immortalized MEFs in response to insulin,\nEGF and PDGF stimulation (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 6a,b and c). However, a moderate\ndiminution on the phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP) at Ser235/236 was\ndetected in these βKO cells in response to insulin or serum (Supplementary Fig. 7). Previous\nstudies have implicated p110β in signalling elicited by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs)\n15, 16. Consistently, we found that both phospho-Akt and phospho-S6RP levels were reduced\nin response to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) in cells lacking p110β (Fig. 2d and Supplementary\nFig. 8a).\n\nTo dissect the potential kinase-dependent and -independent roles of p110β, we reconstituted\nβKO MEFs with a kinase-inactive allele of HA-tagged human p110β, using the previously\nreported K805R mutation (KR)17 to generate the βKO+KR MEF line. Though the KR\nexpression was lower than that of the WT add-back construct, it was expressed at a level slightly\nhigher than endogenous p110β, and expression levels of p110α were unchanged\n(Supplementary Fig.9a and data not shown). Loss of lipid kinase activity in the KR cells was\nconfirmed by lipid kinase assay8, 18 following anti-p110β immuno-precipitation\n(Supplementary Fig.9b). We then examined the effect of WT or KR add-back on the altered\nsignalling seen upon loss of p110β. The reduction in both phospho-Akt and phospho-S6RP in\nresponse to LPA stimulation observed in βKO cells was restored by adding back WT but not\nthe KR allele of p110β (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 8b), suggesting a catalytic function\nfor p110β in LPA signalling. This appears to be unique to p110β as p110α loss has no obvious\neffect on LPA signalling (Fig. 2e). Intriguingly, the reduced phospho-S6RP levels in βKO cells\nwere restored by both WT and KR add-backs in response to insulin or FBS (Supplementary\nFig. 7 and data not shown), suggesting a scaffolding role of p110β in insulin and growth factor\nsignalling. However, our MEF data does not rule out a role for p110β in classical PI3K\nsignalling in other circumstances. For instance, when we ablated p110α in our earlier work,\nresidual Akt-phosphorylation was observed in response to growth factors8. Since MEFs\nexpress p110α and p110β and not other Class I PI3Ks, this residual signal was presumably\ntransduced by p110β. We also note that p110β ablation removes it as a competitor for p110α\non receptors, which may allow any reduction in signalling caused by p110β loss to be masked\nor compensated by increased signal flux via p110α.\n\nTo test the kinase-dependent and/or -independent effects of p110β on cell proliferation, we\nstudied cell cycle kinetics by first synchronizing cells by serum starvation and then measuring\nthe proportion of cells in S-phase with BrdU incorporation following re-feeding. While βKO\ncells had a delayed peak of BrdU incorporation, KR reconstituted cells showed similar BrdU\nincorporation to that of WT and βKO+ β cells (Fig. 2f). Consistently, βKO+KR MEFs showed\nproliferation rates similar to WT and βKO+β cells (Supplementary Fig. 9c), suggesting a\nkinase-independent role of p110β in cell proliferation.\n\nSince previous studies have found p110β associated with members of the Rab family of small\nG proteins and clathrin coated vesicles19, we measured transferrin uptake in βKO MEFs and\nfound it to be defective compared to WT and βKO+ β MEFs (Fig. 2g). Interestingly, normal\ntransferrin uptake was restored by the KR construct (Fig. 2g). While there is ample literature\nevidence pointing to the importance of transferrin uptake for the growth of a variety of cell\ntypes20, it is not clear whether the transferrin uptake defect is a primary cause of the growth\ndefect observed here.\n\nClass IA PI3Ks have been clearly implicated in cancer21–24, with much recent work delineating\nthe role of p110α in cancer25–27. To study a potential role of p110β in oncogenic\n\nJia et al. Page 3\n\nNature.

Oncogenic HRas-G12V\nand EGFR-Del (ΔL747-E749, A750P) efficiently raised foci in WT cells, but failed to\ntransform βKO MEFs (Fig. 3a). The decreases in foci seen in βKO MEFs were actually more\npronounced than those seen in p110α KO MEFS (Supplementary Fig. 10). Notably,\ntransformation was fully restored in βKO+β cells but partially restored in βKO+KR cells (Fig.\n3a), suggesting that both the kinase activity and kinase-independent functions of p110β may\nplay a role in oncogene-induced transformation.\n\nPTEN, a lipid phosphatase, functions to oppose class IA PI3K kinase activity. Loss of PTEN\nexpression is a common event in many solid tumors28. The key challenge is to identify which\np110 isoform’s catalytic activity is unshackled by PTEN loss in any given tumor. To test for\na role of p110β in tumorigenesis driven by PTEN loss, we generated mice that carried the\nPTENflox/flox29 and p110βflox/flox alleles, as well as a probasin-driven Cre transgene30, to\nspecifically delete PTEN and p110β in prostatic epithelium. Prostates appeared normal in the\nabsence of p110β (Fig. 3b and c). Prostate tissue lacking PTEN expression displayed universal\nhigh-grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) in the anterior lobe by 12 weeks.\nRemarkably, ablation of p110β blocked tumorigenesis caused by PTEN loss in the anterior\nprostate (Table 1; Fig. 3b and c). The loss of PTEN was confirmed by genomic DNA analysis\nfollowing laser-capture assisted microdissection of single epithelial layers and by western\nblotting (Supplementary Fig. 11 and data not shown). While Cre-mediated loss of PTEN\nefficiently activated Akt in the prostate as judged by its phosphorylation on Ser473, additional\nablation of p110β diminished the phospho-Akt levels (Fig. 3b), suggesting that p110β catalytic\nactivity contributes to tumorigenesis. More surprisingly, when we performed the same set of\nexperiments using p110α ablation, we saw no changes either in tumor formation or in Akt-\nphosphorylation (Table 1; Figure 3b and c). Again, the complete excision of p110α in tumor\ntissues was confirmed by multiple measures (Supplementary Fig. 12 and data not shown). It\nhas been suggested that p110α and p110β generate distinct pools of PIP37. In response to insulin\nor other stimuli, an acute flux of PIP3 is produced largely by p110α and is efficiently coupled\nto Akt-phosphorylation. In contrast, p110β has been proposed to generate a basal level of PIP3\nwith little effect on Akt-phosphorylation7. The Shokat lab showed that Akt-phophorylation\ninduced by PTEN loss in vitro was sensitive to p110β-specific inhibitors7. We propose that it\nis this basal PIP3 signal that has been enhanced to drive transformation and Akt activation by\nPTEN loss in the murine prostate (Figure 3d). Alternatively, the differential effects of p110α\nand p110β ablation may arise because the signal activating PI3K is generated by a yet\nunidentified GPCR or a receptor tyrosine kinase that functions via p110β.\n\nIn summary, our data, together with an independent report from Dr. Hirsch’s group, suggest\ndistinct functions for p110β and p110α. We have demonstrated that p110β plays an important\nphysiological role in metabolic regulation and glucose homeostasis perhaps involving a kinase-\nindependent mechanism. A kinase-independent function of p110β was further suggested in\ncontrolling cell proliferation and trafficking in p110β KO MEFs and MEFs reconstituted with\na WT or kinase-dead allele of p110β. It would clearly be a mistake to overlook the contributions\nof p110β as a kinase. The basal PIP3 pool catalyzed by p110β appears to be “silent” in response\nto insulin and other growth factor stimulation, but becomes a “powerhouse” to drive oncogenic\ntransformation in the absence of PTEN as evident in our mouse prostate tumor model. Taken\ntogether, our findings indicate that p110β may be an attractive target for kinase inhibitors in\ncancer treatment with minor metabolic disturbances.\n\nMETHODS SUMMARY\nMice carrying floxed p110β (generated in this work), floxed p110α8, floxed PTEN29 (H. Wu,\nUCLA) and probasin-driven Cre transgene30 (MMHCC, NCI) were used is this study. All\n\nJia et al. Page 4\n\nNature.

MEFs generation, culture and immortalization, growth factor signalling study,\nretroviral infection, cell growth, cell cycle, lipid kinase assay, transferrin internalization, focus\nformation, glucose tolerance testing, insulin tolerance tests, pyruvate challenge,\nimmunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, immunohistochemical and histological analyses were\nperformed according to standard or published protocols. Statistical analyses were performed\nusing Student’s t test unless indicated otherwise. Full Methods and associated references are\navailable online in the full-text HTML and PDF versions.\n\nMETHODS\nMice, mice for metabolic and tumor studies\n\nConditional knockout mice of p110β were generated using the Cre-LoxP system. Briefly, the\ntargeting construct was assembled by isolating a 7.5-kb genomic fragment of PIK3CB from\n129SvEv mouse strain and inserting two LoxP sites to flank the exon 2 of PIK3CB. The\ntargeting construct was electroporated into embryonic stem (ES) cells of 129SvEv mouse. ES\nclones carrying floxed PIK3CB were injected into the blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice. Male\nchimeras were bred to C57BL/6 females to establish germ-line transmission of the conditional\nallele. The resulting heterozygous line (p110βflox/+) was intercrossed to yield a homozygous\nline (p110βflox/flox).\n\nFor metabolic studies, 8–10 week old male p110βflox/flox littermates were tail vein injected\nwith 75ul of adenovirus CMV-lacZ and CMV-cre (titer between 1–4 × 1010 pfu/ml, University\nof Iowa Gene Transfer Vector Core, Iowa City, IA). Two weeks after adenoviruses injection,\nglucose tolerance test, insulin tolerance test, pyruvate challenge, and in vivo insulin signalling\nwere performed as previously described31. Blood glucose values were determined using an\nAccu-Chek AVIVA glucose monitor (Roche). Serum insulin and leptin (Crystal Chem Inc.),\nserum free fatty acids and triglycerides (Wako USA), as well as serum cholesterol (Thermo)\nwere measured by ELISA according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\nFor prostate tumor studies, female PTENflox/flox, p110αflox/flox or p110βflox/flox mice were\ncrossed with male carrying PbCre4 transgene for the prostate-specific deletion of PTEN,\np110α, and/or p110β. Details are available from the authors. Anterior prostates were isolated\nfrom male mice at 12 weeks old, and subject to gross inspection, histology and\nimmunohistochemical analysis.\n\nPrimary and Immortalized Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)\nMEFs were prepared from embryos derived from intercrossing p110βflox/+ heterozygotes at\nembryonic day 13.5 post-fertilization. Primary WT or floxed MEFs, and p53DD immortalized\nWT or floxed MEFs were treated with Ade-Cre to generate WT control and p110β-null (βKO)\ncells. Additional control cells used in our study were floxd MEFs without Ade-Cre treatment.\nβKO+β and βKO+KR lines were generated by introducing either HA-tagged WT human\np110β or a kinase-inactive mutant K805R into βKO MEFs and then treated with Ade-Cre.\nGenotyping of MEFs was done by PCR using primer sets: LLF with LLR and SLF with LLR\n(Supplemental Figure 1).\n\nGrowth Factors and Western blotting\nCells were starved either for 2 hours or overnight followed by stimulation with insulin (2.5 µg/\nml or various concentrations as indicated in Supplemental Figure, Sigma I2767), EGF (10 ng/\nml, Sigma E9644), IGF1 (5 ng/ml, Upstate 01–208), LPA (10 µM, Sigma L7260) or 10% FBS\nfor various periods as indicated in corresponding figures. Western blot assays were performed\n\nJia et al. Page 5\n\nNature.

Immuno-fluorescent labeled anti-\nmouse IgG (#610-132-003, Rockland Immunochemicals) and anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular\nProbes) were used to visualize Western blots on an Odyssey scanner. The quantification of\nWestern was done with Odyssey software version 2.0.\n\nGrowth Curves\nMEFs were seeded in 12-well tissue culture plates and stained with crystal violet at each\nindicated time points. The dye was extracted with 10% acetic acid followed by plate reading\nat 590 nm. The values were normalized to the absorbance at day 0. Data shown are the average\nof at least two independent experiments.\n\nCell Cycle Analysis\nCells were synchronized by starvation in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS for 48 hours\nbefore released into the cell cycle by stimulation with 10% FBS. Cells were pulse-labeled with\nBrdU at each indicated time point and analyzed according to manufactor’s protocol (BD\nBiosciences).\n\nFocus Formation Assays\nMEFs at 40–50% confluence were infected with various retroviruses: pBabe-Vector, pBabe-\nHRas-G12V, or pBabe-EGFR-Del (DL747_E749, A750P) and then cultured for 14 to 21 days\nfor WT, βKO+β and βKO+KR cells, but 30 to 40 days for βKO cells. Confluent monolayers\nwith foci were fixed in ethanol and stained with crystal violet.\n\nHistology and Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nProstate tissues were processed and stained as previously described32. Primary antibody used\nin IHC was directed against phospho-Akt (Ser 473) (#3738, Cell Signaling).\n\nLipid Kinase Assays\nIn vitro lipid kinase assays were carried out as previously described8,18. Briefly, anti-p110β\n(Santa Cruz) immunoprecipitates from freshly prepared cell lysates were subjected to an in\nvitro lipid kinase assay using phosphatidylinositol (PI; Avanti Polar Lipids) as the substrate.\nThe phosphorylated lipids were resolved by a thin layer chromatography (TLC) and visualized\nby autoradiography and quantified using Adobe Photoshop.\n\nTransferrin Internalization Assays\nCells were seeded on 10% Poly-L-lysine coated cover slips and grown in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS overnight. The assay was performed as previously described33 with Alexa\nFluor555-conjugated human transferrin (Invitrogen), counter-stained with DAPI (1 µg/ml)\n(Sigma), and mounted with mounting media (Fisher Scientific). Cells were visualized with a\nZeiss confocal microscope LSM510META/NLO at 63× magnification and images were\ncaptured by Zeiss confocal microscope software 3.2.\n\nLaser Capture Microdissection and DNA Extraction\nLaser capture microdissection was done as previously described34. Genomic DNA of\nmicrodissected prostate epithelium was extracted with phenol-chloroform prior to PCR\nanalysis.\n\nJia et al. Page 6\n\nNature.
