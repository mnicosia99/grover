In a previous study, it was\ndemonstrated that EHEC-induced IL-8 secretion is due to the involvement of the mitogen-activated protein\nkinase (MAPK), AP-1, and NF-�B pathways. In this study, we investigated the effect of the yeast Saccharomyces\nboulardii on EHEC infection in T84 cells. For this purpose, cells were (i) incubated with bacteria and yeast at\nthe same time or (ii) incubated overnight with yeast cells that were maintained during infection or eliminated\nby several washes before infection. Coincubation is sufficient to maintain the transmonolayer electrical\nresistance (TER) of EHEC-infected cells, whereas the preincubation of cells with the yeast without elimination\nof the yeast during infection is necessary to significantly decrease IL-8 secretion. We thus analyzed the\nmechanisms of S. boulardii action. We showed that S. boulardii has no effect on EHEC growth or on EHEC\nadhesion. Kinetics studies revealed that EHEC-induced myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation precedes\nthe decrease of TER. ML-7, an MLC kinase inhibitor, abolishes the EHEC-induced MLC phosphorylation and\ndecrease of TER. Studies show that S. boulardii also abolishes EHEC-induced MLC phosphorylation. We\ndemonstrated that the preincubation of cells with S. boulardii without washes before EHEC infection inhibits\nNF-�B DNA binding activity, phosphorylation and degradation of I�B-�, and activation of the three members\nof a MAPK group (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, p38, and c-jun N-terminal kinase).\nThese findings demonstrate that S. boulardii exerts a preventive effect on EHEC infection by (i) interfering with\none of the transduction pathways implicated in the control of tight-junction structure and (ii) decreasing IL-8\nproinflammatory secretion via inhibition of the NF-�B and MAPK signaling pathways in infected T84 cells.\n\nThe enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC)-related bac-\nterium called enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) is a patho-\ngenic bacterium that causes acute gastroenteritis and hemor-\nrhagic colitis that may lead to severe complications, including\nhemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) (15). EHEC infection of\nintestinal cells triggers two major functional effects: inflamma-\ntion and disruption of barrier function.\n\nThe in vivo study done by Westerholt et al. (29) correlated\ninflammatory parameters in serum with a high risk of devel-\noping typical HUS during the prodromal phase of diarrhea,\ncaused by EHEC; low neopterin and interleukin-10 (IL-10)\nlevels and high IL-8 levels are indicators of a high risk for\ndeveloping HUS in EHEC-infected children. A previous study\n(6) linked this in vivo study and an in vitro model and dem-\nonstrated that EHEC could induce a potent proinflammatory\nresponse in vitro by IL-8 secretion in infected T84 cells. IL-8\nappears to be one of the major products secreted by infected\nepithelial cells (10). This proinflammatory and chemoattrac-\ntant cytokine can recruit the polymorphonuclear cells into the\ninfected site and promote their infiltration of the epithelial\nlayer infected by invasive or noninvasive bacteria (18, 28).\n\nIL-8 gene expression is regulated by several pathways. The\nIL-8 gene promoter region contains binding sequences for\n\nvarious transcription factors, including NF–IL-6, NF-�B, and\nAP-1 (20). Elewaut et al. (11) found that NF-�B is a central\nregulator of the epithelial-cell innate immune response to in-\nfection with enteroinvasive bacteria. Moreover, immune and\ninflammatory responses in the gut often involve the transcrip-\ntion factor NF-�B (22). In most cell types, NF-�B is inactive in\nthe cytoplasm through its binding to an inhibitory protein,\ncalled I�B, which masks the nuclear localization signal on\nNF-�B and thus prevents its nuclear translocation. The trans-\nlocation of NF-�B requires the phosphorylation of I�B-�; once\nphosphorylated, I�B-� is ubiquitinylated and then degraded by\nthe 26S subunit of the proteasome (2). AP-1 activation is\ndependent on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) that\nare central in many host responses, including the regulation of\ncytokine responses, stress responses, and cytoskeletal reorga-\nnization (7, 8). MAPK form a group of three pathways, includ-\ning those for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases\n(ERK1/2) and two stress-activated protein kinases named p38\nand c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Most eukaryotic surface\nreceptors use at least one of these highly conserved MAPK\ncascades for signaling inside the cell (26).\n\nIn a previous study, it was demonstrated that the EHEC\nability to elicit a proinflammatory response in infected T84\ncells was due to the involvement of the NF-�B, AP-1, and\nMAPK signaling pathways (6).\n\nEHEC infection can also alter intestinal permeability (25).\nStudies using T84 cells have demonstrated that increased my-\nosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation is implicated in the\n\n* Corresponding author.

Activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and in-\ncreased levels of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate and cytosolic free\ncalcium have been reported in EHEC-infected epithelial cells\n(23, 33). By using the specific inhibitor of PKC, the link be-\ntween PKC activation and the decrease of TER was demon-\nstrated in EHEC-infected T84 cells (25). The presence of\nML-9, an inhibitor of MLCK (27), inhibits EPEC-induced\nMLC phosphorylation and the TER decrease (33) and partially\nrestores TER in the case of EHEC infection (25). However,\nthe effect of EHEC infection on MLC phosphorylation has not\nbeen yet investigated.\n\nSaccharomyces boulardii is a thermophilic, nonpathogenic\nyeast administered in western Europe for the prevention and\ntreatment of a variety of diarrheal diseases (19). Recently, it\nwas reported that S. boulardii prevented the EPEC-induced\ndisruption of barrier function in T84 cells (5). In this study, we\nshow that the yeast decrease the EPEC-induced activation of\nthe ERK1/2 pathway. However, by the use of a pharmacolog-\nical inhibitor, inhibition of ERK1/2 does not prevent the\nEPEC-induced decrease of TER, though this pathway is im-\nplicated in EPEC-induced IL-8 secretion (4). We thus hypoth-\nesized that S. boulardii may be able to attenuate different\nsignaling pathways elicited by proinflammatory enteric patho-\ngens.\n\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of\nS. boulardii on the different signaling pathways induced in\nEHEC-infected T84 cells.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCell lines, media, and bacterial and yeast strains. The T84 human colonic cell\nline was obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures (Salis-\nbury, England). The T84 culture medium contained a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco-\nVogt modified Eagle medium and Ham’s F12 medium (DMEM/F12) supple-\nmented with 50 �g of penicillin/ml, 50 �g of streptomycin (Sigma, Saint Quentin\nFallavier, France)/ml, and 4% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Bezons, France).\nThe O157:H7 EHEC bacterial strain used in this study, EDL931, which produces\nShiga toxins 1 and 2 (14), was kindly provided by Institut Pasteur (Paris, France).\nBacteria were stored in Luria-Bertani medium plus 15% glycerol at �80°C and\ngrown in Luria broth overnight at 37°C without shaking. The yeast S. boulardii\n(Laboratoires Biocodex, Paris, France) was grown at 37°C, with shaking, in\nHalvorston minimal medium with 2% glucose.\n\nInhibitor. MLCK inhibitor ML-7 (Calbiochem, Meudon, France) was stored\nin 50% ethanol at 4°C.\n\nElectrical resistance measurements. T84 cells were grown on 4.6-cm2porous\nfilter membranes (0.4-mm pores; Nunc, Poly Labo Paul Block & Cie, Strasbourg,\nFrance). TER was measured with the Millicell-ERS apparatus purchased from\nMillipore (Molsheim, France). Under these conditions, high TER values\n(�1,000 � � cm2) were consistently obtained in monolayers 14 days postseeding.\n\nInfection procedure. Bacteria, grown overnight in Luria broth medium, were\npelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), and added to cells (100 bacteria/cell) with or without the presence of yeast\n(10 yeast organisms/cell). The yeast-to-bacterium ratio did not modify intestinal\ncell viability (5). For infection of filter-grown cells, bacteria and yeast were added\nto the apical compartment.\n\nIL-8 assay. IL-8 assays were performed at 70 to 90% confluence of T84\nmonolayers grown in 60-mm-diameter petri dishes. Prior to any treatment, cells\nwere washed and incubated for at least 2 h in serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM/\nF12 medium. After infection, the culture supernatants were centrifuged for 10\nmin at 10,000 � g to pellet residual bacteria. The IL-8 concentration was deter-\n\nmined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the Quantikine\nhuman IL-8 immunoassay (R&D System, Abington, United Kingdom).\n\nAdhesion and growth assays. T84 cells were seeded in six-well plates. At 70 to\n90% confluence, cells were washed and infected in 2.5 ml of serum- and antibi-\notic-free DMEM/F12 medium. Bacterial adhesion to T84 cells was quantified by\nthe plate dilution method as described previously (5). Briefly, bacteria present in\nthe culture medium were eliminated by extensive washes with sterile PBS. Cells\nwere then trypsinized and lysed in water containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin\n(Sigma). The cell lysates were serially diluted in sterile PBS and the appropriate\ndilution was plated in duplicate onto MacConkey sorbitol agar plates. After\novernight incubation at 37°C, the number of CFU was counted. For growth assay,\nthe culture supernatants were collected, and cells were lysed without the exten-\nsive washes with PBS. The cell lysates and the culture supernatants were then\npooled, for estimation of CFU.\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). T84 cells were seeded in six-well\nplates. At 70 to 90% confluence, cells were washed and infected in serum- and\nantibiotic-free DMEM-F12 medium. At the indicated times, the infected cells\nwere washed with PBS. AP-1 and NF-�B DNA binding activities were analyzed\nin total cleared cellular extracts prepared in totex buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH\n7.9], 350 mM NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1\nmM EGTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mg of\naprotinin/ml). Samples (10 �g) were incubated for 25 min at 25°C with a radio-\nlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the AP-1 site (5\t-TTCGTG\nACTCAGCGG-3\t) or the �B site (5\t-GATCCAAGGGGACTTTCCATG-3\t).\nThe specificity of the complexes was analyzed by incubation with an excess of\nunlabeled AP-1 or �B oligonucleotides. Complexes were separated by electro-\nphoresis on a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5� Tris-borate-EDTA.\nThe dried gels were autoradiographed (Amersham Hyperfilms, Orsay, France).\n\nWestern blotting. T84 cells were seeded in 100-mm-diameter petri tissue\nculture dishes. At 70 to 90% confluence, cells were depleted overnight in serum-\nand antibiotic-free DMEM-F12 medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum\nalbumin (Sigma). Infections were carried out in this medium. For phospho-MLC\ndetection, infections were performed on filter-grown cells. When indicated, cells\nwere pretreated for 1 h with ML-7 (5 �M) and then infected in the presence of\ninhibitor. At the indicated times, the infected cells were washed with PBS and\nscraped at 4°C in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1%\nNP-40, 2 mM Na3Vo4, 1 mM EDTA, 1 �M aprotinin, 25 �M leupeptin, 1 �M\npepstatin, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride, 10 mM NaF, 5 mM\nNaPPi, 10 mM \n-glycerophosphate). The lysate was sonicated and solubilized for\n30 min at 4°C and then centrifuged at 14,000 � g for 20 min at 4°C. The protein\nconcentration of the supernatant was determined by using Bio-Rad Detergent\nCompatible reagents.\n\nEqual amounts (50 �g) of whole-cell lysates were subjected to sodium dodecyl\nsulfate (SDS)–10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins were trans-\nferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham) and\nincubated overnight at 4°C with the anti-phospho-ERK1/2, anti-phospho-p38,\nanti-phospho-JNK, or anti-phospho-I�B-� antibodies (New England Biolabs);\nanti-ERK2, anti-p38, anti-JNK, or anti- I�B-� antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology, Santa Cruz, Calif.); or anti-phospho-MLC, followed by incubation with\nthe appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (New\nEngland Biolabs). The presence of antibodies was revealed with the enhanced\nchemiluminescence detection system (Amersham).\n\nStatistical analysis. Results are presented as the mean � the standard error of\nthe mean (SEM). Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance\nwith the StatView program for MacIntosh, followed by post hoc comparison with\nthe Bonferroni and Dunn tests.\n\nDensitometric analysis. The changes in signal or band intensity were quanti-\nfied by densitometric analysis by the National Institutes of Health Image pro-\ngram for MacIntosh. All experiments were repeated at least four times, and a\nrepresentative result is shown for each experiment.\n\nRESULTS\n\nS. boulardii prevents the EHEC-induced decrease of T84\nmonolayer resistance. To determine the effect of S. boulardii\non the EHEC-induced decrease in TER, T84 monolayers were\napically infected with EHEC strain EDL931 alone or in the\npresence of S. boulardii and TER was monitored over 12 h\n(Fig. 1). In a previous study, it was reported that over a 12-h\nincubation period, yeasts have no effect on TER (5). In EHEC-\ninfected cells, monolayer resistance was unchanged up until\n\nVOL. 71, 2003 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT OF S. BOULARDII 767\n\n\n\n6 h; at 9 and 12 h, it had dropped to 946 � 46 and 710 � 46\n� � cm2, respectively (P � 0.02 versus that for control mono-\nlayers). When infection was performed in the presence of S.\nboulardii, the TER remained at the level of uninfected mono-\nlayers up until 12 h of infection, indicating that the barrier\nfunction of infected cells was preserved in the presence of the\nyeast.\n\nS. boulardii effect on IL-8 release by infected T84 cells. A\nprevious study demonstrated that a 6-h EHEC infection leads\nto the production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-8 in T84\ncells (6). This study was conducted to investigate the effect of\nS. boulardii on IL-8 production. First, we tested the effect of S.\nboulardii alone on IL-8 production. For this purpose, T84 cells\nwere incubated for 6 h or overnight with the yeast cells and the\nIL-8 concentration was determined in culture supernatants by\nELISA. As shown in Fig. 2, columns 2 and 3, S. boulardii alone\ndid not induce significant IL-8 release (respectively, 9 � 0 and\n33 � 4 pg/ml versus 10 � 1 pg/ml in control cells). By contrast,\nas reported previously (6), a 6-h incubation with EHEC in-\nduced IL-8 production (1,205 � 74 versus 10 � 1 pg/ml in\nuninfected cells [column 4]). To examine the effect of S. bou-\nlardii on EHEC-infected T84 cells, cells were coincubated with\nbacteria and the yeast for 6 h. As shown in Fig. 2, column 5, S.\nboulardii did not induce a significant decrease in IL-8 secretion\n(723 � 88 pg/ml versus that for uninfected cells). Then, we\nstudied a putative preventive effect of S. boulardii by overnight\npreincubation of the yeast, followed by EHEC infection. When\nbacteria were added in the presence of the yeast (column 6), a\nsignificant decrease of IL-8 production was observed (212 � 31\nversus 10 � 1 pg/ml in control cells). However, if infection was\nperformed after the washout of yeast (column 7), the decrease\nof IL-8 secretion was no longer observed (1,545 � 64 pg/ml\nversus 10 � 1 pg/ml). We performed control studies with heat-\n\nkilled S. boulardii cells which showed no protective effect on\nIL-8 secretion induced by EHEC infection (data not shown).\n\nThese results demonstrate that S. boulardii exerts a preven-\ntive effect on the production of IL-8 during EHEC infection of\nT84 cells. In contrast to the results reported above on TER, to\nbe effective, the yeast should be added before infection and\npresent during the infection process.\n\nEffect of S. boulardii on bacterial growth. First, we hypoth-\nesized that S. boulardii modify the bacterial growth during\ninfection. For this purpose, T84 cells were infected with EHEC\nalone or in presence of yeast, and bacteria were counted by\nserial dilutions and plated onto MacConkey agar plates. The\ndata presented in Table 1 show that the growth of EHEC was\nnot affected by the presence of S. boulardii.\n\nEffect of S. boulardii on bacterial adhesion. As adhesion to\nintestinal cells is the first step in EHEC pathogenicity, we\ninvestigated if S. boulardii could modify the bacterial adhesion.\nFor this purpose, T84 cells were infected with EHEC alone or\nin the presence of yeast as described above for the growth\nassay. The data presented in Table 1 show that S. boulardii did\nnot change the number of adherent bacteria. Therefore, the\nanti-inflammatory effect of the yeast is not due to a slower\ngrowth of EHEC or to an impaired attachment of EHEC to\n\nFIG. 1. S. boulardii prevents the EHEC-induced decrease of TER\nin T84 cells.

We thus hypothesized that the yeast might modify\nthe host cell response to EHEC infection.\n\nS. boulardii alters EHEC-induced MLC phosphorylation.\nMLC phosphorylation has been implicated and correlated with\nthe decrease of TER in T84 cells infected by EPEC (33). In the\ncase of infection by EHEC, the use of ML-9, an MLCK inhib-\nitor, partially restores the decrease of TER (25). However, to\ndate, phosphorylation of MLC has not been demonstrated in\nEHEC-infected cells. For this purpose, we performed kinetics\nstudies to determine the time of appearance of the phosphor-\nylated form of MLC in EHEC-infected T84 cells. Western\nblotting with an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated\nform of MLC revealed that MLC was not phosphorylated in\nuninfected polarized T84 cells (control lane) or in cells during\nthe beginning (1 h) of infection (Fig. 3A). The phosphorylated\nform of MLC appeared after 3 h of infection and increased at\n6 h of infection. As shown in Fig. 3A, the presence of 5 �M\nML-7 totally prevented MLC phosphorylation. The blot was\nprobed with antibody recognizing the nonphosphorylated form\nof ERK2 to rule out a change between levels of whole-cell\nlysates. These data indicate that MLCK is implicated in the\nphosphorylation of MLC. We thus attempted to correlate\nMLC phosphorylation and the decrease in TER. TER was\nmeasured in cells infected in the presence of 5 �M ML-7. Data\nshown in Table 2 indicate that ML-7 abolishes the EHEC-\ninduced decrease of TER, thus implicating MLC phosphory-\nlation in the control of TER. Since MLC phosphorylation was\nimplicated in the TER decrease, we performed experiments to\ndetermine the effect of S. boulardii on MLC phosphorylation.\nData presented in Fig. 3B demonstrate that S. boulardii alone\ndid not induce phosphorylation of the protein. The presence of\nyeast during the infection abolished the phosphorylation of\nMLC early during the period of infection (3 h) as well as later\non, after 6 h of infection. These data indicate that the yeast can\nmodulate this signaling pathway implicated in tight-junction\ncontrol.\n\nEffect of S. boulardii on the NF-�B signaling pathway. A\nprevious study demonstrated that EHEC induces IL-8 secre-\ntion in infected T84 cells via activation of the NF-�B and\nMAPK pathways (6). To understand the mechanism involved\nin S. boulardii protection, we investigated the effect of S. bou-\nlardii on NF-�B activation induced by EHEC in infected T84\ncells. As shown in Fig. 4, S. boulardii alone did not induce the\n\nDNA binding of NF-�B in T84 cells (lanes 3 and 4). The\ncoincubation of EHEC with the yeast on cells (lane 6) and the\novernight preincubation of cells with yeast followed by washes\nbefore EHEC infection (lane 8) did not inhibit the NF-�B\n\nFIG. 3.

At various times of infection, cells\nwere lysed and samples were resolved by electrophoresis on an SDS–\n12.5% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-\nphospho-MLC antibody. The control lanes correspond to uninfected\ncells. Identical results were obtained at least three times. The changes\nin signal intensity were quantified by densitometric analysis.\n\nTABLE 1.

However, the overnight pre-\nincubation of cells with S. boulardii followed by EHEC infec-\ntion in the presence of yeast (lane 7) diminished the NF-�B\nDNA binding induced by EHEC (shown by densitometric anal-\nysis). Translocation of NF-�B requires the phosphorylation of\nI�B-� and subsequent degradation of I�B-� by the 26S pro-\nteasome (2). Phosphorylation of I�B-� was analyzed by West-\nern blotting with antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated\nform of I�B-�. As shown in Fig. 5A, phosphorylation of I�B-�\noccurs in the same conditions as NF-�B DNA binding and is\nalso inhibited by the overnight preincubation of cells with S.\nboulardii followed by the EHEC infection procedure in the\npresence of yeast. We next studied the degradation of I�B-� by\nWestern blotting with antibodies against its whole form (Fig.\n5B). The overnight preincubation with S. boulardii followed by\nEHEC infection in the presence of yeast decreased by 40% the\nI�B-� degradation in infected T84 cells.\n\nAltogether, these results demonstrated that the yeast S. bou-\nlardii abolished the NF-�B pathway activation induced by\nEHEC in T84 cells by interfering with I�B-� phosphorylation\nand degradation.\n\nEffect of S. boulardii on the MAPK pathway. A previous\nstudy showed that IL-8 secretion induced by EHEC also de-\npends on MAPK activation (6). Therefore, we performed\nWestern blot analysis with antibodies directed against the\nphosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (Fig. 6A), p38 (Fig. 6B), and\nJNK (Fig. 6C). Blots were probed with antibody recognizing\nthe nonphosphorylated form of ERK2, p38, and JNK to rule\nout a change between levels of whole-cell lysates and amounts\nof specific protein during the treatment procedure. The active\nforms of ERK1/2 (p42 and p44), p38, and JNK (p46 and p54)\nwere undetectable in control cells and in cells treated with S.\nboulardii alone. The coincubation of bacteria with the yeast on\ncells did not modify the activation of the three groups of\nMAPK. The preincubation of cells with the yeast followed by\ninfection in the presence of S. boulardii abolished the MAPK\nactivation. The preincubation of cells with the yeast followed\nby washes before bacterial infection partially inhibited the\nMAPK activation.\n\nAll these results demonstrated that the yeast S. boulardii\nprevents the MAPK activation induced by EHEC in T84 cells.\n\nFIG. 4.

IMMUN.\n\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nTo date, T84 cells have been used as a model to study the\nmechanism of EHEC infection for several reasons. These cells\nresemble human colonic epithelial cells, the target cells for\nEHEC infection in vivo (15). These cells do not express de-\ntectable levels of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), the receptor\nfor Stxs, and this model thus provides the opportunity to study\nprimarily the effects related solely to the bacteria (24). More-\nover, it has been reported in the literature that EHEC inter-\n\naction (but not the interaction of toxin) with the apical cell\nsurface induces a decrease in TER (24). In this study, we\ndemonstrated that S. boulardii prevents the decrease of TER in\nEHEC-infected T84 cells. Additionally, when cells were pre-\nincubated overnight with yeast and then infected in the pres-\nence of the yeast, S. boulardii decreased the IL-8 proinflam-\nmatory secretion induced by EHEC in infected T84 cells.\nAltogether, these results demonstrate that S. boulardii exerts a\nprotective effect against EHEC infection and prompted us to\nunderstand this protective mechanism. We first hypothesized\nthat S. boulardii could stop the bacterial growth. The growth\nassay showed that the presence of the yeast had no effect on\nEHEC viability. As EHEC is an enteroadherent bacterium and\nadhesion is an important step in this infection, our second\nhypothesis was that S. boulardii inhibits EHEC adhesion.\nEHEC adhesion to T84 cells was reported to be strain depen-\ndent and related to the amount of piliation (31). EHEC pili are\nthought to be type I pili that are mannose sensitive. The cell\nwall of S. boulardii is rich in mannose and can thus compete for\nthe EHEC adhesion site on enterocytes. The data presented in\nthis study demonstrate that the number of adherent bacteria\ndo not vary in the presence of the yeast. The fact that the yeast\ndid not modify the number of adherent bacteria can be ex-\nplained by the observation made by others (31) that mannose\ndecreases the adherence of some EHEC strains, has no effect\non other strains, and appears to increase the adherence of still\nothers.\n\nSince S. boulardii did not modify the number of adherent\nbacteria, we investigated the effect of the yeast on the next step\nin EHEC infection, i.e., induction of host cell signal transduc-\ntion pathways. In a previous study, the protective effect of S.\nboulardii on EPEC infection was demonstrated and it was\nreported that S. boulardii modulates the ERK1/2 signaling\npathway induced by EPEC infection in T84 cells (5).\n\nRegulation of tight-junction permeability occurs at many\nsites within epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of the 20-kDa\nMLC on the serine or threonine residue is an important de-\nterminant of contractile tension in both smooth muscle and\nnonmuscle cells (9, 30, 32). In this study, we demonstrated that\nEHEC infection induces time-dependent phosphorylation of\nMLC. Time course experiments demonstrated that this process\noccurs at 3 h of infection and precedes the drop in TER, which\nbegins at 6 h of infection. MLC phosphorylation has previously\nbeen reported after infection by EPEC (33). In that study, the\nauthors demonstrated a time-dependent process and corre-\nlated MLC phosphorylation with the decrease in TER. MLC\nmay be phosphorylated by either MLCK or PKC (23). The\ninvolvement of MLCK and PKC in the EHEC-induced de-\ncrease in the barrier function in T84 cells has previously been\nreported (25). In that study, the authors demonstrated that the\ninhibition of MLCK by ML-9 (20 �M) only partially blocked\nthe EHEC-induced decrease in TER. The data presented in\nthis report show that ML-7, a more potent inhibitor of MLCK,\nabolishes MLC phosphorylation and the decrease of TER in\nEHEC-infected T84 cells. S. boulardii abolishes both the\nEHEC-induced drop of TER and concomitant MLC phos-\nphorylation, confirming the important role played by MLC in\nthe regulation of tight-junction permeability in EHEC infec-\ntion.\n\nIn a recent study, by use of specific inhibitors of different\n\nFIG. 6. Effect of S. boulardii on MAPK activation induced in\nEHEC-infected T84 cells. T84 cells were lysed at different times after\ninfection. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by im-\nmunoblotting with an anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (A), an anti-phospho-p38\n(B), an anti-phospho-JNK (C), or an anti-ERK2 (D) antibody. The\ncontrol lane corresponds to uninfected T84 cells. A 15-min stimulation\nby epidermal growth factor (EGF), 10 nM was used as the positive\ncontrol. ON, overnight.\n\nVOL. 71, 2003 ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT OF S. BOULARDII 771\n\n\n\nsignaling pathways, i.e., the MEK1/2 MAPK kinase inhibitor\nU0126, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, and the NF-�B\ninhibitor ALLN, a basal level of IL-8 production in infected\ncells was restored (6). By this pharmacological approach, we\ndemonstrated that NF-�B and MAPK pathway activation is\ndirectly involved in IL-8 secretion by EHEC, i.e., in the potent\nproinflammatory response induced by EHEC infection.\n\nData presented in this report show that the coincubation of\ncells with S. boulardii and EHEC and preincubation of cells\nwith S. boulardii followed by washes before the infection pro-\ncedure had no effect on the NF-�B and MAPK pathway acti-\nvation induced by EHEC infection in T84 cells, whereas the\npreincubation of cells with S. boulardii followed by EHEC\ninfection in the presence of yeast inhibited NF-�B and MAPK\npathway activation. Inactivation of these pathways is correlated\nwith a S. boulardii-induced decrease of IL-8 production. In a\nprevious study, it was demonstrated that a 12-h yeast incuba-\ntion on T84 cells did not induce the cleavage of caspase 3,\nwhich allowed us to conclude that an overnight incubation with\nS. boulardii did not affect the T84 cell viability (5). We have\nshown that the yeast was required to be viable and must be\nmaintained during infection to exert protection.\n\nThese results prompted us to extrapolate several supposi-\ntions about S. boulardii’s mechanisms of action. Previous stud-\nies have demonstrated that S. boulardii secretes protease with\nactivities against Clostridium toxins (3). Such a protease may\nalso affect EHEC virulence factors, for example, surface-lo-\ncated intimin. However, data reported in this study show that\nS. boulardii cells do not modify the number of adherent bac-\nteria. For this reason, we studied cellular responses induced\nafter intimate bacterial adhesion. We thus think that S. bou-\nlardii does not “quench” the virulence factor but rather modify\nits expression. Transcriptional expression of the secreted pro-\ntein (EspA, EspB, and EspD) by environmental stimuli (i.e.,\nosmolarity) has been reported (1). Yeast can also act on\nEHEC protein synthesis involved in the type III secretion\nsystem, resulting in cellular rearrangement induction (12). Re-\ncently, the study of Kodama et al. (16) demonstrated that\nEspB, a bacterial-secreted protein, recruits �-catenin at the\nEHEC adherence site by direct interaction and that the re-\ncruitment of �-catenin is essential for EHEC-induced A/E\nlesion formation. The complex E-cadherin-catenin not only is\na cell-cell adhesion molecular complex and an actin-associated\ncomplex but also contributes to a variety of functions, including\nsignal transduction, inflammation, and immunological func-\ntions (13). This is the reason why the effect of S. boulardii on\nthe expression of EspB and other bacterial product will soon\nbe investigated by DNA array in our laboratory.\n\nThe second hypothesis relates to the study of Neish et al.\n(21) regarding the cellular events leading to immune re-\nsponses. In that report, nonvirulent Salmonella strains which\ninteracted directly with model human epithelia attenuated the\nsynthesis of the inflammatory effector molecules elicited by\ndiverse proinflammatory stimuli. This immunosuppressive ef-\nfect involves inhibition of the NF-�B pathway by blockade of\nI�B-� degradation. Our study demonstrates that S. boulardii\nexerts a preventive anti-inflammatory effect against pathogenic\nbacteria; this effect disappears when cells are washed before\nEHEC infection. Moreover, our findings reveal that the yeast\ncan interfere on different signaling pathways and, in particular,\n\non the NF-�B pathway by blockade of both the phosphoryla-\ntion and degradation of I�B. S. boulardii seems to act at a level\ndifferent from that at which the anti-inflammatory Salmonella\nstrain does. Neish et al. (21) suggest that prokaryotic determi-\nnants secreted by the anti-inflammatory Salmonella strain\ncould be involved in the unresponsiveness of gastrointestinal\nmucosa to proinflammatory stimuli. This hypothesis could sug-\ngest that, in a normal situation, attenuation of acute inflam-\nmatory responses by nonpathogenic organisms could contrib-\nute to adaptation of the mucosal immune system, but\ndisruption of this equilibrium could contribute to the patho-\ngenesis of enteric infections or inflammatory bowel disease.\nMoreover, it is relevant that nonpathogenic organisms are used\nnow as biotherapeutic agents in inflammatory bowel disease\n(17).\n\nIn summary, we demonstrated that S. boulardii preserves the\nbarrier function of EHEC-infected cells and decreases the\nEHEC-induced IL-8 proinflammatory secretion. S. boulardii\nacts via inhibition of the phosphorylation of MLC and inhibi-\ntion of the NF-�B and MAPK signaling pathways in T84-\ninfected cells. These results open a new field for investigation,\ni.e., the study of the protective effect of S. boulardii in inflam-\nmatory bowel disease.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was supported by Laboratoires BIOCODEX, the Région\nProvence-Alpes Côte d’Azur, the Conseil Général des Alpes Mari-\ntimes, the Faculté de Médecine de l’Université de Nice-Sophia Anti-\npolis, and the Centre Hospitalier Régional de Nice.\n\nWe thank Naofumi Mukaida for assistance with EMSA.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
