This critical role of OCT4 is maintained in\n\nembryonic stem cells [7–10], the developing germline [11–13],\n\nand germline tumors, such as seminomas and embryonic\n\nteratocarcinomas [14–18]. When inducing pluripotency in differ-\n\nentiated cells, OCT4 appears to be an essential, but not the only\n\nrequired transcription factor [19,20]. OCT4 acts as a transcrip-\n\ntional activator of genes involved in maintenance of undifferen-\n\ntiated state and as a repressor of differentiation-specific genes\n\n[7,21,22].\n\nIn addition to its presence in embryonic and germ-derived cells,\n\nexpression of OCT4 and other pluripotency markers has been\n\nreported in cancers, adult stem cells and various adult somatic\n\ntissues. The most abundant reports about OCT4 expression can\n\nbe found for hematopoietic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells\n\nfrom umbilical cord blood and bone marrow [23–28]. Detection\n\nof OCT4 transcripts in these compartments has led to a suggestion\n\nthat embryonic OCT4A may participate in maintenance of\n\nstemness in adult stem cell compartments [29], somatic tissue\n\ncancers (bladder [30], squamous cell carcinoma [31], breast\n\ncarcinoma [32,33] and may even be expressed in normal\n\ndifferentiated tissues [34,35]. Most astoundingly, existence of true\n\npluripotent embryonic stem-like cells in adult organs has been\n\nproposed [23–25,36,37]. We have described expression of OCT4\n\nin adult human fibroblasts undergoing induction into a regener-\n\nation competent cell type (iRC) using low oxygen culture and\n\nmedium supplementation with FGF2 [35,38,39]. iRC cells display\n\nincreased life span, maintain normal karyotype, express a number\n\nof stem cell genes, participate in in vivo regeneration of skeletal\n\nmuscle, but do not form tumors [39]. While we observed that the\n\namount of OCT4 transcript does not change before and after\n\ninduction, we at the time did not examine whether the transcript\n\nbelonged to the OCT4A or its pseudogenes.\n\nThe POU5F1 gene produces three transcripts by alternative\n\nsplicing [40,41] and three protein isoforms by alternative codon\n\nuse [42] (Figure 1). Only the OCT4A transcript contains the first\n\nexon at its 59 sequence and only protein translated from this\n\ntranscript consequently contains the unique N-terminal transacti-\n\nvation domain that regulates DNA binding of OCT4A to target\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\npromoters. It is only this full length OCT4A - a 360 amino acid\n\nprotein - that localizes to the nucleus, binds to OCT4-regulated\n\npromoters, and contributes to the maintenance of pluripotency\n\nand self-renewal [43]. OCT4A transcript and protein can be\n\ndistinguished from the non-pluripotency variants (OCT4B) using\n\nprimers specific for 59 sequence of OCT4A mRNA and N-\n\nterminal-recognizing antibodies, respectively, as well as by their\n\ndistinct subcellular localization [41,42,44,45].\n\nWith a more recent description of OCT4 pseudogenes and their\n\nexpression [46–48], however, studies examining OCT4 expression\n\nhave to consider an additional level of complexity (Table S1,\n\nFigure S1). Eight OCT4 pseudogenes have been identified using\n\nbioinformatics approach [47] and several of these are expressed\n\nand translated into proteins in somatic tumors, but not in\n\nembryonic carcinomas, fibroblasts or normal tissues [48–51].\n\nAmong the OCT4 pseudogenes, OCT4-pg1, OCT4-pg3 and\n\nOCT4-pg4 pseudogenes share a high sequence homology to\n\nOCT4A and share the unique N-terminal coding sequence.\n\nSimilarly, cell types isolated from umbilical cord or adult bone\n\nmarrow express OCT4-pg3, OCT4-pg4, and OCT4-pg5 but do\n\nnot express embryonic OCT4A [52], and reports identifying these\n\ntranscripts as OCT4A may have been erroneous. The only adult,\n\nnon-cancer cell type that has been reported to express pseudo-\n\ngenes are cells derived from peripheral blood [36]. It has been\n\nsuggested that pseudogenes may play regulatory roles in expres-\n\nsion of genes from which they originate, potentially by an RNA\n\ninterference-like mechanisms [53,54] or even as weak transcrip-\n\ntional activators [48].\n\nWhen studying expression of OCT4 it is therefore critically\n\nimportant to account for OCT4 transcripts, OCT4 pseudogene\n\ntranscripts and all the possible protein products, the majority of\n\nwhich have no demonstrated DNA-binding activity. While\n\nmethods and reagents to distinguish between OCT4A and\n\nOCT4B transcripts and protein variants are available, unavail-\n\nability of similar reagents to distinguish between embryonic\n\nOCT4A and its pseudogene transcripts and proteins remains an\n\nobstacle to studying activity of these genes in more detail. Here we\n\ndescribe unique endonuclease restriction sites within OCT4A and\n\nits pseudogenes that enable differentiation between their tran-\n\nscripts, and investigate their expression in undifferentiated and\n\ndifferentiated human cells.\n\nWe demonstrate that embryonic stem cells express exclusively\n\nOCT4A and that during differentiation this expression ceases and\n\nis replaced by expression of pseudogenes. Similar regulation,\n\nhowever faster, takes place in teratocarcinoma cells. We also show\n\nthat all differentiated cell types express exclusively pseudogenes,\n\nbut this expression can shift to predominantly embryonic OCT4 in\n\nadult human fibroblasts undergoing induction of regenerative\n\ncompetence (iRC) by FGF2 and low oxygen.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell Culture\nHuman embryonic stem cells (hESCs, WA09) and induced\n\npluripotent stem cells (iPSCs, DF19-9-7T) were obtained,\n\ncultured, and maintained as recommended by the supplier\n\n(WiCell). For differentiation into embryonic bodies (EBs), stem\n\ncells were either trypsinized (hESCs) or mechanically dissociated\n\n(iPSCs) and plated onto low attachment culture plates in\n\ndifferentiation medium consisting of DMEM-F12, 7.5% serum\n\nreplacement, 10% FBS, 0.56NEAA (Gibco), 0.005% b-mercap-\ntoethanol (Gibco), and 2 mmol of retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium\nwas changed with fresh medium twice a week. On day 5 of\n\ndifferentiation, EBs were transferred to cell culture plates where\n\nFigure 1.

NTERA, NCCIT (both\n\nteratocarcinoma), HeLa, and NHSY (glioblastoma) cells were\n\nobtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC).\n\nFor differentiation, NTERA cells were seeded at density 16106\n\ncells per 75 cm\n2\nin expansion medium (DMEM +10% FBS). After\n\nattachment the medium was changed to differentiation medium\n\nconsisting of DMEM +10% FBS supplemented with 0.01 mM\ntrans-retinoic acid (Sigma). Medium was changed twice a week\n\nand samples for RNA isolation taken during 21 days post-\n\ndifferentiation.\n\nOther cell types or their total RNA was obtained from Lonza\n\n(human mesenchymal stem cells – hMSCs, human umbilical cord\n\nvascular endothelium - HUVEC), Clontech (testis RNA), Lonza\n\n(smooth muscle cells, and Clontech (RNA from heart). All cell\n\ntypes were cultures as recommended by suppliers. Control adult\n\nprimary human fibroblasts CRL-2352 (ATCC) were cultured in\n\nDMEM-F12, 10% FBS at ambient oxygen, or in 2% oxygen in the\n\nsame medium, supplemented with 4 ng/mL of FGF2 (Pepro-\n\nTech).\n\nTotal RNA Extraction and RT-PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen).\n\nRNA integrity was examined on 1% agarose gel. 1 mg of total\nRNA was reverse transcribed using QuantiTech Reverse Tran-\n\nscription kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nTotal RNA was first treated with DNA Wipeout buffer to remove\n\npotential contamination of genomic DNA and then used for\n\nreverse transcription. The cDNA samples were stored at 220uC.\nThe polymerase chain reaction contained 26 GoTaq Green\nMastermix (Promega), 20 pmols of primers and PCR water. The\n\nPCR primers used for PCR were: NANOG F: 59-\n\nTGTCTTCTGCTGAGATGCCTCACA-39 and R: 59-\n\nCCTTCTGCGTCACACCATTGCTAT-39; CRIPTO1 F: 59-\n\nGACGAGCAAATTCCTGATGG-39 and R: 59-\n\nGCCTCTTTTCCCCCTAATTG-39; GAPDH F: 59-ATCAC-\n\nCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-39 and R: 59-\n\nTTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACG-39; OCT4 F, 59-\n\nGTTGATCCTCGGACCTGGCTA-39; R, 59-\n\nGGTTGCCTCTCACTCGGTTCT-39. The OCT4 primers\n\nwere designed to bind at nucleotides 142–162 and 768–788 of\n\nthe coding OCT4 sequence and amplify OCT4 as well as\n\npseudogene 1, 3 and 4 transcripts (Figure 1). PCR cycling\n\nparameters consisted of an initial cDNA denaturation of 2 min at\n\n95uC, followed by 15 sec at 94uC, 30 sec at annealing temperature\n60uC, and DNA extension for 1 min at 72uC for 31 cycles. A final\nextension step was performed at 72uC for 10 min and held at 4uC\nuntil analysis. All PCR reactions included no template controls or\n\nno RT reaction. PCR products were resolved by 1% agarose gel\n\nelectrophoresis and were visualized by exposure to 535 nm light\n\non Kodak MM4000 image analyzer.\n\nPCR Clean-up\nFour 25 microliter reactions were combined and PCR product\n\ncleaned using NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel). Briefly,\n\nPCR reactions were diluted with 2 volumes of Buffer NT and\n\nloaded on NucleoSpin Extract II column and centrifuged 1 min at\n\n11,0006g. Flow-through was discarded and column washed with\n700 mL of buffer NT3 and then the membrane was dried for\n2 min at 11,0006g. DNA was eluted into a new 1.5 mL tube and\nDNA concentration was determined with Nanodrop.\n\nRestriction Digest\nSequence alignments between OCT4A and OCT4-pg1,\n\nOCT4-pg3 and OCT4-pg4 were used to identify restriction sites\n\nthat were then used for differentiation between the transcripts\n\n(Figure 2). A previously described ApaI restriction site specific for\n\nembryonic OCT4A [55] and three novel restriction sites for\n\npseudogenes were selected (HinfI for OCT4-pg1; BglI for OCT4-\n\npg3, XhoI for OCT4-pg4; all from NEBiolabs). 500 ng of PCR\n\namplicons were digested with 12.5U ApaI, 10U XhoI, 10U BglI,\n\nor 10U HinfI. ApaI digestion reaction was incubated for 1.5 h at\n\nroom temperature and the other three for 1.5 h at 37uC. Digested\nproducts were separated on 2% agarose gel with ethidium\n\nbromide and visualized by exposure to 535 nm light on a Kodak\n\nMM4000 image analyzer.\n\nCloning and Sequencing\nPCR amplicons were cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector (TOPO\n\nTA Cloning Kit for Sequencing, Invitrogen), were transformed\n\ninto TOPO10 competent E. coli, and were then plated onto LB-\n\nagar plates containing 100 mg/ml ampicillin. Antibiotic resistant\ncolonies were selected, expanded, and plasmid was isolated, and\n\nbi-directionally sequenced from both T3 and T7 promoters\n\n(Genewiz). Three clones were sequenced for OCT4A from ESCs,\n\n3 clones for each pseudogene from control fibroblasts and 6 clones\n\nfor OCT4A from treated fibroblasts.\n\nWestern Blotting\nTotal cell lysates were prepared using common procedures.\n\nNuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were prepared as follows: cells\n\nwere collected using 0.05% trypsin (Cellgro) and washed twice\n\nwith PBS and pelleted.

As expected, strong\n\nexpression of all three stem cell genes was maintained during\n\nhESC (Figure 3A) and iPSC maintenance culture (data not\n\nshown). Starting 10 days after induction of differentiation, the\n\nexpression of these embryonic markers gradually decreased and\n\nwas undetectable for CRIPTO1 on day 14 and NANOG on day\n\n17. Low levels of OCT4 transcript, however persisted and were\n\nstill detectable on day 21 (Figure 3B). Expression of the same genes\n\nin control adult human fibroblasts resembled the expression of\n\nthese genes in day 21 differentiated hESCs. We next examined\n\nwhether expression of these genes can be detected in adult human\n\nfibroblasts cultured in 2% oxygen culture in the presence of FGF2.\n\nRT-PCR amplified transcripts could be detected for all three\n\ngenes after 3 days and increased on day 7 (Figure 3C), confirming\n\nour previously published observations [37].\n\nIn addition to recognizing the OCT4A, our OCT4 primers\n\nwere designed to amplify a fragment including 59 region which is\n\ncommon for OCT4A and pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, but which is\n\nmissing in all other pseudogene transcripts and OCT4B transcripts\n\n(Figure 1). The expected 646 bp amplicon, therefore could contain\n\nany of the four transcripts. This allowed us to examine the OCT4\n\namplicon in these cells in more detail. To identify the composition\n\nof the transcripts that could contribute to the 646 bp OCT4\n\namplicon at any time and to distinguish between the individual\n\ntranscripts, we searched otherwise highly homologous sequences of\n\nOCT4 and OCT4-pg1, 3 and 4 for potentially unique endonu-\n\nclease restriction sites. In addition to previously described ApaI\n\nsite, that is specific only for OCT4A [55], we were able to identify\n\nthree restriction sites that were then selected for differentiation\n\nbetween pseudogene transcripts (Figure 2). Restriction analysis of\n\nthe amplicon from hESCs during differentiation is presented in\n\nFigure 3D. ApaI restriction analysis of the 646 bp PCR product\n\nidentified the persistence of OCT4A until day 14 of differentiation,\n\nas evident by ApaI restriction of the amplicon into 146 and 500 bp\n\nfragments. By day 17 the amplicon could not be digested by ApaI\n\nany longer. This indicated that the embryonic OCT4A transcript\n\nwas no longer present and the entire 646 bp amplicon on day 17\n\nand after consisted of pseudogene transcripts. Digestion of the\n\namplicon with XhoI, which digests all but the OCT4-pg4\n\nindicated very low amounts of this transcript in hESCs and\n\nstarted gradually increasing between days 10 and 14 after\n\ndifferentiation. Digestion with BglI which cuts only OCT4-pg3\n\n(412 and 232 bp fragments) revealed a gradual increase of this\n\ntranscript 14 days after differentiation. Lastly, digestion with HinfI\n\nwhich cuts all transcripts into 5 fragments except OCT4-pg1 (4\n\nfragments) similarly indicated the start of OCT4-pg1 transcription\n\non day 14 by the virtue of the longer, 424 bp fragment unique to\n\nOCT4-pg1. Overall, the amount of all pseudogene transcripts\n\nincreased with a concomitant decease in transcription of OCT4A\n\nover the 21 days of hESC differentiation. The pattern of OCT4A\n\nand pseudogenes expression in control fibroblasts resembled the\n\npattern observed in differentiated hESCs and control fibroblasts,\n\nwhich expressed only OCT4 pseudogenes (Figure 3E). However,\n\nApaI digestion of the OCT4 amplicon from fibroblasts grown in\n\n2% oxygen and with 4 ng/ml FGF2– the conditions we have\n\npreviously used to induce a phenotype switch to a regeneration\n\ncompetent cell [38] - identified embryonic OCT4A transcript at\n\nboth day 3 and day 7 of culture in these conditions, indicating a\n\nreversal of expression from OCT4 pseudogenes to embryonic\n\nOCT4A (Figure 3G), resembling the pattern of ApaI digestion in\n\nhESC and iPSCs (Figure 3D and 3F). When a variety of other cell\n\ntypes were examined, only hESCs and teratocarcinoma cell lines\n\n(NTERA and NCCIT) expressed ApaI-sensitive OCT4A tran-\n\nscript (Figure 3H). Similar downregulation of OCT4A transcript\n\nwas observed during differentiation of teratocarcinoma cells\n\n(Figure 4), however, simultaneous expression of pseudogenes\n\nstarted increasing much earlier during differentiation, and could\n\nbe observed from day 5 onward.\n\nTo confirm our restriction digestion results, the 646 bp PCR\n\namplicons from hESCs, 2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts and\n\ncontrol fibroblasts were cloned into TOPO vector and three clones\n\nfrom each sample for each pseudogene and six clones from\n\n2%O2/FGF2 treated fibroblasts were sequenced. Sequencing\n\nconfirmed our restriction data; hESCs and 2%O2/FGF2 treated\n\nfibroblasts expressed only embryonic OCT4A, while control\n\nfibroblasts expressed OCT4-pg1, pg3 and pg4 (Tables S2–S7).\n\nTranslation and Localization of Protein Products of OCT4\nGene and its Pseudogenes\nTo determine whether any of the OCT4 transcripts were, in\n\nfact, translated into detectable proteins, Western blotting was\n\nperformed. As demonstrated in Figure 5A, the OCT4 sc-5279\n\nantibody, directed against N-terminal protein sequence, recog-\n\nnized several bands in teratocarcinoma cells (NCCIT) and in\n\nfibroblasts, regardless of culture conditions. The doublet that\n\nmigrated at 45/43 kDa (OCT4A or OCT4pg1) and a band\n\nmigrating around 37 kDa (likely somatic OCT4B) were present in\n\nall samples, while the two faster migrating proteins (30 and\n\n20 kDa) were present only in fibroblasts gown in ambient oxygen,\n\nregardless off FGF2 supplementation. The proteins were detected\n\nin both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of fibroblasts. Knowing\n\nthat FGF2/2%O2 fibroblasts express OCT4A, however, it is\n\nreasonable to assume that some of the slower migrating doublet\n\nrepresents embryonic OCT4A. In control fibroblasts these bands\n\nare likely contributed by pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4, as the antibody\n\nshould recognize sequences in the N-terminal of these proteins\n\n(Figure 5A). The second antibody, ab19857 (against C-terminal),\n\nsimilarly recognized the doublet of 45/43 kDa and a protein\n\nmigrating around 37 kDa, but failed to recognize any other\n\nprotein products. The amount of detected protein at 37 kDa was\n\nsignificantly higher in cells grown in low oxygen and potentiated\n\nby addition of FGF2 (Figure 5B). The third antibody ab18976,\n\nderived against the N-terminal OCT4 sequence could, in principle\n\ndetect OCT4A and pseudogenes 1 and 3. Intensity of the band in\n\ntreated fibroblast was significantly lower than in hESCs\n\n(Figure 5C). A 31 kDa band was detected in both control and\n\ntreated fibroblasts and could represent OCT4pg4. The identity of\n\nthe 26 kDa band detected with this antibody remains unknown.\n\nAn additional 19 kDa protein, that could be the product pf\n\nOCT4pg3, was recognized in control fibroblasts, but was absent in\n\nstem cells and treated fibroblasts.\n\nImmunocytochemistry revealed OCT4 presence in cell nuclei of\n\nhESCs regardless of the antibody used, as expected (Figure 6). The\n\nN-terminal specific antibody sc-5279 recognized weak nuclear\n\nsignal in 2%O2/FGF2 fibroblasts. The C-terminal ab19857\n\nrecognized nuclear localized protein in hESCs, and nuclear and\n\ncytoplasmic proteins in control and treated fibroblasts. As none of\n\nthe OCT4B variants localize to the nucleus, the nuclear signal can\n\nExpression of OCT4 and Its Pseudogenes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e89546\n\n\n\nbe contributed only by OCT4A or pseudogene OCT4-pg1\n\nderived protein [48,51]. Considering the individual cell type\n\ntranscript profile, it is possible that in treated fibroblasts the\n\nantibody recognized OCT4A. The OCT4-pg4 protein has yet to\n\nbe detected by any anti-OCT4 antibody, and OCT4-pg3 localizes\n\nto the cytoplasm [51]. The sc-8629, another C-terminal specific\n\nantibody, recognized nuclear OCT4A in hESCs and cytoplasmic\n\nproteins in both control and treated fibroblasts. Cytoplasmic\n\nstaining in both fibroblasts may be identifying OCT4A, OCT4B,\n\nOCT4pg1 [42], and/or OCT4-pg3 [51]. These data corroborate\n\nour previously published results [35] and indicate that expression\n\nof OCT4 in somatic cells is under the control of an oxygen and\n\nFGF2-sensitive mechanism.\n\nDiscussion\n\nOCT4 has received considerable attention during the past years\n\nand its expression has been reported in various cell types and\n\nacross a spectrum of differentiation cell states. Due to the\n\npossibility of multiple transcript variants and protein isoforms, as\n\nwell as expressed pseudogenes being detected, more rigorous\n\nanalyses of OCT4 are required [44,46]. Existence of high number\n\nof pseudogenes for OCT4 is not an exception. Excessive frequency\n\nof pseudogenes for embryonic stem cells-specific genes was also\n\ndescribed for Nanog (10 pseudogenes), Stella (16 pseudogenes),\n\nand Cripto-1 (6 pseudogenes) [47,52].\n\nWe identified expression of Oct-4pg1, Oct-4pg3 and Oct-4pg4\n\npseudogenes in normal adult human fibroblasts using PCR based\n\napproach followed by pseudogene-specific restriction digestion and\n\nsequencing. Our study confirms that expression of OCT4A\n\nprotein is exclusive to hESCs and germ cell-derived tumor cell\n\nFigure 3. RT-PCR for expression of embryonic stem cell specific genes.

None of the other examined somatic cells, somatic tumor cell\n\nlines or adult stem cells expressed OCT4A. In an exact opposite\n\npattern, all cell types examined except hESCs and germ cell\n\ntumor-derived cell lines expressed pseudogenes 1, 3 and 4.\n\nMonitoring the relationship between OCT4A expression and\n\nexpression of pseudogenes in hESCs during differentiation, an\n\ninteresting pattern emerges; a gradual decrease of OCT4A occurs\n\nin a parallel with an increase in expression of pseudogenes. This\n\nmay indicate a tight regulatory relationship between OCT4A and\n\nits pseudogenes, even though the OCT4 gene and all the\n\npseudogenes are located on different chromosomes [47]. One of\n\nthe pseudogenes, namely OCT4-pg3 is located within the 445 kb\n\nof NANOG, STELLA and GDF3 locus on chromosome 12 [56],\n\nsignificance of which still needs to be examined.\n\nIt is interesting that similar changes occur in reverse during\n\nacquisition of regeneration competence in adult human fibroblasts.\n\nAfter a short term culture in reduced oxygen and supplementation\n\nwith FGF2 [35,38] human fibroblast cease expressing OCT4\n\npseudogenes in favor of OCT4A. We have reported previously\n\nthat these cells do not acquire the pluripotent phenotype [35], but\n\nrather undergo a phenotype switch that demonstrates regeneration\n\ncompetence in vivo [38]. Cells demonstrate an increased life span,\n\ndoubled population doubling capacity, maintain a normal\n\nkaryotype and do not form tumors in SCID mice. They do,\n\nhowever, demonstrate long term engraftment and acquire PAX7\n\npositive phenotype when transplanted into a skeletal muscle defect\n\nin mice [38]. Significance and relevance of OCT4A expression, if\n\nany, during acquisition of regeneration competence, is not clear\n\nand is currently under investigation. Nevertheless, this is the first\n\nstudy in which a switch from pseudogene to OCT4A expression\n\nhas been reported and induced by selective manipulation of\n\nculture conditions. We speculate that pseudogene silencing is\n\ninduced in adult somatic cells using our culture system, an event\n\nthat may be required for re-activation of OCT4A. While clearly\n\nnot pluripotent, regeneration-competent cells express low levels of\n\nOCT4A. It has been shown that OCT4 is controlling pluripotency\n\nin a quantitative manner [57]. Specifically, high level of OCT4\n\nexpression drives ES cells to endoderm and mesoderm lineages,\n\nwhile stem cells with low level of OCT4 differentiate into\n\ntrophoectoderm. Only a specific level of OCT4 can maintain\n\nstem cells in a pluripotent state. These observations suggest that\n\nOCT4 is different from many known transcription regulators that\n\nappear to function in an on-off manner. Consequently, low levels\n\nof embryonic OCT4A may not be functionally relevant for either\n\ninduction or maintenance of pluripotency, but may be relevant for\n\ninduction of this novel regeneration-competent cell phenotype.\n\nOur data indicate that chromatin plasticity may be an inherent\n\nfeature of adult fibroblasts and that the manifestation of this\n\nplasticity may be influenced by the extracellular environment. Our\n\ndata also support the notion that regeneration competence does\n\nnot depend on cell pluripotency and may be regulated by a novel,\n\nOCT4A-dependent mechanism.

Neither OCT4 nor its\n\npseudogenes, for example, are required for multipotency of human\n\nstromal cells from different tissues [49]. There is no common\n\nregulatory network that has been shown to exist between the\n\nvarious somatic stem cell types and that can be compared to gene\n\nregulatory network that maintains pluripotency in ES cells with\n\nOCT4 as its cornerstone [52,58]. It is more likely that\n\nFigure 5. Protein expression of stem cell specific genes.

Misidentification of OCT4 in\n\nsomatic tissues and cancer cell lines can also result from detection\n\nof pseudogene transcripts by RT-PCR and/or nuclear detection of\n\npseudogene proteins by ICC. Most studies indeed do not exclude\n\nthe possibilities of pseudogene expression [16,44,46,59] and do not\n\ndistinguish between OCT4 isoforms [46]. All OCT4 protein\n\nisoforms are identical in their C-terminal region and distinct in N-\n\nterminal region so the location of the epitope recognized by any\n\nanti-OCT4 antibody should be considered first [42,46] and\n\ncombined with a diligent analysis of the OCT4 transcript. Adding\n\nthe possibility that OCT4 pseudogenes translate into proteins and\n\nthat OCT4-pg1 can localize to the nucleus [51] and confer\n\ntranscriptional activation of some reporter gene constructs [48],\n\ndiligent analysis should be employed. This may likely require a\n\ncombination of experimental approaches, such as RT-PCR,\n\nrestriction analysis for various pseudogenes, and protein analysis.\n\nAdditional functional studies, such as chromatin immunoprecip-\n\nitation, electromobility shift assay and/or transcription analysis of\n\ndownstream genes may need to be included to reach a valid\n\nconclusion.\n\nBesides accurately characterizing OCT4 expression, relevance\n\nof OCT4 expression should be considered for each chosen\n\nexperimental system. While OCT4A expression may be critically\n\nimportant when studying pluripotency and self-renewal, examin-\n\ning expression of OCT4A in studies involving stem cells from adult\n\ncompartments or in somatic cell cancers may be of little functional\n\nrelevance [59,60].\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Differences between Oct4 pseudogenes based\non the coding sequences.
