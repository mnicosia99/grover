They can either provoke or ameliorate\nimmune responses. This review focuses on outlining the stimulatory as well as the inhibitory effects\nof heat-shock proteins 27, 40, 70, 65, 60, and 90 in experimental and clinical autoimmune settings.\n\nKeywords: heat-shock proteins; autoimmunity; heat-shock response\n\n1. Introduction\n\nHeat-shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones participating primarily in pro-\ntein folding preventing protein degradation and subsequent cellular distress [1]. HSPs are\nregulated through heat-shock factor 1(HSF-1) [2]. In the steady state HSF-1 is bound to\nHSP90 or HSP70 [3,4]. Upon stressful signals HSF-1 dissociates from HSPs and translocates\ninto the nucleus where it stimulates HSP expression [1]. HSPs can be exposed to the im-\nmune system through tissue necrosis and the resultant cellular debris, via organized release\nof exosomes/endosomes, or through their presence on the cellular membrane [5–7]. Their\nevolutionary conservation can elicit interspecies immune recognition [8]. The resulting\nimmune response can be either immunoregulatory or immunostimulatory [9,10]. Further-\nmore specific HSP domains as well as certain HSP isoforms and their client proteins induce\na differential autoimmune response. The purpose of the present review is to outline the yet\nknown pathophysiology guiding these bimodal and sometimes paradoxical phenomena.\nThe effects of heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27), heat-shock protein 40 (HSP40), heat-shock\nprotein 70 (HSP70), heat-shock protein 60 (HSP60), heat-shock protein 65 (HSP65), and\nheat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) in eliciting differential immune responses in experimental\nas well as in clinical autoimmune settings will be described.\n\n2. Structural Characteristics, Subcellular Localization of HSPs, and Elicited\nImmune Responses\n2.1. Structure and Subcellular Localization of the Small HSP Family\n\nThe small HSP (sHSP) gene family has 11 family members (Table S1) [11], which are\nlocated in the nucleus, cytoplasm, extracellular space, and the cytoskeleton where they can\nmodulate its structure [12–14]\n\nSmall HSPs have a central alpha crystallin domain (ACD) bounded by N-terminal\nand C-terminal domains (Figure 1a) [15–17]. The ACD entails many antiparallel β-sheets\nwhich form its final β-sandwich conformation [15]. The N-terminal domain contains serine\nresidues which can be phosphorylated by intracellular kinases. For example, MAPK-\nactivated protein kinase 5 (MK5) can interact with HSP27 in vivo and influence F-actin-\ndependent cytoskeletal organization [18].

Aberrant phosphorylation of HSP27 correlates to various clinical\npathologies, such as viral infections, specific tumor cells, and autoimmune skin diseases\n(pemphigus vulgaris and pemphigus foliaceus) [18].\n\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 21 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 2.

HSP27 induces mesangial cell activation; immunization with HSP27 leads to expansion of spe-\ncific T-cell populations (CD43+, CD45Ro+, and CD57+ NK cells) as well as the production of HSP27 autoantibodies. \n\n2.3. Structure and Subcellular Localization of HSP40 Family Members \nEukaryotes generally express an expanded arsenal of HSP40s compared to prokary-\n\notes [36]. To date there are 49 human genes coding for separate members of the HSP40 \nfamily (Table S2). HSP40 protein family members are localized within the nucleus, plasma \nmembrane, extracellular space, and cytoplasm (Figure 1b) [37,38]. \n\nThe molecular signature of the HSP40 family is the J-domain, which contains multi-\nple α-helices and has a critical role of stimulating the ATPase domain within HSP70 pro-\ntein family members [21]. A histidine–proline–aspartate (HPD) motif is required for the J-\ndomain to be functional [21]. HSP40 family members are categorized into type I, type II, \nor type III, according to their structural conformation. Types I and II have a J-domain \nlocated at the N-terminus. In type III, is apparent that the J-domain can be located in any \nposition of the protein sequence [36]. The C-terminal domain of HSP40 binds denatured \nclient proteins [39]. Since both HSP40 and HSP70 family members can be localized in the \nextracellular space [40,41] they could collectively interact with immune system compo-\nnents. \n\n2.4. Immune Response Elicited through HSP40 \nThe term glomerulonephritis defines the subset of glomerular diseases in which in-\n\nflammation or autoimmunity play a substantial pathogenetic role. A member of HSP40 \nprotein family, DNAJB9, is a novel biomarker with a sensitivity and specificity near 100% \nfor fibrillary glomerulonephritis [40,42,43]. Fibrillary glomerulonephritis is characterized \nby the extracellular deposition of non-amyloid fibrils ranging between 16 and 25 nm [42]. \n\nFigure 2. Immunomodulatory actions of HSP27. HSP27 (blue circle) participates in cytoskeletal integrity in cases of\ncellular distress. Phosphorylation of the N-terminal domain of HSP27 through MAPK kinase protects against cytoskeletal\ndisorganization. HSP27 gene expression can be controlled through transcription factors LEGF (lens epithelium growth\nfactor). HSP27 may inhibit mRNA expression of IL-1β and thus inhibit the production of proinflammatory cytokine\nIL-1β and subsequent inflammatory milieu, P2X7R (ATP-gated P2X cation channel receptor). HSP27 activates SIP1R\n(sphingocine 1 phosphate receptor) signaling, ameliorates renal inflammation, and protects against acute kidney injury (AKI).\nProinflammatory actions of HSP27. HSP27 induces mesangial cell activation; immunization with HSP27 leads to expansion\nof specific T-cell populations (CD43+, CD45Ro+, and CD57+ NK cells) as well as the production of HSP27 autoantibodies.\n\nReduction in HSP27 levels leads to an increase of pro-IL-1β protein in LPS-treated\nmonocytes and HSP27-knockdown cells release significantly more IL-1β [26].\n\nUpregulation of HSP27 was primarily induced by immunoregulatory cytokines\nsuch as IL-4, IL-6, and TGF-β, whereas the expression of other sHSPs such as alpha\nB-crystallin was found solely to be enhanced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα.\nApparently, there is a HSP-specific cytokine combination that provokes or ameliorates its\nexpression [27].\n\nNZBxW/F1 mice develop a spontaneous lupus phenotype manifesting with lupus\nnephritis. When NZBxW/F1 mice were immunized with recombinant ribosomal protein\nP0 (rRibos.P), anti-rRibos.P antibodies developed in the context of lupus disease. Primary\nmesangial cells were exposed to NZBxW/F1-mouse anti-rRibos.P and to human anti-\nrRibos.P antibodies, respectively. This action induced an activation of mesangial cells\npartly mediated through HSP27 [28] (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 4 of 20\n\nMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a paraneoplastic syndrome defined by the presence of\nacetylcholine receptor antibodies (AchR-Abs) which occurs in up to 30% of patients with\nthymoma. Phosphorylated HSP27 was significantly increased in the serum of patients with\nMG, who were positive for AchR-Abs compared to seronegative patients [29].\n\nIn patients with cancer, HSP27 was among the antigens capable of inducing an im-\nmunoregulatory action in lymphoid cell lines. In a phase 2 study vaccination of cancer\npatients with HSP27, client peptides induced lymphoid cell infiltration in the postvaccine\nbiopsy, with an evident increase in the number of total T-cells (CD43+) and mature acti-\nvated T-cells (CD45Ro+). The postvaccine biopsy also showed an increase in the number of\nNK-cells (CD57+) [30] (Figure 2).\n\nDeletion of the endothelial-expressed sphingosine-1-phosphate 1 receptor (S1P1R)\nis associated with exacerbation of renal injury and cellular inflammatory infiltrates after\nischemic acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice. The authors identified an endothelial reduc-\ntion of HSP27 expression as a mechanism for exacerbated kidney injury and neutrophil\ninfiltration after ischemic AKI in mice (Figure 2). Fingolimod, a S1P1R agonist, is highly\nprotective in ischemic AKI [31,32]. However, fingolimod seems to exert its action through\nmultiple pathways including activation of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and activation\nof necroptosis [33]. HSP27 externalization has been identified as playing a central role in\nneutrophilic cell death after fingolimod exposure [33]. This action is mediated through\nactivation of receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP1/RIP3) and the mixed-lineage kinase\ndomain-like (MLKL) pathway [33].\n\nIn the setting of organ transplantation, there is a statistically higher level of serum\nHSP27 from lung transplant recipients with bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) compared to\ncontrol subjects. BOS accompanies chronic lung allograft dysfunction and is characterized\nby obliterative fibrosis of the small airways [34]. BOS is considered as a manifestation of\nchronic allograft rejection [34]. Anti-HSP27 antibody levels were significantly higher in\nbroncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) in patients with BOS compared to lung transplant recipients\nwithout BOS. Elevated serum levels of HSP27 and elevated antibody titers against HSP27\nonly in the BAL suggest a localized immune response occurring at the level of alveoli and\nterminal airways [35].\n\n2.3. Structure and Subcellular Localization of HSP40 Family Members\n\nEukaryotes generally express an expanded arsenal of HSP40s compared to prokary-\notes [36]. To date there are 49 human genes coding for separate members of the HSP40\nfamily (Table S2).

Since both HSP40 and HSP70 family members can be localized in the\nextracellular space [40,41] they could collectively interact with immune system components.\n\n2.4.

Fibrillary glomerulonephritis is characterized\nby the extracellular deposition of non-amyloid fibrils ranging between 16 and 25 nm [42].\nImmunoelectron microscopy revealed HSP40 localization to individual fibrils of fibrillary\nglomerulonephritis [42] (Figure 3a).\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 5 of 20\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 21 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 3.

Antigen-presenting cells exposed to HSP40 induce an inflammatory \nresponse through increased IFNγ production. However in a later phase, there is an expansion of tolerogenic T-regulatory \ncells. \n\n2.5. Structure and Subcellular Localization of HSP70 Superfamily Members \nHSP70 family members have a central role in protein unfolding. There are 17 human \n\nfamily members of the HSP70 superfamily (Table S3). HSPA1 is the most studied isoform \nof HSP70 [8,52]. HSP110 is also a member of HSP70 superfamily [53]. HSP70 localizes in \nthe cytosol, the nucleus [54], the endoplasmic reticulum(ER) [55], the peroxisomes [56], \nthe extracellular space [57,58] and the mitochondria [59] (Figure 1c). Through its extracel-\nlular localization, and its complexing with other HSPs, HSP70 may directly present client \npeptides to the local immunological microenvironment. \n\nWhat designates the HSP70 superfamily is the N-terminal nucleotide-binding do-\nmain (NBD) [21]. NBD has four subdomains (namely IA, IB, IIA, and IIB) surrounding an \nATP-binding pocket [60]. C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) has a β-sandwich \n(SBDβ) and an α-helical domain (SBDα) [60,61]. For ATP-hydrolysis, the binding of J-do-\nmain-baring chaperones is necessary (Section 2.3). ATP hydrolysis is a major determinant \nof its spatial conformation and protein-binding function [5]. By binding ATP, an NBD-\nbinding pocket opens (Figure 1c). Consequently, SBDα is detached from SBDβ and em-\nbarks onto NBD [21,61]. As a result of ATP-binding, there is increased affinity and pro-\ncessing rate of non-native peptides [21]. GrpE (GroP-like gene E), BAG (Bcl-2-associated \nathanogene), proteins with Arm (armadillo repeat) domain, and HSP110 are the nucleo-\ntide exchange factors (NEFs) [21,53,62–64]. NEFs assure proper substrate release from \nHSP70 machinery [21,61]. \n\n2.6. Immune Response Elicited through HSP70 \n\nFigure 3. Immunomodulatory actions of HSP40. (a) HSP40 is a biomarker of fibrillary glomerulonephritis. The fact\nthat DNAJB9 colocalizes with fibrils, depicts that HSP40 protein family members have an extracellular function. (b) In\natherosclerosis, HSP40 is highly expressed in atheromatous lesions. More specifically cellular components that actively\nparticipate in atheroma formation express high amounts of HSP40. (c) HSP40/HSP70 complexes induce PI3K/JNK\nsignaling and inflammation. (d) HSP40 exerts a bimodal action. Antigen-presenting cells exposed to HSP40 induce an\ninflammatory response through increased IFNγ production. However in a later phase, there is an expansion of tolerogenic\nT-regulatory cells.\n\nA homolog of the human HSP40, HDJ-2, found in Escherichia coli, is significantly\nincreased in human atherosclerotic carotid artery plaques when compared with non-\natherosclerotic intima (Figure 3b). Furthermore, immunoreactive HDJ-2 protein was lo-\ncalized in macrophage-derived foam cell surfaces, in endothelial cells, and in vascular\nsmooth muscle-like myointimal cells [44]. The authors suggest that HDJ-2 expression may\nbe responsible for T-cell activation in the development of atherosclerosis (Table 1). HSP40 is\nincreased in stroke patients. Increased expression of human HSP40/HSP70 during stroke\nmay lead to autoimmunization against human HSP40 and may cause the immunolog-\nical cross-reaction against bacterial HSP40 [45]. HSP40 has been shown to stimulate a\nmacrophage cell line (RAW264) to secrete IL-6 through activation of the PI3K and JNK\nsignaling pathways towards a pro-inflammatory response [46,47] (Figure 3c).\n\nHSP40 induces an in vitro decline of the production of the proinflammatory cytokine\nTNFα and a corresponding increase of the tolerogenic cytokine IL-10 in the synovial fluid\nof juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients. This decline seems to be dependent on PD-1 and\nCTLA-4 expression [48]. In order to study T- cell responses to HSP40 peptide fragments in\npatients with oligoarticular juvenile arthritis, Massa et al. [48] showed that proliferative\nresponses of patient synovial fluid monocytes (SFMCs) to recombinant E. coli HSP40 (rdnaJ)\nwere significantly higher than those of the corresponding peripheral blood monocytes. The\nexposure of SFMCs to HSP40 peptide fragments induced CD4+, CD25+ high T-cells (Treg)\nwith higher expression of CTLA-4, IL-10, and FoxP3 mRNA. These T-cells had the ability to\nsuppress effector T-cell proliferation in vitro. Although the CD4+, CD25+ high Treg-cells\nclearly could not prevent the development of the disease, they may contribute to reversing\nongoing inflammation. According to this mechanism, patients with persistent oligoarticular\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 6 of 20\n\njuvenile arthritis may have partially maintained the Treg-cell function in response to self-\nHSP40 in the joint, where it is overexpressed during inflammation; this may result in the\nself-remitting course of the disease [48] (Figure 3d). HSP40-family-member expression is\ninfluenced by external stimuli, more specifically, the presence of the heat-shock proteins\nDnaJB4 and DnaJC6 was higher in the synovial tissue compared to non-smokers with\nrheumatoid arthritis [49]. These local changes can activate pro-inflammatory signaling\npathways and promote autoimmunity.\n\nBullous pemphigoid is a bullous autoimmune disease of the skin. It is characterized\nby the presence of auto-antibodies against components of the dermal–epidermal junction.\nCirculating IgG autoantibodies directed against HSP40 were elevated in patients with\nactive bullous pemphigoid and pemphigus vulgaris compared with healthy controls [50].\n\nThe expression of the HSP40 family homolog DNAJC15 is directly influenced by\nIFNγ. The reduction of DNAJC15 expression is regulated through ikaros, a transcription-\nregulating factor, which directly binds the promoter region of DNAJC15 gene under IFNγ\ninfluence. Therefore, the regulation of HSP gene expression involves the participation of\nproinflammatory cytokines [51].\n\n2.5. Structure and Subcellular Localization of HSP70 Superfamily Members\n\nHSP70 family members have a central role in protein unfolding. There are 17 human\nfamily members of the HSP70 superfamily (Table S3). HSPA1 is the most studied isoform\nof HSP70 [8,52]. HSP110 is also a member of HSP70 superfamily [53]. HSP70 localizes in\nthe cytosol, the nucleus [54], the endoplasmic reticulum(ER) [55], the peroxisomes [56], the\nextracellular space [57,58] and the mitochondria [59] (Figure 1c). Through its extracellular\nlocalization, and its complexing with other HSPs, HSP70 may directly present client\npeptides to the local immunological microenvironment.\n\nWhat designates the HSP70 superfamily is the N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain\n(NBD) [21]. NBD has four subdomains (namely IA, IB, IIA, and IIB) surrounding an ATP-\nbinding pocket [60]. C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD) has a β-sandwich (SBDβ)\nand an α-helical domain (SBDα) [60,61]. For ATP-hydrolysis, the binding of J-domain-\nbaring chaperones is necessary (Section 2.3). ATP hydrolysis is a major determinant of its\nspatial conformation and protein-binding function [5]. By binding ATP, an NBD-binding\npocket opens (Figure 1c). Consequently, SBDα is detached from SBDβ and embarks onto\nNBD [21,61]. As a result of ATP-binding, there is increased affinity and processing rate of\nnon-native peptides [21]. GrpE (GroP-like gene E), BAG (Bcl-2-associated athanogene), pro-\nteins with Arm (armadillo repeat) domain, and HSP110 are the nucleotide exchange factors\n(NEFs) [21,53,62–64]. NEFs assure proper substrate release from HSP70 machinery [21,61].\n\n2.6. Immune Response Elicited through HSP70\n\nAntigen-presenting cells exposed to HSP70 secrete more TNFα, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-\n1β, and enhance surface expression of B7 and maturation of immature dendritic cells.\nHSP70 also binds to its client proteins through the KEFRQ-like motif [65] and leads\nto MHC-II recognition [6,65–68] (Figure 4b and Table 2). An HSP70-associated expan-\nsion of T-cells was observed. This T-cell expansion was CD4-dependent but not CD28-\ndependent [68]. Millar et al. showed that the immunization of RIP-GP/P14 mice with\nrecombinant HSP70 (rhHSP70) induced the onset of diabetes showing an in vivo promotion\nof autoimmunity [68].\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 7 of 20\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 21 \n \n\n \n\n \nFigure 4.

These changes can also be induced through \ndirect binding of HSP70 with damage-associated molecular pattern receptors (DAMPR).

Structure and Subcellular Localization of HSP90 \nThere are five members of the human HSP90 family. The HSP90 family members \n\n(Table S4) are localized within the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum, the endosomes \n[41], the cell membrane [81], and the nucleus [82], and they can be secreted in the extra-\ncellular space (Figure 1d) [41]. Furthermore, the HSP90 isoform, TRAP1, is localized \nwithin the mitochondrion [83]. HSP90 interacts with other client proteins as well as other \nmembers of the heat-shock-protein family [84]. The N-terminal domain of HSP90 contains \nits ATP-binding pocket [85]. This N-terminal domain is followed by a middle domain \nleading to the C-terminal region [86] (Figure 1d). The middle domain is responsible for \nclient protein-binding [86]. The C-terminal region of HSP90 homodimerizes in the steady \nstate. By binding of ATP in its N-terminal domain, HSP90 gains its active conformation \n[87]. After completion of its chaperone function, the ATP molecule is hydrolyzed and \nHSP90 regains its resting state [86].  \n\n2.8. Immune Responses Elicited through HSP90 \nExposure to an HSP90 isoform (grp96) downregulates T-cell responses in experi-\n\nmental models of type 1 diabetes mellitus and EAE. HSP90 causes an expansion of CD4+ \nT-regulatory cells by binding to CD91, CD36, and TLR2/4, which in turn can inhibit CD8+ \nT-cells [88]. Exposure of dendritic cells to grp96 suppresses their maturation. PGMA1 (2,3-\nbisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase, an enzyme participating in \nglycolysis pathway) complexes with grp96 producing an immunosuppressive effect [89]. \n\nFigure 4. Immunomodulatory actions of HSP70 (a) HSP70/client protein-complexes induced signaling through HLA-DR\nbinding in T-regulatory cells. Endoplasmic reticulum HSP70, binding of HSP70 with LAG3 receptor increases IL-2, IL-4,\nand IL-10. This induces inactivation of antigen-presenting cells (inducible nitric oxide synthase reduction-iNOS, regulated\non activation of normal-T-cell-expressed and secreted reduction-RANTES). These changes can also be induced through\ndirect binding of HSP70 with damage-associated molecular pattern receptors (DAMPR).

A parallel autoantibody production against HSP70 may\ncoexist. Collectively these changes promote autoimmunity.\n\nHSPA5 (an endoplasmic reticulum isoform of HSP70) elicits an immunomodulatory T-\ncell response (increase of IL-10 and IL-4 production) diminishing experimental autoimmune\narthritis activity [69]. Multiple HSP70 client peptides promote a T-regulatory cell pheno-\ntype(CD4+, CD25+, FoxP3+) [70]. T-regulatory cell stimulation through HSP70, induced\nan increase in LAG3 expression (CD233 induces the suppressive function of T-regulatory\ncells [70,71]) (Figure 4a). In a mouse model of autoimmune arthritis, T-regulatory cell\nexpansion and the subsequent suppression of disease activity was mediated through the\nLAG3 co-stimulatory molecule [70].\n\nFurthermore, HSP70 is present in clathrin-coated pits, uncoating during clathrin-\nmediated endocytosis. HSP70 packaged in exosomes can be released from cells. This\nattracts T-cells bearing a CD8+ IL-10+ phenotype [65].\n\nHSP70 and client peptide HINT1 (histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein-1, a pro-\ntein having an active role in the p53 signaling pathway [52]) mediate immunoregulation\nthrough CD94 and NKG2D (NKG2-D type-II integral membrane protein; a costimulatory\nreceptor of NK-cells [72]) signaling in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune en-\ncephalomyelitis (EAE) [73]. Detection of HSP70 mRNA was related with reduced clinical\ninflammation scores in an experimental mouse model of EAE. In this set of experiments,\nthere was a reduction in inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) production, RANTES\n(chemokine C-C motif ligand 5), and NF-κB mRNA [74] (Figure 4a). This shows that HSPs\ncan regulate gene expression in response to autoimmune stimuli.\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 8 of 20\n\nImmunization of Balb-c mice against α-actinin induces autoimmune responses against\nHSP70 and produces a lupus-like phenotype [75]. HSP70 dermis exposure causes inflam-\nmatory infiltration and increases IL-6 production with progressive reactivity of T-cytotoxic\ncell phenotypes (CD4+, CD8+) through IL-17 production [76] (Figure 4b).\n\nRo52 and Ro60 complex with Grp78 (an inducible form of HSP70). These com-\nplexes are recognized via surface immunoglobulins specific for the HSP70 component [77].\nGrp78/Ro52 complexes co-localize with HSP90 in apoptotic debris and stimulate T-cells [78].\n\nIn salt-sensitive hypertension there is an overexpression of tubulointerstitial HSP70,\nT-cell proliferation with perivascular T-cell infiltration and circulating anti-HSP70 antibod-\nies [79]. HSP70 was found increased in a cohort of ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic\nantibody) vasculitis patients. Increased presence of interstitial HSP70 was associated with\nworsened kidney survival in this cohort [80]. There is a plethora of examples showing that\nelevated serum circulating anti-HSP70 correlates with immune response modulation in\nhumans as well as in laboratory animals (Tables 1 and 2).\n\n2.7. Structure and Subcellular Localization of HSP90\n\nThere are five members of the human HSP90 family. The HSP90 family mem-\nbers (Table S4) are localized within the cytoplasm, the endoplasmic reticulum, the en-\ndosomes [41], the cell membrane [81], and the nucleus [82], and they can be secreted in the\nextracellular space (Figure 1d) [41]. Furthermore, the HSP90 isoform, TRAP1, is localized\nwithin the mitochondrion [83]. HSP90 interacts with other client proteins as well as other\nmembers of the heat-shock-protein family [84]. The N-terminal domain of HSP90 contains\nits ATP-binding pocket [85]. This N-terminal domain is followed by a middle domain\nleading to the C-terminal region [86] (Figure 1d). The middle domain is responsible for\nclient protein-binding [86]. The C-terminal region of HSP90 homodimerizes in the steady\nstate. By binding of ATP in its N-terminal domain, HSP90 gains its active conformation [87].\nAfter completion of its chaperone function, the ATP molecule is hydrolyzed and HSP90\nregains its resting state [86].\n\n2.8. Immune Responses Elicited through HSP90\n\nExposure to an HSP90 isoform (grp96) downregulates T-cell responses in experimental\nmodels of type 1 diabetes mellitus and EAE. HSP90 causes an expansion of CD4+ T-\nregulatory cells by binding to CD91, CD36, and TLR2/4, which in turn can inhibit CD8+\nT-cells [88]. Exposure of dendritic cells to grp96 suppresses their maturation. PGMA1\n(2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent phosphoglycerate mutase, an enzyme participating in\nglycolysis pathway) complexes with grp96 producing an immunosuppressive effect [89].\nInhibition of HSP90β with vibsanin-B inhibits interstitial leukocyte migration in a mouse\nmodel of EAE [90]. Small inhibiting-RNA (si-RNA)-induced inhibition of grp96 prevents\ndendritic cell maturation without involving TLR4 signaling. AIMP1 (aminoacyl tRNA\nsynthase complex-interacting multifunctional protein 1, a multirole protein involved in\nmany disease processes including immune modulation [91]) binds grp96 and reduces the\nintensity of the elicited immune response [92] (Figure 5a). Functional HSP90 is required for\nP2X7-receptor-mediated IL-1β release in a mouse model of autoimmune exocrinopathy [93]\n(Figure 5b). Exposure of HSP90 on the cell membrane is associated with a lupus-like\nphenotype, mediated through CD24+ antigen-presenting cells. Extrapolating data from\na CD24-knockout mouse model, HSP90 induction of autoimmunity is mediated through\nregulation of CD11c+ macrophages and inactivation of a specific dendritic cell subset\n(CD80+, CD86+, CD40+, IL-12+) [7] (Figure 5b).\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 9 of 20\n\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 21 \n \n\n \n\nInhibition of HSP90β with vibsanin-B inhibits interstitial leukocyte migration in a mouse \nmodel of EAE [90].

Expression of the HSP90 isoform (gp96) on the cell \nsurface is associated with glomerulonephritis and auto-antibody production (anti-nuclear \nantibodies and anti-dsDNA antibodies). This phenotype is associated with CD4-T-cell \nstimulation which in turn activates dendritic cells [95]. \n\nIt is apparent that an armamentarium of different receptors and signaling pathways \nmay have different immune effects upon the exposure to the same HSP. This fact may lead \nto immunoregulation or immunostimulation. \n\n \nFigure 5. Immunomodulatory actions of HSP90.

This fact may lead\nto immunoregulation or immunostimulation.\n\n2.9. Structure and Subcellular Localization of Chaperonins\n\nThere are 15 members in the human chaperonin family (Table S5). HSP60 and HSP10\nare primarily located within the mitochondrion [96], although cell membrane [97–99],\nperoxisomes [96] and extracellular localizations [100] have been reported. The protein\nstructure of this family consists of two heptameric ring subunits, or two octameric rings in\nthe case of TCP1 [101], which come positioned “back to back” to form a barrel-like structure\n(Figure 1e). Unfolded proteins bind to each subunit ring with 1:1 stoichiometry [102].\nHSP10 forms a heptameric cover upon the substrate cavity of HSP60 [103] and is a necessary\ncomponent of the optimal processing of substrates through HSP60 machinery [104]. ATP-\nbinding, followed by binding of HSP10 can induce processing of the unfolded protein\nwithin the central cavity of each ring subunit [102]. As a result, ATP hydrolysis induces\ndissociation of HSP10, ADP and the release of the folded substrate protein [102].\n\nThe molecular chaperone HSP65 is mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of non-mammalian\ncells, such as Mycobacterium species. HSP65 has a very similar structure and function\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 10 of 20\n\nto that of HSP60 and can form oligomeric aggregates within the cell as well as within\nthe extracellular space [105]. The homology between human HSP60 and HSP65 makes\nmolecular mimicry unavoidable, leading to an involvement in immune processes.\n\n2.10. Immune Responses Elicited through HSP60\n\nT-cell subpopulations and related responses are classified according to cytokine ex-\npression profiles and surface expression molecules. More specifically, T-helper 1 (Th1) cells\nproduce among others, IFNγ, GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor)\nand TNFα and promote a proinflammatory state. Whereas T-helper 2 (Th2) cells produce\namong others IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 and promote a tolerogenic immune phenotype [106].\n\nMolecular mimicry between endogenous and foreign peptides could induce autoim-\nmune phenomena [107]. Mycobacterial HSP65 undergoes a self-induced autolysis engaging\nMHC-I and MHC-II antigen processing [108]. HSP60/65 are HLA-DR binders and could\nthus ease client peptide presentation to antigen-presenting cells. This specific binding\nproperties of distinct HSP60/65 peptide regions induces TNFα and IFNγ production [109]\n(Figure 6a,b). There seems to be a differential T-cell reaction against indigenous com-\npared with exogenous HSP60. While mycobacterial HSP60 induces T-cell activation, the\nindigenous HSP60 induces T-cell anergy [110] (Figure 6c).\n\nCells 2021, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 21 \n \n\n \n\nP118-388 causes T-cell expansion while HSP65 peptide P180-188 does not inhibit autoim-\nmune arthritis [124]. Bacterial HSP65 protects against arthritis by inducting tolerogenic T-\ncell clones against self HSP60 [125]. C-terminal mycobacterial HSP65 causes cross reactiv-\nity against rat HSP65 in experimental autoimmune arthritis [126]. \n\n \nFigure 6. Immunomodulatory actions of HSP60/65. (a) HSP60/65 induce a Th2 cytokine response after stimulating \nTLR9/HLA-DR in antigen-presenting cells. (b) HSP60/65 induce a Th1 cytokine response after stimulating TLR2/HLA-DR \nin antigen-presenting cells. (c) Self HSP60 undergoes a complete antigen processing within antigen-presenting cells. This \ninduces Th2 responses and tolerogenicity. Non-mammalian HSP65 undergoes an incomplete antigen processing within \nantigen-presenting cells. This induces Th1 responses and autoimmunity. Non-self and self HSPs share a conserved amino \nacid sequence homology. Self-HSP60 can stochastically activate Th1-cell clones. This induces autoimmunity after stimu-\nlation with non-self HSP65 molecules. In the case of autoimmunity there can be a parallel production of anti-HSP60/65 \nautoantibodies. \n\nThe conserved sequences of self and non-self HSP60/65 seem to activate the immune \nsystem. Unanswered remains the fact concerning the exact amount of non-self HSPs that \ncould induce a cross-recognition reaction from the native immune system. It may be the \ncase that this could be organism-, disease-, tissue-, or target-HSP (or HSPs)-specific.  \n\nTable 1.

This induces autoimmunity\nafter stimulation with non-self HSP65 molecules. In the case of autoimmunity there can be a parallel production of\nanti-HSP60/65 autoantibodies.\n\nType 1 diabetes mellitus is an autoimmune disease [111]. In an experimental model\nof streptozotocin-induced diabetes, HSP60 inhibited diabetes progression by eliciting a\n\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 11 of 20\n\nTh2 response [112]. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice are a primary animal model for\nstudying autoimmune diabetes [113]. Immunization of NOD mice with a HSP60-p277\npeptide, also induces a Th2 response with the subsequent production of IL-4 and IL-10.\nThis is accompanied by reduced immune reactivity against HSP60 through Th1 response\ndownregulation [114]. Immunization with mycobacterial HSP65 has been shown to prevent\nautoimmune diabetes in NOD mice [115]. On the other hand, HSP60 induced T-cell\nstimulation which was associated with diabetes aggravation and anti-HSP60 antibody\nproduction in experimental models of type 1 diabetes mellitus [116].\n\nVascular-associated lymphoid tissue (macrophages, T-cells, and mast cells) is stim-\nulated by HSP60 exposure. This stimulation could aggravate atherosclerosis [117]. Au-\ntoantibodies against HSP60 were detected after chlamydial infection in cholesterol-fed\nC57Bl/6 mice and subendothelial accumulation of foam cells was observed [118].\n\nAutoantibodies against HSPs indicate the involvement of humoral immunity in the\nresponse induced by HSPs (Table 1). However, it seems apparent that specific subsets of\nB-lymphocytes are involved [119]. Anti-HSP60 protein antibodies are present in patients\nwith rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Sjögren syndrome, and undifferentiated connective tissue\ndisease [120–122] (Table 1).\n\nIn a rat arthritis model, HSP60 induces a TLR9-mediated T-regulatory cell (CD4+,\nFoxP3+) proliferation leading to IL-10 production. Rats treated with a HSP60 showed\ngreater amount of T-regulatory cells in the joint-draining lymph nodes and had lower\narthritis activity scores [123] (Table 2). There are specific domains of HSP65, which exert\ntheir immunomodulatory action in autoimmune arthritis; for example, HSP65 peptide P118-\n388 causes T-cell expansion while HSP65 peptide P180-188 does not inhibit autoimmune\narthritis [124]. Bacterial HSP65 protects against arthritis by inducting tolerogenic T-cell\nclones against self HSP60 [125]. C-terminal mycobacterial HSP65 causes cross reactivity\nagainst rat HSP65 in experimental autoimmune arthritis [126].\n\nTable 1.

Unanswered remains the fact concerning the exact amount of non-self HSPs that\ncould induce a cross-recognition reaction from the native immune system. It may be the\ncase that this could be organism-, disease-, tissue-, or target-HSP (or HSPs)-specific.\n\n3. Therapeutic Implications\n\nAs of today, there are at least 54 studies concerning therapeutic applications of heat-\nshock proteins (source: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, accessed on 18 August 2021). The vast\nmajority of those completed, did not concern autoimmune disorders per se. Of those\nactively recruiting or ongoing, none concern autoimmune disorders. This observation\ndenotes not only the necessity for establishing new treatment strategies but also the com-\nplexity of the heat-shock-protein system itself. A multimodal approach which targets\nmultiple heat-shock proteins and components of the immune system may be necessary.\nGiven the fact that the heat-shock-protein system produces an effect in multiple levels\nof the immune system, the effects of a heat-shock-protein driven intervention might be\ntime demanding. In the aforementioned paradigms, HSPs undergo control at the level of\ngene expression both by components of the immune system and also by external stimuli.\nPossible gene polymorphisms of heat-shock response genes might help us individualize\nfuture treatments. Given the fact that heat-shock proteins finely modulate immune re-\nsponses one may have to examine the combined effect of heat-shock response and other\nimmunomodulatory agents.\n\nAt last, but not least, heat-shock proteins can help us drive therapy in various au-\ntoimmune diseases. There is relative new knowledge that heat-shock proteins are unique\nbiomarkers of disease (the paradigm of fibrillary glomerulonephritis and the HSP40 iso-\nform DNAJB9). Taking this idea one step further, one could use the tissue signature of\nHSP-system components for guiding therapy in various autoimmune diseases. Utilizing\nproteomic analysis or immunohistochemistry, HSPs that are uniquely expressed at the\ntissue level in specific disease stages can guide the intensity as well as the modalities of\nimmunosuppressive therapy.\n\nhttps://clinicaltrials.gov/\n\n\nCells 2021, 10, 2626 14 of 20\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nIt is the very nature of the immune response that is characterized by plasticity. This\nplasticity is depicted in the case of HSPs:\n\n(1) Through molecular mimicry in cases of microbial or mycobacterial infection. In-\nfection causes exposure of non-self-antigens to the immune system. The evolutionary\nconservation of heat-shock proteins induces cross-reactivity with self HSP antigens.\n\n(2) Through induction of different signaling pathways via a plethora of membrane\nreceptors and client peptides. HSPs act as vehicles which present self-antigens to immune\ncells. Specific domains within the HSP molecule are responsible for effective antigen pre-\nsentation. The degree of antigen processing within antigen-presenting cells guides not only\nthe intensity of immune response but also whether this response leads to autoimmunity or\nimmunoregulation. Making things even more complicated, different receptors (MHC-II,\nTLR, etc.), upon stimulation with different HSPs, produce different immune responses.\nIt seems therefore that the HSP system is dependent on external stimuli and the tissue\nmicroenvironment. Immune responses can be finely tuned through exposure to HSPs.\nAltogether, the above points pose an intriguing endeavor in understanding immunity and\nplanning future therapeutic strategies for autoimmune diseases.\n\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at https://www.mdpi.com/article/\n10.3390/cells10102626/s1, Table S1: Nomenclature of human small HSP family gene members\n(modified according to Kampinga et al.
