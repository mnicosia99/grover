Friedman\n\nPathology Department, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY\n\nPrior studies had shown that the Mirk/dyrk1B gene is amplified/upregulated in about 75% of ovarian cancers, that protein levels\n\nof this kinase are elevated in quiescent G0 cells and that Mirk maintains tumor cells in quiescence by initiating rapid degradation\n\nof cyclin D isoforms and by phosphorylation of a member of the DREAM complex. Depletion of Mirk/dyrk1B led to increased\n\ncyclin D levels, an elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) content and loss of viability. However, many normal cells in vivo are\n\nquiescent, and therefore, targeting a kinase found in quiescent cells might be problematic. In our study, Mirk kinase activity was\n\nfound to be higher in ovarian cancer cells than in normal cells. Pharmacological inhibition of Mirk/dyrk1B kinase increased cyclin\n\nD levels both in quiescent normal diploid cells and in quiescent CDKN2A-negative ovarian cancer cells, but led to more active\n\nCDK4/cyclin D complexes in quiescent ovarian cancer cells, allowing them to escape G0/G1 quiescence, enter cycle with high\n\nROS levels and undergo apoptosis. The ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine reduced both the amount of cleaved poly(ADP-ribose)\n\npolymerase (PARP) and the extent of cancer cell loss. In contrast, normal cells were spared because of their expression of cyclin\n\ndirected kinase (CDK) inhibitors that blocked unregulated cycling. Quiescent early passage normal ovarian epithelial cells and two\n\nstrains of quiescent normal diploid fibroblasts remained viable after the inhibition of Mirk/dyrk1B kinase, and the few cells that\n\nleft G0/G1 quiescence were accumulated in G21M. Thus, inhibition of Mirk kinase targeted quiescent ovarian cancer cells.\n\nThe Minibrain/dyrk protein kinase family member Mirk/\ndyrk1B1–3 is an effector for both oncogenic K-ras and H-ras\nthrough a Rac1 to MKK3 pathway and can also be activated\nby cellular stresses like the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluo-\nrouracil that activates MKK3.4–7 Mirk expression levels are\nvery low in most normal cell types except for skeletal mus-\ncle,8 suggesting that this kinase has a noncritical function in\nmost normal cells. Mirk is upregulated or amplified in a large\nsubset of ovarian cancers compared to normal ovarian\ntissue.9 Mirk is one of the 16 genes within a consistently\namplified 660-kb subregion of the 19q13 amplicon found in\npancreatic cancers10 and ovarian cancers,11 suggesting selec-\ntion for this gene. Mirk depletion leads to increased ROS\nlevels in pancreatic cancer and in colon cancer cells.12 Simi-\nlarly, depletion of Mirk in each of four ovarian cancer cell\nlines increased their intracellular levels of ROS, sensitizing\nthem to cisplatin that itself raises ROS levels.13 The combined\neffect of Mirk depletion and low cisplatin levels was sufficient\n\nto kill the tumor cells, suggesting that Mirk may be an attrac-\ntive target in ovarian cancers.13 However, subsequent studies\nshowed that Mirk levels varied widely during cell cycling\nwith the greatest protein levels found in ovarian cancer cells\nmade quiescent by serum starvation or growth to high cell\ndensity.9 A re-examination of the experimental conditions in\nthe cisplatin studies revealed that several were performed in\nserum-free culture or over a several day growth period that\nled to high cell density,9 suggesting that most of the ovarian\ncancer cells were quiescent when Mirk depletion sensitized\nthem to cisplatin. The significance of quiescence to Mirk\nresponse was troubling, as many normal cells in the body are\nquiescent, except the hematopoietic system and the gut epi-\nthelium. When a Mirk kinase inhibitor was tested on pancre-\natic and colon cancer cells in a recent study,14 normal non-\nimmortalized epithelium from either of these human tissues\nwas not studied in parallel, as such tissue is not readily avail-\nable and is difficult to maintain in tissue culture. In contrast,\nnormal nonimmortalized ovarian diploid epithelial cells are\ncommercially available and can be cultured. In our study, the\neffects of pharmacological inhibition of Mirk kinase are com-\npared in these normal ovarian cells, two diploid fibroblast\nstrains and in ovarian cancer cells under culture conditions\nwhere cells entered a reversible quiescent state.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nMaterials\n\nCell lines and strains were obtained from the ATCC, and\nfresh cells were taken from frozen stocks negative for myco-\nplasma, on average every 3 months.

Flow cytometry after propidium iodide\nstaining and Western blotting were performed as detailed,9\n\nwith antibodies to cleaved caspase-3 (#9661) from Cell Signal-\ning, Beverly, MA, agarose conjugate to CDK4 sc-23896AC, sc-\n8396 to cyclin D1, sc-182 to cyclin D3, sc-528 to p27 and sc-\n1616 to actin from Santa Cruz Biotech, Santa Cruz, CA and to\nphosphorylated H2AX from Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD. For\nthe determination of DNA and RNA content to distinguish G0\nfrom G1 cells, two-parameter cell cycle analysis was performed\non cells fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol and then washed.\nHoechst 33258 was added to bind to DNA and block DNA\nstaining by Pyronin Y, followed by Pyronin Y to bind to RNA\nexactly as detailed.12 Mirk kinase inhibitor RO5454948 was\nprovided by Hoffmann La Roche (Nutley, NJ). Its chemical\nstructure, similar IC50 values on purified dyrk1B and the\nclosely related dyrk1A, selectivity in a screen of 49 protein ki-\nnases and biological effects on pancreatic and colon cancer cells\nwere recently reported.14 RO5454948 only affected cell cycling\nin colon cancer cells if Mirk/dyrk1B was expressed, having no\neffect on the cycling of HCT116 colon cancer cells that express\nonly dyrk1A, while leading more SW620 colon cancer cells,\nwhich express both dyrk1B and dyrk1A, to enter cycle and\nincorporate BrdU.14\n\nMirk kinase assay\n\nLog-phase cells or cells made quiescent by serum-free culture\nfor 4 days were lysed in modified ice-cold RIPA buffer called\nIP buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1%\nNP40, 10% glycerol, 1 protease inhibitor tablet (Roche) and\nphosphatase inhibitor cocktails 1 and II diluted from 100�\nstocks]. About 300 lg lysate was incubated with 2 lg/5 ll\nanti-Mirk C0-terminal peptide polyclonal antibody overnight\nat 4�C and with 20 ll protein G-agarose added for 2 hr at\n4�C. The agarose complexes were washed three times with IP\n\nbuffer and then three times with kinase buffer (50 mM Tris-\nHCl pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT). Incubation contin-\nued for 15 min at 30�C in 20 ll kinase buffer containing 50\nlM cold ATP, 5 lCi 32P-cATP and 2 lg myelin basic pro-\ntein substrate. The reaction was stopped by the addition of\n2� SDS sample buffer and boiling. The samples were\nanalyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide gels, followed by\nautoradiography and Western blotting for Mirk.\n\nROS measurements\n\nTotal ROS was measured by dichlorodihydrofluorescein diace-\ntate (DCFA) metabolism; ROS superoxide levels were measured\nby dihydroethidium fluorochrome metabolism, and nitric oxide\nlevels were measured by diaminofluorescein metabolism. Cells\nwere plated at 4 � 105 per six-well plate, changed to serum-\nfree DMEM and then treated with 0.5 lM RO5454948 for 1\nday or 2–3 days, with a fresh media change daily.\n\nResults\nQuiescent ovarian cancer cells have higher levels of\n\nMirk/dyrk1B protein and are more sensitive to Mirk\n\nkinase inhibition than proliferating cells\n\nQuiescent tumor cells are generally more resistant to chemo-\ntherapeutic drugs and radiation than cycling cells and can\nrepopulate the tumor in a favorable microenvironment. A drug\ntargeting quiescent tumor cells could have clinical utility. Mirk\nand p130/Rb2 were shown to mediate quiescence in ovarian\ncancer cells by depletion studies.9 Quiescence is maintained by\nthe DREAM complex (p130/Rb2, E2F4, DP1 and a stable core\nincluding the LIN52 protein), which disassembles when cells\nleave quiescence and enter cycle. In quiescent cells, Mirk/\ndyrk1B and the closely related Dyrk1A phosphorylate the core\nprotein LIN52 at a site necessary for its quiescence function.15\n\nMirk also blocks cells in quiescence by initiating cyclin D turn-\nover by phosphorylation at an ubiquitination site conserved in\nall isoforms.16 TOV21G, SKOV3 and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer\ncells could serve as model cell lines to study drug targeting in\nquiescent cells because these lines were shown to enter a viable\nreversible quiescent state when deprived of growth factors,\nwhereas other ovarian cancer lines such as OVCAR4 under-\nwent cell death by autophagy.9\n\nAs a first step, quiescent cultures were confirmed to con-\ntain a high proportion of G0 cells and a low proportion of S\nphase cells. Two-parameter flow cytometry for both DNA\nand RNA was used to distinguish G1 cells from G0 cells,\nwhich have lower RNA levels because of polyribosome\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nChemotherapeutic drugs and radiation are more toxic to cycling than quiescent cancer cells. Quiescent ovarian cancer cells\n\nare enriched in the Mirk/dyrk1B kinase, which may be a therapeutic target if normal quiescent diploid cells are not affected.\n\nThe authors show that Mirk/dyrk1B inhibition elevated cyclin D levels, allowing cancer cells to escape G0/G1 quiescence and\n\nenter the cell cycle with high ROS levels and DNA damage, leading to cell death. The same treatment in normal quiescent\n\ndiploid cells had little effect on cell viability, underscoring the therapeutic potential of Mirk/dyrk1B inhibition in cancer cells.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nHu et al. 2259\n\nInt.

G0 cells and S phase cells were 75 and 1%,\nrespectively, in quiescent TOV21G cultures, whereas in\ncycling cultures, G0 and S phase cells were 17 and 26%,\nrespectively (Fig. 1a). SKOV3 cultures exhibited similar\ndistributions, as seen earlier.9\n\nMirk/dyrk1B is an unusual kinase in that its expression\nand protein abundance vary widely during the cell cycle, with\nlow levels in S phase because of downregulation through\nMEK/Erk signaling17 and significant upregulation when cells\nenter G0/early G1 quiescence.9,18 As Mirk/dyrk1B protein\nlevels were upregulated threefold to fourfold in the quiescent\novarian cancer cultures (Fig. 1a), we asked whether inhibition\nof this kinase would have greater toxicity in quiescent cul-\ntures. When quiescent, both TOV21G cultures (Fig. 1a) and\nSKOV3 cultures (data not shown) were twofold to threefold\nmore sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of Mirk by the\nsmall-molecule inhibitor RO5454948, with EC50 levels of 0.8–\n0.9 lM compared to about 2 lM for proliferating cells. We\nnext examined whether the decreased cell number after Mirk\nkinase inhibition was due to growth arrest or induction of\napoptosis.\n\nThe ability of ovarian cancer cells to escape quiescence\n\nand enter cycle after Mirk kinase inhibition was examined\n\nby flow cytometry\n\nMany cell manipulations are required for two-parameter flow\ncytometry, which could cause loss of sub-G0/G1 apoptotic\ncells, and therefore, the analysis of ovarian cancer cells was\ncarried out by one-parameter flow cytometry, measuring\nDNA content after propidium iodide staining. Both TOV21G\nand SKOV3 cells were observed to slip out of quiescence into\ncycle when treated with the Mirk inhibitor at about their\nEC50 levels, as shown by an increased fraction of S and\nG2þM cells. This was more pronounced in the p53-null\nSKOV3 cells compared to the p53 wild-type TOV21G cells.\nHowever, sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cells (Fig. 1b, arrows) were\nobserved after 2–4 days of treatment of both lines with the\nMirk kinase inhibitor. By 4 days, apoptotic cells comprised\n15–25% of the either tumor cell population. These lines differ\nin cell cycle regulators that control G0 to G1 to S cycling,\nwith TOV21G wild-type in p53 expressing p21 but not p16\nand SKOV3 p53 null expressing neither p21 nor p16 (data\nnot shown).19–21 As SKOV3 cells express fewer CDK inhibi-\ntors, it may be easier for SKOV3 cells than TOV21G cells to\ntraverse G1, enter S prematurely and die after release from\nG0 quiescence by Mirk inhibition.\n\nCancer cells express higher Mirk protein levels\n\nand kinase activity\n\nWould normal diploid cells exhibit less response to Mirk\nkinase inhibition because they expressed little Mirk protein?\nTOV21G, SKOV3 and OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, the\nHD and BJ strains of normal diploid fibroblasts and normal\novarian epithelial cells in early passage were made quiescent\nby serum starvation and then their Mirk protein levels and\n\nMirk kinase activities were determined. The cancer cells had\ntwofold to 17-fold higher levels of Mirk protein than the nor-\nmal diploid cells (Fig. 1c). The OVCAR3 cells with a 20-fold\namplified Mirk gene9 expressed the most Mirk proteins. The\nkinase activity was determined by an in vitro kinase assay of\nimmunoprecipitated Mirk on the exogenous substrate MBP\nand then normalized to the amount of immunoprecipitated\nMirk [Fig. 1c, lower panel; note that twice as much as Mirk\nprotein was present in SKOV3 cells than the normal epithe-\nlium (upper panel), and thus, SKOV3 cells had twice the\ntotal kinase activity]. As Mirk kinase activity was higher in\nthe cancer cells than the normal diploid cells, pharmacologi-\ncal inhibition of Mirk might lead to larger changes in the\ncancer cells.\n\nMirk kinase inhibition has little effect in\n\nnormal diploid cells\n\nMany normal cells in the body are quiescent, thus, targeting\nMirk might allow them to escape quiescence. Normal diploid\novarian epithelial cell cultures were made quiescent by culture\nin serum-free medium and treated with the Mirk inhibitor for\n2 and 3 days (Fig. 2a). The major effect of Mirk kinase inhibi-\ntion was to enable about 10–12% of cells to leave G0 (Fig. 2a,\narrowheads) and to increase the G2þM cell fraction from about\n20% to about 35%. Few cells were seen in S phase. About 70%\nof cells in the HD strain of normal diploid dermal fibroblast\nquiescent cultures were accumulated in G0 after 4 days of se-\nrum starvation, with about 10% fewer G0 cells in Mirk kinase\ninhibitor-treated parallel cultures (Fig. 1b, arrowheads). Mirk\nkinase inhibition moved about 8% more cells into G2þM.\nThus, the Mirk kinase inhibitor slightly reduced the fraction of\nG0 quiescent diploid epithelial cells and fibroblasts, whereas the\nmajority of the cells was pushed into cycle accumulated in\nG2þM. Apoptotic sub-G0/G1 cells were not detected.\n\nThe ability of normal cells to escape quiescence and\n\nbecome apoptotic after Mirk kinase inhibition was\n\nexamined by flow cytometry\n\nNo sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cells were seen by one-parameter\nflow cytometry after Mirk inhibitor treatment of two strains\nof human diploid fibroblasts, BJ and HD (Fig. 2c, only 3-day\npoint is shown) or normal diploid ovarian epithelial cells\n(Fig. 2c, days 2 and 3 are shown). Possibly, the Mirk kinase\ninhibitor preferentially damaged the cancer cells. To test this\nhypothesis, the drug was washed out and then the cells were\nplaced in fresh growth medium containing the mitotic inhibi-\ntor nocodazole to block any cycling cells in G2þM. After\nwashout of the drug, normal diploid BJ fibroblasts regained\ncycling with the same cell cycle distribution as untreated con-\ntrol cells. Mirk inhibitor-treated TOV21G ovarian cancer cells\nexhibited a slower traverse of the cell cycle, with many cells\nstill in G1 and S phase, whereas most control cells had cycled\ninto G2þM (Fig. 2d). Many sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cells were\nseen in the inhibitor-treated TOV21G culture before inhibitor\nremoval, and thus, the slower cycling after release might be\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n2260 Mirk/dyrk1B kinase inactivation in quiescent cells\n\nInt.

Mirk depletion was 60% in\novarian epithelium, 71% in BJ cells and more than 90% in\nHD cells.\n\nTotal p27 levels rose in only the normal diploid cells, not\nthe cancer cells, after pharmacological inhibition of Mirk ki-\nnase in time-course studies (Fig. 3a). The threefold to fivefold\nincrease in p27 levels after Mirk kinase inhibition was not an\noff-target effect, as depletion of Mirk by RNAi (Fig. 3b) also\nincreased p27 levels in normal diploid cells. This increase in\np27 only in normal cells led to a twofold to threefold\nincrease in p27 bound to CDK4/cyclin D complexes only in\nnormal diploid cells, not in TOV21G or SKOV3 cancer cells\n(Fig. 3c). These CDK4/cyclin D complexes in normal cells\nshould be inactive, unable to phosphorylate and inactivate\nthe DREAM complex component p130/Rb2 that maintains\nG0. In fact, treatment of BJ and HD fibroblast strains with\nthe Mirk kinase inhibitor did not decrease the amount of\n\nE2F4 coimmunoprecipitated with p130/Rb2 (Fig. 3d), consist-\nent with the lack of escape from G0 shown by most cells\n(Fig. 2b). In contrast, CDK4/cyclin D complexes in cancer\ncells treated with the Mirk inhibitor were expected to be\nmore active and capable of phosphorylating p130/Rb2 as\ncyclin D levels were increased, p27 levels were not increased\nand cells did not express p16, and in the case of SKOV3,\ncells did not express p21. Mirk kinase inhibitor treatment of\novarian cancer cells led to slower electrophoretic mobility of\np130/Rb2 consistent with increased phosphorylation, with a\nstronger response in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells that express\nfewer CDK inhibitors. In cancer cells, this caused disassembly\nof the DREAM complex, up to a threefold loss of sequestered\nE2F4 (Fig. 3d), and escape from quiescence (Fig. 1b). Deple-\ntion of Mirk had a similar effect, leading to increased phos-\nphorylation of p130/Rb2, disassembly of the DREAM com-\nplex and loss of sequestered E2F4.12 Thus, both ovarian\ncancer cell lines tested responded to the Mirk kinase inhibitor\n\nFigure 4.

Cancer: 132, 2258–2269 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nby loss of sequestered E2F4 (Fig. 3d) and escape into cycle as\nseen by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. 1b), and the majority of\ncells in both strains of normal diploid fibroblasts remained\narrested in a reversible quiescent state (Figs. 2b and 2c). The\nsmall shift of both normal diploid fibroblasts and ovarian\nepithelial cells from G0 into G2 with Mirk kinase inhibitor\ntreatment (Figs. 2a and 2b) might be due to a subpopulation\nwith increased cyclin D levels, which progressed to a func-\ntional G2 checkpoint.\n\nMirk kinase inhibition has differential effects on viability\n\nand on ROS induction\n\nThe HD fibroblast strain and TOV21G cancer cells were\ntreated with a series of concentrations of RO5454948 from\n0.1 to 5 lM, and then their relative viability was compared.\nThe HD cells were 94–99% as viable as untreated control\ncells, whereas the TOV21G cells lost viability beginning at\n0.5 lM, with only about 30% viable cells at 1 lM (Fig. 4a).\nIn parallel experiments, relative cell number was estimated by\nmetabolism of MTT. The normal fibroblasts reached a rela-\ntive cell number of about 70% of untreated cultures (Fig. 4b),\npossibly because the inhibitor blocked some cell cycling in\nG2þM (Fig. 2b). In contrast, the lowest concentration tested\nof 0.1 lM reduced both SKOV3 and TOV21G cell numbers\nto about half of untreated controls, whereas 1 lM reduced\ncell numbers to 17–22% of untreated controls. Thus, at 1 lM\nRO5454948, about 99% of normal HD fibroblasts were viable\ncompared to only 30% of the remaining TOV21G cells, as\nthe total cancer cell number had been reduced about sixfold.\nIn earlier studies, Mirk depletion by RNAi duplexes increased\nTOV21G cell death by 50% as assayed by dye exclusion,\nwhereas depletion of Mirk in BJ fibroblasts did not increase\nthe fraction of dead cells.9 Thus, inhibition of Mirk kinase\nactivity in normal cells and in cancer cells resulted in similar\ndifferential effects on cell viability as did these earlier studies\nwith Mirk depletion.9\n\nSelective killing of cancer cells by a small molecule target-\ning the stress response to ROS has been observed.22 Normal\ncells generally have lower ROS levels than cancer cells, allow-\ning a selective attack on cancer cells. Mirk depletion increases\nROS levels in cancer cells; however, the role of Mirk kinase\nin ROS handling in normal cells was not studied.12,13 Phar-\nmacological inhibition of Mirk kinase increased total ROS\nlevels, as assayed by the DCFA fluorochrome, up to twofold\nboth in SKOV3 cells and in TOV21G cells in time-course\nexperiments (Fig. 4c) and in dose-response studies (not\nshown). A twofold increase in total ROS was about the maxi-\nmum that could be seen when Mirk was depleted from either\nline, as greater increases in ROS caused cell lysis.13 A roughly\ntwofold increase in total ROS in TOV21G cells by a 2-day\ntreatment (Fig. 4c) was followed by a loss in cells (data not\nshown) reflected in less total ROS after 3 days. The Mirk ki-\nnase inhibitor also increased ROS levels in the OV90 and\nOVCAR8 ovarian cancer cell lines (data not shown). In con-\ntrast, no increase in total ROS levels with Mirk kinase inhibi-\n\ntion was seen in either HD and BJ normal diploid fibroblasts\nor normal ovarian epithelium (Fig. 4d). Mirk depletion in\nSKOV3 cells decreased the expression of superoxide dismu-\ntase 2,13 so Mirk kinase inhibition should increase superoxide\nlevels. The levels of superoxide class of ROS, detected with\nthe dihydroethidium fluorochrome, increased in both\nTOV21G and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells treated over a 3-\nday period, but did not increase over control levels in either\nHD or BJ fibroblast strain (data not shown). The nitric oxide\nclass of ROS species was increased up to 250% in both cancer\ncell types, but was at control levels in the normal cells after\n48 hr of treatment (data not shown). Thus, Mirk kinase inhi-\nbition increased total ROS levels and the levels of superoxide\nions only in SKOV3 and TOV21G cancer cells.\n\nIncreased apoptosis markers in cancer cells compared to\n\nnormal diploid cells\n\nElevated ROS levels could cause DNA damage reflected in\ncell cycle checkpoints (Fig. 2d), greater abundance of the\nDNA damage protein cH2AX and increased apoptosis. These\neffects were observed in our study. Time-course analysis by\nWestern blotting demonstrated an increase in the apoptotic\nproteins cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP, coupled with\nan increase in the DNA damage protein cH2AX, in TOV21G\nand SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell cultures after 1–4 days of\ntreatment with the Mirk kinase inhibitor (Fig. 5a). There was\nno alteration in the amount of Mirk protein by the Mirk ki-\nnase inhibitor, as expected. However, there was little increase\nin either cleaved PARP or cleaved caspase 3 in either strain\nof diploid fibroblast compared to SKOV3 cells grown in par-\nallel conditions (Fig. 5a). Note that the BJ and the HD fibro-\nblasts had more actin than SKOV3 cells. The amount of\ncleaved PARP (normalized to actin) after 3 days of Mirk ki-\nnase inhibition in SKOV3 cells was 44 times higher than that\nin HD fibroblasts and 13-fold higher than that in BJ fibro-\nblasts. Similarly, after 3 days of Mirk kinase inhibition, the\namount of cleaved caspase 3 in SKOV3 cells was 49-fold\nhigher than that in HD fibroblasts and 14-fold higher than\nthat in BJ fibroblasts. Consistent with the differential effects\non induction of apoptotic proteins, diploid fibroblasts treated\nwith Mirk inhibitor grew very slowly, whereas there was a\nloss in cell numbers in Mirk inhibitor-treated ovarian cancer\ncultures (data not shown). The analysis of three additional\novarian cancer cell lines, OV90, OVCAR8 and OVCAR4,\nshowed that the Mirk kinase inhibitor increased the levels of\ncleaved PARP, cleaved caspase 3 and cH2AX in each line af-\nter 3 days of treatment (Fig. 5b). In sharp contrast, Mirk in-\nhibition induced no increase in the low level of cleaved\nPARP and no increase in cleaved caspase 3 levels in a strain\nof normal human ovarian epithelial cells in early passage\n(Fig. 5c). SKOV3 cells were treated in parallel, and lysates\nwere run on the same gel for an internal control. Thus, in\neach of the five ovarian cancer cell lines, the Mirk kinase in-\nhibitor increased apoptosis when tested at concentrations,\nwhich induced only 2–6% as much apoptosis in two strains\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nHu et al. 2265\n\nInt.

This strong difference and the relative viability\nstudies (Figs. 4a and 4b) may indicate a therapeutic window\nto use Mirk kinase inhibition as part of treatment of ovarian\ncancers in vivo.\n\nHistone protein H2AX molecules within the chromatin at\na double-stranded DNA break site become phosphorylated\non a serine near the carboxyl terminus. Many phosphorylated\nH2AX (cH2AX) molecules are found at such a break, creat-\ning a focal site for accumulation of proteins involved in\nDNA repair and chromatin remodeling within a short time\nof DNA damage.23 Both the Mirk/dyrk1B kinase inhibitor\nRO5454948 and Mirk depletion, either by induction of a\nstably transfected shRNA to Mirk exon 11 or by transient\n\ntransfection of RNAi duplexes to exon 5, induced double\nstrand DNA breaks identified by cH2AX in quiescent Panc1\npancreatic cancer cells.14 Likewise, Mirk kinase inhibition\nincreased the level of phosphorylated H2AX (cH2AX) in\nSKOV3 and TOV21G ovarian cancer cells with a maximum\nafter 3 days (Fig. 5a), as if the breaks were repaired or the\ncells had died and were lost to analysis. Mirk kinase inhibi-\ntion also increased cH2AX levels in OV90, OVCAR8 and\nOVCAR4 ovarian cancer cells (Fig. 5b). In both normal dip-\nloid fibroblast strains, an increase in cH2AX levels were seen\nafter 2 days of inhibitor treatment, followed by almost com-\nplete loss after 3 days of treatment, possibly indicating DNA\nrepair or cell loss (Fig. 5a). The Mirk kinase inhibition\ncaused little increase in cH2AX levels in normal ovarian\n\nFigure 5.

The Mirk inhibitor increased\nthe amount of cleaved PARP several-fold, whereas the addi-\n\ntion of NAC led to a dose-dependent decrease in cleaved\nPARP in both cell types (Fig. 6a). There was no alteration in\nMirk or actin protein levels used as controls. In parallel stud-\nies, the number of SKOV3 cells and TOV21G cells remaining\nafter Mirk inhibitor treatment was about one-third of control\nlevels (Fig. 6b). The remaining cells still exhibited some\nincrease in ROS levels over controls, 160% in SKOV3. Con-\ncurrent treatment with NAC prevented much of this cell loss,\nwith cell numbers of SKOV3 and TOV21G cultures at 87%\n(64%) of controls and 117% (613%) of controls,\n\nFigure 6. The ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) reverses the toxicity of the Mirk kinase inhibitor towards ovarian cancer cells. (a)\n\nQuiescent SKOV3 cells and TOV21G cells were treated for 2 days with 0.5 lM Mirk inhibitor, with parallel cultures also treated with 0, 0.5\nor 1 mM NAC the last 6 hr of incubation, before analysis by Western blotting of the apoptosis marker cleaved PARP and as controls Mirk\n\nand actin. One of the two experiments is shown. (b) Parallel cultures to those in Panel a with 1 mM NAC were analyzed for total ROS levels\n\nby DCFA metabolism and cell numbers by direct cell counting.

The analysis of cell growth\nby MTT analysis gave a similar picture. The Mirk kinase in-\nhibitor reduced relative cell numbers from 10 to 17% of con-\ntrols, whereas treatment with the antioxidant NAC reversing\nsome of the growth inhibition, with relative cell numbers\nincreasing to 30% of control SKOV3 cultures and to 54% of\nTOV21G control cultures (Fig. 6c). Thus, NAC treatment\npartially reduced ROS levels, enabling more tumor cells to\nsurvive treatment with the Mirk kinase inhibitor, and demon-\nstrated that increased ROS levels led to cell death.\n\nDiscussion\nMirk/dyrk1B kinase is widely expressed at low levels in\nmost tissues, but is upregulated in several solid tumors\nincluding ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, nonsmall cell\nlung cancers, osteosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas.24–26\n\nThe study of Mirk/dyrk1B as a therapeutic target has some\nunique challenges. First, Mirk/dyrk1B is not mutated in\ncancer cells, like other kinases such as B-Raf in melanomas\nor erbB2 in breast cancers. Mirk activity appears propor-\ntional to its expression level, which is elevated in many can-\ncers, and is increased by upstream activators such as onco-\ngenic K-ras or H-ras, which initiate a Rac1 to MKK3 to\nMirk signaling cascade.4,5,7 Second, Mirk/dyrk1B functions\nprimarily in quiescent cells where it is transcriptionally up-\nregulated. Thus, the typical xenograft tests are untenable.\nUnder these conditions, tumor cell growth is rapid, and\nMirk protein levels are quite low (data not shown). No\nMirk function is known in cycling cells. Mirk associates in\nlarge-molecular-weight complexes in cells,27 possibly associ-\nated with its upstream activator kinases through association\nwith scaffold proteins like Han11,28 and is known to phos-\nphorylate a member of the DREAM complex that controls\ncell cycle arrest in quiescence.15 These DREAM complexes\ndissociate when cells enter cycle and Mirk protein levels fall\nsharply. Third, the choice of a transgenic mouse model is\ndifficult because many rely on strong promoters, which\nagain keep cells in cycle.\n\nAs a result of these limitations, this initial study has com-\npared three ovarian cancer cell lines, one with Mirk gene\namplification, to early passage normal ovarian epithelium and\ntwo strains of human diploid fibroblasts. These cells can\nreadily be placed into a reversible quiescent state in culture,\n\nthus, Mirk function in these different cell types can be com-\npared. Low Mirk levels8 and lack of oncogenic ras genes to\nactivate Mirk in normal cells suggests that Mirk will have\nmuch weaker activity in most normal cells compared to those\ncancers in which the Mirk gene is either amplified or Mirk\ngene expression is upregulated. Supporting this interpretation,\n20-fold depletion of Mirk in cultured diploid fibroblasts\nresulted in little loss of viability.5,9 Mirk is not an essential\ngene because embryonic knockout of Mirk/dyrk1B caused no\nevident phenotype in mice.29 Thus, inhibition of Mirk might\ncause few deleterious effects in normal tissue. In our study,\ntreatment with the small-molecule Mirk kinase inhibitor\nRO5454948 had a selective effect on quiescent cancer cells\nexpressing elevated levels of active Mirk kinase, allowing the\ncancer cells to escape quiescence with high ROS levels. These\nimproperly cycling cancer cells died by apoptosis, as shown\nby the appearance of sub-G0/G1 apoptotic cells, increased\nlevels of apoptotic markers and decreased cell numbers.\nBlocking ROS by a chemical antioxidant reduced cell loss,\nshowing the role for elevated ROS in loss of survival capacity.\nIn addition, p53 mutations have been found in almost all\nhigh-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas, indicating that\nstress induction of the CDK inhibitor p21 would be minimal,\nand one-third of cases had very low or no expression of\nCDKN2A (p16/ink4a).30 Thus, quiescent cancer cells in vivo,\nlike SKOV3 cells in culture, might be able to escape quies-\ncence in response to the increased cyclin D levels caused by\nMirk inactivation because the cancer cells lacked sufficient\nCDK inhibitors. Normal cells would be able to block cycling\nbecause of their expression of these CDK inhibitors. The lack\nof deleterious effects on normal cells by RO5454948 was not\nlimited to this Mirk/dyrk1B inhibitor. Another Mirk inhibitor\nwas administered to athymic mice by intraperitoneal injec-\ntion over a 2-week period at concentrations up to 10 lM and\nhad no effect on normal cell viability as judged by mouse\nweight, activity and general appearance (Friedman, manu-\nscript in preparation). Thus, Mirk/dyrk1B kinase inhibitors\nhave the novel property of targeting those quiescent cancer\ncells with high Mirk kinase activity and reduced CDK inhibi-\ntor expression.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health\n(5R21CA135164), the Jones/Rohner Foundation and the Schoeck-Blakely\nOvarian Cancer Research Fund (all to E.F.)\n\nReferences\n\n1.
