CD4+ FoxA1+ Treg cells appear as key regulators of responsiveness to therapy\nwith interferon beta (IFN-β) in RRMS patients. Data indicate that CD4+FoxA1+ FOXP3− Treg cells develop within the central\nnervous system (CNS), and a potential of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) in generation of CD4+FoxA1+PD-L1hiFOXP3−\n\nTreg cells from encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells.\nA CD4 co-receptor specific ligand, IL-16, governs trafficking and biological properties of CD4+ T cells irrespective of their\nactivation state. Functions of IL-16, relevant to Treg cells, include expansion of CD4+CD25+ T cells in long-term cultures\nwith IL-2, de novo induction of FOXP-3 and migration of FOXP-3+ T cells. IL-16 is highly conserved across species including\nhuman and mouse. CGN and neurons in hippocampus contain neuronal-IL-16 (NIL-16), splice variant of immune IL-16,\nand express CD4 molecule. In a CD4-dependent manner, IL-16 supports cultured CGN survival.\nConcomitant studies of RRMS lesions and corresponding MOG35–55-induced relapsing EAE in (B6 × SJL)F1 (H-2\n\nb/s) mice\ndiscovered similar roles of IL-16 in regulation of relapsing disease. In RRMS and EAE relapse, peak levels of IL-16 and active\ncaspase-3 correlated with CD4+ T cell infiltration and levels of T-bet, Stat-1(Tyr701), and phosphorylated neurofilaments of\naxonal cytoskeleton [NF (M +H) P], suggesting a role of locally produced IL-16 in regulation of CD4+ Th1 inflammation\nand axonal damage, respectively. IL-16 was abundantly present in CD4+ T cells, followed by CD20+ B, CD8+ T, CD83+\n\ndendritic cells, and Mac-1+ microglia. Apart from lesions, bioactive IL-16 was located in normal-appearing white matter\n(NAWM) and normal-appearing grey matter (NAGM) in RRMS brain and spinal cord.\nA cytokine IL-16 emerges as an important regulator of relapsing MS and EAE. Better understanding of immune\ncell-neuron interactions mediated by IL-16 will foster development of more specific CD4+ T cell subset-targeted\ntherapies to prevent or ameliorate progression of neuroinflammation and axonal and neuronal damage. Translational\nstudies necessitate corresponding EAE models.\n\nKeywords: IL-16, Multiple sclerosis, Cerebellum, CD4+ T cells, IFN-β, FoxA1, MOG, EAE, Translational, Therapy\nBackground\nDiscovery of a novel lineage of regulatory T (Treg) cells,\nwhich are CD4+FoxA1+, as major regulators of respon-\nsiveness to IFN-β therapy in patients with relapsing-\nremitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), is important for\nfurther optimization of this first in class disease-\nmodifying therapy (DMT).

To\ngain better understanding of complex cellular and mo-\nlecular interactions important for disease progression,\nsome fundamental mechanisms underlying MS immune\npathogenesis, reinforced by this recent finding deserve\nadditional attention and reappraisal.\nPrimarily, a potential of locally inflamed CNS micro-\n\nenvironment to regulate plasticity of CD4+ T cell re-\nsponses, by switching their functional phenotypes from\nencephalitogenic to suppressive, regulatory, FoxA1 me-\ndiated, appears vital for progression of the disease [1].\nLocally elaborated cytokines are critical regulators of\nl.

In progressive inflammatory disease,\nwhere inflammatory mediators are reoccurring, immune\ncell communications are likely diverse engaging in dis-\ntinctive types of relationships throughout RRMS and its\nconversion into secondary progressive (SP) disease.\nAdditionally, effects of IFN-β therapy regulated through\n\nCD4+ FoxA1+ Treg are shared mechanisms between\nRRMS and EAE [1]. Such approach further emphasizes im-\nportance of an appropriate EAE model when studying im-\nmune regulation of MS. In order to identify ongoing\nmodifications in intertwined shared regulatory mecha-\nnisms, it is critical for an EAE model to resemble the\nRRMS clinical course, histopathology and relevant immune\nmechanisms [2,3]. Immune regulation of relapse in re-\nsponse to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide 35\nto 55 (MOG35–55) is poorly studied due to a relative defi-\nciency of relapsing EAE in mice [4]. MOG is conserved\nacross species. An immunodominant epitope of MOG35–55\nis associated with autoimmune responses by CD4+ Th1 and\nTh17 cells and/or autoantibodies in RRMS and aquaporin-4−\n\n(AQP4−) relapsing neuromyelitis optica (NMO), respec-\ntively [5].\nFinally, data from co-culture experiments prompt us to\n\nquestion the nature of interactions between cerebellar\ngranule neurons and encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells, in\ngeneration of CD4+FoxA1+PD-L1hiFOXP3− Tregs [1]. De-\nmyelinating lesions in cerebellar cortex are prominent in\nprogressive MS [6]. Clinical signs of cerebellar dysfunction\nincluding nystagmus and ataxic gate accompany MS [7]. In\nhomeostasis, hippocampal and cerebellar granule neurons\nproduce neuronal-IL-16 (NIL-16), a splice variant of im-\nmune IL-16, which is produced by lymphocytes, macro-\nphages, DC, mast cells, and microglia [8-10].\n\nCommentary\nData from RRMS tissue analysis and relapsing EAE are\nconcurrent in identifying a CD4+ T cell-specific chemo-\ntactic factor, IL-16, as a key regulator of progressive\nCNS inflammation mediated by CD4+ Th1 cells.\nIn RRMS acute brain lesions, IL-16 was found in CD3+\n\nand CD4+ T cells, followed by CD20+ B, CD8+ T and\nCD83+ dendritic cells and Mac-1+ microglia. Often, IL-16\nlocated to cell cytoplasm, less frequently to cell nucleus,\nor polarized on the membrane connecting adjoining cells.\nThe majority of CD4+ IL-16+ cells were T-bet+ and active\ncaspase-3+. Increased levels of bioactive IL-16 correlated\nwith levels of active caspase-3, T-bet, Stat-1 (Tyr701), and\nphosphorylated medium and heavy neurofilaments of\naxonal cytoskeleton, [NF (M+H) P], which suggested a\nrole for IL-16 in regulation of CD4+ Th1 inflammation\nand damage of axonal cytoskeleton, respectively. IL-16 in-\nduces migration of CD4+Tbet+ (Th1) and CD4+FOXP3+\n\n(Treg) cells and FOXP3 de novo expression [11,12]. In the\nMS brain, highest levels of IL-16 were detected in chronic\nlesions, followed by subacute and acute. Conversely, in\nMS spinal cord, acute lesions contained highest levels of\nIL-16. Bioactive IL-16 was also detected in normal-\nappearing white matter (NAWM) and normal-appearing\ngrey matter (NAGM) in the brain and NAWM in the\nspinal cord. More robust increase of IL-16 was noted in\nthe spinal cord compared to brain NAWM. A sharp in-\ncrease of pro-IL-16 was found in NAGM in RRMS brain\n[2]. Data propose regional differences in IL-16 regulation\nin lesions between the brain and spinal cord and a role of\nbioactive and pro-IL-16 in pathology of NAWM and\nNAGM in RRMS.\nCorresponding to our findings of elevated IL-16 levels\n\nin situ, raised levels of IL-16 were detected in serum of MS\npatients. Following therapy with IFN-β1a, IL-16 gene ex-\npression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)\nand its serum levels were down regulated, suggesting IL-16\nas a potential biomarker for MS [13,14]. Myelin oligo-\ndendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-specific CD4+Th17 ex-\nhibited more pronounced IL-16 production compared\nto CD4+Th1 cells, implicating a role of IL-16 in the\nregulation of Th17 responses [14].\nConcurrent with RRMS findings, in relapsing-remitting\n\nMOG35–55-induced EAE in (B6 × SJL) F1 (H-2\nb/s) mice,\n\nintra-CNS production of IL-16 correlates with extensive\nCD4+ T cell infiltration, accompanied by phosphorylation\nof axonal cytoskeleton, which all peak during relapses and\nin chronic progressive disease. IL-16 and CD4 were co-\nprecipitated from CNS of relapsing H-2b/s mice. Data indi-\ncate that active caspase-3-mediated release of bioactive\nIL-16 from infiltrating CD4+ T cells supports progression\nof local inflammation by specifically enhancing trafficking\nof additional CD4+ T cells [2,3,15].\nAs opposed to low/non-relapsing parental, B6 (H-2b),\n\nin H-2b/s mice, immunization with MOG35–55 induces\nrelapsing-remitting EAE with extensive CD4+ T cell infiltra-\ntion, followed by Mac-3+ macrophages, B220+ B, and CD8+\n\nT cells. Induced autoimmune responses to MOG35–55 in\nH-2b/s but not in H-2b mice result in myelin-associated\nglycoprotein (MAG) predominated pattern of demyeli-\nnation, which is suggestive of oligodendrocyte dysfunction\nand/or damage [15,16]. A similar pattern of demyelination\nwas observed in the MS lesion subtype III, where pro-\nfound loss of MAG serves as an indicator of a distal oligo-\ndendrogliopathy [17]. MAG-predominated demyelination,\na decrease of NF160 axonal neurofilament, and a sharp\nelevation of PARPp85 suggested axonal dysfunction and ir-\nreversible apoptosis, respectively, and correlated with severe\nrelapsing disease in H-2b/s mice [16]. Relapsing-remitting\nEAE in H-2b/s mice may provide valuable insights into\nmechanisms of MAG depletion and oligodendroglial path-\nology initiated by autoimmune responses to MOG35–55.\nTherapy with IL-16-specific antibody diminished paralysis\n\n\n\nSkundric et al. Journal of Neuroinflammation  (2015) 12:78 Page 3 of 4\nand CD4+ T infiltration and abrogated demyelination and\naxonal damage in relapsing EAE H-2b/s mice [18].\nStudies from RRMS and corresponding MOG35–55-in-\n\nduced relapsing EAE in H-2b/s mice suggest a role of IL-16\nin neuron-immune cell communications in lesions of gray\nmatter, including cerebellar and hippocampal, and in adja-\ncent NAGM and NAWM (Skundric, unpublished). Cor-\ntical and subcortical, including hippocampal, grey matter\nlesions underlie cognitive deficits observed in MS [19].\nBeneficial effects of IFN-β therapy include potential\n\nlowering of probability of disease progression from RRMS\nto SP and development of Expanded Disability Status\nScale (EDSS) score [20].\nUncovering those IL-16-specific mechanisms is critical\n\nfor the development of new CD4+ T cell subset-targeted\ntherapies for MS and other chronic and/or progressive\ninflammatory and demyelinating diseases.\nConclusion\nData from FoxA1 co-culture experiments argue for the\nimportance of bidirectional neuron-immune cell com-\nmunications and underscore necessity for better under-\nstanding of underlying mechanisms, in particular IL-16\nmediated. Future studies in this direction are required for\nthe development of specifically targeted therapies aimed\nat preventing or ameliorating neuronal damage.\nDelineating differences in mechanisms of immune\n\nregulation between the spinal cord and brain is critical\nfor therapy of NMO and NMO-spectrum disorders\n(NMOSD) with predominate optic nerve and spinal cord\ndemyelination.\nDelineating molecular mechanisms enhancing migration\n\nof encephalitogenic CD4+ cells (Th1 and Th17), and Treg\ncells into the CNS throughout the disease, is essential in\nthe development of new therapy specific for CD4+ T cell\nsubsets for MS and similar inflammatory and demyelina-\nting diseases.\nAbbreviations\n[NF(M + H)]P: phosphorylated medium and heavy chains of neurofilament;\nAQP4: aquaporin-4; DMT: disease-modifying therapy; EAE: experimental\nautoimmune encephalomyelitis; IFN-β: interferon beta; IL-16: interleukin 16;\nMAG: myelin-associated glycoprotein; MOG: myelin oligodendrocyte\nglycoprotein; NAGM: normal-appearing grey matter; NAWM: normal-\nappearing white matter; NIL-16: neuronal IL-16; NMO: neuromyelitis optica;\nNMOSD: NMO-spectrum disorders; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear\ncells; RRMS: relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis; Stat-1: signal transducer\nand activator of transcription-1.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors’ contributions\nDSS conceived idea and wrote the commentary.
