ng mm–2 and a kd of 0.081 s\n−1 (Fig. 4B).\n\nWhen the two proteins were mixed, a Geq of\n5.95 ng mm–2 was reached. An apparent kd >\n0.0008 s−1 was determined by fitting a mono-\nexponential function to the dissociation phase,\nwhich is 3 and 2 orders of magnitude lower as\ncompared with the single proteins (fig. S7). Both\nSOPC and DOPS:SOPC bilayers showed no in-\nteraction with the control protein MBP (Fig. 4,\nA and B). Dissociation of bound CHMP2ADC and\nCHMP3DC in Hepes buffered saline (HBS) con-\ntaining 1 M NaCl revealed a kd ≥ 1 s\n\n−1, which was\nmuch faster than dissociation in HBS alone. In\ncontrast, the CHMP2ADC-CHMP3DC polymer did\nnot dissociate with a higher rate (kd ≤ 0.00046 s\n\n−1)\nin the presence of 1 M NaCl (fig. S7), indi-\ncating resistance to change in ionic strength.\nOnce assembled on membranes, CHMP2ADC-\nCHMP3DC did not exchange with soluble or\nmembrane-bound CHMP3DC (fig. S8). Thus,\nCHMP2A-3 complexes assembled on membranes\nin vitro in the absence of CHMP4-6 subcomplexes,\neven though yeast Snf7-Vps20 (CHMP4-6) com-\nplexes may recruit Vps2-Vps24 (CHMP2A-3)\ncomplexes to membranes in vivo (7).\n\nTo assess the influence of CHMP2ADC-\nCHMP3DC tubes on membrane shapes, we\nused large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) com-\nposed of DOPS:SOPC. LUV incubation with\neither CHMP2ADC or CHMP3DC had no ef-\nfect on their floatation in sucrose gradients (fig.\nS9, A and B), whereas preformed CHMP2ADC-\nCHMP3DC tubes restricted LUV floatation to\nthe middle of the gradient (fig. S9, C and D).\nNegative staining EM confirmed CHMP2ADC-\nCHMP3DC tube membrane interaction via their\nouter surfaces (Fig. 4, C and D). However, no\nsystematic remodeling of the LUV membranes\nwas observed. Potential membrane remodeling\nby the CHMP copolymer or vice versa was fur-\nther explored by assembling the polymer in\nthe presence of LUVs. Although CHMP2ADC-\nCHMP3DC assembly in the presence of SOPC\nLUVs had no effect on tube morphology (Fig. 4E),\nthe presence of DOPS:SOPC LUVs produced\nshorter tubes (Fig. 4F), displaying loose helical\ncoils (Fig. 4G) and cone-shaped tubes that ap-\npeared closed at the narrower end (Fig. 4H). Thus,\nthis suggests a mechanism where lipid interac-\ntion affects CHMP polymerization.\n\nBecause modified VPS4 and CHMP3 exert\ndominant negative effects on HIV-1 budding\n(8, 9, 17, 25) and cytokinesis (6, 18), CHMP2A-\nCHMP3-VPS4 complexes may catalyze a common\nstep such as membrane fission. The CHMP2A-\nCHMP3 polymer presents a membrane binding\ntopology that is inverse to that of dynamin mem-\nbrane complexes (26), which catalyze endocytot-\nic vesicle abscission (27). ESCRT-III coupled to\nVPS4 may exert a similar role in budding pro-\ncesses directed away from the cytosol. Thus, we\npropose that a helical CHMP2A-CHMP3 poly-\nmer assembles on the inside of a membrane bud,\nwhich may induce membrane deformation, lead-\ning to constriction and eventually abscission when\n\ncoupled to VPS4 activity, the only energy-providing\ncandidate in the pathway (2, 15) (fig. S10).\n\nReferences and Notes\n1. R. L. Williams, S. Urbe, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 8, 355\n\n(2007).\n2. S. Saksena, J. Sun, T. Chu, S. D. Emr, Trends Biochem.\n\nSci. 32, 561 (2007).\n3. J. H.

We show\nthat normal endometrial stromal cells contain a specific chimeric RNA joining 5′ exons of the\nJAZF1 gene on chromosome 7p15 to 3′ exons of the Polycomb group gene JJAZ1/SUZ12 on\nchromosome 17q11 and that this RNA is translated into JAZF1-JJAZ1, a protein with anti-apoptotic\nactivity. The JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA appears to arise from physiologically regulated trans-splicing\nbetween precursor messenger RNAs for JAZF1 and JJAZ1. The chimeric RNA and protein are\nidentical to those produced from a gene fusion found in human endometrial stromal tumors.\nThese observations suggest that certain gene fusions may be pro-neoplastic owing to constitutive\nexpression of chimeric gene products normally generated by trans-splicing of RNAs in\ndeveloping tissues.\n\nR\necurrent, specific gene fusions arising\nfrom chromosomal rearrangements are\ncharacteristic features of many neoplasms,\n\nespecially those having hematopoietic and mes-\nenchymal origins (1–6). In most fusions, recom-\n\nbination occurs within introns that interrupt the\ncoding sequences, giving rise to the expression of\nchimeric proteins (2). The prevailing view is that\nthe chimeric proteins resulting from chromosom-\nal rearrangements are entirely abnormal and have\nneoplastic effects leading to the growth and/or\nsurvival advantage of cells containing them.\n\nAn observation that seems at odds with this\nview is that chimeric mRNAs identical to those\nderived from fusion genes can often be detected\nin low abundance by reverse transcription–\n\n1Department of Pathology, Yale University School of Medicine,\nNew Haven, CT 06520, USA. 2Department of Obstetrics and\nGynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, NewHaven, CT\n06520, USA.\n\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The explanation generally\noffered for this finding is that specific chromosom-\nal rearrangements occur within small numbers of\ncells in healthy tissues but that the chimeric pro-\nteins generated by them are alone insufficient to\ndrive substantial clonal expansion.\n\nWe have previously described a gene fusion\ndue to a (7;17)(p15;q21) chromosomal trans-\nlocation found in about 50% of human endome-\ntrial stromal sarcomas (ESSs) (8, 9). The fusion\njoins the first three exons (from a total of five) in\nthe gene JAZF1 to the last 15 (from 16) in the\nPolycomb group gene JJAZ1/SUZ12. Expression\nof the chimeric JAZF1-JJAZ1 protein in cultured\nhuman embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells con-\nfers resistance to apoptosis and, when accom-\npanied by suppression of the unrearranged JJAZ1\nallele, increased rates of proliferation (9).\n\nWe examined normal human endometrial\ntissues for possible chimeric JAZF1-JJAZ1\nRNA, beginning with endometrial stromal cell\nlines. RNA extracted from the immortalized,\nnormal human endometrial stromal cell line\n(HESC) (10) was analyzed for the presence of\nJAZF1-JJAZ1 chimeric RNA by RT-PCR with\nprimers containing sense and antisense sequence\nflanking the site of joining between JAZF1 and\nJJAZ1 (11). A single amplification product\ngenerated by this reaction was identical in size to\nthat amplified from human ESSs carrying a\nJAZF1-JJAZ1 gene fusion due to the presence\nof a t(7;17)(p15;q21) (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR for\nthe JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in two additional, non-\nimmortalized primary cell lines derived from\nthe normal endometrial stroma of two other pa-\ntients amplified similarly sized products. Nucleo-\ntide sequence analysis of the RT-PCR products\nfrom each cell line yielded the same sequence of\nnucleotides at the JAZF1-JJAZ1 junction as was\nfound in RNA of tumors with the gene fusion.\nRT-PCR for JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA failed to am-\nplify products from the RNA extracted from a\nvariety of other epithelial and mesenchymal cell\nlines, all of which contained JAZF1 and JJAZ1\nRNA (fig. S1).\n\nTo investigate the specificity of the junction\nbetween JAZF1 and JJAZ1 RNA sequences in\nthe HESC cell line, we carried out detailed RT-\nPCR studies on RNA from the HESC cell line\nusing antisense primers for JJAZ1 exon 3 se-\nquence paired with six different sense primers for\nfive exons of JAZF1. With primers for the first\nthree exons of JAZF1, single products were ob-\ntained matching the sizes predicted for the join-\ning of JAZF1 exon 3 to JJAZ1 exon 2 (Fig. 1B).\nSimilar results were achieved when the sense\nprimer for JAZF1 exon 3 was paired with six\ndifferent antisense primers distributed among the\n16 exons of JJAZ1. These results are consistent\nwith the JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA joined at exon 3 and\nexon 2 of the respective genes being the only\nabundant JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in HESC cells.\n\nTo determine whether the JAZF1-JJAZ1\nRNA is translated into protein, we performed\n\nWestern blot analysis with JJAZ1-specific anti-\nbody on protein extracts prepared from HESC\ncells. This analysis detected a protein identical in\nsize to JAZF1-JJAZ1 protein detected in ESSs\n(Fig. 1C and supporting online text).\n\nThe detection of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in en-\ndometrial stromal cell lines was duplicated by\nRT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from formalin-\nfixed, paraffin-embedded tissues from normal\nhuman uteri. JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA was detected\nprimarily in endometrium from late secretory and\nearly proliferative phases of the menstrual cycle\n(Fig. 2A). No JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA sequences were\namplified from normal myometrium at any phase\nof the cycle (fig. S2).\n\nBecause of the general association of the\nJAZF1-JJAZ1 RNAwith endometrium from par-\nticular phases of the menstrual cycle, we inves-\ntigated the effects of steroid hormones on the\nproduction of the chimeric transcript in HESC\n\ncells. Low concentrations of progesterone seemed\nto slightly increase amounts of the JAZF1-JJAZ1\nRNA seen in the absence of added hormone,\nwhereas both estrogen and, at higher concen-\ntrations, progesterone suppressed detection of the\nchimeric RNA (Fig. 2B). These findings are\nconsistent with the results of analyses on endo-\nmetrial tissue, showing that JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA\nis present predominantly at the beginning and\nend of the menstrual cycle, when hormone con-\ncentrations are low.\n\nBecause normal endometrium is subjected to\nhypoxia and undergoes apoptosis during the late\nsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle, we in-\nvestigated whether hypoxia can induce produc-\ntion of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in HESC cells by\ntreatment with desferroximine (DFO), which\nsimulates hypoxic conditions. HESC cells treated\nwith 250 mMDFO for 8 hours showed increased\namounts of JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA(Fig. 2C).Another,\n\nES\nS\n\n-R\nT\n\ndH\n2\nO\n\nMa\nrke\n\nrs\n\nHE\nSC\n\nA\n\nJAZF1-JJAZ1JAZF1-JJAZ1\n\nB\n\nC\n\n300 bp\n\n  JAZF1-JJAZ1JAZF1-JJAZ1\n\nJJAZ1JJAZ1\n\nESSESS\nTumorTumor HESCHESC 293293\n\n81 kD\n\n107 kD\n\n1   2   3   4\n\n2 kb\n1.6 kb\n\n1 kb\n\n0.5 kb\n\n0.3 kb\n\nJAZF1\n\nJJAZ1\n\n85   6   7 9  10 11 12\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n7 8 9 10 1211\n\n0.2 kb\n\n0.1 kb\n\n3 kb\n\nFig. 1.

Analysis of the\nRNA in DFO-treated HESC cells by a nuclease\nprotection assay (fig. S3) indicated that some-\nwhat less chimeric RNA was produced in these\ncells than in tumor cells containing the JAZF1-\nJJAZ1 fusion, consistent with relative amounts of\n10 to 35% detected by quantitative RT-PCR. The\nnuclease protection assay also confirmed that\ndetection of chimeric RNA was not a methodo-\nlogic artifact associated with RT-PCR. Quantita-\ntive RT-PCR revealed that treatment of HESC\ncells with DFO did not appreciably change the\namount of either JAZF1 or JJAZ1 RNA (fig. S4),\nsuggesting that DFO raises the levels of JAZF1-\nJJAZ1 RNA by a mechanism independent of\nincreased transcription of the two genes.\n\nTo investigate whether JAZF1-JJAZ1RNA is\nproduced from a t(7;17)(p15;q21) in HESC cells,\nwe first showed that this cell line, which had not\nintentionally been cloned, had in fact originated\nfrom a single cell immortalized in culture (fig.\nS5). We then performed Southern blot analyses\nof HESC DNA by using probes that had pre-\nviously detected t(7;17)(p15;q21) rearrangements\nin ESSs. No rearranged bands were detected. Cy-\ntogenetic analysis of numerous metaphase spreads\nfrom HESC cells revealed no abnormalities in\nchromosomes 7, 17, or any other chromosome\n(Fig. 3A). Similarly, analysis by fluorescence in\nsitu hybridization (FISH) with pairs of bacterial\nartificial chromosome (BAC) probes for DNA\nflanking on either side the chromosome 7p15\nbreakpoint and separately the 17q21 breakpoint\ndetected no breakage in these regions of the\ngenome (fig. S5). Additionally, a probe consist-\ning of a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) that\ncontains DNA spanning the 7p15 breakpoint\n\nshowed no splitting of the fluorescent signal (Fig.\n3B). Finally, no superimposition of signals was\nobserved when probes for chromosomes 7p15\nand 17q21 were used together in FISH studies.\n\nTo investigate the possibility that (7; 17)(p15;q21)\ntranslocations or their equivalents arose in cells in\nculture at some point after immortalization, we\nsubcloned HESC cells by limiting dilution.\nThirty-seven subclones derived on average from\nhalf a cell per culture were tested for the pro-\nduction of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA. RT-PCR of RNA\nfrom these subclones detected JAZF1-JJAZ1\nRNA in all clones examined, and for most sub-\nclones, the amount of JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in-\ncreased when DFO was added to the culture (Fig.\n3C). Furthermore, analyses of all clones ex-\namined were negative for rearrangements at the\nchromosome 7p15 site by FISH with flanking\nprobes (Fig. 3D). Ten of these subclones were\nalso tested for rearrangements at the 17q12 site by\nFISH, and none of these showed abnormalities.\n\nGiven the evidence against DNA recombina-\ntion in HESC cells and the precise joining of\nsequences at exon boundaries in JAZF1-JJAZ1\nRNA, we reasoned that the mechanism most\nlikely responsible for production of this RNA is\ntrans-splicing of pre-mRNAs for the JAZF1 and\nJJAZ1 genes. To test this hypothesis, we prepared\nin vitro splicing extracts from the nuclei of HESC\ncells. Samples of this extract were mixed with\nsamples of a nuclear extract from a primary\nrhesus fibroblast cell line RF (12). RT-PCR of\nJJAZ1 intron 1 RNA sequence revealed that un-\nspliced pre-mRNAwas present in the HESC and\nRF nuclear extracts (fig. S7). Nucleotide se-\nquence analysis of exon 3 in the JAZF1 gene of\nRF cells showed two single base-pair sequence\ndifferences from the human JAZF1 gene that\npermitted both selective RT-PCR of any RNA\ncontaining either rhesus or human exon 3 and the\nability to distinguish between the products am-\nplified from these RNAs. With selective primers\nand conditions, amplification of RNA after incu-\nbation of mixed extracts yielded products in\nwhich RF JAZF1 exon 3 was joined to exon 2 of\nJJAZ1 (Fig. 4B). Sequence analysis of the RT-\nPCR products confirmed that the amplified\nJAZF1-JJAZ1 sequences contained exon 3 of\nRF JAZF1 (Fig. 4C). The amount of product\ngenerally increased when the HESC extract was\nprepared from cells cultured with DFO, although\nthe extent of increase varied considerably among\nexperiments. No product was obtained from ex-\ntracts of HESC cells or RF cells alone, or when\nadenosine 5´-triphosphate (ATP), an obligate\ncofactor for splicing, was omitted from the splic-\ning reaction. Similar results were obtained with\nextracts from the nonimmortalized endometrial\nstromal cell line, HESC-597 (Fig. 4D).\n\nTo study the mechanism further and to rule\nout the possibility of polymerase switching dur-\ning transcription, we carried out the in vitro trans-\nsplicing assay with HESC nuclear extract mixed\nwith purified RF RNA.

Trans-splicing of noncoding, leader exons\nto separately transcribed pre-mRNAs is common\nin certain lower eukaryotes, such as protozoa and\nnematodes (13–16). However, in vertebrates, only\na few examples of trans-splicing have been de-\nscribed (17–25), and most of these involve splic-\ning between pre-mRNAs of the same gene to\ngenerate mRNAs with duplicated exons (17–20).\nFor these reasons, trans-splicing in vertebrates\nhas sometimes been regarded as a nonfunctional\nby-product of a somewhat sloppy splicing sys-\ntem (26). This conclusion seems inapplicable to\nJAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA because the JAZF1-JJAZ1\nfusion gene is a recurrent finding in a high frac-\ntion of endometrial stromal tissues, and fusion\ngenes associated with chromosomal transloca-\ntions in cancer have repeatedly been shown to\ncontribute to the neoplastic phenotype of the\ntumors containing them (27, 28). Additionally,\nthe expression of the JAZF1-JJAZ1 coding se-\nquences in cultured cells has demonstrated ef-\nfects on cell survival and proliferation (9).\nWhether JAZF1-JJAZ1 protein in tissues pro-\nvides protection from hypoxia, to which endo-\nmetrium is subjected during the late secretory\nphase and possibly the early proliferative phase\nof the menstrual cycle, remains to be determined.\n\nThe mechanisms involved in the trans-\nsplicing of RNAs and the regulation of this pro-\ncess are unclear. Juxtaposition of the loci encoding\nthe RNAs that participate in trans-splicing would\nnot seem essential because in vitro splicing in\nnuclear extracts of RNAs at physiological con-\ncentrations was found to be efficient. These re-\nsults also indicate that cotranscriptional splicing\nis not an absolute requirement for trans-splicing.\nWhether in vivo trans-splicing of RNA tran-\nscribed from loci that participate in chromosomal\nrearrangements predisposes DNA at those sites to\nrecombination with or without prior intranuclear\ncolocalization of the loci will require further\ninvestigation.\n\nIn view of the regulated trans-splicing be-\ntween JAZF1 and JJAZ1 pre-mRNAs in normal\nendometrium, the t(7;17)(p15;q21) found in\nESSs might be considered a mutation that leads\nto constitutive production of the JAZF1-JJAZ1\nmRNA and its protein product. This relation is\nsimilar to that seen in other oncogenic mutations\nassociated with tumor development, namely, that\nmutations lead to overproduction or irreversible\nactivation of gene products rather than to creation\nof “new” genes, as the fusion genes resulting from\nmany chromosomal translocations and other DNA\nrearrangements have generally been thought to be.\n\nIf RNA products of fusion genes other than\nJAZF1-JJAZ1 also mimic normal products re-\nsulting from trans-splicing of pre-mRNAs, it\nwould explain the ability to frequently amplify\nfrom healthy tissues chimeric RNAs associated\nwith chromosomal rearrangements in tumors.\nConsidering the large number of recurrent gene\n\nfusions found in tumors, it would further sug-\ngest that trans-spliced RNAs may be relatively\ncommon in normal cells and tissues (support-\ning online text). At a minimum, the finding of the\ntrans-spliced JAZF1-JJAZ1 RNA in normal cells\nimplies a risk to inferring the presence of chro-\nmosomal rearrangements in tissue specimens for\nthe diagnosis and detection of cancer, especially\nin the context of minimal disease. Additionally, it\nis possible that drugs designed to target chimeric\nproteins produced by neoplastic gene fusions\nmay have toxicities due to inhibited function of\nsimilar proteins in normal cells.\n\nReferences and Notes\n1.

Tanner,1* Albert de la Chapelle1*\n\nMuch of the genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC) in humans is unexplained.\nStudying a Caucasian-dominated population in the United States, we showed that germline\nallele-specific expression (ASE) of the gene encoding transforming growth factor–b (TGF-b)\ntype I receptor, TGFBR1, is a quantitative trait that occurs in 10 to 20% of CRC patients and\n1 to 3% of controls. ASE results in reduced expression of the gene, is dominantly inherited,\nsegregates in families, and occurs in sporadic CRC cases. Although subtle, the reduction in\nconstitutive TGFBR1 expression alters SMAD-mediated TGF-b signaling. Two major TGFBR1\nhaplotypes are predominant among ASE cases, which suggests ancestral mutations, but causative\ngermline changes have not been identified. Conservative estimates suggest that ASE confers a\nsubstantially increased risk of CRC (odds ratio, 8.7; 95% confidence interval, 2.6 to 29.1), but\nthese estimates require confirmation and will probably show ethnic differences.\n\nT\nhe annual worldwide incidence of colo-\nrectal cancer (CRC) exceeds 1 million,\nbeing the second to fourth most common\n\ncancer in industrialized countries (1). Although\ndiet and lifestyle are thought to have a strong\nimpact on CRC risk, genes have a key role in the\npredisposition to this cancer. A positive family\n\nhistory of CRC occurs in 20 to 30% of all pro-\nbands. Highly penetrant autosomal dominant\nand recessive hereditary forms of CRC account\nfor at most 5% of all CRC cases (2). Although\nadditional high- and low-penetrance alleles have\nbeen proposed, much of the remaining predis-\nposition to CRC remains unexplained (3).\n\nwww.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 321 5 SEPTEMBER 2008 1361\n\nREPORTSCorrected 18 September 2015; see full text.\n\n o\nn \n\nJu\nly\n\n 1\n, 2\n\n01\n6\n\nht\ntp\n\n:/\n/s\n\nci\nen\n\nce\n.s\n\nci\nen\n\nce\nm\n\nag\n.o\n\nrg\n/\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n \n\nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/\n\n\n (5894), 1357-1361.
