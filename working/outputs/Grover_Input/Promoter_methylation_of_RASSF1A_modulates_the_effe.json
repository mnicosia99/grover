JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  41:  611-620,  2012\n\nAbstract. Docetaxel is one of the most commonly used chemo-\ntherapeutic agents in breast cancer. To avert from significant \ntoxicities with no clinical benefit, identification of predictive \nmarkers for response is one of the most important unsolved \nclinical needs. Therefore, the potential associations of RASSF1A \nhypermethylation and response to docetaxel-based chemotherapy \nwere evaluated, and the underlying mechanism was studied. The \nexpression of RASSF1A in breast cancer cell lines and tissues of \nnormal breast, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and breast cancer \n(n=45) was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blot \nanalysis. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the expres-\nsion of RASSF1A was frequently lost in primary breast cancers \nand human breast cancer cell lines, while normal breast tissues \nor DCIS displayed moderate to strong expression. Furthermore, \nquantitative methylation analysis of the RASSF1A promoter \nregion in 45 primary breast cancers revealed that RASSF1A was \nfrequently methylated in primary breast cancers (≥20% methyla-\ntion in 53% of the patients), and prospective analysis in patients \nwith locally advanced or recurrent breast cancer showed that the \nmean level of methylation of RASSF1A was significantly higher \nin patients who did not respond to docetaxel-based chemotherapy \n(30.6±8.5%) than patients with partial or complete response \n(20.1±11.2%, p=0.042). Finally, in vitro studies showed that \nRASSF1A had cooperative activity in suppression of cancer cell \ngrowth and proliferation by enhancing docetaxel-induced cell \ncycle arrest. Our results suggest that hypermethylated RASSF1A \n\nis an important modulating factor for the efficacy of docetaxel-\nbased chemotherapy in breast cancer.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBreast cancer is one the most common cancers in women \nworldwide as well as in Korea (1). Although treatment outcome \nof breast cancer has been greatly improved due to early diag-\nnosis and development of various targeted agents, prognosis of \npatients with locally advanced breast cancer still remains to be \nimproved. Recently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has increas-\ningly been considered, since the chance for breast conservation \nis significantly increased and the treatment outcome was similar \nto that in patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy after \nprimary surgery (2,3). Therefore, it is critical to identify biologic \nmarkers for response to commonly used chemotherapeutic \nagents in a neoadjuvant setting. To date, several studies have \nbeen conducted for the identification of the predictive markers \nfor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and some biologic \ncharacteristics of tumors such as hormone receptor status, \nHER-2 overexpression, and Ki-67 labeling index have been \nsuggested as potential biomarkers (4,5). However, none of these \nhas been proposed as a marker based on the biologically relevant \nmechanisms in their cytotoxicity for a specific chemothera-\npeutic agent. Thus, the multi-factorial molecular mechanisms \ndetermining chemotherapy response remain largely unclear.\n\nTaxanes, including docetaxel, in combination with other \ncyctotoxic agents or targeted agents are the standard treat-\nment for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancers. Many \nclinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the taxanes in \nthis group of patients, however, about 20% of breast cancers do \nnot shrink significantly or progress with neoadjuvant treatment \nand 30-40% of the patients who had residual disease ultimately \nget recurrent cancer (2,3). Therefore, identification of promising \nbiomarker which can guide physicians to select best treatment \nregimen is clearly unmet need in this era of personalized care.\n\nIn breast cancers, multitudes of genes are known to be \nsuppressed by epigenetic mechanisms in the promoter region, \nand RASSF1A is one of the most frequently silenced genes in \nthis type of cancer (6). Moreover, inactivation of the RASSF1A \n\nPromoter methylation of RASSF1A modulates the effect of \nthe microtubule-targeting agent docetaxel in breast cancer\n\nEUN YOUNG GIL1,5,  UK HYUN JO1,  HOISEON JEONG2,  YOUNG MI WHANG1,  OK HEE WOO3, \nKYU RAN CHO3,  JAE HONG SEO1,  AEREE KIM2,  EUN SOOK LEE4,  INSONG KOH6, \n\nYEUL HONG KIM1  and  KYONG HWA PARK1\n\nDivision of Oncology/Hematology, Departments of 1Internal Medicine, 2Pathology, 3Radiology and 4Surgery; \n5Graduate School of Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine; 6Department of Physiology, \n\nCollege of Medicine, Hanyang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea\n\nReceived February 7, 2012;  Accepted April 12, 2012\n\nDOI: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1470\n\nCorrespondence to: Professor Kyong Hwa Park, Division of \nOncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea \nUniversity Anam Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, \n126-1 Anam-Dong 5-Ga, Seongbuk-Gu, Seoul 136-705, Republic of \nKorea\nE-mail: khpark@korea.ac.kr\n\nKey words: RASSF1A, docetaxel, methylation, cyclin B1, breast \ncancer\n\n\n\nGIL et al:  RASSF1A AND DOCETAXEL IN BREAST CANCER612\n\ngene by the methylation is known as an early event in the \ncarcinogenesis of breast cancer (7-9), and recent studies have \nsuggested detection of methylated RASSF1A in serum or body \nfluids as a biomarker for early breast cancer development (9-11). \nFurthermore, there is a growing amount of data, demonstrating \nthat methylation status in the promoter region of RASSF1A is \nassociated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients (12-14) \nas well as patients with other cancers (15-18). Epigenetic or \ngenetic modification of RASSF1A gene may have effects on \nkey biological processes including apoptosis, cell cycle regula-\ntion, mitosis, and microtubule dynamics in cancer cells, which \nhave been shown in numerous studies (19-22). Our recent data \nshowed that RASSF1A protein enhances microtubule-targeted \ndrugs in inducing G2/M arrest in non-small cell lung carcinoma \n(NSCLC) cells (23), implicating RASSF1A in cytotoxicity of \nanti-mitotic drugs. However, only a few studies have thus far \nbeen focused on the biologic consequence of the methylation \nof RASSF1A in various cancer types (24,25), but not in breast \ncancer. Therefore, we hypothesized that commonly-silenced \nRASSF1A in breast cancer can modulate the response to the \nfrequently used cytotoxic agent, docetaxel.\n\nTo this end, we prospectively investigated the relationship \nbetween the methylation level of RASSF1A gene and response \nto docetaxel-based chemotherapy in patients with locally \nadvanced or recurrent breast cancer using methylation-specific \npyrosequencing analysis, and found that the mean level of meth-\nylation in the promoter region of RASSF1A showed a significant \nassociation with response to docetaxel-based chemotherapy. \nFurther in vitro study showed that RASSF1A had cooperative \nactivity in suppression of cancer cell growth and proliferation \nby enhancing docetaxel-induced cell cycle arrest.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCell culture and transfection. Three human breast cancer cell \nlines, ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 cells, were obtained \nfrom the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul, Korea). For transfec-\ntion, cells were transiently transfected with 1 µg of RASSF1A \nDNA (kindly provided by Dr S. Tommasi of the Beckman \nResearch Institute, Duarte, CA, USA) or the empty pcDNA 3.1 \nplasmid using the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, \nCA, USA). To generate cells stably expressing RASSF1A, \ncells were transfected and selected in geneticin (G418) (Life \nTechnologies Inc., Grand Island, NY, USA). Only low passage \ncells (passage <10) were used for experiments.\n\nPatients and tissues. A total of 45 primary breast cancer tissues \nwere obtained from newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who \nwere scheduled to receive docetaxel-based chemotherapy for \nlocally advanced or metastatic disease. Ten non-cancer tissues \nwere obtained from 5 patients with DCIS and 5 normal breast \ntissues from reduction mammoplasty. All patients gave their \ninformed consent, and the study was approved by the Ethics and \nScientific Committees of our Institution (no. 2008-267). Tissues \nwere processed and stored as frozen block at -80˚C or paraffin-\nembedded block in Korea Lung Tissue Bank (Seoul, Korea) until \nanalysis. Clinicopathological data involving age, TNM stage, \ntumor grade, ER/PR/HER-2 expression status, and response to \ndocetaxel-based chemotherapy were collected. Responders in \nthis study were defined as the patients who achieved a partial or \n\ncomplete response to chemotherapy, according to the RECIST \ncriteria version 1.1 (26).\n\nCell proliferation assays. Cell proliferation was assessed by \nboth colorimetric MTT assay and [3H]-thymidine incorporation. \nThus, each breast cancer cell line was incubated with docetaxel \nfor 48 h after 24 h of serum starvation. For the MTT assay, the \ncells were incubated for 4 h with MTT reagent and then lysed in \n50% dimethylformamide (DMSO) and 20% SDS-PAGE at 37˚C. \nOptical densities (OD) at 550 and 670 nm were measured using \na plate reader (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA), and differential OD \nbetween 550 and 670 nm (OD 550-670 nm) was determined. \nFor [3H]-thymidine incorporation assay, 1 µl of [3H]-thymidine \n(Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) was added per well and \nplates were incubated for 18 h. Then, cells were harvested in \na cell harvester, and radioactivity (dpm) was counted using a \nβ-counter. The results were expressed as dpm/mg protein or as \npercentage of the control (defined as 100%).\n\nMethylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis. Genomic DNA was \nextracted from control, 5-aza-deoxycytidine-treated (10 µM for \n3 days) cells using QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, \nValencia, CA, USA), by following the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions. Bisulfite modification of DNA (1 µg) was performed using \nthe EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit™ (Zymo Research, Orange, \nCA, USA). Based on the promoter sequence of RASSF1A, \nmethylation- and unmethylation-specific primers were designed \nusing Serologicals CpGware software (http://apps.serologicals.\ncom/CPGWARE/dna_form2.html) methylated, 5'-GCTAAC \nAAACGCGAACCG-3'; 5'-GGGTTTTGCGAGAGCGCG-3' \nand unmethylated, 5'-CACTAACAAACACAAAC CAAAC-3'; \n5'-GGTTTTGTGAGAGTGTGTTTAG-3'; product sizes 169 \nand 169 bp, respectively (PMID: 11333291). Bisulfite-modified \nDNA (2 µl out of 10 µl elute) was used for each PCR. All \nexperiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least \nthree times.\n\nQuantitation of RASSF1A promoter methylation by pyrose-\nquencing. Bisulfite-treated DNA from tumors was used for PCR \namplifications. Pyrosequencing was performed using the \nPSQ96ID system (Qiagen) including PyroMark Gold Q96 \nreagents. Primers were designed by the PyroMark Assay design \n2.0 (Qiagen). The primers amplify a stretch of the RASSF1A \nexon 1 (Ensemble ID: ENST00000266020). The primers target \nCpG regions within this stretch. PCR was carried out using 2 µl \nbisulfite-treated DNA under the following conditions: 94˚C for \n5 min, 45x (94˚C for 30 sec, 55˚C for 30 sec, 72˚C for 30 sec), \n72˚C for 5 min. Intactness of the PCR product was assessed by \nelectro-phoresis on 2% agarose gel (Seakem® LE Agarose, \nLonza) and subsequent ethidium bromide staining. The pyrose-\nquencing primers target a 46-nt segment, which lies within the \npreviously amplified stretch of RASSF1A exon 1 and contains \n7 CpGs(GTCGGGGTTCGTTTTGTGGTTTCGTTCGG \nTTCGCGTTTGTTAGCGT).\n\nImmunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Expression of \nRASSF1A protein in tissue samples and breast cancer cell lines \nwere determined with anti-RASSF1A monoclonal antibody \n(clone eB114, eBioscience, Minneapolis, MI, USA) as previously \ndescribed (27). The staining results were evaluated according to \n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  41:  611-620,  2012 613\n\nthe immunodetection of stain intensity and amounts of positive \ncells by two pathologists (A.K. and H.J.), who discussed each \ncase until they reached a consensus. The degree of staining was \nsubdivided as follows: the stain intensity could be from 0 to 3 \n(0, no staining; 1, focal or fine granular, weak staining; 2, linear \nor cluster, strong staining; and 3, diffuse, intense staining); and \nthe positive cells in the observed breast tissue samples ranged \nfrom 0 to 3 in percentage (0, no staining; 1, <30%; 2, 30-70%; \nand 3, >70%). The samples were scored by their summation: \n0-1 (-); 2-3 (+); 4 (++); 5-6 (+++). Any staining score 2 or above \n(+) was considered as positive expression.\n\nFor immunofluorescence, cells were plated on 18 mm \ncoverslips and treated on the next day with 10 µM 5-aza-deoxy-\ncytidine (Sigma Co., St. Louis, MO, USA). After 48-h treatment, \ncells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized \nin 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked in PBS/5% BSA. \nRASSF1A was detected using anti-RASSF1A (eBioscience) \nfollowed by incubation with fluorescent conjugated secondary \nantibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA). After \nwashing, cells were counterstained with 4',6-diamidino-2-phe-\nnylindole (DAPI) (Sigma Co.), mounted on glass slides, and \nexamined by a DP40 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nWestern blot analysis. The expressions of proteins were \ndetected using relevant antibodies (anti-RASSF1A, Cdk1, Cdk2, \nCdk4, cyclin B, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA; anti-cyclin \nD1, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA; anti-p21, Santa Cruz \nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). The collected cells were \nlysed with 10 µl of dilution buffer containing 20 mM 3-morpho-\nlinopropanesulfonic acid (pH 7.2), 25 mM β-glycerophosphate, \n5 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM dithioth-\nreitol, and protease inhibitors (100 µg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl \nfluoride, 1 µg/ml aprotinin, and 1 µg/ml leupeptin). The total \n\ncell lysates were resolved on 8-12% SDS-PAGE as previously \ndescribed (23).\n\nCell cycle analysis. The cell cycle distribution was determined by \nflow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide (PI) labeled cells. \nThus, cells were seeded at 1x105 cells/60-mm plate and treated \nwith docetaxel. The cells were harvested, fixed in 70% ethanol, \nand then stored at -20˚C. The cells were then washed twice \nwith ice-cold PBS and incubated with ribonuclease and PI. Cell \ncycle was analyzed by BD FACScan flow cytometry (Becton \nDickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and CellQuest software.\n\nStatistical analysis. Mean methylation level of RASSF1A \naccording to the clinicopathological parameters were analyzed \nby Student's t-test. A logistic regression model was applied \nto determine whether a factor was independent predictor of \nresponse to chemotherapy in a multivariate analysis. A two-sided \n0.05-level test was determined for statistical significance. All \ndata analyses were conducted with SPSS software (SPSS Inc., \nChicago, IL, USA).\n\nResults\n\nRASSF1A protein and mRNA expressions are downregulated in \nbreast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancers. Western \nblot analysis and RT-PCR revealed the loss of RASSF1A protein \nand mRNA expression in 3 breast cancer cell lines (ZR-75-1, \nMDA-MB-231, MCF-7) (Fig. 1A). Next, we evaluated the \nexpression of RASSF1A using immunohistochemical analysis, \nand Fig. 1B shows that benign breast tissues and DCIS tissues \nwere strongly positive for RASSF1A, whereas invasive ductal \ncarcinoma tissues were negative for RASSF1A staining. Further \nanalysis of primary invasive ductal carcinoma of breast revealed \nthat RASSF1A was lost in 27 (60%) out of 45 primary breast \nsamples (Table I), thus indicating that RASSF1A expression is \nlow or lost in many cases of primary breast cancer specimens \nas well as selected breast cancer cell lines. These results support \nearlier hypothesis that the loss of RASSF1A is one of the impor-\ntant events in the breast cancer carcinogenesis (7,8).\n\nRASSF1A promoter is methylated in breast cancer cell \nlines. Next, we investigated underlying mechanism of down-\nregulation of RASSF1A, and tested whether any epigenetic \nmodification regulates RASSF1A gene expression in breast \n\n  A\n\n  B\n\nFigure 1.

The 7 CpG sites were analyzed by methyl-\nation-sensitive pyrosequencing and a representative pyrogram \nis shown in Fig. 3A. Pyrosequencing showed that the mean level \nof methylation in 7 CpG sites in the 45 primary breast cancers \nranged from 1.08% to 59.8%, and 24 of 45 tumors (53.3%) \nexhibited a high level of methylation (>20%).

Furthermore, it is of an interest to note that the mean \nlevel of methylation in RASSF1A was significantly higher in \n\npatients who did not respond to docetaxel-based chemotherapy \n(30.6±8.5 %) than patients with partial or complete response \n(20.1±11.2 %, p=0.042; Fig. 3C).

Therefore, we transfected RASSF1A or control vector \nto the breast cancer cells (ZR-75-1, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7), \nand investigated whether reintroduction of RASSF1A had any \ngrowth inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells. As shown in \nFig. 4A, the number of round-shape cells which are typical \nfeatures of apoptotic cells was increased in RASSF1A trans-\nfected cells compared with the control vector-transfected cells \nand the effect was greatly enhanced after treatment of docetaxel. \nNext, the cooperative effect was confirmed in a proliferation \nassay showing that docetaxel induced a marked reduction of \n[3H]-thymidine incorporation in the cells stably transfected \nwith RASSF1A, compared with the control vector-transfected \n\ncells (Fig. 4B).

The result indicates \nthat the cooperative effect of RASSF1A and docetaxel is \naccompanied with cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. Further \nanalysis using western blot analysis showed that the cell cycle \narrest at the G2/M phase in the breast cancer cells was associ-\nated with the induction of cyclin B1, Cdk2 and p21 by both \nRASSF1A and docetaxel (Fig. 5B). Maximum cyclin B1, Cdk2 \nand p21 induction was observed when docetaxel was applied \nto the RASSF1A-transfected breast cancer cells, whereas Cdk1, \nCdk4, and cyclin D1 were greatly decreased when breast cancer \ncells reintroduced with RASSF1A were treated with docetaxel. \nThese findings indicate that the effects of RASSF1A and \ndocetaxel on the G2/M phase cell cycle arrest are associated \nwith accumulation of cyclin B1/Cdk2/p21 and suppression of \nCdk1, Cdk4, and cyclin D1 in breast cancer cells.\n\nDiscussion\n\nRASSF1A has been reported to be frequently silenced in many \ncancer types including breast cancer; however, the biologic \nrelevance in clinical standpoint has not yet been clearly char-\nacterized. Because there is a probability that unsatisfactory \nresponse in breast cancer treatment may in part be due to \nsilencing of gene, the role and clinical relevance of a frequently \nsilenced tumor suppressor gene, RASSF1A, was examined in this \nstudy. In the current study, we found that the promoter region \nof RASSF1A was frequently methylated in the primary breast \ncancer samples from 45 locally advanced or metastatic cancer \npatients, in good agreement with previous reports. In addition, \nwe showed that level of methylation of RASSF1A was indepen-\ndent factor for response to docetaxel-based chemotherapy in \n\nFigure 5.

Moreover, RASSF1A enhanced docetaxel-mediated \ngrowth inhibition by inducing cell cycle arrest and altering the \nlevel of related proteins. Our results demonstrated that meth-\nylation status of RASSF1A modulates the efficacy of docetaxel \nchemotherapy and regulates docetaxel mediated cell cycle arrest \nin breast cancers.\n\nThere are a few studies suggesting the methylated RASSF1A \nas a potential biomarker for poor prognosis in breast cancer \n(12-14). However, no biologically relevant mechanism, thus \nfar, has been presented. In this context, we showed herein that \nthe methylation status of RASSF1A was significantly associ-\nated with response to docetaxel-based chemotherapy: cell line \nstudies showed that RASSF1A per se had docetaxel-like effect \nin suppressing growth and proliferation of breast cancer cells \nvia inducing cell cycle arrest. Furthermore, cooperative activity \nof RASSF1A in docetaxel-induced cell cycle arrest could be a \npotential mechanism for differential response among breast \ncancer patients.\n\nDocetaxel is one of the prototype taxane and a front line \nchemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of breast, ovary, lung, \nand head and neck cancers. Despite of its widespread use and \nsuccess in clinical practice, there are significant shortcom-\nings including myelosuppression, peripheral neuropathy, and \nprimary or secondary resistance (30). Nevertheless, there is no \nrational biomarker for the identification of patients who are most \nlikely to respond to docetaxel. Of the predictive markers for the \nresponse to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, biology-based tumor \ntypes have been shown to be most consistent and reproducible \namong the studies (4). However, it is still unsatisfactory marker \ndue to strong heterogeneity within the subgroups. More mecha-\nnistic markers such as Ki-67 (31) and topoisomerase IIα (32) \nhave also been suggested as valuable predictive markers for \nresponse to anthracyclines and other chemotherapeutics. For \nthe taxanes, however, no biologic marker has been suggested \nfor the prediction of response based on mechanistic study. In \nthe present study, we found a significant association between the \nmethylation level of RASSF1A and response to docetaxel-based \nchemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or recurrent \nbreast cancer. Additional multivariate analysis showed that low \nlevel of methylation (<20%) in the promoter region of RASSF1A \nwas an independent factor for response to docetaxel-based \nchemotherapy after adjusted for ER, PR, HER-2, p53 immu-\nnoreactivity, and Ki-67 staining. Furthermore, the specific \nmodulating effect of RASSF1A on docetaxel-induced cytotox-\nicity was demonstrated in the cell culture system. Therefore, the \nloss of RASSF1A for the prediction of docetaxel-based chemo-\ntherapy also seems to deserve further investigation.\n\nIt is now well known that taxanes exert their anti-cancer \neffect by inducing mitotic arrest of cancer cells. When cells are \nexposed to anti-mitotics, they are arrested in mitosis and then \nundergo one of several fates; death in mitosis, unequal division, \nor exit without division (33). However, little is known about how \ncells respond to this prolonged cell cycle delay. Recent studies \nsuggested that commitment to mitotic exit is determined by the \nlevel of cyclin B1 in anti-mitotics exposed cells (34). Therefore, \nit seems important to define the factors that govern the degra-\ndation of cyclin B1 during a prolonged mitotic arrest. Notably, \nour present results showed that overexpression of RASSF1A \nin breast cancers induced the accumulation of cyclin B1, as \nobserved in docetaxel-treated cells in consistent with previous \n\nstudies (21,35). Furthermore, the accumulation of cyclin B1 in \nthe RASSF1A-transfected cells was significantly enhanced by \ndocetaxel. Thus, RASSF1A could be considered as one of the \nfactors controlling degradation of cyclin B1 during the mitotic \narrest which was induced by docetaxel in breast cancer cells. In \nthe present study, the accumulation of p21 and decreased levels \nof Cdk 1, Cdk 4, and cyclin D1 were also found to be involved in \nthe induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by both docetaxel \nand RASSF1A. In addition, decreased expression of Cdk 1 by \nRASSF1A might also contribute to cell death after mitotic \nexit, since Cdk 1 has been shown to inhibit caspase-9 (36). Our \npresent observations therefore show that RASSF1A might be an \nimportant biologic contributor to docetaxel-induced cell cycle \narrest and, finally, cell death in breast cancer cells.\n\nIn conclusion, the data presented herein led us to propose \nthat hypermethylated RASSF1A might be an important modu-\nlating factor for efficacy of docetaxel-based chemotherapy \nin breast cancers. We also provided mechanistic data that the \ntumor suppressor, RASSF1A, has a cooperative effect along \nwith docetaxel in inducing cell cycle arrest in breast cancer. \nOur results are expected to contribute to the identification of \nbiomarkers in predicting the response of breast cancer patients \nto docetaxel. Since our data are limited by the small sample \nsize and locally advanced stage cancers in most of the cases, the \nstatistical significances shown here are still marginal. Therefore, \nfurther research with a large number of clinical samples is \nneeded to confirm our results.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study was supported by a grant of the Korea Healthcare \ntechnology R&D Project, Ministry for Health, Welfare & \nFamily Affairs, Republic of Korea (A084400).
