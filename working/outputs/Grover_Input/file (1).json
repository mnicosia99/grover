Although this disease is related to oxidative stress and\ninflammation, it is not known whether these processes facilitate the memory impairment. Our objective was to\ninvestigate the performance of rat pups chronically injected with GA and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in spatial memory\ntest, antioxidant defenses, cytokines levels, Na+, K+-ATPase activity, and hippocampal volume. We also evaluated\nthe effect of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on theses markers.\nMethods: Rat pups were injected with GA (5umol g of body weight-1, subcutaneously; twice per day; from 5th to\n28th day of life), and were supplemented with NAC (150mg/kg/day; intragastric gavage; for the same period). LPS\n(2mg/kg; E.coli 055 B5) or vehicle (saline 0.9%) was injected intraperitoneally, once per day, from 25th to 28th day of\nlife. Oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers as well as hippocampal volume were assessed.\nResults: GA caused spatial learning deficit in the Barnes maze and LPS potentiated this effect. GA and LPS\nincreased TNF-α and IL-1β levels. The co-administration of these compounds potentiated the increase of IL-1β levels\nbut not TNF-α levels in the hippocampus. GA and LPS increased TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance)\ncontent, reduced antioxidant defenses and inhibited Na+, K+-ATPase activity. GA and LPS co-administration did not\nhave additive effect on oxidative stress markers and Na+, K+ pump. The hippocampal volume did not change after\nGA or LPS administration. NAC protected against impairment of spatial learning and increase of cytokines levels.\nNAC Also protected against inhibition of Na+,K+-ATPase activity and oxidative markers.\nConclusions: These results suggest that inflammatory and oxidative markers may underlie at least in part of the\nneuropathology of GA-I in this model. Thus, NAC could represent a possible adjuvant therapy in treatment of children\nwith GA-I.\n\nCitation: Rodrigues FS, Souza MA, Magni DV, Ferreira APO, Mota BC, et al.

The symptoms and\nsigns of GA-I are predominantly neurological and include\nseizures, dystonia, dyskinesia, memory impairment, and\nirreversible cerebral injury, especially during crises of metabolic\ndecompensation [5-7]. It is feasible that during these episodes,\nwhich usually follow infections or other metabolic stress\nconditions, the increased tissue levels of GA due to highly\naccelerated endogenous proteolysis may trigger molecular\nmechanisms leading to neurological dysfunction. In fact,\naffected infants may become debilitated and septic rather\nquickly [8], and sepsis may contribute to their neurologic\ndeterioration.\n\nAlthough the neurological disorders are prevalent in GA-I,\nlittle is known about the mechanism by which the accumulated\norganic acids lead to these alterations after infection process\n[9-11]. Memory impairment, studies have reported that patients\nwith GA-I present cognitive deficit [5-7] mainly after\nencephalopathic crises precipitated by a non-specific illness or\ninfection [10], which suggests a close association between\ninflammation and the occurrence of cognitive disorder in GA-I\nchildren.\n\nIn this context, studies have reported a correlation between\nelevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and cognitive\ndeficits after neuroinflammatory processes [12,13]. Moreover, a\nlarge number of cognitive disorders in humans and animal\nmodels are associated with elevated levels of proinflammatory\nmolecules, such as IL-1β and TNF-α [12-19].\n\nBesides neuroinflammatory processes, oxidative stress has\nbeen also implicated as an important causative factor in\nvarious neurodegenerative and neurometabolic diseases,\nincluding glutaric acidemia [9,11,20-22]. Although the\nmechanisms underlying brain damage in GA-I are not well\nestablished, growing evidence suggests that excitotoxicity\n[23,24], Na+,K+-ATPase activity inhibition [9,20], inflammation\n[11], and free radical generation [9,22] play a central role in the\nneuropathogenesis of the GA-I.\n\nIn this context drugs with antioxidant and antinflammatory\npotential could be consequently a promoting approach to\nneuroprotection in patients with glutaric acidemia [9,11,20,22].\nThis seems to be the case of NAC, an agent with antioxidant\nand antinflammatory properties, which inhibits oxidative\nmetabolism and decreases the release of proinflammatory\nmolecules [25-27]. Studies have also shown that NAC prevents\nmemory impairment in some experimental models [28].\n\nSince there is clinical evidence that infection and/or\ninflammation mediators facilitate metabolic crises and\nneurologic dysfunction (including cognitive impairment) in\npatients with GA-I, in this study we investigated the\nperformance of rat pups chronically injected with GA and LPS\nin spatial memory test, antioxidant defenses, cytokines levels,\n\nNA+,K+-ATPase activity, and hippocampal volume.\nFurthermore, we also evaluated whether NAC could improve\nthese behavioral, biochemical or structural changes induced by\nGA and LPS administration.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics Statement\nLaboratory experiments were performed in accordance with\n\nnational and international legislations (Brazilian College of\nAnimal Experimentation [COBEA] and the U.S. Public Health\nService’s Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory\nAnimals-PHS Policy) and approved by the Ethics Committee\nfor Animal Research of Universidade Federal de Santa Maria\n(UFSM; Permit Number: 116/2010). Indeed, animal handling\nand laboratory assays were carried out in such a way that all\nefforts were made to minimize suffering.\n\nReagents\nUnless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from\n\nSigma (St. Louis, MO, USA)\n\nAnimals\nThe present study utilized Wistar rats with 5 days of life.\n\nPregnant Wistar rats were housed in individual cages and left\nundisturbed during gestation. Forty-eight hours after delivery,\nlitters were culled to eight male pups. Pups were fed by the\nmother since birth until 21 days of life when they were weaned.\nAnimals were divided in order to have the same number of rats\nfor each treatment in each cage. Animals had free access to\nwater and to a standard commercial chow and were maintained\non a 12:12 h light/dark cycle in an air-conditioned constant\ntemperature (24 ± 1°C, 55% relative humidity) colony room.\nThe “Principles of Laboratory Animal Care” (NIH publication no.\n80-23, revised 1996) were followed in all experiments and the\nexperimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee\nfor Animal Research of the Federal University of Santa Maria,\nSanta Maria, Brazil. All efforts were made to minimize the\nnumber of animals used and their suffering.\n\nDrugs and injections\nGA injection.  Buffered GA, pH 7.4 (5 µmol g of body weight\n\n−1) was administered subcutaneously, twice a day, from 5th to\n28th day of life to produce brain concentrations of GA around\n0.6 µmol g−1, ~0.72 mM [29] similar to concentrations found in\npatients with GA-I. Control animals received saline\nsubcutaneously in the same volumes and frequency. All\nsolutions were prepared so that each animal received 10 µL\nsolution g of body weight −1.\n\nLPS injection.  As GA-I patients may become debilitated\nafter an infection process and since sepsis may contribute to\ntheir neurologic deterioration [8], the rat pups were injected\nintraperitoneally (i.p.) with LPS (2 mg/kg; E.coli 055 B5) [30,31]\nor vehicle (saline 0.9%), once per day, on postnatal days 25-28\nto mimic a severe infection state [32].\n\nEffect of N-Acetylcysteine in Memory Impairment\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e78332\n\n\n\nNAC administration\nRat pups were supplemented with NAC (150mg/kg/day) or\n\nvehicle (saline 0.9%) by intragastric gavage once a day on\npostnatal days 5-28 [33].\n\nPhysical development\nAll rats used in experiments had their behavioral\n\ndevelopment assessed. For this, the weight of animals was\ndaily determined at the appropriate ages by one experimenter\nwho was not aware of the subject condition.\n\nCognitive tasks\nBehavioral experiments were carried out between 9:00 am\n\nand 2:00 pm. Animals were assessed on the Barnes maze on\npostnatal days 29-32. After Barnes maze test, animals were\ntested in the open field task on postnatal day 32.\n\nBarnes Maze task\nThe next day after the end of treatment animals were trained\n\nto solve the Barnes maze. The Barnes maze is a validated test\noften used for the assessment of spatial learning and memory\nin rodents [34].The Barnes maze paradigm exploits the natural\ninclination of small rodents to seek escape to a darkly lit\nsheltered environment when placed in an open arena under\nbright and aversive illumination. Our maze consists of a 120 cm\ndiameter circular wooden table, 3.5 cm thick and elevated 90\ncm above the floor.\n\nTwenty holes (6 cm diameter) were equidistantly located\naround the perimeter and centered 5 cm from it. The apparatus\nwas located in a 4 m x 4 m test room where four visuospatial\ncues made of rigid black paper (rectangle, circle, cross, and\ntriangle) were affixed to the walls but not directly over any\nmaze hole; this increases the spatial component of the Barnes\nmaze during training [35]. A black wooden escape tunnel (15\ncm x 10 cm x 30 cm) was placed beneath one randomly\nselected hole for each rat but remained constant throughout\nthe training sessions for a given rat. The remaining 19 holes\nled only to a false escape box (15cm x 10cm x 10cm), which\nfrom the platform, appeared indistinguishable from an escape\nbox but was too small to be entered. False boxes removed\nvisual cues that might be observed through an open hole.\nThere was a bright illumination of 300 lux over the maze.\n\nOn the first day of the experiment the rats were moved to a\ntesting room and left undisturbed for 60 min. Following this\nhabituation period the rats were trained to find the escape hole.\nThey were placed in the escape box for 1 min and then into a\ncylindrical opaque chamber (start box) in the center of the\nmaze. With light on, the start box was removed and the rats\nwere allowed to explore freely and find the escape box. The\nmaximum time allowed to find the escape was 180 s. Each rat\nwas given three trials per day over four consecutive days. In\neach trial we recorded the time to reach the escape tunnel and\nthe number of wrong holes visited. A visited hole was\nconsidered when the animal poked at a hole. The arena and\nthe boxes were wiped clean using distillated water both\nbetween each training session for a given rat and between\neach rat. Immediately after the second training session on the\n\nBarnes maze, animals were transferred to an open-field\nmeasuring 50 x 60 cm, with the floor divided into 12 squares\nmeasuring 12 x 12 cm each. The open-field test was carried\nout to identify motor disabilities and lasted for 5 min. During this\ntime an observer who was not aware of pharmacological\ntreatments recorded the number of crossing and rearing\nresponses manually.\n\nOpen-field task\nAfter the fourth day of Barnes maze test the locomotor\n\nactivity was measured for 5 min in the open field. The\napparatus consisted of a wooden box measuring 60 cm x 40\ncm x 50 cm with a glass front wall. Its floor was divided by\nblack lines into 12 equal squares. Animals were gently placed\nfacing the rear left corner of the arena and the number of\nsquares crossed with the four paws recorded for 5 min to\nevaluate motor activity [36]. The testing room was dimly\nilluminated with indirect white lighting.\n\nElevated plus maze task\nBased on the design of File and Gonzalez [37] the maze\n\nconsisted of two opposite closed arms (30 cm x 5 cm) enclosed\nwith walls (15 cm in height) and two opposite open arms (also\n30 cm x 5 cm, without edges) forming a plus shape. The whole\napparatus had a central arena (5 cm x 5 cm) and was elevated\nto 80 cm above the floor by a tripod. Each rat was placed in the\ncentral arena of the maze facing an open arm and observed for\n5 min. The behaviors recorded were: total number of entries,\nthe percentage of time spent on either arm, and percentage of\ntime spent in the middle. The apparatus was cleaned\nthoroughly between the 5 min observation sessions with a 30\n% ethanol solution.\n\nSample processing\nAfter the behavioral evaluation (second day of Barnes Maze\n\ntest), a subset of animals was killed by decapitation, and\nhippocampi were rapidly removed, dissected and homogenized\nin 1-ml sterile PBS, and then stored at -70 °C until processed\nfurther.\n\nIL-1β and TNF-α immunoassay\nTo analyze the content of IL-1β and TNF-α the hippocampus\n\nwas weighted and homogenized (1:10) in a solution containing\nbovine serum albumin (BSA 10 mg/ml), EGTA (2 mM), EDTA\n(2 mM) and PMSF (0.2 mM) in phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS, pH 7.4) using a Potter homogenizer. The hippocampus\nhomogenate was centrifuged (3000 g for 10 min) and cytokines\nwere determined in supernatant. Cytokine levels were\nmeasured using a commercially available ELISA Kit from Rand\nD Systems (Minneapolis, MN) using an antibody selective\nagainst rat IL-1β or TNF-α, according to the manufacturer’s\nprotocol. Results are expressed in pg/mg of protein for\nhippocampus homogenate assays. Absorbance was read at\n405 nm. The detection limit was 4 ng/ml.\n\nEffect of N-Acetylcysteine in Memory Impairment\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e78332\n\n\n\nMeasurement of TBARS content\nThiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances (TBARS) content\n\nwas estimated in a medium containing 0.2 ml of brain\nhomogenate, 0.1 ml of 8.1% SDS, 0.4 ml of acetic acid buffer\n(500 mM, pH 3.4), and 0.75 ml of 0.81% (TBA). The mixture\nwas finally made up to 2 ml with type I ultrapure water and\nheated at 95 °C for 90 min in a water bath using a glass ball as\na condenser. After cooling to room temperature, absorbance\nwas measured in the supernatant at 532 nm [38].\n\nNon Protein Thiol determination\nNon Protein Thiols (NPSH) were measured\n\nspectrophotometrically with Ellman’s reagent [39]. An aliquot of\n200 μL for hippocampus in a final volume of 900 μL of solution\nwas used for the reaction. The reaction product was measured\nat 412 nm after the addition of 10 mM 5-5-dithio-bis (2-\nnitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (0.05 mL). A standard curve using\ncysteine was added to calculate the content of thiol groups in\nthe samples, and was expressed as µmol SH/g tissue.\n\nCatalase activity determination\nFor the catalase (CAT) assay in hippocampus, the tissue\n\nwas homogenized in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH\n7.5, at a proportion of 1:9 (w/v) and 1:5 (w/v), respectively. The\nhomogenate was centrifuged at 2000 g for 10 min to yield a\nsupernatant that was used for the enzyme assay [40]. The\nreaction mixture contained 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer\n(pH 7), 10 mM H2O2, and 20 μL of the supernatant. The rate of\nH2O2 reaction was monitored at 240 nm for 2 min at room\ntemperature as determined in total blood assay. The enzymatic\nactivity was expressed in units mg−1 protein (One unit of the\nenzyme is considered the amount of CAT which decomposes 1\nμmol of H2O2 per min at pH 7 at 25 °C.)\n\nSuperoxide dismutase activity determination\nWith the purpose of performing the superoxide dismutase\n\n(SOD) assay in hippocampus, the tissue was adequately\ndiluted with Tris-HCl pH 7.4 at a proportion of 1:40 (w/v) and\n1:60(w/v) respectively [41]. Briefly, epinephrine undergoes\nauto-oxidation at pH 10.2 to produce adrenochrome, a colored\nproduct that was detected at 480 nm. The addition of samples\n(10, 20, 30 µL) containing SOD inhibits the auto-oxidation of\nepinephrine. The rate of inhibition was monitored for 180 s. The\namount of enzyme required to produce 50% inhibition was\ndefined as one unit of enzyme activity.\n\nGlutathione levels\nThe levels of glutathione (GSH) were determined\n\nfluorometrically as described by Hissin and Hilf [42] with minor\nmodifications using 0-phthaladehyde (OPA) as fluorophore.\nBriefly, the hippocampus was homogenized in 0.1M HClO4.\nHomogenates were centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 min and the\nlow-speed supernatants were separated for measurement of\nGSH. The supernatant (100 μl) was incubated with 100 ìl of\nOPA (0.1% in methanol) and 1.8 ml of 0.1M phosphate buffer\n(pH 8.0) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark.\nFluorescence was measured with a fluorescence\n\nspectrophotometer at excitation wavelength of 350 nm and at\nemission wavelength of 420 nm. GSH levels were expressed\nas nmol GSH/g of tissue.\n\nNa+, K+-ATPase activity measurements\nThe Na+,K+-ATPase activity was measured according to\n\nWyse et al.[43]. Briefly, the assay medium consisted of 30 mM\nTris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4; 0.1 mM EDTA, 50 mMNaCl, 5 mMKCl,\n6 mM MgCl2, and 50 µg of protein in the presence or absence\nof ouabain (1 mM) in a final volume of 350 µL. The reaction\nwas started by the addition of adenosine triphosphate to a final\nconcentration of 5 mM. After 30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was\nstopped by the addition of 70 µL of 50% (w/v) trichloroacetic\nacid. Saturating substrate concentrations were used, and the\nreaction was linear with protein and time. Appropriate controls\nwere included in the assays for non-enzymatic hydrolysis of\nATP. The amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) released was\nquantified by the colorimetric method described by Fiske and\nSubbarow [44] using KH2PO4 as reference standard. Specific\nNa+,K+-ATPase activity was calculated by subtracting the\nouabain-insensitive activity from the overall activity (in the\nabsence of ouabain) and expressed in nmol Pi/mg protein/min.\n\nIn a separate set of experiments we investigated whether\nsome Na+,K+-ATPase isoform is selectively inhibited. For this\npurpose we used a classical pharmacological approach based\non the isoform-specific sensitivity to ouabain [45]. We\ndetermined whether some treatments inhibited ouabain-\nsensitive ATPase activity using 3 µM (that inhibits Na+,K+-\nATPase isoforms containing α2 and α3 subunits) or 4 mM\nouabain (that inhibits all isoforms).\n\nHippocampal Volume\nConsidering that hippocampus cannot act as a unitary\n\nstructure and that dorsal portion is related to learning\nprocesses and memory [93], we decided to investigate the\neffect of GA, LPS and NAC treatment on the volume of dorsal\nhippocampus. In our study the dorsal hippocampus was\ndefined as the hippocampus comprised between the following\nPaxinos and Watson atlas coordinates: Bregma -1.60mm/\nInteraural 7.40mm; Bregma -3.8mm/Interaural 5.2mm. We\nanalyzed this hippocampal region because it is deeply\nassociated to learning and memory processes and presents\nwell defined anatomical limits, being suitable to unbiased\nvolume estimation using Cavalieri principle. For this propose,\nafter the behavioral evaluation (second day of Barnes Maze\ntest), a subset of animals was deeply anesthetized with\nthiopental (40 mg/kg, i.p.) and transcardially perfused with\nsaline solution followed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde\nin 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. After perfusion, the brains\nwere removed from the skulls, post-fixed in the same solution\nat room temperature for 24 h and cryoprotected by immersion\nin 30% sucrose solution in phosphate buffer at 4 °C until they\nsank. After these procedures, the brains were quickly frozen in\nisopentane, previously cooled in liquid nitrogen (-70°C). For\neach brain, coronal sections from the hippocampus (60µm)\nwere obtained using a cryostat (Leica CM 1850) at -20° C and\nmounted on gelatinized slides. These sections were identified\naccording to Paxinos and Watson’s Atlas (coordinates:\n\nEffect of N-Acetylcysteine in Memory Impairment\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e78332\n\n\n\ninteraural 7.2 mm, bregma -1.8 mm and interaural 5.4 mm,\nbregma -3.6 mm). Slides were hydrated in decreasing ethanol\nsolutions (absolute, 80%, 70%) and distilled water. They were\nplaced in acresyl violet solution acetified 0.01% for\napproximately 1 min. Then, they were dehydrated in increasing\nalcohol solutions (70%, 80% absolute) and clearedin xylene,\nand finally covered with coverslips with entellan resin.\n\nVolume estimation of dorsal hippocampus\nSections of dorsal hippocampus were digitized using an\n\nOlympus BX50 microscope coupled to a Motic Images Plus 2.0\ncamera and Image Pro Plus Software 6.1 (Media Cybernetics,\nCA, USA). The unbiased volume estimation of the dorsal\nhippocampus was performed using the Cavalieri principle\nassociated to the counting point method. The volume was\nestimated using the following equation:V=T·a/p·ΣP, where,\nV=Volume estimation; T=Distance between the analyzed\nsections (240μm); a/p=point area (1mm2)and ΣP is the sum of\npoints overlaid in the image [46-48]. Two histology specialists\nblinded to the source of the images carried out the volume\nestimations.\n\nProtein determination\nProtein content was measured colorimetrically by the method\n\nof Bradford [49] using bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) as a\nstandard.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nThe statistical analysis was carried out by two or three-way\n\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) and only F values of P <0.05 are\npresented. Post hoc analysis was carried out by Duncan’s\nmultiple comparisons test, when appropriate. All data were\nexpressed as mean ± SEM. Statistical analyses were\nperformed utilizing the SPSS software in a PC-compatible\ncomputer.\n\nResults\n\nPhysical Development of Animals\nThe physical development of animals determined by their\n\nweights during the treatment is shown in Figure 1A and 1B.\nStatistical analysis of the weight of animals (three-way ANOVA)\ndid not show a significant drug (Saline or GA) by toxin (Saline\nor LPS) by treatment (Sal or NAC) interaction: [F(1,57)= 0.46;\np> 0.05].\n\nEffect of NAC on Open field task\nThe exploratory and locomotor activity of animals is shown in\n\nFigure 2. Statistical analysis of the number of crossing and\nrearing (three-way ANOVA) did not show a significant drug\n(Saline or GA) by toxin (Saline or LPS) by treatment (Sal or\nNAC) interaction: [F(1,57)= 1.00; p>0.05; Figure 2A and\nF(1,57)= 1.00; p >0.05; Figure 2B; respectively).\n\nEffect of NAC on Spatial Memory\nThe effect of GA and LPS treatment on cognitive\n\nperformance is shown in Figure 3B. Statistical analysis\n\ndemonstrated that all the animals [F(1,57)=14.33; p <0.001]\ndecreased the latency to escape indicating that they have\nlearned the task.\n\nIn addition, statistical analysis of the latency to escape\nrevealed that GA and LPS co-administration potentiated the\nmemory impairment in the Barnes task [F(1,57)=27.85; p\n<0.001]. On the other hand, statistical analysis (three-way\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant drug\n(Saline or GA) by toxin (Saline or LPS) by treatment (Sal or\nNAC) interaction on the second [F(1,57)=5.28; p <0.05] and\nthird days of test F(1,57)= 3.95; p<0.05; Figure 3 A], indicating\na decreased performance of these animals in this spatial\nlearning paradigm. These results revealed that NAC\nadministration decreased the latency to escape induced by GA\nand LPS co-administration. Considering that GA, LPS and NAC\npresented effects mainly on the second day of spatial memory\ntesting, the next experiments carried out were limited to 2 days.\n\nEffect of NAC on anxiety\nStatistical analysis of the percent of time and entries in open\n\narm in the elevated plus mazeb (three-way ANOVA) did not\nshow a significant drug (Saline or GA) by toxin (Saline or LPS)\nby treatment (Sal or NAC) interaction: [F(1,57) = 0.43; p>0.05\nand [F(1,57) = 0.27; p >0.05; respectively]. In addition,\nstatistical analysis (three-way ANOVA) did not show a\nsignificant drug (Saline or GA) by toxin (Saline or LPS) by\ntreatment (Sal or NAC) interaction for percent of time [F(1,57) =\n0.85; p> 0.05], number of entries into the enclosed arm\n[F(1,57) = 0.34; p > 0.05] and time spent on middle\n[F(1,57) = 0.34; p >0.05], indicating that the treatment had no\neffect on anxiety-like behavior (Table 1). \n\nEffect of NAC on IL-1β and TNF-α levels\nSince numerous studies have found a link between elevated\n\nlevels of cytokines and memory deficits after\nneuroinflammatory processes [12,13], we decided to determine\nthe levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in hippocampus of rat pups.\n\nTNF-α levels in the hippocampus are shown in Figure 4A.\nThe statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA) revealed an increase\nin TNF-α levels induced by GA [F(1,44)=22.83; p <0.001] and\nLPS [F(1,44)=14.93; p <0.001] when compared with de control\ngroup.

Most children survive to the first acute metabolic\ncrisis, but develop long-term complications including\nneurological [5-7]. Although it is believed that these\nabnormalities occur as a result of the primary metabolic\nimpairment, the underlying mechanism of brain damage and\nneurological deficits in GA-I is poorly understood.\n\nIt is known that patients and experimental models of this IEM\nexhibit neuronal damage and changes in several areas of the\ncentral nervous system, as well as in several other neurological\ndiseases [8,10,12,13]. This is often related to oxidative stress\nand neuronal death, causing cognitive impairment and\nneuroinflammatory processes [9-13-19-22]. A recent study in\nan experimental model has elucidated the role of inflammatory\nmediators in model of acute seizures by GA [11]. However, it is\nnot known if GA itself may increase these mediators and if they\nare related with memory deficit.\n\nThis current study was carried out with young rats in a period\nof development with proven synaptogenesis and cell\nproliferation in several brain structures involved in learning and\nmemory. We found that the chronic GA administration (5th - 28th\nday of life) at doses that raise its concentration in blood and in\nthe brain [29] and LPS injection cause memory deficits in\nspatial recognition, decrease antioxidant defenses, and induce\nincreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β and TNF-\nα) in the hippocampus. In addition, an increasing oxidative\nmarkers and consequent inhibition of the Na+, K+-ATPase\nactivity, without modifying hippocampal volume was observed.\n\nIt is important to observe that chronic GA, LPS or NAC\nadministration had no effect on body weight, implying that\nchronic injection did not cause malnutrition in animals (Figure\n1). Similarly, the same treatments did not change rat\nperformance in the open field task as observed by a number of\nrearing and crossing at the testing session (Figure 2). In\naddition, these treatments did not change the behavior of rat\npups in the elevated plus maze task, indicating that GA, LPS\nand NAC were not anxiogenic (Table 1).\n\nAs regards to the behavior of rat pups, we observed that LPS\npotentiated the deficit of spatial learning induced by GA (Figure\n3 A-C). This result suggests that early chronic postnatal\nadministration of GA caused a long-standing deficit in spatial\nlearning probably secondary to GA-induced brain dysfunction\n[29], which was potentiated by an inflammatory insult. In fact,\nstudies have suggested that neonatal inflammation causes\ncognitive impairment in humans and experimental models\n[53-55]. Taken together, we can suggest that the potentiation of\ncognitive deficit induced by GA neonatal administration after\ninflammatory insult could be involved with the cognitive\ndysfunction presented in GA-I children [5-7], since these\npatients frequently develop neurological dysfunction after an\ninfectious process [50-56].\n\nIn line of this view, our data revealed that spatial learning\ndeficit induced by GA and LPS was associated with an\n\nEffect of N-Acetylcysteine in Memory Impairment\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e78332\n\n\n\nincrease of proinflammatory cytokine levels such as TNF-α and\nIL-1β (Figure 4A and B), and that the co-administration of these\n\ncompounds potentiated IL-1β levels in the hippocampus of rat\npups (Figure 4 B). It is important to note that the cytokines such\n\nFigure 4.  Effect of early postnatal chronic GA, NAC and LPS administration on cytokine levels on the second day of\nBarnes maze.

Since the activation of microglia produces a variety of\ninflammatory mediators [59] and the exposure to GA activates\nglial cells [22], it is plausible to propose that the increase of\ncytokine levels induced by GA may be due to glial activation\nand that LPS potentiated this effect manly by increasing IL-1β\nlevels (Figure 4B).\n\nCurrent evidence indicates that cytokines, particularly IL-1β,\nincrease neuronal excitability by activating IL-1 receptors [64].\nThe neuronal IL-1R1 stimulation induces Src kinase-mediated\ntyrosine phosphorylation of the NR2B subunit in N-methyl-D-\naspartate (NMDA) receptor. As a consequence, IL-1β facilitates\nNMDA receptor-mediated Ca2+ influx into neurons, promoting\nexcitotoxicity [102]. Considering that IL-1β can also inhibit\nglutamate uptake in astrocytes [67] and increase its glial\nrelease possibly via TNF-α production [94], the increase of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines may result in elevated extracellular\nglutamate levels and toxicity in this model of organic acidemia.\nIn agreement of this view, a considerable body of evidence has\ndemonstrated that glutamate receptor modulation can lead to\nGA-induced toxicity [9,11,20,21]. Furthermore, the\nadministration of LPS can also impair memory and elevate\nhippocampal IL-1β levels [64] by increasing the GABAergic\ninhibition [65,66].\n\nSince synaptic neurotransmission changes induced by\ncytokine may result in memory impairment [66,67], the actions\nof GA and LPS in neurotransmission [64] could potentiate the\ncognitive deficit observed in this study. In agreement to this, it\nhas been observed in post mortem brain of GA-I patients\npronounced reactive hypertrophic astrocytes with chronic\nastroglyosis and reactive microglia [60-63].\n\nFurthermore, TNF-α and IL-1β act in their respective\nreceptors and cause activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-\nchain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFκB), a transcription\n\nfactor that migrates to the cell nucleus and can promote\nelevated concentrations of intracellular calcium as well as a\nproduction of NO and H2O2 increase [95,96]. NO is a free\nradical that when reacting with superoxide anion (O2•-, also\nformed during the inflammatory process by enzymes such as\nNADPH oxidase) generates the highly reactive peroxynitrite\n(ONOO-) [97]. These free radicals induce a nitrosative/oxidative\nstress that may result in DNA damage, increase of lipid\nperoxidation and impaired antioxidant defenses [71,72].\n\nInterestingly, we revealed that GA and LPS administration\nincreased TNF-α and IL-1β levels as well as increased lipid\nperoxidation and impaired antioxidant defenses in the\nhippocampus of rat pups. Regarding the antioxidant defenses,\nthe concentrations of GSH, which is the major brain\nantioxidant, were reduced in the hippocampus of the animals\nthat received GA and LPS. Considering that GSH is an\neffective scavenger of free radicals [68] and that a disruption of\nGSH system homeostasis by neuroinflammation [97] may\nresult in oxidative injury in sensitized neurons [69,70], reduced\nGSH levels in hippocampus caused by GA and LPS\nadministration may be at least in part involved in the memory\ndeficit observed in these rat pups. Furthermore, GA and LPS\ndecreased CAT and SOD activities in the hippocampus (Figure\n6C-D), suggesting that the reduction of CAT and SOD activities\ndid not present a compensatory mechanism in response to the\nincreased formation of reactive species. In fact, oxidative stress\naccompanies inflammatory processes [73] and patients with\nGA-I frequently develop cognitive damage during and after\ninfections associated with inflammation and with a potential\nincrease of tissue concentrations of GA [52,74]. Also, reactive\nastrogliosis, a characteristic feature of neuroinflammation, is\noften found in brain GA-I patients [60-63].\n\nConsidering that GA, inflammatory mediators and oxidative\ndamage have been implicated as negative modulators of Na+,\nK+-ATPase [9,20,75-77], which is the major determinant of\nsodium concentration and cellular excitability, we investigated if\n\nFigure 5.

In fact, studies\nshowed that proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and\nreactive species have been shown to decrease the expression\nof Na+, K+-ATPase during severe experimental sepsis [78].\n\nIn our investigation it was interesting to learn that besides\nLPS and GA have increased oxidative and inflammatory\nmarkers, these compounds inhibited markedly Na+, K+-ATPase\nactivity suggesting the participation of this enzyme in spatial\nmemory deficit in this acidemia model. These results are in\naccordance with Liu and colleagues [79] that showed an\ninhibition of the activity of this enzyme by LPS. In addition,\nLima et al. [80] showed that in situations which cause brain\ninflammation and oxidative stress such as traumatic brain\ninjury, the inhibition Na+, K+-ATPase activity occurs\nconcomitantly to a cognitive impairment. Some studies have\nalso shown that the inhibition of Na+, K+-ATPase activity\ninduces spatial learning deficits [80,81] and impairs retention of\nan inhibitory avoidance task in rats [82]. In fact, Na+, K+-\nATPase activity can be inhibited by the direct and indirect\n\naction of LPS [79,83,84], as well as by GA and LPS-induced\nfree radical and inflammatory mediator generation [85,86].\nThus, it is plausible to propose that some of the mechanisms\nmay result in the Na+, K+-ATPase inhibition and contribute with\nmemory impairment observed in this study.\n\nAlthough we have shown that GA and LPS facilitate the\nmemory deficit, in the present study we did not find changes in\nthe dorsal hippocampal volume after GA, LPS or GA/LPS\nadministration (Figures 8 and 9). These results agree with\nstudies that show the GA-I patients develop mainly bilateral\nstriatal degeneration, but not in hippocampus, during catabolic\nor infectious events observed in neuroradiological imaging\n[62,87-89]. In fact, Oliveira-Bravo et al. [77,90] showed that a\nsingle intracerebroventricular dose of GA induced degeneration\nmainly in the striatum. Furthermore, Ulrich et al. [91] showed\nthat only 3-OH-glutaric, but not GA and glutaconic acid induced\nneurodegeneration in corticostriatal and hippocampal slice\ncultures from rat brain. Thus, this result reveals that GA did not\ninduce reduction of hippocampal volume, suggesting that the\n\nFigure 6.

In fact, the results presented in this\nreport showed that NAC supplementation was effective in\npreventing the decreased cognitive deficit as well as the\nincrease of inflammatory and oxidative mediators levels\ninduced by GA and LPS in rat pups. The supplementation of\nthis compound also protected against the Na+,K+-ATPase\nactivity inhibition (total and α1 subunit).\n\nRecent studies have shown that cytokines have potential to\nalter the redox equilibrium, thereby affecting GSH/GSSG\nshuttling and recycling [97]. For example, after H2O2 or\namyloid-β intracerebral injection in rat brain, it was observed an\nassociation between lipid peroxidation and the levels of\ncytokines in addition to a significant inverse correlation\nbetween glutathione peroxidase activity and lipid peroxidation\nlevels [98,99]. In this line of view, we showed that the treatment\nof rat primary astrocytes with TNF-α or IL-1β leads to marked\nalteration in cellular redox (decrease in intracellular GSH). On\nthe other hand, pretreatment of astrocytes with NAC, an\nantioxidant and efficient thiol source for glutathione, prevents\ncytokine-induced decrease in GSH [100,101]. In fact, our\nfindings showed that NAC supplementation decreased cytokine\n\nFigure 7.  NAC prevented the decrease of α1 subunit activity of Na+,K+-ATPase enzyme.

These data\nsuggest that inflammatory events and oxidative stress occur in\na synchronized manner by changing the redox environment,\nand that compounds with antinflammatory and antioxidant\nproperties could be used as adjuvant therapy to some\nneurodegenerative disorders.\n\nThus, a currently reported increase in GA-induced spatial\nmemory deficit by LPS not only supports the idea that\ninflammatory mediators, such as IL-1β facilitates the cognitive\nimpairment, but also adds pharmacologic evidence to the fact\nthat infections and oxidative damage precipitate metabolic\ncrises and worsen neurologic status of patients with GA-I.\nFurthermore, the Na+, K+-ATPase activity inhibition also plays\nan important role for the cognitive impairment observed in this\nwork. Taken together, all experimental findings suggest that\noxidative stress GA and LPS-induced impairs the intrinsic cell\n\npotential, leading to proinflammatory signals and creating a\nvicious circle between oxidative stress and neuroinflammation\ncausing a negative modulation in Na+,K+-ATPase activity that\nwas responsive to NAC supplementation. Therefore, if the\neffects detected in this study also occur in patients with GA-I, it\nis tempting to propose that they may contribute, at least in part,\nto the neurological dysfunction found in GA-I, and that the\n\nFigure 8.
