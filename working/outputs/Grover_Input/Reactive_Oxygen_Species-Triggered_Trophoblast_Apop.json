pregnant women may result in abortion or in fetal teratogenesis; however, the underlying mech-\nanisms are still unclear. In this paper, based on a murine model, we showed that maternal infection with RH strain T. gondii\ntachyzoites induced elevated production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), local oxidative stress, and subsequent apoptosis of\nplacental trophoblasts. PCR array analysis of 84 oxidative stress-related genes demonstrated that 27 genes were upregulated at\nleast 2-fold and that 9 genes were downregulated at least 2-fold in the T. gondii infection group compared with levels in the con-\ntrol group. The expression of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) and glutathione peroxidase 6 (Gpx6) increased significantly, about 25-\nfold. The levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) increased significantly with T. gondii in-\nfection, and levels of glutathione (GSH) decreased rapidly. T. gondii infection increased the early expression of endoplasmic\nreticulum stress (ERS) markers, followed by cleavage of caspase-12, activation of ASK1/JNK, and increased apoptosis of tropho-\nblasts, both in vivo and in vitro. The apoptosis of trophoblasts, the activation of caspase-12 and the ASK1/JNK pathway, and the\nproduction of peroxides were dramatically inhibited by pretreatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The upregulation of Nox1\nwas contact dependent and preceded the increase in levels of ERS markers and the activation of the proapoptosis cascade. Thus,\nwe concluded that apoptosis in placental trophoblasts was initiated predominantly by ROS-mediated ERS via activation of\ncaspase-12, CHOP, and the JNK pathway in acute T. gondii infection. Elevated ROS production is the central event in T. gondii-\ninduced apoptosis of placental trophoblasts.\n\nToxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan para-site that infects all warm-blooded animals, including approx-\nimately 30% of the human population worldwide (42). Infection\nis normally asymptomatic, but congenital fetal toxoplasmosis may\nresult in abortion, stillbirth, severe mental retardation, and retinal\nor neurologic damage later in life. Although birth defects caused\nby T. gondii could be attributed to structural damage (49), endo-\ncrine disorders (16), and increased cell apoptosis of placental tis-\nsue (1), the exact mechanisms and key events underlying congen-\nital toxoplasmosis remain unclear. T. gondii has a fascinating dual\ninvolvement in host cell apoptosis. Some previous studies dem-\nonstrated that T. gondii-infected cells became relatively resistant\nto some apoptotic stimuli (34). On the other hand, it has been\nobserved that T. gondii infection can induce apoptosis, as with\nCD4� splenocytes during acute infection of mice with T. gondii\n(23). High levels of apoptosis and an increased mortality rate have\nbeen proven to be associated with T. gondii infection with high-\nvirulence strains (15). In contrast, in chronic toxoplasma enceph-\nalitis, only a few apoptotic cells were observed. Therefore, the\ninitiation and the degree of cell apoptosis may play crucial roles in\nthe pathogenesis and outcomes of toxoplasmosis, but the exact\nmechanisms and key events underlying congenital toxoplasmosis\nremain unclear.\n\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the primary intracellular\norganelle for proper protein synthesis, folding, and assembly. The\naccumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the lumen of\nthe ER, which induces an adaptive program called the unfolded\n\nprotein response (UPR), leads to ER stress (ERS). Increasing evi-\ndence shows that ERS plays a key role in the regulation of apop-\ntosis caused by a variety of toxic insults, including reactive oxygen\nspecies (ROS), chemicals, and heavy metals. Oxidative stress is\ndescribed as an imbalance between ROS generation and antioxi-\ndant capacity, and such stress triggers apoptosis through a variety\nof signaling pathways, such as ERS response and the activation of\nthe ASK1/JNK pathway (21). These pathological processes can be\nsimultaneously observed in some diseases, such as diabetes, cad-\nmium poisoning, and neurodegenerative diseases (24, 30, 45). Ad-\nditionally, there is growing evidence that oxidative stress plays an\nimportant role in infection-induced apoptosis (11, 31, 41).\n\nGenerally, pregnancy is a state of mild oxidative stress arising\nfrom increased placental mitochondrial activity and ROS produc-\ntion for maternal and fetal metabolism. In the first trimester, es-\ntablishment of blood flow into the intervillous space results in a\nburst of oxidative stress (20). The placenta is subjected to hypoxia\n\nReceived 9 February 2012 Returned for modification 7 March 2012\nAccepted 23 March 2012\n\nPublished ahead of print 2 April 2012\n\nEditor: J. H.

In\nlate gestation, increased oxidative stress is observed in pregnancies\ncomplicated by diabetes, intrauterine growth restriction, and pre-\neclampsia in association with escalated trophoblast apoptosis (5,\n48). Previous studies revealed that T. gondii infection can lead to\noxidative stress and immune suppression in blood donors (12).\nTh2 immune bias can be seen in the normal maternal-fetal inter-\nface, which is unfavorable to the elimination of pathogens (3) and\nenhances susceptibility to toxoplasmosis (35). Thus, T. gondii in-\nfection or the reactivation of latent infection during pregnancy\nwill increase oxidative stress in the placenta, contribute to cell\napoptosis and placenta damage, and, finally, lead to more serious\noutcomes than would be seen during the normal physiological\nstate. The relationship between oxidative stress and cell apoptosis\nin gestation-related disease has been reported. Wang and col-\nleagues demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) could induce\noxidative stress in several tissues, leading to preterm labor in mice\n(44). Some studies discovered that trophoblasts could be produc-\ntively infected by a virulent strain of T. gondii, and that uninfected,\nbut not infected, cells undergo apoptosis (1, 31, 39), which indi-\ncated that T. gondii-induced apoptosis was not due to a direct\naction of the parasite at the maternofetal interface.\n\nTherefore, we hypothesized that T. gondii infection would sig-\nnificantly increase ROS generation and subsequent trophoblast\napoptosis at the maternal-fetal interface. In the present study, we\nexplored the role of ROS and the downstream activation by ROS\nin the mechanisms of placental trophoblast apoptosis induced by\nT. gondii infection. To this aim, we investigated the involved oxi-\ndative and antioxidative molecules by PCR array, the parasite bur-\nden of placenta tissues and blood samples by real-time PCR, the\ntrophoblast apoptosis index by terminal deoxynucleotidyltrans-\nferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) and\nflow cytometry (FCM), and the local oxidative stress by examining\nincreased malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine\n(8-OHdG), and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels of placental tis-\nsues. Simultaneously, ERS, p38, and JNK pathways in placental\ntissues from mouse congenital toxoplasmosis models and in vitro\nprimary cultured trophoblasts in a transwell coculture system\nwere observed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)\nand Western blotting.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIn vivo passage of T. gondii tachyzoites. Tachyzoites of the highly viru-\nlent RH strain of T. gondii were maintained in BALB/c mice by intraper-\nitoneal passage at 72-h intervals. Parasites were obtained from mouse\nperitoneal exudates, washed twice (at 1,000 � g for 15 min) in sterile\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) and maintained by serial passage\nin human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) for further infection experiments in\nvitro and in vivo.\n\nMouse models and treatment. All procedures were in strict accor-\ndance with the Chinese National Institute of Health Guide for the Care\nand Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Animal Care and Use\nCommittee of Anhui Medical University. Efforts were made to minimize\nthe number of animals used and their suffering. Six- to 8-week-old ICR\nmice (body weight, 20 to 22 g), obtained from the Animal Department of\nAnhui Medical University, were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle\nfrom 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. in a controlled, specific-pathogen-free envi-\nronment (temperature, 20° � 1°C). Animals were housed in plastic cages\nwith free access to food and water. The mice were acclimatized for at least\n1 week before being mated. For mating purposes, four females were\n\nhoused overnight with two males at 9:00 p.m. Females were checked by\n7:00 a.m. the next morning, and the presence of a vaginal plug or sperm in\nthe vaginal smear was considered as marking gestational day 0 (GD0).\nPregnant females were maintained in the animal care facility until they\nwere infused with tachyzoites or saline. On GD7, pregnant females were\nrandomly divided into the following three groups: T. gondii infection,\nN-acetylcysteine (NAC) pretreatment plus T. gondii infection, and con-\ntrol. Mice were maintained in the animal care facility until they were\ntreated. On GD8 and GD9, mice in the NAC pretreatment group were\ninfused with NAC (100 mg/kg of body weight). On GD8, each mouse in\nthe T. gondii infection group and NAC pretreatment group was injected\nintraperitoneally with 200 tachyzoites in 0.1 ml of 0.9% sterile saline so-\nlution. In the control group, the mice were exposed to only 0.9% sterile\nsaline solution. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation on gestational\ndays 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18. Placentas were carefully dissected and, after\ntheir weights were recorded, processed into cell suspension or fixed in\nBouins fluid for immunohistochemical analysis; samples were then snap\nfrozen in liquid nitrogen for other types of analysis.\n\nAnalysis of oxidative stress and antioxidant defense molecules by\nPCR array. Tissue samples were homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent\nper 50 to 100 mg of tissue using a power homogenizer. RNA isolation was\nperformed according to the conventional method, and the yield and qual-\nity of RNA were assessed by spectrophotometer and gel electrophoresis.\nMouse Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense RT2 Profiler PCR Array\nkits were obtained from SABioscience Company (Frederick, MD). First-\nstrand cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR were conducted based on the\nmanufacturer’s instructions. The relative gene expression was determined\nby ABI 7500 real-time detection system software (SDS, version 2.05) using\nan adaptive baseline to determine the threshold cycle (CT). The data were\nanalyzed by the ��CT method according to the manufacturer’s manual.\nQuality control was performed using genomic DNA and reverse tran-\nscription- and positive-PCR controls. The data were normalized to the\nhousekeeping gene �-actin. Changes in gene expression were represented\nas fold increase/decrease. Genes were considered to be upregulated or\ndownregulated if changes in expression levels were�2.0-fold or �2.0-\nfold, respectively.\n\nPrimary trophoblast culture and experimental infection. The pla-\ncentas (GD12) were obtained from normal pregnant mice. Cells were\nisolated according to the method of mouse trophoblast isolation de-\nscribed elsewhere (2), with appropriate modifications. Briefly, the placen-\ntas were carefully cut into pieces with scissors and digested by trypsin and\ncollagenase I to obtain primary trophoblast cells. Detached trophoblasts\nwere washed in Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM; Gibco)\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco) and were puri-\nfied over a Percoll gradient. To decrease residual macrophage and fibro-\nblast cell contamination, the cells were seeded at 105/microwell/100 �l of\n10% FBS in 24-well tissue culture plates (product number 3527; Corning)\nand incubated for 4 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere; the\nnonadherent cells and debris were removed by washing the plates with\nprewarmed IMDM. Cell passage was performed several times by 0.25%\ntrypsin digestion for 2 min at 37°C to minimize the contamination of the\nmacrophage. The characterization of the trophoblast cell population was\ncarried out through positive immunolocalization of the cytokeratin-7 and\nnegative reactivity to vimentin (18). Anti-cytokeratin-7–fluorescein iso-\nthiocyanate (FITC), anti-vimentin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP; Huayi\nBiotechnology Co., China), and anti-F4/80-FITC (eBioscience, San Di-\nego, CA) were used to identify the purity and phenotype of cells by FCM\nanalysis and immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent staining.\nCytokeratin-7-positive cells were counted randomly, and results are ex-\npressed as a percentage of the total cell number. Experimental infection\nwas performed with a transwell system using cell culture plates with a\n0.4-�m-pore-size filter (Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cell culture medium\nand reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Freshly prepared parasites\n(1 � 106) were added to the upper well, which contained a monolayer of\nplacental cells (1 � 106). The placental trophoblasts (1 � 106) in the lower\n\nXu et al.\n\n2122 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nwells remained uninfected and were cocultured with infected cells from\nthe upper well on a 12-well plate at 37°C for the time intervals indicated in\nthe figure legends before being subjected to the apoptosis assay by TUNEL\nand FCM, as well as to the real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting for the\ndetection of ERS or other proapoptotic pathways.\n\nDetection of apoptosis by annexin V/PI and flow cytometry. An an-\nnexin V-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)/propidium iodide\n(PI) kit for an apoptosis assay was purchased from BestBio (Shanghai,\nChina). Cell suspensions from placental tissues or primary cultured tro-\nphoblasts were harvested and washed twice with PBS and resuspended in\n400 �l of annexin V binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, 0.14 M NaCl, and\n0.25 mM CaCl2). Then, 5 �l of EGFP-conjugated annexin V was added\nand incubated at room temperature for 15 min in the dark with gentle\nvortexing. Next, 10 �l of propidium iodide was added and incubated at\nroom temperature for 5 min in the dark. Finally, 400 �l of 1� binding\nbuffer was added to each tube. The cells were analyzed on a Coulter Epics\nAltra HyPerSort system (Beckman Coulter, FL), and the data were ana-\nlyzed using EXPO32 Multicomp software. Early and late apoptosis were\nanalyzed to better observe the effect of T. gondii infection or NAC treat-\nment on apoptosis signal. Annexin V-positive, PI-negative (annexin V�\n\nPI�) cells are early apoptotic cells, and annexin V�, PI-positive (PI�) cells\nare late apoptotic cells (14).\n\nDetection of apoptotic cells in situ using TUNEL. Placental tissues\nembedded in paraffin were cut into 5-�m-thick sections using a micro-\ntome. For TUNEL assays, these sections were immersed in xylene in a\ncoupling jar to remove paraffin and rehydrated in graded ethanol solu-\ntions. DNA fragmentation was detected using a TUNEL kit (Roche Diag-\nnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions, with some modifications. Apoptotic cells were directly de-\ntected as green using fluorescence microscopy (Olympus IX51; Olympus,\nTokyo, Japan). Images were captured with a charge-coupled-device\n(CCD) camera and QCapture Pro 6 software (QImaging, Burnaby, BC,\nCanada) for real-time image preview and capture. To assess the extent of\napoptosis, the number of TUNEL-stained nuclei was counted by two in-\nvestigators who were blinded with regard to the treatments in four ran-\ndomly selected microscopic fields at a �200 magnification per section.\nData obtained from two sections per animal were then averaged. Values\nare presented as the mean � standard deviation (SD).\n\nMeasurement of MDA, GSH, and 8-OHdG in placenta homoge-\nnates. Frozen placental tissues were thawed, weighed, and homogenized\nin phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Homogenates were centrifuged (at\n2,000 � g for 10 min at 4°C), and the supernatant was used immediately\nfor assays of MDA, GSH, and 8-OHdG.\n\nThe total protein concentration from placental tissues or cultured pri-\nmary cells was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit\nwith an absorption band of 570 nm (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Commercial\nassay kits used to determine lipid peroxidation (MDA) and GSH were\nproduced by the Jiancheng Institute of Biotechnology (Nanjing, China);\nthe kit for 8-OHdG was obtained from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA).\nMDA, GSH, and 8-OHdG were all strictly determined following the in-\n\nstructions of the commercial kits. The formation of MDA, a substance\nproduced during lipid peroxidation, was determined by the thiobarbitu-\nric acid method. MDA level is expressed as micromoles per gram of pro-\ntein.\n\nGSH analysis was performed as described previously (40). Briefly, after\ncentrifugation at 2,000 � g for 10 min, 0.5 ml of supernatant was added to\n2 ml of 0.3 mol/liter Na2HPO4 · 2H2O solution. A 0.2-ml solution of\ndithiobisnitrobenzoate (0.4 mg/ml in 1% sodium citrate) was added, and\nthe absorbance at 412 nm was measured immediately after mixing. Re-\nsults are expressed as micromoles per gram of protein.\n\nThe level of 8-OHdG was measured according to the protocol of the\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. The unknown\n8-OHdG samples or 8-OHdG standards were first added to an 8-OHdG/\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugate-preabsorbed ELISA plate. After a\nbrief incubation, an anti-8-OHdG monoclonal antibody (Ab) was added,\nfollowed by an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. The 8-OHdG con-\ntent in unknown samples was determined by comparison with a prede-\ntermined 8-OHdG standard curve.\n\nDetection of tachyzoite burden and oxidative stress-associated mol-\necules by real-time PCR. The extraction and purification of T. gondii\nDNA from placenta tissues or blood samples were performed according to\nthe manufacturer’s instructions (QIAamp DNA Minikit, Qiagen, Ger-\nmany). The tachyzoite burden was assessed by using a commercial kit\n(DaAn, China). Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,\nCA) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The cDNA was syn-\nthesized from total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase and\nrandom primers (Invitrogen). To investigate apoptosis-associated or ox-\nidative stress-associated molecules, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was\nperformed using specific primer sets (Shenggong, Shanghai, China) and a\nsingle-tube SYBR green kit (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) with an ABI 7500\nreal-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, SA). The primers used for\nPCR are listed in Table 1. Only experiments in which a distinct single peak\nwas observed with a melting temperature different from that of the no-\ntemplate control were analyzed. The mRNA fold induction values were\ncalculated by the following equations: �CT � �CT(target) � �CT(GAPDH);\n��CT � �CT(infected) � �CT(control); mRNA fold change � 2\n\n���CT\n\n(GAPDH is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Experiments\nwere performed in triplicate, and data are expressed as mean � SD.\n\nImmunoblotting. Placental tissues were dissected and homogenized\nin ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM HEPES, 1.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate [SDS], 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM sodium\ndeoxycholate) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Boehr-\ninger Mannheim, Germany) and phosphatase inhibitor (Phosphatase In-\nhibitor Cocktail Set II; Merck, Germany). Primary cultured trophoblasts\nwere directly treated with 100 �l of lysis buffer. Total cell lysates were\nsubjected to SDS-PAGE.

To clarify whether T. gondii\ninfection would result in increased ROS production and oxidative\nstress, we investigated the gene expression profile of placenta tis-\n\nsues from GD12 mice in the T. gondii infection group with a 96-\nwell RT2 Profiler PCR Array containing 84 key genes related to\noxidative stress. This mouse PCR array includes antioxidants in-\nvolved in ROS metabolism and relevant oxygen transporter genes.\nMeanwhile, the results were compared with ones of the control\ngroup and NAC pretreatment group. RT-PCR was performed to\ndetect expression of several representative genes, showing the con-\nsistency of the assays (data not shown).\n\nTwenty-seven genes were upregulated at least 2-fold, and nine\nwere downregulated at least 2-fold in the T. gondii infection group\ncompared with expression in the control group (Fig. 1A). Eight\ngenes differed more than 10-fold between the control group and\nT. gondii infection group (Fig. 1D). For example, two key antiox-\nidant enzymes, Gpx6 and Gpx1, adaptively increased in the in-\nfected group versus the control group by about 25 and 12 times,\nrespectively. As the main source of ROS production, NADPH ox-\nidase 1 (Nox1) also increased about 25 times as a result of T. gondii\ninfection, which could contribute to excessive production of ROS.\n\nFIG 1 Oxidative response-related gene expression profiles in three groups.

A burst of oxidative\nresponse occurred in the placental tissues of subjects infected with\nT. gondii. To discover the origin of the increased oxidative stress,\nthe placenta tissues and blood samples of pregnant mice from the\nT. gondii infection group were checked for assessment of parasite\nburden. Next, we evaluated local oxidative stress and placenta\nstructural damage through analysis of GSH, MDA, and 8-OHdG\nlevels in placenta tissue homogenates. By quantitative PCR anal-\nysis, T. gondii was not detectable in the placentas of GD10 and\nGD12. A dramatic increase in parasite load, however, was found in\nthose of GD14. Additionally, our data also showed that the para-\nsitemia occurred and GSH level of placentas decreased before\nGD12 in the T. gondii infection group (Fig. 2A and B, respec-\ntively). Additionally, MDA and 8-OHdG were elevated to differ-\nent degrees after T. gondii infection (Fig. 2C and D). NAC could\nweaken the oxidative response, further protecting the infected pla-\ncenta from serious damage (Fig. 2).\n\nIsolated trophoblasts were identified through a variety of im-\nmunological and morphological means. Primary trophoblast\ncells appeared as irregular polygons or round (Fig. 3A, left) and\nwere confirmed by immunostaining for cytokeratin-7, an epithe-\nlial cell marker. Although about 5.1% of cultured cells were mac-\nrophages, by analysis of FCM (Fig. 3B), most cells (90.5% � 3.5%)\nshowed positive staining for cytokeratin-7 (Fig. 3C). Additionally,\npositive reactivity to vimentin was not noted (Fig. 3A, the upper\nright), which indicated that the cell cultures did not contain large\nnumbers of contaminating fibroblast or endothelial cells.\n\nT. gondii induces apoptosis of trophoblasts in placental tis-\nsues in vivo and of primary cultured cells in vitro. To estimate\nthe effects of local oxidative stress and peroxidation damage on\nplacental trophoblasts, trophoblast apoptosis was analyzed by\nFCM. We found that the apoptosis levels in the infection group\nincreased with the duration of infection (Fig. 4A, top), but no\nsignificant difference in apoptosis across gestation days was found\nin the control group (Fig. 4A, bottom). According to the apoptosis\nindex from the control and T. gondii infection groups, total, early,\nand late apoptosis were significantly enhanced in the T. gondii\ninfection group (Fig. 4B).

Analyses of GSH (B), MDA (C), and 8-OHdG (D) levels were conducted\nper the manufacturer’s instructions.

We found that trophoblast\napoptosis significantly increased after 12 h of coculture with T.\ngondii (Fig. 4C) compared with the control group.\n\nT. gondii-induced trophoblast apoptosis is ROS dependent.\nTo further confirm the role of ROS in T. gondii-triggered tropho-\nblast apoptosis, N-acetylcysteine (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), a specific\nROS quencher, was reconstituted in physiologic saline solution at\na pH of 6.8 to 7.2 and administered at 100 mg/kg of body weight to\nthe mice or at 10 �M to the primary cultured trophoblasts. From\nthe analysis of TUNEL and FCM, we found that introduction of\nNAC significantly inhibited trophoblast apoptosis, not only in\nplacental tissues (Fig. 5A and B) but also in primary cultured\ntrophoblasts experimentally infected with T. gondii (Fig. 5C). Pre-\ntreatment with NAC decreased the apoptosis index of placental\ntissues compared with that of the infection group, especially in late\napoptosis (Fig. 5B, right). Similar results were found in cocultured\nprimary trophoblasts (from 41.3% to 27.6%) (Fig. 5C).\n\nT. gondii-induced ROS initiates ERS response in vivo. Al-\nthough overproduction of ROS can induce cell apoptosis via mul-\ntiple pathways, such as MAPK or mitochondria, the endoplasmic\nreticulum may be more sensitive to oxidative stress. Therefore, we\n\nobserved the ERS markers in the placental tissues from each of the\nthree groups. We found that these markers did not vary signifi-\ncantly across days of gestation in the control group (Fig. 6A), but\nthere was a significant increase in caspase-12 and CHOP levels in\nthe T. gondii infection group (Fig. 6B). To confirm the connection\nbetween ROS and increased levels of ERS markers, NAC was used\nin the antioxidant pretreatment group. We found that NAC treat-\nment significantly inhibited the escalation of ERS molecules (Fig.\n6C and D).\n\nT. gondii infection contributes to apoptosis by activation of\nmultiple proapoptotic pathways, including the ERS and ASK1/\nJNK pathways. To observe the effect of T. gondii-triggered oxida-\ntive stress on endoplasmic reticulum and multiple proapoptotic\npathways, a set of markers expressed during ER-induced apopto-\nsis and UPR were checked by real-time PCR and immunoblotting.\nWe found that the levels of major ERS markers, such as CHOP,\nGRP78, GRP94, and caspase-12, increased with T. gondii infection\n(Fig. 7A); compared to levels of GD10 in the control group, ASK1/\nJNK and caspase-12 were significantly activated by phosphoryla-\ntion or cleavage (Fig. 7B). However, the upregulation and activa-\ntion of p38 were not observed in our data. In terms of these\nmolecules, no significant difference was found in placental tissues\n\nFIG 3 Identification of primary trophoblast cells.

Nox1 is a key oxidase in the production of some oxide\nmolecules. The upregulation of this oxidase in T. gondii infection\nwas confirmed in this study (Fig. 1D). Members of the glutathione\n\nperoxidase family are major antioxidant enzymes in mammals\nand catalyze the reduction of hydroxyperoxides by GSH. To in-\nvestigate the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and the ac-\ntivation of the proapoptotic pathway, we detected the Nox1,\nGpx1, and Gpx6 mRNA levels, the GSH protein level, and the\nactivation of the ERS and ASK1/JNK pathways in one transwell\ncocultured system.

From Western\nblot analysis, we found that GRP78 increased before other mark-\ners; then, the levels of CHOP and phosphorylation of JNK in-\ncreased. Significantly increased phosphorylation of ASK1 and\ncleavage of caspase-12 were also observed after 6 h. However, p38\nand phospho-p38 levels did not vary significantly across variable\nintervals (Fig. 8C). This observation could result from the limited\nobservation period and lower pathogen load.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThere is extensive evidence that oxidative stress or an imbalance\nbetween oxidant and antioxidant activity at the maternal-fetal in-\nterface plays a key role in the development of placenta-related\ndiseases, including preeclampsia and miscarriage (28, 37). On the\none hand, redox-sensitive signal transduction pathways are criti-\ncal for developmental processes, including proliferation, differen-\n\ntiation, and apoptosis of human tissues, especially for placenta; on\nthe other hand, teratogens that induce oxidative stress, such as\nchemical poisoning and infection, may induce teratogenesis via\nthe misregulation of the above-mentioned pathways (46). In par-\nticular, previous studies have discovered that ROS were involved\nin teratogenic processes in mice treated with LPS (7, 50), which is\none well-recognized pathogen-associated molecular pattern\n(PAMP) of Gram-negative bacteria. Structures analogous to LPS\nhave been found in T. gondii, such as glycosylphosphatidylinosi-\ntols (GPI) (9, 36). Interestingly, all of these structures can trigger\nthe activation of inflammatory cytokine expression by Toll-like\nreceptor (TLR)-dependent pathways (25), e.g., TLR4 (10, 47) and\nTLR2 (6, 38). Some studies have revealed that LPS could induce\nthe production of ROS in some organs, such as lung and liver (8,\n51), in which ROS are important to the pathogenesis of organ\ndamage (52).\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated that in mice, acute infection\n\nFIG 5 Effect of NAC on the apoptosis levels of placental tissues or primary cultured cells.

In addition to\nearly decreased GSH, parasitemia was also found about 48 h after\nacute infection, followed by the abrupt increase of placental par-\nasite burden on GD14. Therefore, based on our present study,\noxidative stress caused by maternal infection, but not by placenta\ninfection, may contribute to the structural damage to the placenta\nbarrier in early stage, which benefited the invasion of T. gondii.\nSimultaneously, an increase in apoptosis of trophoblastic cells\nwith T. gondii infection was observed by FCM and TUNEL in vitro\nand in vivo. Apoptosis levels increased with duration of infection\nbut were not correlated with parasite burden.\n\nIn trophoblastic cells, apoptosis is a normal element of cell\nturnover, leading some cells to be eliminated without a local in-\nflammatory reaction (19). T. gondii, however, is able to alter the\napoptotic program of the host cells by promoting or inhibiting\napoptosis (17). Previous studies have shown that modulation of\napoptosis during T. gondii infection may be closely associated with\nthe parasite’s virulence factors (15), the state of infection of the\nindividual cell (acute or chronic), the affected cell type, and the\nspecific experimental conditions used. Apoptosis of bystander\nhost cells may result from the secretion of some soluble factors by\nparasite-infected cells (31). In acute infection, major host tissue\n\ncells could act as the bystanders, and lethal overproduction of Th1\ncytokines may play an important role in pathogenesis (27). Here,\nwe found increased trophoblast apoptosis, not only in placental\ntissues but also in primary cultured cells (mixed with immune\ncells), in the transwell coculture system. Our study reveals that\nelevated apoptosis does not result from direct physical damage but\nfrom the release of soluble factors. Additionally, we also found\nthat pretreatment with antioxidants effectively suppressed local\noxidative stress. GSH is a major intracellular antioxidant, and its\nbiosynthesis depends on the intracellular availability of cysteine,\nwhich can be provided by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The amelio-\nrated redox condition in placental tissues resulted in a significant\ndecrease in apoptosis, especially in late apoptosis. Similar results\nwere obtained from the analysis of primary cultured trophoblasts\nin the coculture transwell system. Although in this study usage of\nantioxidant had a minor effect on early apoptosis, which could\nresult from short-term usage of NAC, lower dosage, or factors\nother than ROS, existing data showed that acute T. gondii infec-\ntion could induce cell apoptosis via oxidative stress, and ROS gen-\neration might be essential to this infection-mediated apoptosis.\n\nERS and oxidative stress are becoming increasingly recognized\nas inducers of pathological cell death leading to tissue dysfunction\n(22). ERS plays a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis caused\nby a variety of toxic insults that damage mammalian cells, includ-\ning oxidative stress, hypoxia, chemicals, Ca2�-homeostasis imbal-\nance, and heavy metals (4, 26). Previous studies have revealed that\nthe oxidative stress and ERS pathways are activated in the lungs of\n\nFIG 6 ERS levels in placenta tissues of various gestational days from three groups. (A to C) The markers of ERS were detected by real-time RT-PCR in each group,\nas indicated. The data were normalized to those measured at GD10 in the same group. To prevent overlap, the data sets were moved by the same data units.

Thus, we examined a number of ERS-\nrelated molecules and stress-activated signaling pathways, such as\nGRP78, CHOP, caspase-12, ASK1/JNK, and p38 cascades. The\nreal-time RT-PCR revealed that GRP78, CHOP, and caspase-12\nwere upregulated in the T. gondii infection group. Western\nblotting of both in vivo and in vitro trophoblasts showed that\nthe caspase-12 and ASK1/JNK cascades were activated and that\ncaspase-12 was upregulated in infected mice in late pregnancy.\nCaspase-12 and CHOP are suspected to be specific to the apop-\ntotic mechanism downstream of ERS because mice deficient in\ncaspase-12 (29) and CHOP�/� cells (32) are resistant to ERS-\nmediated apoptosis. Previous reports showed that the activation\nof p38 and JNK was responsible for oxidative stress-induced\napoptosis. Our study indicated that T. gondii infection might ac-\ntivate ASK1/JNK and that pretreatment with NAC significantly\n\ninhibited phosphorylation of ASK1 rather than of JNK. No acti-\nvation of p38 was seen in the present observation. Whether p38 is\ninvolved in this pathological process remains to be elucidated. The\nNox4 isozyme is essential to LPS-induced production of ROS\n(33). By analysis of oxidative molecules in a coculture transwell\nsystem, we found that Nox1 was upregulated initially on challenge\nwith T. gondii tachyzoites. Nox1 is a key oxidase in the production\nof some oxide molecules, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen\nperoxide. Additionally, a significant decrease in GSH, the most\nimportant antioxidant, was observed soon after Nox1 upregula-\ntion. These events finally triggered the endoplasmic reticulum re-\nsponse and inevitably induced trophoblast apoptosis. These re-\nsults demonstrate that the oxidative response may be central to\ninfection and the subsequent activation of those proapoptotic\npathways.\n\nFIG 7 Activation of multiple proapoptotic pathways by T. gondii infection. (A) The data were normalized to the same gene, measured at GD10, in the control\ngroup. The data are means � SDs and represent five independent experiments. Differences between gestational days were assessed by one-way ANOVA and the\nSNK multiple comparison posttest. (B) Placental cell lysates from different gestational days from the T. gondii infection group and GD10 from the control group\nwere collected for immunoblotting with Abs against GRP78, CHOP, caspase-12, phospho-JNK (Thr183/Tyr185), phospho-ASK1 (Ser967), and total and\nphosphorylated (p-) forms of p38. �-Actin was used as an internal control. (C and D) Placental cell lysates of GD18 from three groups were checked by\nimmunoblotting; a quantitative analysis of the Western blot analysis using densitometry (normalized to actin) is also shown.

These data show that the\nintensity of the oxidative response at the maternal-fetal interface\nrather than the direct action of the parasite could account for\ndifferent prognoses of infection. ROS-mediated ERS may partly\ncontribute to cell apoptosis and pathophysiological injury in-\nduced by high-virulence T. gondii. These results are important to\nthe understanding of the mechanisms underlying the process of\npathological damage in T. gondii infection. Antioxidants have po-\ntential as a therapeutic regimen for the treatment of T. gondii-\nrelated diseases.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was funded by the Natural Basic Research Program of China\n(grant 2010CB530001), by the National Natural Science Foundation of\nChina (grant 81171605), and by the Education Department Research Pro-\ngram of Anhui, China (grant KJ2011Z200).\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

(A) Primary trophoblast cells were harvested after coculture for\n0, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24 h. RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis were performed per the conventional protocol. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was conducted using\nthe SYBR green method, and the mRNA fold induction values were calculated by the 2���CT method. Data are means � SDs of three independent experiments.\n(B) Primary cultured trophoblasts (106/well) were directly treated with 100 �l of lysis buffer. GSH was detected according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nThree independent experiments were conducted. (C) The trophoblast lysates experimentally infected by T. gondii were collected for immunoblotting.\n\nT. gondii Induces Trophoblast Apoptosis by ROS-ERS\n\nJune 2012 Volume 80 Number 6 iai.asm.org 2131\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\n10.
