Byers,1,2 Andrew W. Stadnyk,1,3\n\nWalla Al-Hertani,1 and Robert Bortolussi1,3*\nDepartments of Pediatrics,1 Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,2 and Microbiology and Immunology,3\n\nDalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia B3J 3G9, Canada\n\nReceived 17 June 2003/Returned for modification 29 July 2003/Accepted 19 November 2003\n\nHuman newborns are more susceptible than adults to infection by gram-negative bacteria. We hypothesized\nthat this susceptibility may be associated with a decreased response by leukocytes to lipopolysaccharide (LPS).\nIn this study, we compared LPS-induced secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�) by mononuclear\ncells (MNC) from adult peripheral blood and newborn umbilical cord blood in vitro and attempted to\ndetermine the mechanisms involved in its regulation. At a high concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml) and in the\npresence of autologous plasma, MNC from adults and newborns secreted similar amounts of TNF-�. However,\nin the absence of plasma, MNC from newborns secreted significantly less TNF-� compared to MNC from\nadults. Moreover, at a low concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) and in the presence of plasma, TNF-� secretion\nwas significantly lower for newborn MNC compared to adult MNC. Adults and newborns had similar numbers\nof CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-positive cells as measured by flow cytometry. However, the intensity\nof the CD14 marker was greater for adult than for newborn cells. Incubation of cells with LPS led to an increase\nin CD14 and TLR-4 intensity for adult cells but not for newborn cells. The effect of LPS stimulation of adult\nor newborn cells was similar for ERK, p38, and I�B� phosphorylation, as well as I�B� degradation. Finally,\nwe assessed levels of the TLR-4 adapter protein, the myeloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88). We found a\ndirect relation between adult and newborn TNF-� secretion and MyD88, which was significantly decreased in\nnewborn monocytes. Since TLR-4 signals intracellularly through the adapter protein, MyD88, we hypothesize\nthat MyD88-dependent factors are responsible for delayed and decreased TNF-� secretion in newborn\nmonocytes.\n\nPhagocytic cells such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils\n(PMNs) and monocytes play a key role in host defense against\nbacterial infection. During infection, phagocytic cell activity is\nmodulated by cytokines (from the host) and toxins (from the\ninvading microorganism). For example, after exposure to lipo-\npolysaccharide (LPS), PMNs are primed for increased oxida-\ntive radical production (1, 45), and monocytes are activated to\nproduce tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�) (4, 35). Since\npriming of PMNs and activation of monocytes are key stages of\nthe early response to infection, any altered or delayed response\nto LPS may interupt the host’s response to infection.\n\nWe have shown previously that PMNs from newborns are\nprimed less effectively in vitro with LPS compared to PMNs\nfrom adults (7, 38). Similarly, some authors have found that\nmonocytes from newborns have a lower response than adult\nmonocytes in the secretion of cytokines, such as TNF-�, after\nLPS stimulation (11, 36). This diminished response to LPS by\nnewborn monocytes and PMNs may contribute to the observed\nincreased incidence and susceptibility of newborns to gram-\nnegative bacterial infection (22, 42).\n\nOver the past decade the mechanism of LPS interaction with\n\nthe phagocytic cell membrane has become more clearly under-\nstood. For adult PMNs, monocytes, and macrophages, CD14 is\nthe principal cell membrane receptor for the LPS/LPS-binding\nprotein (LBP) complex (40). Indeed, the presence of CD14\nand LBP greatly enhance cellular activation with LPS (25, 27,\n37, 41, 48, 50, 51, 54). In addition to CD14, a family of trans-\nmembrane receptors with homology to Toll proteins of Dro-\nsophila are known to trigger inflammatory reactions, including\nsecretion of proinflammatory cytokines (32, 39). The Toll-like\nreceptor-4 (TLR-4) imparts ligand-specific recognition of LPS\nfor mammalian cells (18, 28). Through CD14–TLR-4 interac-\ntions, LPS induces several intracellular responses, including\nactivation of nuclear factor �B (NF-�B) and activation of the\nmitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, particularly\nextracellular-signal regulated kinases (ERKs) and p38 (49).\nHowever, the intracellular processes involved in TNF-� tran-\nscription, translation, and secretion into the extracellular space\nafter stimulation by LPS are less well understood.\n\nUsing an in vitro model of the mononuclear cell (MNC)\nresponse to LPS, Cohen et al. (11) showed that cells derived\nfrom cord blood of newborns secrete lower amounts of TNF-�\ncompared to MNC from adults. A decreased response to LPS\nmay be even more marked in preterm infants (17, 24). How-\never, the mechanism underlying the hyporesponsiveness of\nnewborn cells has not been determined. We hypothesized that\nnewborn cells have an inherent deficiency in the production of\n\n* Corresponding author.

We investigated surface expres-\nsion of CD14 and TLR-4 on adult and newborn monocytes and\nLPS-induced TNF-� secretion. We also compared intracellular\nfactors in adult and newborn mononuclear cells, including my-\neloid differentiation antigen 88 (MyD88) and phosphorylation\nof ERK-1 and ERK-2 (ERK-1/2) and p38, as well as I�B phos-\nphorylation and degradation. We report here that diminished\nLPS-induced TNF-� protein secretion by monocytes from human\nnewborns is associated with diminished MyD88 expression.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nReagents. Escherichia coli LPS (serotype O111:B4) was purchased from List\nBiological Labs (Campbell, Calif.). Sterile water (no preservative, nonpyrogenic)\nwas obtained from Abbott Laboratories (Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Percoll,\nTaqDNA polymerase, ECL Western blotting reagents, and nitrocellulose mem-\nbranes were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Baie d’Urfé, Que-\nbec, Canada). Red blood cell lysing solution and paraformaldehyde were pur-\nchased from Becton Dickinson (Mountain View, Calif.) and from Cedarlane\nLaboratories Ltd., respectively. Flat-bottom multiwell plates for the enzyme\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were purchased from Costar (Cambridge,\nMass.). SuperScript II, random hexamers, deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix,\ndithiothreitol, HEPES buffer, sodium bicarbonate solution, and Hanks balanced\nsalt solution were obtained from Gibco-BRL (Burlington, Ontario, Canada).\nRPMI 1640 medium and 32P-labeled dCTP were purchased from ICN Biomedi-\ncals Canada, Ltd. (St-Laurent, Quebec, Canada). An RNeasy kit was obtained\nfrom Qiagen, Inc. (Chatsworth, Calif.). E-Toxate kits, ABTS [2,2�azinobis(3-\nethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid)], and all other chemicals were purchased from\nSigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). Buffers and plasma were checked for\nendotoxin by a Limulus amebocyte lysate assay to ensure that LPS was not\ndetectable (limit of detection of �12 pg/ml).\n\nAntibodies. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) MY4 (immunoglobulin G\n2b [IgG2b]) directed against CD14, and isotypic control (IgG2b) were purchased\nfrom Coulter Immunology (Hialeah, Fla.). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)\nconjugated to rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from Serotec (To-\nronto, Ontario, Canada). Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP), biotin-\nconjugated mouse anti-human TNF-� (MAb 11 IgG1) and purified mouse anti-\nhuman TNF-� (MAb 1 and IgG1) were purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego,\nCalif.). Rabbit anti-phosphorylated p38 and anti-I�B� protein antibodies and a\nmouse antiphosphorylated I�B� MAb were obtained from Cell Signaling Tech-\nnology (Beverly, Mass.). Rabbit anti-p38 protein, anti-ERK2 protein, anti-\nMyD88 antibodies, and mouse antiphosphorylated ERK1/2 MAb were pur-\nchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, Calif.). Rabbit anti-�-actin and\nHRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from Sigma Chem-\nical Co. (Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Anti-human TLR-4 (IgG2a) MAb was a\nkind gift of Kinsuke Miyake (Department of Immunology, Saga Medical School,\nNabeshima, Saga, Japan). Mouse IgG2a isotype control MAb (3H11) was a gift\nof Andrew Issekutz (Department of Pediatrics, Dalhousie University, Halifax,\nNova Scotia, Canada).\n\nMNC preparation. Fresh peripheral venous blood from healthy adult volun-\nteers and umbilical cord blood from normal, full-term newborns delivered by\ncaesarean section, were collected aseptically and anticoagulated with heparin (10\nU/ml). MNC were isolated by using a Percoll gradient technique described\npreviously (34). MNC were routinely purified to �95% purity and �98% via-\nbility in approximately 2 h and were assayed immediately afterward. After en-\nrichment, MNC were washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 without serum. In\npreliminary experiments, MNC from adult venous and from newborn cord blood\nwere characterized by using flow cytometry (FACS) for surface CD14. The\npercentage of CD14 positive monocytes in MNC was similar for adult and\nnewborn cells (10 and 12%, respectively).\n\nAdherent cells (monocytes) were prepared by culturing MNC (3.5 � 106/ml)\nin RPMI 1640 with 5% autologous plasma in the wells of a 24-well plate at 37°C\nand 5% CO2 for 2 h. The nonadherent cells were removed by a wash with\nmedium without plasma. Adherent cells were stimulated with LPS (at concen-\ntrations indicated in Results) in RPMI 1640 culture medium with or without 5%\nautologous plasma. Supernatants of adherent cells were collected at 1, 3, 6, and\n24 h and stored at \t70°C until assayed. In some experiments, MNC were also\ncultured and stimulated with LPS in suspension (i.e., nonadherent).\n\nFlow cytometry. For CD14 assessment healthy adult venous or full term new-\nborn cord blood (50 \nl) samples were incubated in the presence or absence of 0.1\nor 10 ng of LPS/ml for 30 min at 37°C before being stained with anti-CD14 (MY4\n\nclone; final concentration, 12.5 \ng/ml) or isotype control antibody (12.5 \ng/ml)\nfor 30 min at 4°C. The cells were then washed twice with Hanks balanced salt\nsolution and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at\n4°C, and then 1 ml of red blood cell lysing solution was added. The cells were washed\nthen fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\nFor TLR-4 staining, leukocyte-rich plasma was incubated in the presence or\nabsence of 5 ng of LPS/ml for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with PBS\nand labeled with a mouse anti-human TLR-4 (IgG2a) MAb or IgG2a isotype\ncontrol antibody for 1 h and then washed and incubated with FITC-conjugated\ngoat anti-mouse IgG. Red blood cells were then removed by hypotonic washing,\nand the remaining cells were suspended in 1% paraformaldehyde. Cell prepa-\nrations were stored at 4°C until FACS analysis. Cells were analyzed by using a\nBecton Dickinson FACScan by using the Lysis II software program. Lympho-\ncytes, PMNs, and monocytes were identified on the basis of front and side light\nscatter. Specific CD14 and TLR-4 was expressed as the mean value of the\nfluorescence intensity on samples minus that of the isotype control.\n\nMeasurements of adult and newborn TNF-�. Bioactivity of TNF-� was as-\nsessed with L929 cells as described previously (19). TNF-� protein concentra-\ntions were measured by using an ELISA as described by the manufacturer\n(Pharmingen) by using MAb 1 (2 \ng/ml) as capture and biotin-conjugated MAb\n11 for detection. TNF-� standards and adult and newborn MNC supernatants\nwere diluted in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin. The lower limit of detection\nwas 15 pg/ml in the assay. For intracellular TNF-�, standards were diluted in lysis\nbuffer. The lower limit of detection with lysis buffer was 30 pg/106 cells.\n\nMeasurements of adult and neonate mRNA for TNF-�. Isolation of total adult\nand newborn cellular RNA was achieved by using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen)\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. One microgram each of adult and\nnewborn MNC RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA by using Superscript II\nreverse transcriptase in the presence of [�-32P]dCTP. Then, equal amounts of\nacid-precipitable counts per minute of each cDNA were used for PCR. PCR was\nrun for 35 cycles for �-actin detection and 40 or 45 cycles for TNF-� detection\nin the presence of specific primer. The sequences for the sense and antisense\nprimers for TNF-� are 5�-TTG TTC CTC AGC CTC TTC TCC-3� and 5�-AGG\nGTT TGC TAC AAC ATG GGC-3�, respectively, and the sense and antisense\nprimer for �-actin are 5�-ACA TCC GCA AAG ACC TGT ACG-3� and 5�-TTG\nCTG ATC CAC ATC TGC TGG-3�, respectively. The antisense primer for\nTNF-� spans an intron-exon boundary and thus cannot amplify a product from\nDNA. Neither TNF-� primer cross-reacts with human TNF-�. PCR products\nwere electrophoresed in a 1.5% agarose gel containing 0.5 \ng of ethidium\nbromide/ml and photographed under UV light.\n\nWestern blot assays. Adherent monocytes from adults and newborns were\nprepared and incubated in the absence or presence of LPS (0.1 or 10 ng/ml) as\ndescribed above for 20 min at 37°C with 5% CO2. After the incubation, the\nmedium was aspirated, and the cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS con-\ntaining 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate. The PBS was then replaced with 0.5\nml of M2 buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.0], 0.5% NP-40, 250 mM NaC1, 3 mM EGTA,\n3 mM EDTA, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 \ng of\nleupeptin/ml, 5 \ng/ml of pepstatin A, 10 \ng of aprotinin/ml, 0.1 mM Na3VO4).\nAfter incubation for 30 min at 4°C, the lysates were transferred to microcentri-\nfuge tubes and clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 � g for 10 min at 4°C to\nremove insoluble materials. The protein concentrations in the lysates were de-\ntermined by using the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay. Twenty micrograms of\nprotein from each sample was analyzed by Western blotting after sodium dodecyl\nsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer, with antibodies\nspecific for phosphorylated I�B�, I�B� protein, MyD88, TLR-4, phosphorylated\np38, or ERK1/2. The binding of the antibodies were detected with HRP-conju-\ngated goat anti-rabbit or mouse IgG and ECL Western blotting reagents, fol-\nlowed by exposure to Kodak X-ray films. The equality of loading was confirmed\nby stripping the membranes and reblotting with p38, ERK2 protein antibodies as\ndescribed earlier (6). Band density was quantified by densitometry analysis by\nusing NIH Image J software and calculated as the corrected density of MyD88\nbands related to that of �-actin on the same blots.\n\nStatistical analysis. Data are presented as the mean � the standard deviation\n(SD) (see Fig. 1, 3, and 5) or the mean � standard error of mean (SEM) (see Fig.\n2). For comparison between adult and newborn samples, a nonpaired t test was\nused; a P value of �0.05 was considered significant. Statistical determinations\nwere done by using Statistix (Analytical Software, Minneapolis, Minn.).\n\nRESULTS\n\nTNF-� secretion by adult and newborn MNC. TNF-� secre-\ntion from adherent monocytes of adults and newborns was\n\n1224 YAN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\ncompared by using bioassay and ELISA. In agreement with\nearlier reports that newborn monocytes secret fewer cytokines\nthan adult monocytes upon LPS stimulation (11, 36), in our\nexperimental system, we also observed that the secretion of\nTNF-� from both adherent monocytes and nonadherent MNC\nof newborns was less than that from adults early in incubation\n(�6 h) (Fig. 1). For adult cells the concentration of TNF-� in\nthe supernatant of adherent monocytes peaked between 3 and\n6 h, whereas the maximum for newborn cells was not reached\nuntil 6 h of incubation. Excellent correlation between bioassay\n\nand ELISA was found for cells from adults and newborns (Fig.\n1A and B) (r � 0.94).\n\nSince adherence of monocytes to glass or plastic may signal\ncells to produce inflammatory cytokines (26) and to develop\ncharacteristics of tissue macrophages, we undertook experi-\nments with nonadherent MNC in the presence or absence of\nplasma. Using this model we compared LPS-induced TNF-�\nproduction by adult venous and newborn cord blood MNC. As\nshown in Fig. 1C, neither adult nor newborn MNC secreted\ndetectable TNF-� protein (�15 pg/ml) after stimulation with a\nlow concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml) in the absence of plasma.\nIn the presence of plasma (5%), however, this low concentra-\ntion of LPS did induce both adult and newborn MNC TNF-�\nsecretion. Levels achieved by adult MNC were significantly\nhigher than that of newborn cells at 3 h (5.38 � 0.56 ng/ml\nversus 0.97 � 0.85 ng/ml; P � 0.01). The difference between\nadult and newborn cellular response was still seen after 6 h of\nincubation (6.60 � 0.97 ng/ml versus 1.52 � 1.30 ng/ml; P �\n0.05).\n\nIn the absence of plasma and at a higher LPS concentration\n(10 ng/ml), both adult and newborn MNC produced TNF-�\n(Fig. 1C), but MNC from newborns again secreted less TNF-�\ncompared to adult MNC (0.72 � 0.33 ng/ml versus 2.05 � 0.72\nng/ml; P � 0.05). As expected, when 5% plasma was present,\nMNC from both adults and newborns secreted higher amounts\nof TNF-�. Under these conditions (10 ng of LPS/ml plus 5%\nplasma) adult and newborn MNC secreted similar amounts of\nTNF-� (5.80 � 1.01 ng/ml for adult and 5.65 � 0.57 ng/ml for\nnewborn MNC).\n\nIn order to better understand TNF-� regulation in new-\nborns, we examined the levels of mRNA for TNF-� in stimu-\nlated MNC. Newborn and adult MNC consistently showed\ndetectable mRNA for TNF-� in the presence of 0.1 ng of\nLPS/ml alone, although we failed to detect secreted or intra-\ncellular TNF-� protein under this condition. When plasma and\nLPS (0.1 ng/ml) were both present in the cultures, steady-state\nmRNA levels slightly increased but remained similar in both\nadult and newborn cells (Fig. 2). Thus, differences in TNF-�\nexpression could not be attributed to major differences in\nTNF-� mRNA levels between adults and newborns.\n\nCD14 and TLR-4 of adult and newborn monocytes. Since\nmembrane-bound CD14 and TLR-4 is required for effective\nLPS induced TNF-� production from monocytes/macro-\nphages, we characterized CD14 on monocytes from adults and\n\nFIG. 1. Plastic adherent newborn monocytes and MNC produce\nless TNF-� than adult monocytes. (A and B) The TNF-� protein\nconcentrations in the supernatants of adherent monocytes of adults\nand newborns was measured after incubation in autologous plasma\nand LPS (1 ng/ml) for the times indicated. (C) MNC were incubated\nfor 3 h with LPS (at 0.1 and 10 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of\nadult plasma (5%).

TNF-� mRNA levels are similar in MNC from adults and\nnewborns. Adult and newborn monocytes were incubated with LPS\n(0.1 ng/ml) in the presence or absence of adult plasma (5%) for 3 h.\nTotal cellular RNA was extracted and used in reverse transcription-\nPCR with specific primer sets for TNF-� and �-actin. A representative\nresult of three independent experiments is shown.\n\nVOL. 72, 2004 TNF-� PRODUCTION BY NEWBORN MONONUCLEAR CELLS 1225\n\n\n\nnewborns before or after LPS stimulation. As shown in Fig. 3,\nadult and newborn monocytes expressed similar levels of\nTLR-4 and CD14 before LPS stimulation; however, newborn\ncells demonstrated significantly lower levels of both TLR-4 and\nCD14 than adult cells after LPS stimulation (Fig. 3).\n\nResponses of MAP kinases and I�B� in monocytes from\nadults and newborns to LPS stimulation. The inducible ex-\npression of the gene for TNF-� by monocytes is regulated by\nMAP kinases and I�B/NF-�B nuclear transcription factors (14,\n49). Because the LPS-induced secretion of TNF-� from new-\nborn MNC was remarkably decreased compared to adult cells,\nwe assessed the signaling molecule activation in adult and\nnewborn monocytes after LPS stimulation. The basal levels of\n\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 in newborn monocytes\nwere slightly higher than in adult monocytes (Fig. 4A and C).\nAfter LPS stimulation, incremental changes in levels of phos-\nphorylated ERK1/2 were somewhat greater in adult than new-\nborn monocytes (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, LPS activated\np38 to a similar extent in monocytes from both adults and\nnewborns (Fig. 4C). Similar results were observed in MNC that\nwere incubated in suspension (Fig. 5). These patterns of MAP\nkinase responsiveness suggest that MAP kinase signaling, by\nitself, was unlikely to be responsible for the attenuation of\nnewborn TNF-� production.\n\nA critical step during induction of many cytokines is the\nactivation of NF-�B. This occurs as a result of phosphorylation\n\nFIG. 3. LPS-stimulated newborn monocytes have lower amounts of\nTLR-4 and CD14 than adult cells. (A) Leukocyte-rich plasma from\nadults and newborns was left untreated (Control) or stimulated with 5\nng of LPS/ml for 30 min at 37°C and then stained with a mouse\nanti-TLR-4 MAb and then an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG\nbefore being assessed by FACS. The mean � the SD fluorescent\nintensity for adult and newborn monocytes is shown.

As shown in\nFig. 4E and F, I�B� phosphorylation and I�B� protein deg-\nradation were similar for both adult and newborn monocytes.\nThese data correspond with the reverse transcription-PCR re-\nsults showing similar levels of TNF-� mRNA in adult and\nnewborn cells (Fig. 2).\n\nExpression of MyD88 in monocytes from adults and new-\nborns. MyD88, a cytosolic adapter protein, has been reported\nas an essential mediator for LPS receptor signaling (3, 21, 43,\n46). Thus, we investigated whether there was any difference in\nthe expression of MyD88 in adult versus newborn monocytes\nby using Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, there was a\nmarked difference in protein levels of MyD88 in lysates pre-\npared from newborn compared to adult monocytes (58.7% �\n9.8% of adult monocyte MyD88 protein; P � 0.0003 as deter-\nmined by paired t test). This was not linked to any detectable\ndifference in total cellular TLR-4 protein on the same analyzed\nsamples (Fig. 6), although the surface expression of this recep-\ntor was higher in LPS-stimulated adult cells compared to new-\nborn cells (Fig. 3A).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIt is generally understood that newborns have increased\nsusceptibility to gram-negative bacterial and viral infection. A\nnumber of mechanisms may contribute to this, including hu-\nmoral and cellular factors. In recent years cytokines critical in\nthe early stages of inflammation, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)\n\n(36) and IL-12 (20, 31), have also been assessed in newborns.\nMost of this work was done with primary cell cultures stimu-\nlated in vitro with live organisms or bacterial LPS. Diminished\nand delayed secretion of these cytokines has been reported for\nnewborn cells.\n\nThe results of studies comparing TNF-� secretion by new-\nborn animals or cells after stimulation with LPS or bacteria\nhave been variable. Although most studies have reported di-\nminished responsiveness of newborns (9, 11, 36), some inves-\ntigations have found similar or increased responsiveness of\nnewborns compared to juvenile or adult animals after LPS\nstimulation (13).\n\nIn our study, significantly lower amounts of TNF-� were\nsecreted by human newborn MNC compared to adult MNC\nafter LPS exposure. This was evident when cells were stimu-\nlated with a high concentration of LPS (10 ng/ml) in the ab-\nsence of plasma and at a low concentration of LPS (0.1 ng/ml)\nin the presence of plasma.\n\nDiminished TNF-� secretion correlated directly with levels\nof MyD88 in newborn cells. Our findings with MNC and our\nprevious report with PMNs from normal newborns (38) are\nremarkably similar to observations with cells from MyD88\t/\t\n\nmice and MyD88 truncated cells. Mice with the MyD88 gene\ninactivated (MyD88\t/\t) lack LPS-induced cytokine produc-\ntion and NO2\n\n\t release but preserve NF-�B and JNK activation\n(2, 21, 23). TLR signaling is also suppressed when MyD88\nmolecule is truncated (10). The diminished LPS responses that\nwe observed in newborn MNC are therefore consistent with\n\nFIG. 6. Expression of MyD88 and TLR-4 in adult and newborn monocytes. (A) Adherent monocytes were harvested and lysed as described in\nthe text. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit anti-MyD88 antibody. (B and C) The same membranes were stripped and\nreblotted with a rabbit anti-TLR-4 antibody (B) and then repeatedly with the stripping-reblotting cycle for �-actin (C). A pooled result of the\ndensitometry analysis of MyD88 bands in panel A is shown in panel D as means � the SD of arbitrary units normalized by the density of �-actin\nbands (n � 7). ❋, P � 0.0003 (paired t test).\n\nVOL. 72, 2004 TNF-� PRODUCTION BY NEWBORN MONONUCLEAR CELLS 1227\n\n\n\nreports of decreased expression of MyD88. Because of its cen-\ntral place in signaling pathways, MyD88 may become a “bot-\ntleneck” affecting TLR-triggered cytokines in general (44).\nThis possibility should be explored through assessment of\nother stimuli linked to MyD88 processing and other cytokines.\n\nThe differences between newborn and adult TNF-� secre-\ntion are most evident in suboptimal conditions of stimulation,\nsuch as low concentrations of LPS in the presence of plasma or\nhigher concentrations of LPS in the absence of plasma. How-\never, with high concentrations of LPS in the presence of\nplasma, newborn and adult MNC secrete similar amounts of\nTNF-�. The reason for this difference is currently not clear.\nWe hypothesize that, at high concentrations, LPS may over-\nwhelm deficits of MyD88 by signaling through a MyD88-inde-\npendent pathway, resulting in similar amounts of TNF-� se-\ncretion in adult and newborn MNC.\n\nProduction and secretion of TNF-� may be controlled or\nmodulated at several steps: cell receptors, intracellular mes-\nsengers, mRNA transcription, protein translation, intracellular\nstorage, and/or secretion. In addition, LPS can interact with\ncells via at least two pathways that are either dependent or\nindependent of plasma proteins (5, 11, 12, 30, 47, 52, 53). The\ntwo pathways of LPS activation may serve different roles in\ngram-negative bacterial infection. Plasma-dependent LPS ac-\ntivation may be the predominant pathway for monocytes and\nPMNs in the bloodstream, where plasma proteins are at high\nconcentrations and LPS levels are low early in sepsis. In con-\ntrast, the plasma-independent pathway may be important at\nthe local site of infection, where plasma proteins levels are low\nand the LPS concentration may be high. Understanding both\npathways of cellular activation by LPS will be important in\norder to understand the host response to gram-negative infec-\ntion.\n\nAt low concentrations of LPS, LBP facilitates the binding of\nLPS to CD14 and greatly enhances TNF-� secretion. Thus,\none possible explanation for our finding is that LBP or some\nother constituents of plasma may be more active in adult than\nin newborn plasma. However, LBP is unlikely to be responsi-\nble, since we have shown previously that concentrations in\nnewborn and adult plasma are similar (8). We also speculated\nthat the difference between adult and newborn MNC protein\nproduction might be related to mRNA transcription. However,\nwhen mRNA for TNF-� was assessed, no striking difference\nwas observed. This observation is consistent with the report of\nHan et al. (16) showing that TNF-� secretion after LPS stim-\nulation is controlled primarily by posttranscriptional mecha-\nnisms.\n\nCD14 is a critical LPS receptor on human MNC. Most LPS\nresponses including activation of MAP kinases depend primar-\nily on CD14 (15, 29). Because CD14 is a glycosylphosphatidy-\nlinositol-anchoring molecule, it lacks an intracellular domain\nneeded to transmit the LPS signal. As presently understood,\nLPS, with the extracellular proteins LBP and MD2, binds to\nCD14, which then clusters with TLR-4. The CD14–TLR-4\ncomplex then signals intracellularly through the adapter pro-\nteins MyD88 and/or Mal (MyD88 adapter-like protein) to in-\nduce activation of IRAK (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase),\nwhich triggers signal cascades through MAP kinase and other\npathways (3, 21, 33, 43, 46). We found that TLR-4 expression\nin the monocytes of adults and newborns is similar before cells\n\nare stimulated with LPS. The MAP kinases ERK1/2 and p38\nwere phosphorylated in both adult and newborn monocytes in\nresponse to LPS. However, more studies should be done on\nMAP kinases to determine whether subtle differences between\nadults and newborns are present. The LPS induced I�B� phos-\nphorylation and degradation were also similar in adult and\nnewborn monocytes.\n\nThe finding of greatly diminished MyD88 in cells of human\nnewborns provides some insight into the role this molecule\nmay play in the diminished inflammatory responses in new-\nborns. Although the suppression of inflammation and acquired\nimmunity may be advantageous for survival of the fetus, innate\nand acquired immune processes must be acquired rapidly after\nbirth. Further study on regulation of MyD88 should be done to\nprovide insight into the ontogeny of the innate immune system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Chris Waterhouse and Linda Best for their technical\nassistance, Kim Barrett for transcribing the manuscript, and the Case\nRoom nurses of the IWK Health Centre for their assistance in collect-\ning newborn umbilical cord blood.\n\nThis research was supported by Hospital for Sick Children Founda-\ntion (Toronto) and the Canada Institute of Health Research\n(MT14439).
