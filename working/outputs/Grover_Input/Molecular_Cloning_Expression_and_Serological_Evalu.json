The open reading frame of the cDNA clone encodes a polypeptide\ncomprising 85 amino acids with a 20-amino-acid NH2-terminal signal sequence, which was confirmed following\nN-terminal sequencing of the native antigen. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that the clone\nencoding EmAgB8/1 is predominantly transcribed in larval E. multilocularis. The gene consists of two exons\n(encoding the signal sequence and mature protein) separated by a 91-bp intron. The mature form was\nexpressed in Escherichia coli, and its antigenic reactivity was compared with that of a counterpart, an 8-kDa\nsubunit of antigen B from Echinococcus granulosus (EgAgB8/1) by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immu-\nnosorbent assay (ELISA) with serum samples from patients confirmed to have cystic echinococcosis (CE) and\nalveolar echinococcosis (AE). Recombinant EmAgB8/1 showed positive reactions in Western blots with 81.3%\n(65 of 80) of serum samples from CE patients and 40.6% (26 of 64) of serum samples from AE patients, while\nrecombinant EgAgB8/1 showed positive reactions with 86% (43 of 50) and 42% (19 of 45) of the serum samples\nfrom these CE and AE patients, respectively. By the ELISA, both EmAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/1 exhibited similar\npositive reactions with 88% (44 of 50) of serum samples from CE patients and 37.8% (17 of 45) serum samples\nfrom AE patients. Statistical analysis revealed that the sensitivity of EmAgB8/1 was comparable to that of\nEgAgB8/1 for the serodiagnosis of echinococcal diseases. There was no cross-reaction with sera from patients\nwith cysticercosis, which often cross-react when native antigens are used for serodiagnosis.\n\nEchinococcosis in humans is a widespread and potentially\nlethal parasitic zoonosis. Cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alve-\nolar echinococcosis (AE), caused by infection with the larval\nstages of Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocu-\nlaris, respectively, are the clinically and epidemiologically most\nimportant forms of echinococcosis (21, 24, 30). These diseases\nare coendemic in large areas of the Northern Hemisphere,\nincluding the northwest part of China (2, 13, 21, 30, 34). Early\ndiagnosis and proper treatment of the diseases are important\nsince the pathogenicity is high and the prognosis for patients\nwith echinococcosis, especially AE, is often poor. It is now\nrecommended that imaging for the detection of a hepatic ab-\nnormality is the first choice not only in areas where echinococ-\ncosis is highly endemic but also in developed countries where\nAE is rare and should be followed by confirmation by serology\nwith specific antigens (8, 24, 32). For these reasons, substantial\nefforts have been made to establish sensitive and specific se-\n\nrodiagnostic methods (1, 7, 10, 11, 12, 23, 25, 31). During the\nprocess, two major diagnostic antigens, named antigen 5 (Ag5)\nand antigen B (AgB), were identified from E. granulosus hy-\ndatid cyst fluid. These two antigens are considered the most\nimportant antigens for the serodiagnosis of human CE (17, 33).\nAgB is a 160-kDa thermostable lipoprotein, which comprises\nthree subunits with molecular masses of 8 to 12, 16, and 20 to\n24 kDa (18, 19). The smallest subunit (8 to 12 kDa) of AgB is\nstrongly immunogenic in patients with echinococcal infections;\nabout 80 to 90% of serum samples from CE patients and 40%\nof serum samples from AE patients exhibit specific antibodies\nagainst this antigen (15, 19, 20, 32).\n\nA full-length cDNA encoding an 8-kDa subunit of E. granu-\nlosus AgB (EgAgB8/1) has been cloned by Frosch et al. (4),\nand another cDNA clone encoding a novel 8-kDa subunit of\nAgB (EgAgB8/2) was characterized by Fernández et al. (3).\nBoth EgAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/2 have been considered the com-\nponents of the smallest subunit of native AgB from E. granu-\nlosus and may constitute the building blocks of the higher-\nmolecular-mass subunits (5). Furthermore, a cDNA fragment\nencoding an EgAgB8/1 homolog (referred as EmAgB8/1 in\n\n* Corresponding author.

However, the complete nucleotide sequence and the\nantigenicity of EmAgB8/1 for the detection of CE and AE by\nuse of patient sera have not yet been characterized.\n\nIn the present study, genomic DNA and a full-length cDNA\nclone encoding EmAgB8/1 were isolated from E. multilocularis\nand characterized. The antigenicity of recombinant EmAgB8/1\n(rEmAgB8/1) was assessed by Western blotting (WB) and en-\nzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and compared\nwith that of recombinant EgAgB8/1 (rEgAgB8/1).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nParasite material. Metacestodes were obtained from a Mongolian gerbil (Me-\nriones unguiculatus) experimentally infected with E. multilocularis, which was\noriginally isolated from a naturally infected vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in\nHokkaido, Japan.\n\nPatients’ sera. Serum samples were collected from the following groups of\npatients with AE and CE after appropriate ethical approval was obtained and\ninformed consent was obtained from the patients: 30 serum samples from pa-\ntients with CE in France (14) and 30 serum samples from patients with CE in\nChina confirmed by surgery; 20 serum samples from patients with CE in Aus-\ntralia confirmed by serology with Ag5 with or without surgery (17, 18), followed\nby WB and ELISA with AgB of E. granulosus hydatid cyst fluid at Asahikawa\nMedical College (AMC) (20) (Table 1); 45 serum samples from patients with AE\ndiagnosed by surgery plus Em18 serology at Hokkaido University Hospital and\nAMC; and 19 serum samples from patients with AE in France diagnosed by\nsurgery plus serology with a commercially available kit (14, 16). The major target\nantigens were Em18, Em16, and AgB in a whole larval extract of E. multilocularis\n(10, 12, 14, 16). These serum samples were obtained from patients who had been\nconfirmed to have CE or AE and do not necessarily represent samples taken\nfrom patients prior to their commencement of treatment surgically and/or che-\nmotherapeutically. Twenty-three serum samples from patients who had other\nhelminth infections and who were confirmed to be antibody positive for the\nhomologous antigens were obtained from the serum bank at AMC to evaluate\nthe specificity of rEmAgB8/1: 10 serum samples from patients with neurocystic-\nercosis, 5 serum samples from patients with sparganosis, 3 serum samples from\npatients with schistosomiasis mansoni, and 5 serum samples from patients with\nfascioliasis patients.\n\nIsolation of cDNA encoding EmAgB8/1. A cDNA library prepared from an\nE. multilocularis metacestode was used (28). In order to isolate full-length cDNA\nencoding EmAgB8/1, a fluorescein-labeled cDNA probe was synthesized by PCR\n\nby using the cDNA library as the template DNA. The primers used for probe\nsynthesis were EmAgB8/1/F2 (5�-GGATCCGGATGATGGTCTCACCTCGAC\nGTCG-3� [P2 in Fig. 1]) and EmAgB8/1/R (5�- GGATCCTATTTACCTTCAG\nCAACCAACTC-3� [P3 in Fig. 1]), designed on the basis of a previously pub-\nlished nucleotide sequence (4). Since these primers were also used for amplifi-\ncation of a region encoding the mature form, BamHI restriction sites (under-\nlined) were added to facilitate subsequent cloning steps. A guanine (boldface)\nwas added to the 5� end of the forward primer to enable in-frame cloning into the\nexpression vector. PCR was performed with 200 �M each deoxynucleoside\ntriphosphate, 0.5 nmol of fluorescein-12-dUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals,\nMannheim, Germany), 20 pmol of each primer, 2 �l of the cDNA library, and 1\nU of Ex TaqDNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan) in a total volume of 50 �l.\nThe PCR conditions were programmed for initial denaturation at 94°C for 1 min;\n3 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, and 2 min at 72°C; and 35 cycles of 30 s at\n94°C, 30 s at 65°C, and 2 min at 72°C, with a final extension for 5 min at 72°C.\nAs a result, an approximately 200-bp labeled cDNA probe was amplified (data\nnot shown). The cDNA library was screened by plaque hybridization with the\nDNA probe, and positive clones were detected with an enhanced chemilumines-\ncence random prime labeling detection system (Amersham Life Science, Little\nChalfont, United Kingdom) according to the instructions of the manufacturer.\nThe isolated phages were converted to plasmids by automatic site-specific re-\ncombination in host strain Escherichia coli BM25.8 (Novagen, Madison, Wis.).\nThe recombinant plasmids were then extracted by a miniprep protocol and in-\ntroduced into strain E. coli JM109 (Promega, Madison, Wis.) for DNA sequencing.\n\nRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was prepared from E. multilocularis proto-\nscolex-rich metacestodes with an RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).\nReverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was carried out with Ready-To-Go RT-\nPCR beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with an oligo(dT)-labeled adaptor\nprimer [5�-CTGATCTAGAGGTACCGGATCC(dT)20-3�] for synthesis of the\nfirst strand of cDNA and primer EmAgB8/1/F1 (5�-ATGCGGTTCTGCCTTCT\nTC-TCGC-3� [P1 in Fig. 1]) and an adaptor primer (5�-CTGATCTAGAGGTA\nCCGGATCC-3�) for PCR amplification. The RT-PCR products were purified\nfrom agarose gels by using a filter cartridge (TaKaRa), ligated into vector\npGEM-T (Promega), and subcloned into E. coli JM109. Twenty-four clones with\nthe expected insert size were picked and sequenced.\n\nIsolation of genomic clone of EmAgB8/1. A genomic DNA library prepared\nfrom E. multilocularis protoscolices (22) was screened by hybridization with a\nfluorescein-labeled EmAgB8/1 cDNA probe, as described above. Bacteriophage\nlambda DNAs from positive clones purified with a Lambda mini kit (Qiagen)\nwere directly sequenced.\n\nDNA sequencing and sequence analysis. Nucleotide sequencing was per-\nformed on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer with the ABI PRISM Big Dye\nTerminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster\nCity, Calif.). The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed by\n\nTABLE 1.

The alignment of sequences was\ncarried out with the CLUSTAL W program, available over the World Wide Web\n(http://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/E-mail/clustalw-e.html).\n\nNH2-terminal sequencing of native EmAgB. Cyst fluid components obtained\nfrom cysts developed in a mouse experimentally infected with larval tissue ho-\nmogenates of E. multilocularis were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto a polyvinyli-\ndene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore, Tokyo, Japan). The membrane\nwas stained with 0.2% Coomassie brilliant blue R-250, and the 8-kDa target band\nwas excised for sequencing of the NH2 terminus. Sequencing was performed by\nthe Edman degradation method.\n\nExpression and purification of rEmAgB8/1. The region encoding the antici-\npated mature form of EmAgB8/1 was amplified under the same cycling condi-\ntions and with the same primers used for probe synthesis. The PCR product was\npurified from the agarose gel, digested with BamHI, and then ligated into\nexpression plasmid vector pET-32b(�) (Novagen). E. coli BL21(DE3)(pLysS)\n(Novagen) was used as the host cell. Protein expression was induced at 37°C for\n4 h in the presence of isopropyl-�-D-thiogalactopyranoside at a final concentra-\ntion of 1 mM. Recombinant protein fused with thioredoxin was purified with a\nHis Trap column kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and was cleaved with\nenterokinase (Novagen) to separate the fusion partner. The recombinant pro-\nteins from each purification step were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.\n\nPreparation and purification of rEgAgB8/1. The E. granulosus gene region\nencoding the mature form of EgAgB8/1 is intronless (25); hence, E. granulosus\ngenomic DNA was used to amplify the region of the mature form of EgAgB8/1.\nGenomic DNA was extracted from E. granulosus protoscolices collected from a\nsingle hydatid cyst from a sheep at a slaughterhouse in Urumqi, China. The\nregion encoding the mature form of EgAgB8/1 was amplified by PCR with\nprimers 5�-GATGATGGCCTTACCTGACGTCGAGGAGTGTGATGAAAA\nTGATTGGCGAAGCGA and 3�-CTATTTACCTTCAGCAACCAACTCTCT\nGAGGTGGGACTTA, designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of\nEgAgB8/1 (4). The PCR was performed as described above for cDNA probe\nsynthesis. Subsequently, an approximately 200-bp product was amplified and\ninserted into pET-32b(�) for protein expression (data not shown). The expres-\nsion and purification of rEgAgB8/1 were performed by methods similar to those\ndescribed above for rEmAgB8/1.\n\nProtein assay. The protein concentration was estimated by using a BCA\nProtein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.).\n\nWB. SDS-PAGE and WB were carried out as described by Ito et al. (9). In\nbrief, approximately 1 �g of either rEmAgB8/1 or rEgAgB8/1 was separated on\ntwo-dimensional 4 to 20% polyacrylamide gradient gels (width, 6 cm; Tefco,\nTokyo, Japan) and transferred electrophoretically onto PVDF membranes. Each\nmembrane was cut into 50 strips and probed with diluted human serum (1:50).\nBound antibody was detected by using rec-protein G-peroxidase conjugate\n(Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, Calif.) at a 1:1,000 dilution and\n4-chloro-1-naphthol (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) at a final concentration of\n0.05% as the substrate.\n\nELISA. ELISA was performed as described by Verastegui et al. (33), with\nslight modifications. Briefly, 96-well microtitration plates (Maxisorp; Nunc,\nRoskilde, Denmark) were coated with either rEmAgB8/1 or rEgAgB8/1 (100\n�l/well) at a concentration of 1 �g of protein per ml in 10 mM carbonate buffer\n(pH 9.6). Serum samples were diluted 1:200 in blocking solution (1% casein in 20\nmM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6] containing 150 mM NaCl) and tested in duplicate. Bound\nantibody was detected by using the rec-protein G-peroxidase conjugate at a\n\n1:2,000 dilution in blocking solution. As the substrate, 100 �l of 2,2�-azino-bis(3-\nethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) was added to each\nwell (0.3 mg/ml in 50 mM citrate buffer [pH 4.7]) and the plate was incubated at\n37°C. Color development was terminated by addition of 100 �l of 1% SDS after\n15 min. The optical density at 405 nm was monitored with a microplate reader\n(ImmunoMini, model NJ-2300; Nalge, Nunc, Japan). Cutoff values were estab-\nlished as four times the optical density of pooled serum samples from 30 healthy\ndonors.\n\nStatistical analysis. The serological data obtained with antigens rEmAgB8/1\nand rEgAgB8/1 were tested by the chi-square test with 95% confidence.\n\nNucleotide sequence accession numbers. The cDNA and amino acid se-\nquences of EmAgB8/1 and clones EmAgB8/1a, EmAgB8/1b, and EmAgB8/1c\nand the genomic DNA sequence for EmAgB8/1 are deposited in the DDBJ/\nEMBL/GenBank databases under accession numbers AB100403, AB100404,\nAB100405, AB100406, and AB112079.\n\nRESULTS\n\nCharacterization of EmAgB8/1 and RT-PCR analysis. Thir-\nteen positive clones were isolated from approximately 2 � 105\n\nrecombinant phage by plaque hybridization. Nucleotide se-\nquence analysis revealed that all 13 clones had overlapping\nsequences, with the longest one being 352 bp (Fig. 1). The\nputative open reading frame consisted of 255 bp encoding a\n\nFIG. 1. Complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of EmAgB8/1. An asterisk indicates a stop codon.

Multiple alignment of amino acid sequences deduced from\nfour different cDNAs of EmAgB8/1 with EgAgB8/1 and Ag1V1 of T.\nsolium. Amino acid residues identical to those of EmAgB8/1 are indi-\ncated by colons. Dashes are introduced to maintain alignment. The\nsignal sequence is shown in boldface, and an arrow indicates the cleav-\nage site of the signal peptide. The amino acids found in the NH2-ter-\nminal amino acids of native AgB are underlined.

The cDNA and\namino acid sequences are deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank\ndatabase under the accession numbers provided in Materials and\nMethods. The sequences of EgAgB8/1 and Ag1V1 of T. solium were\nobtained from the EMBL data bank (accession numbers Z26336 and\nAB044081, respectively).\n\n1084 MAMUTI ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\npolypeptide consisting of 85 amino acids with a 20-amino-acid\nNH2-terminal hydrophobic region and a mature form. NH2-\nterminal amino acid sequencing of native EmAgB8/1 revealed\nthat the cleavage site for a signal sequence is present between\nAla20 and Asp21 (Fig. 2, arrow). The molecular mass of the\nmature form was estimated to be approximately 7.6 kDa, a size\ncorresponding to that of EgAgB8/1 (4). Comparison of the\namino acid sequences revealed that the sequence of the ma-\nture form of EmAgB8/1 showed 92.6% homology with that of\nEgAgB8/1.\n\nSequence analysis of the RT-PCR products revealed that\nfour different cDNAs encoding EmAgB8/1 were obtained from\nlarval E. multilocularis. Twenty-one of 24 clones examined had\nsequences identical to that of EmAgB8/1 (AB100403) cloned\nfrom the cDNA library, but the sequences of another three\nclones, designated EmAgB8/1a (AB100404), EmAgB8/1b\n(AB100405), and EmAgB8/1c (AB100406), were different\nfrom the sequence of EmAgB8/1 and those of each other. In\ncomparison with the sequence of EmAgB8/1, the Lys at\nposition 39, the Met at position 64, and the Ser at position\n30 were replaced by Arg, Ile, and Gly in EmAgB8/1a,\nEmAgB8/1b, and EmAgB8/1c, respectively (Fig. 2). These\namino acid substitutions resulted in 97.6 to 98.5% and 91.4\nto 92.6% homologies among the four different clones of\nEmAgB8/1 and EgAgB8/1, respectively. By contrast,\nEmAgB8/1 has only 20% homology with the serodiagnostic\nprotein Ag1V1 of Taenia solium (28).\n\nStructure of EmAgB8/1 gene. A 1,780-bp genomic DNA frag-\nment (AB112079) was isolated from an E. multilocularis pro-\ntoscolex genomic DNA library. The EmAgB8/1 gene consists\nof two exons and a 91-bp intron inserted at the junction be-\ntween the sequence encoding the signal peptide and the ma-\nture protein, and these also occur in the homologous gene in E.\ngranulosus (26).\n\nExpression and comparison of antigenicities of rEmAgB8/1\nand rEgAgB8/1. Both rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1 were suc-\ncessfully expressed in E. coli as soluble fusion proteins with\nthioredoxin. The fusion proteins were purified from bacterial\nlysate, and the fusion moieties were removed by cleavage with\nenterokinase. Finally, purified rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1\n\n(Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) were used for subsequent\nserological tests.\n\nThe antigenicity of purified rEmAgB8/1 was compared with\nthat of rEgAgB8/1 by WB and ELISA with sera from patients\nconfirmed to have CE and AE. The results obtained by sero-\nlogical tests with the two recombinant antigens are summa-\nrized in Table 1. By WB, rEmAgB8/1 showed positive reactions\nwith 81.3% (65 of 80) of serum samples from patient with CE\nand 40.6% (26 of 64) of serum samples from patient with AE,\nand rEgAgB8/1 also reacted with 86% (43 of 50) of serum\nsamples from patient with CE and 42% (19 of 45) of serum\nsamples from patient with AE. Representative data are shown\nin Fig. 4. Most of the serum samples from patients with CE and\nAE showed very similar reactivities with both recombinant\nantigens; the exceptions were two serum samples from patients\nwith CE (the result for one sample is shown in Fig. 4, lane\n8) and one serum sample from a patient with AE (data not\nshown), which failed to produce visible bands reactive with\nrEmAgB8/1, while they were positive for reactivity with\nrEgAgB8/1. By ELISA, both recombinant antigens were co-\nincidently detected by 88% of 50 serum samples from pa-\ntients with CE and 37.8% of 45 serum samples from patients\nwith AE (Table 1 and Fig. 5). Statistical analysis revealed\nthat there was no significant difference between the reactiv-\nities of rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1 for the detection of anti-\ngens in the sera of patients with CE and AE by WB.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, the complete nucleotide sequence of EmAgB8/1\nfrom E. multilocularis, an EgAgB8/1 homolog, was determined\nand the antigenicity of the recombinant protein was evaluated.\nSequence analysis revealed that EmAgB8/1 consists of a signal\nsequence and a mature form, similar to EgAgB8/1, which was\npredicted to be a secretory protein (4). NH2-terminal sequence\nanalysis of the smallest subunit of native AgB of E. multilo-\ncularis confirmed the cleavage site for the signal sequence of\nEmAgB8/1. Genomic DNA sequence analysis revealed that\nthe gene structure of EmAgB8/1 is similar to that of EgAgB8/1\n(26).\n\nFour different cDNAs encoding EmAgB8/1 with single\namino acid substitutions were obtained by RT-PCR analysis.\nSequence analysis revealed that 21 of 24 clones had sequences\nidentical to that of EmAgB8/1 cloned from the cDNA library,\nindicating that EmAgB8/1 is predominantly transcribed in the\nlarval stage of E. multilocularis.\n\nAlthough the EmAgB8/1 antigen described here was derived\nfrom an E. multilocularis isolate from Hokkaido, Japan, the\ncoding region for the mature form was found to show 100%\nhomology with that of EmAgB8/1 from E. multilocularis iso-\nlates from Europe (4). This observation suggests that EmAgB8/1\nis conserved among geographically different isolates of E. mul-\ntilocularis.\n\nHomology analysis revealed that EmAgB8/1 is 92.6% ho-\nmologous to EgAgB8/1 at the amino acid level. This may\nexplain the high level of cross-reactivity of the smallest subunit\nof AgB in E. granulosus with sera from AE patients, as re-\nported in several serological studies (9, 15, 32). The results of\nour serological tests with rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1 also\nrevealed that more than 80% of serum samples from patients\n\nFIG. 3. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1.\nApproximately 1 �g of each sample were separated on a 4 to 20%\npolyacrylamide gradient gel and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue.\nLane 1, prestained protein markers (Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.); lane\n2, purified rEmAgB8/1; lane 3, purified rEgAgB8/1.\n\nVOL. 42, 2004 EVALUATION OF E. MULTILOCULARIS ANTIGEN B 1085\n\n\n\nwith CE and about 40% of serum samples from patients with\nAE exhibited positive reactions with both antigens. Even\nthough rEmAgB8/1 was isolated from E. multilocularis, it\nshowed more reactivity with serum samples from CE patients\nthan from those from AE patients (Table 1; Fig. 4 and 5).\nFurthermore, it has been reported that a short region (EVK\nYFFER, residues 17 to 24) of the NH2-terminal region of the\nEgAgB8/1 mature protein is a major immunodominant region\nof the molecule; in particular, residues Glu17, Lys19, Tyr20, Glu23,\nand Arg24 were considered the most important (6). We have\nfound that these residues are also conserved in EmAgB8/1\n(Fig. 2), suggesting that EmAgB8/1 has an immunoreactive\nregion very similar to that of EgAgB8/1 and is similarly recog-\nnized by immunoglobulin G antibodies in serum samples from\nCE and AE patients.\n\nIn a serological study performed in order to evaluate the\nspecificity of the recombinant antigen, EmAgB8/1 did not show\ncross-reactivity with sera from patients with neurocysticercosis\nor other helminth infections (data not shown). A T. solium\nlow-molecular-weight antigen (TsolAg1V1) is highly reactive\nwith homologous sera from patients with neurocysticercosis\nbut is not cross-reactive with heterologous sera from patients\nwith CE and AE (29), although sera from patients with these\ndiseases were highly cross-reactive when native antigens were\nused. Antigens from both E. multilocularis and T. solium be-\nlong to a hydrophobic ligand binding protein family (27), but\nthey have only 20% homology to each other at the amino acid\nlevel. The lack of cross-reactivity in serological tests reflects the\nlow level of amino acid homology between the two antigens\n(Fig. 2).\n\nAlthough sera from all 45 AE patients examined in this\nstudy had antibodies against Em18, a specific serological mark-\ner for AE (14), only about 40% of these serum samples showed\n\nantibody responses against rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1. Thus,\nthe humoral responses against AgB in patients with AE appear\nto be variable, depending on host-parasite interactions during\nthe infection. The limitations to the sensitivity of the AgB8/1\n\nFIG. 4. Comparison of antigenicities of rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1 by WB. Representative data are shown.

The arrows show the locations\nof the recombinant antigens that reacted with serum samples.\n\nFIG. 5. Comparison of antigenicities of rEmAgB8/1 and rEgAgB8/1\nby ELISA. The reactivity of rEmAgB8/1 or rEgAgB8/1 was assessed by\nusing serum samples from 50 and 45 patients with CE (F) and AE (E),\nrespectively. The broken lines indicate the cutoff values for rEmAgB8/1\n(A405 � 0.120) and rEgAgB8/1 (A405 � 0.170), respectively. The cutoff\nvalues were set at four times the optical density for the negative pooled\nserum sample.\n\n1086 MAMUTI ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\nrecombinant antigens for serodiagnosis found here were ap-\nparent when sera that were predominantly obtained from pa-\ntients after they had been surgically or clinically confirmed as\nhaving CE or AE were used. The diagnostic value of these\nantigens would be most effectively determined with serum sam-\nples from patients prior to the commencement of treatment\nand samples with a spectrum of serological reactivities in other\ndiagnostic tests for echinococcosis. In patients with AE, the\nalveolar-like cysts of E. multilocularis usually contain only a\nminute volume of cyst fluid; however, some AE patients, es-\npecially patients with advanced cases, have cysts with consid-\nerable amounts of cyst fluid. We have no critical data on the\ncorrelation of the antibody response to AgB and the threshold\nvolume of cyst fluid. The difference in the antibody response\nagainst AgB in AE patients might be due not only to the size\nand the stage of development of the parasite but also to the\ngenetic background of the host. According to our present\nknowledge, the mechanisms of the host-parasite interaction\nunderlying such a distinctive humoral response against AgB in\npatients with AE are still unclear.\n\nIn conclusion, EmAgB8/1 presents antigenicity comparable\nto that of EgAgB8/1 for the detection of immunoglobulin G\nantibodies in sera from patients with echinococcosis, but the\nsensitivity of the antigen for the detection of antibodies in the\nsera of patients with AE was not increased. Hence, the recom-\nbinant AgB8/1 antigens can be used for the specific serodiag-\nnosis of hydatidosis, although these antigens are not able to\ndifferentiate CE from AE and the sensitivities of the antigens\nfor the detection of AE alone is poor. Further work is being\nperformed to investigate the host-parasite interactions during\nthe humoral response against EmAgB8/1 in seropositive and\nseronegative AE patients.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was supported in part by grants-in-aid from the Japan\nSociety for Promotion of Science (grants 12557024 and 14256001), a\ngrant from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (grant 1 R01\nTW01565-01; principal investigator, P.
