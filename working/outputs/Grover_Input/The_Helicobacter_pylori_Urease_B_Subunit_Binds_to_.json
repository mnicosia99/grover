Reyes1,4*\nDepartments of Pediatrics,1 Internal Medicine,2 and Microbiology and Immunology,4 University of Texas Medical Branch,\n\nGalveston, Texas 77555, and Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 770303\n\nReceived 3 August 2005/Returned for modification 1 October 2005/Accepted 10 November 2005\n\nThe pathogenesis associated with Helicobacter pylori infection is the result of both bacterial factors and the\nhost response. We have previously shown that H. pylori binds to CD74 on gastric epithelial cells. In this study,\nwe sought to identify the bacterial protein responsible for this interaction. H. pylori urease from a pool of\nbacterial surface proteins was found to coprecipitate with CD74. To determine how urease binds to CD74, we\nused recombinant urease A and B subunits. Recombinant urease B was found to bind directly to CD74 in\nimmunoprecipitation and flow cytometry studies. By utilizing both recombinant urease subunits and urease B\nknockout bacteria, the urease B-CD74 interaction was shown to induce NF-�B activation and interleukin-8\n(IL-8) production. This response was decreased by blocking CD74 with monoclonal antibodies. Further\nconfirmation of the interaction of urease B with CD74 was obtained using a fibroblast cell line transfected with\nCD74 that also responded with NF-�B activation and IL-8 production. The binding of the H. pylori urease B\nsubunit to CD74 expressed on gastric epithelial cells presents a novel insight into a previously unrecognized\nH. pylori interaction that may contribute to the proinflammatory immune response seen during infection.\n\nHelicobacter pylori is one of the most widespread human\npathogens. Over 50% of the world’s population are infected,\nwith infection rates as high as 90% in developing countries.\nThis pathogen is a major cause of chronic gastritis, gastric and\nduodenal ulcers, and gastric carcinomas (9, 24). Although in-\nfection of the gastric epithelium with H. pylori elicits a marked\ninflammatory responses and apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells\n(17, 25), the events that promote these responses are not\nclearly defined. H. pylori resides in the lumen of the gastric\nmucosa, in close association with gastric epithelial cells during\ninfection (20, 43). Clearly, bacterial adhesion and colonization\nof the gastric mucosa are key events in pathogenesis (45).\n\nAn essential factor in H. pylori colonization of the gastric\nmucosa, which is also considered a major virulence factor, is\nurease (11, 12). Urease is perhaps the most abundant protein\nmade by H. pylori, comprising �10% of the total bacterial\nprotein (10, 14). It hydrolyzes urea to generate ammonia and\nCO2, which aid in neutralizing hydrochloric acid and allow H.\npylori to colonize the gastric mucosa. Urease-deficient H. pylori\nfailed to colonize the gastric mucosa in multiple studies with\nmice and gnotobiotic piglets (49). While much urease is found\nin the cytoplasm of the bacteria (42), it has also been shown to\nbe present in association with the outer membrane (8, 41).\nAlthough the presence of surface-associated urease has been\ndebated, a plethora of studies have provided evidence that it\nexists on the bacterial surface or is released by the bacteria. A\nrecent study showed the presence of urease in sarcosine-insol-\nuble outer membrane fractions of H. pylori (1), while others\n\nsuggested that autolysis is responsible for surface urease (10,\n30, 39). Some have also suggested that urease is secreted or\nreleased (18, 50). There is also an intriguing suggestion that\nurease binds to lipopolysaccharide on the bacterial surface\n(22).\n\nIn addition to the enzymatic role in hydrolyzing urease to\nammonia, urease has been suggested to play a role in the\npathogenesis of gastritis and peptic ulceration (34, 44). It was\nshown to activate monocytes and to stimulate them to produce\ninflammatory cytokines (19). We have previously shown that\nurease binds to class II major histocompatibility complex\n(MHC) and induces apoptosis of gastric epithelial cells (15).\nEvidence for a role of urease in contributing to the local\nresponse was obtained when Mongolian gerbils treated with\nurease inhibitors showed markedly less gastritis when infected\nby H. pylori than untreated gerbils (37).\n\nAs urease is known to interact with class II MHC, this study\nexamined the interaction with the class II MHC-associated\ninvariant chain, or CD74. CD74 is best known for its role in\nregulating the intracellular transport and functions of class II\nMHC in antigen-presenting cells (13, 40), and a variety of\nother functions for this molecule have recently been discov-\nered. Cell surface expression of CD74 on a variety of cell types\nhas been described (38, 51). There is also significant expression\non gastric epithelial cell surfaces, which is upregulated during\ninflammation (6). CD74 has a long cytoplasmic tail that has\nbeen implicated in signaling events. Several studies have shown\nthat signaling induced through CD74 plays a role in B-cell\nmaturation (31, 32) that acts though NF-�B activation. We\nrecently showed that H. pylori binding to CD74 stimulates the\nNF-�B signaling cascade that leads to interleukin-8 (IL-8) pro-\nduction (7). In another signaling role, macrophage migration\n\n* Corresponding author.

We demonstrate that urease B binds to CD74\nexpressed on gastric epithelial cell surfaces, while the urease A\nsubunit, on the other hand, appears to bind to class II MHC.\nBy utilizing both recombinant urease subunits and urease B\nknockout bacteria, we have demonstrated that urease B up-\nregulates IL-8 production upon binding to CD74.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCell lines. N87 human gastric carcinoma epithelial cells and Hs738.st/int hu-\nman fetal gastric epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture\nCollection (Manassas, VA). P3HR1 B cells expressing CD74, but not class II\nMHC (47), were obtained from Robert E. Humphreys (Antigen Express,\nWorcester, MA). Cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10%\nfetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and antibiotics. M1 human fibroblast cells\ntransfected with the RSV.2-p33 isoform of CD74 (M1-p33) or the RSV.2 vector\nalone (28) were obtained from Eric Long (National Institutes of Health, Rock-\nville, MD) and cultured in selective Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with\n10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin.\n\nBacterial cultures. H. pylori strains 43504 and 51B, which were clinical strains\nisolated from Japanese patients with simple gastritis, were used in this study.\nIsogenic ureB mutants were constructed using strains 43504 and 51B as parental\nstrains. For isogenic ureB mutants, portions of the genes were amplified by PCR\nand the amplified fragment was inserted into the EcoRV site of pBluescript\nSK(�)(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the BamHI site deleted in advance. A\nkanamycin resistance gene cassette (a gift from Rainer Haas, Max von Petten-\nkofer Institut, Munich, Germany) was inserted into the BamHI site of insert\nDNA for the ureB gene. The obtained plasmids (1 to 2 �g) were used for\ninactivation of chromosomal genes by natural transformation as previously de-\nscribed (21). Inactivation of the genes was confirmed by PCR amplification\nfollowed by Southern blot hybridization. All strains were grown on blood agar\nplates (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) at 37°C under microaerophilic condi-\ntions as previously described (2). Bacteria were transferred after 48 h into\nbrucella broth containing 10% fetal bovine serum and left for an additional 24 h.\nAfter centrifugation at 2,500 � g for 10 min, bacteria were resuspended in sterile\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The number of bacteria per milliliter was\ndetermined by measuring the absorbance (at 530 nm) with a spectrophotometer\n(DU-65; Becton Dickinson Instruments, Inc., Fullerton, CA) and comparing the\nvalue to a standard curve generated by quantifying viable organisms from ali-\nquots of bacteria at various concentrations that were also assessed by absor-\nbance.\n\nBiotinylation of bacteria and urease. Bacterial strains, urease (Oravax, Cam-\nbridge, MA), and urease A and B subunits (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA)\nwere biotinylated using the Fluoreporter cell surface biotinylation kit (F-20560;\nMolecular Probes, Eugene, OR). According to the manufacturer, this reagent is\ncell membrane-impermeative biotin-XX sulfosuccinimidyl ester, an amine-reac-\ntive compound that is designed to label surface proteins of live cells. Bacteria and\nsubunits were then biotinylated according to the manufacturer’s instructions. H.\npylori strains were lysed by sonication, and bacterial lysates were dialyzed over-\nnight in PBS.\n\nUrease binding of immunoprecipitated CD74. P3HR1 cells (2 � 107) were\nlysed with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 10% NP-40, 10%\nNa-deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and\nwere centrifuged at 10,000 � g for 10 min to remove nuclei. Biotinylated bacte-\nrial surface proteins were added to cell lysates and rotated for 2 h at 4°C. The\nlysate mixture was precleared with 10 �l of protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 2 hours at 4°C. CD74 was immunoprecipi-\ntated using protein A/G beads that were preincubated with BU-45 monoclonal\nantibody for 2 hours at room temperature. After washing, beads were incubated\nwith the lysate mixture of P3HR-1 cells and biotinylated bacterial surface pro-\nteins or urease subunits for 2 h at 4°C. Beads were then washed four times, and\nthe bound CD74 was eluted with 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 2.7) and neutralized\nimmediately. The bound material was eluted, and samples were run on sodium\ndodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellu-\nlose membrane, and incubated with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (Santa\n\nCruz Biotechnology) to detect precipitated H. pylori proteins or urease subunits\nby Western blot analysis.\n\nAttachment assays. Ten micrograms of biotinylated urease A or B subunits\nwas incubated with 2 � 105 gastric epithelial cells or fibroblast cells for 1 h at\nroom temperature. Some samples were incubated with the anti-CD74 monoclo-\nnal antibody MB-741 (Becton Dickinson) for 1 h prior to urease exposure or with\nan isotype control. After being washed with PBS, samples were incubated with 1\n�l of strepavidin-phycoerythrin (PE) (Becton Dickinson) for 30 min on ice.\nSamples incubated with only strepavidin-PE were used as negative controls.\nSamples were washed two more times and analyzed by flow cytometry on a\nFACScan cytometer (Becton Dickinson). H. pylori was stained with the red\nfluorochrome PKH26 (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions,\nwashed multiple times with RPMI 1640, and resuspended in RPMI. Bacteria\nwere washed and added to pelleted cells treated with medium or gamma inter-\nferon and with blocking or control antibodies where indicated. The cultures were\ntreated with a 30:1 ratio of bacteria to cells and incubated for 90 min at 37°C.\nNegative control samples consisted of cells treated with the wash from stained H.\npylori to assess background staining of cells.\n\nI�B� degradation. Cells grown in 24-well plates were incubated overnight with\nserum-free medium and stimulated with H. pylori for specified times. Cells were\nremoved from plates by scraping and lysed as described for similar studies (37).\nLysates were centrifuged at 14,000 � g for 10 min at 4°C. The resulting samples\nwere run on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate gels for electrophoresis and transferred\nto nitrocellulose membranes for Western blotting. The membranes were treated\n\nFIG. 1.

Gastric epithelial cells or fibroblast transfectants\nwere incubated for 24 h with H. pylori (30:1 bacteria/cell ratio). The fibroblast\ncontrol cells, M1, and the CD74-transfected cells, M1-p33, were incubated with\nserum-free medium for 16 h before bacterial exposure because of high basal IL-8\nproduction. Some samples were incubated with anti-CD74 antibodies or isotype\ncontrol antibodies before exposure to H. pylori. Supernatants were harvested at\n24 h and analyzed using IL-8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)\n(Becton Dickinson) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to compare\nIL-8 secretion from gamma interferon-treated and untreated cells exposed to H.\npylori, CD74 cross-linking, or blocking anti-CD74 antibodies.\n\nReal-time PCR Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy RNA\nisolation kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-\ntions. The sample concentration was measured by spectrophotometry at 260 nm,\nand RNA quality was determined on a 1% agarose gel. real-time reverse tran-\nscription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed according the Applied Biosystems two-\nstep real-time RT-PCR protocol (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). All\nreagents were purchased from Applied Biosystems. The RT reaction mixture\ninclude random 2.5 �M hexamers, 500 �M deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 0.4\nU/�l of the RNase inhibitors, 5.5 mM MgCl2, MultiScribe reverse transcriptase\n(3.125 U/�l) and its buffer, and 1 �g of cellular RNA. The RT mix was up to final\nvolume of the 50 �l using RNase- and DNase-free H2O (Sigma). The RT step\nwas performed using the GeneAmp PCR system 9700 thermocycler (Perkin-\nElmer Applied Biosystems) according to the following protocol: 10 min at 25°C,\n60 min at 37°C, and 5 min at 95°C. The cDNA samples obtained were stored at\n�20°C (if necessary) and used for the PCR step. The PCR mix was prepared\nusing TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The Assays-on-\nDemand gene expression assay mix (Applied Biosystems) for human 18S rRNA,\nIL-8, or CD74 (a 20� mix of unlabeled PCR primers and TaqMan MGB probe,\n6-carboxyfluorescein dye labeled) and 2 �l of cDNA were added to the PCR mix.\nThe reaction was carried out in a 20-�l final volume using the GeneAmp 5700\nsequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) according to the following\nprotocol: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C (1 cycle), and 15 s 95°C and 1 min at 60°C\n(40 cycles). The negative controls were included in the RT real-time two-step\nreaction. The endpoint used in real-time PCR quantification, CT, is defined as\nthe PCR cycle number that crosses the signal threshold. CT values range from 0\nto 40, with the latter number assumed to represent no product formation.\nQuantification of cytokine gene expression was performed using the comparative\nCT method (Sequence Detector user bulletin 2; Applied Biosystems) and re-\nported as the fold difference relative to the human 18S rRNA housekeeping\ngene. In order to calculate the fold change (increase or decrease), the CT value\nfor 18S rRNA was subtracted from CT value for the target cytokine gene to yield\nthe �CT. The change in the expression of the normalized target gene as a result\nof experimental conditions was expressed as 2���CT, where ��CT \t �CT for\nexperimental samples � �CT for biological control.\n\nCD74 expression.

Since we have previ-\nously shown that H. pylori attaches to CD74 and that CD74\nplays a role in the inflammatory response seen in response to\nH. pylori (7), we sought to determine the bacterial adhesin\nresponsible for this interaction. To this end, H. pylori surface\nproteins were biotinylated before bacterial lysis by sonication.\nBacterial lysates were mixed with lysates of P3HR1 cells, a\nB-cell line that was used to examine the interactions with CD74\nin the absence of class II MHC. This was crucial since class II\nMHC can bind H. pylori proteins (15). CD74 was immunopre-\ncipitated along with bound biotinylated H. pylori surface pro-\nteins. Western blot analysis using avidin-HRP revealed a\nstrong band at 68 kDa and a weak band at 27 kDa, similar to\nthe case for the urease control, as seen in Fig. 1A. Two addi-\n\ntional bands at high molecular weights were also coprecipi-\ntated. The presence of biotinylated urease coprecipitating with\nCD74 suggests that urease is on the surface of H. pylori, since\nonly surface proteins were biotinylated. In a similar experi-\nment, recombinant urease, as well as urease A and urease B\nsubunits, was biotinylated and mixed with P3HR1 cell lysates.\nFigure 1B illustrates that the recombinant urease B subunit\ncoprecipitated with CD74. A band for urease A is present only\nwhen intact urease is used and not when the subunit is used\nalone, suggesting that it does not bind independently to CD74.\n\nThe H. pylori urease B subunit binds to cell surface-ex-\npressed CD74. Biotinylated recombinant urease A and B sub-\nunits were utilized in order to examine their attachment to\nCD74 on the surface of gastric epithelial cells or CD74-trans-\nfected fibroblast cells. The gastric cell lines N87 and HS738\nand the CD74-transfected fibroblast cell line M1-p33 were\nincubated with subunits and stained with strepavidin-PE for\nflow cytometric analysis. Some samples were preincubated with\nanti-CD74, anti-class II MHC, or isotype control antibodies for\n1 hour prior to urease subunit exposure for blocking purposes.\nFigure 2A shows that urease B attached to HS-738, and the\nattachment was dramatically decreased upon pretreatment\nwith anti-CD74 antibodies, while very little decrease was seen\nafter pretreatment with anti-class II MHC antibodies (Fig. 2B).\nCD74 blocking resulted in up to a 70% decrease in attachment\nto gastric epithelial cells and CD74-transfected fibroblasts\ncompared to cells treated with isotype control. Urease A at-\ntachment to gastric epithelial cells was decreased more than\n50% upon blocking class II MHC with monoclonal antibodies.\nAdditionally, when CD74-transfected fibroblast cells were ex-\namined, urease A attachment was much lower than urease B\nattachment, supporting the Western blot results where recom-\nbinant urease A alone did not coprecipitate with CD74. Nei-\nther subunit attached to the M1 parent fibroblast cell line,\nwhich did not express CD74 or class II MHC (not shown).\n\nIn order to further examine urease B attachment to CD74,\nthe attachment of H. pylori strains 43504 and 43504 and urease\nB knockouts to three cell lines was examined by flow cytom-\netry. Bacteria were stained with PKH26 PE dye and incubated\nwith gastric cells (N87 and HS738) or M1-p33 fibroblast cells\nfor 90 min at 37°C. The urease B-deficient 51B strain bound to\nN87 and HS-738 cells 27% and 30% less then the wild type,\nrespectively, and the urease B-deficient 43504 strain bound\n28% and 30% less than the wild type (Fig. 2C and D). The\ndecreased attachment was significant, with P values of �0.05.\nThe wild-type bacteria attached to the M1-p33 fibroblasts,\nwhile the urease B-deficient bacteria exhibited very little at-\ntachment to these cells. There was very little attachment of H.\npylori strains to the M1 parent cell line in the absence of CD74\n(not shown). Examination of the attachment of recombinant\nurease B subunit or urease B knockout H. pylori strains to\ngastric epithelial cells clearly demonstrates that urease can be\nused as an adhesin by H. pylori in binding to CD74.\n\nUrease B triggers I�B� degradation. We have previously\nshown that H. pylori binding to CD74 and cross-linking CD74\nresulted in I�B� degradation leading to NF-�B activation (7).\nIn this study, we sought to determine if urease binding to CD74\nis involved in these responses. Recombinant urease B subunit\nwas incubated with gastric epithelial cells for 20-min intervals\nto observe I�B� degradation. As seen in Fig. 3A, incubation of\n\nFIG. 3. Urease engagement of CD74 on gastric epithelial cells\ncauses I�B� degradation. (A) Urease B incubation with N87 cells\nresulted in I�B� degradation at 40 min shown in a representative\nresult with a tubulin-� loading control. (B) Preincubation of cells with\nanti-CD74 antibodies blocked I�B� degradation as shown in a repre-\nsentative result with a tubulin-� control. (C) Incubation of N87 cells\nwith H. pylori strain 43504 led to I�B� degradation at 40 min as shown\nin a representative result with N87 cells with a tubulin-� control.\n(D) Incubation of cells with an H. pylori 43504 urease knockout de-\ncreased I�B� degradation.\n\nVOL. 74, 2006 H. PYLORI UREASE B BINDS TO CD74 1151\n\n\n\nrecombinant urease B alone with N87 cells resulted in I�B�\ndegradation at 40 and 60 min, and its expression was restored\nat 80 min. The tubulin control was utilized in order to dem-\nonstrate that equal protein concentrations were loaded into\neach well. When cells were preincubated with anti-CD74 an-\ntibodies, very little I�B� degradation was seen in response to\nurease B exposure (Fig. 3B). Similarly, when wild-type H. pylori\nwas incubated with N87 cells, I�B� degradation was visible at\n40 and 60 min (Fig. 3C), but when the urease B knockout\nbacteria were used, the I�B� bands are more visible (Fig. 3D).\nInterestingly, the kinetics of I�B� degradation induced by ure-\nase B alone are comparable to those induced by H. pylori (Fig.\n3A and C). These results are consistent with our previous data\nshowing a decrease in I�B� degradation in cells exposed to H.\npylori upon blocking of CD74 (7).\n\nUrease B triggers IL-8 production by binding to CD74. Since\nH. pylori binding to CD74 results in IL-8 production, we sought\nto determine whether urease B binding to CD74 alone leads to\nIL-8 production. N87, HS-738, and M1-p33 fibroblast cells\nwere exposed to recombinant urease A or urease B subunits to\nassess IL-8 responses. IL-8 ELISAs were used to quantify the\namounts of IL-8 produced by the various cells. As shown in\nFig. 4A and B, recombinant urease B alone led to cell re-\nsponses up to three times higher than basal levels of IL-8 with\nall three cell lines examined at 24 h. The urease A subunit led\nto very small increases in IL-8 production. Preincubating cells\nwith anti-CD74 antibodies decreased IL-8 production in re-\nsponse to urease B to levels similar to those after treatment\n\nwith an isotype control with M1-p33 cells and drastically de-\ncreased levels with gastric epithelial cells, although these were\nstill slightly above control levels. Anti-class II MHC antibodies\nhad little effect on IL-8 levels induced by the urease B subunit.\nCells were also incubated with H. pylori strains 51B and 43504\nand their urease B knockout counterparts to assess their ability\nto stimulate IL-8 production by gastric epithelial cells and\nM1-p33 CD74-transfected fibroblast cells. Figure 4C and D\nshow that significantly less (P � 0.05) IL-8 (approximately 35%\ndecreased production) is produced by the cells exposed to\nurease B knockout strains than by those exposed to wild-type\nbacteria. This response is especially apparent with M1-p33\ncells, where CD74 appears to be the principal receptor for H.\npylori.\n\nIn order to determine whether the observed IL-8 response\nby these cells to urease B involved increased transcript expres-\nsion, real-time PCR was utilized to quantitate mRNA levels.\nAs shown in Fig. 5A, incubation with recombinant urease B led\nto fourfold, ninefold, and fivefold increases in IL-8 mRNA for\nN87, HS738, and M1-p33, respectively. Blocking with anti-\nCD74 antibodies led to at least 50% reduced mRNA levels\ncompared to those in cells treated with an isotype control.\nUrease A incubation resulted in very little increase in IL-8\nmRNA. Similarly, H. pylori incubation led to even larger in-\ncreases in IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 5B), while urease B knockout\nstrains still induced IL-8 mRNA but at reduced levels com-\npared to wild-type bacteria.\n\nFIG. 4. Urease B engagement of CD74 on multiple cell types induces IL-8 production as measured by ELISA. Urease subunit incubation with\nN87 cells resulted in very little increase in IL-8 production with urease A subunit but a significant increase with urease B subunit at 24 h, which\nwas decreased upon blocking CD74 with monoclonal antibodies but not when blocking class II MHC with (A) N87 and M1-p33 cells and (B) HS738\ncells. H. pylori strains 51B and 43504 induced IL-8 production, while urease B knockouts induced significantly less IL-8 with (C) N87 and M1-p33\ncells and (D) HS738 cells. The means and standard errors of the means are shown as the results of duplicates in four experiments (n \t 8).\n\n1152 BESWICK ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nUrease B increases CD74 surface expression on gastric\ncells. We have previously shown that CD74 surface expression\nis upregulated by IL-8 production and H. pylori infection (6). In\norder to investigate whether urease B plays a role in this\nincreased CD74 expression, surface expression was measured\nby flow cytometry and the corresponding mRNA levels were\nassessed by real-time PCR. Figure 6A demonstrates that ure-\nase B incubation led to a notable increase in CD74 surface\nexpression, while urease A incubation led to very little change\nin expression. Gastric epithelial cells exposed to H. pylori also\nresulted in an upregulation of CD74 expression, while the\nurease B knockout strain led to lower expression levels than\nthe wild type (Fig. 6B). Similar results were observed with\nmRNA levels, where urease B induced increases in CD74\n\nmRNA of threefold and fivefold for N87 and HS738, respec-\ntively, while H. pylori induced a fivefold increase for N87 and a\nsevenfold increased for HS738. The urease B knockout strain\nled to only a two- to threefold increase for both cell lines.\n\nFIG. 5. Urease B engagement of CD74 on multiple cell types leads\nto increased IL-8 mRNA production as measured by real-time PCR.\n(A) Urease subunit incubation with N87 cells resulted in very little\nincrease in IL-8 mRNA with urease A subunit but significant increases\nwith urease B subunit at 24 h, which was decreased upon blocking\nCD74 with monoclonal antibodies with N87, M1-p33, and HS738 cells.\n(B) H. pylori strains 51B and 43504 increased IL-8 mRNA, while\nurease B knockouts induced significantly less IL-8 mRNA, in N87,\nM1-p33, and HS738 cells. The means and standard errors of the means\nare shown as the results of duplicates in four experiments (n \t 8).\n\nFIG. 6. CD74 expression by gastric epithelial cell lines exposed to\nurease B is increased. Gastric epithelial cells stained for CD74 after\nexposure to urease subunits, H. pylori strain 43504, and a urease B\nknockout showed increased expression with urease B but very little\nincrease with urease A compared to the solid-peak isotype control in\na sample histogram with HS-738 cells (A), showed increased expres-\nsion with H. pylori strain 43504 but less expression with the urease B\nknockout (B), and showed increased expression by real-time PCR, with\nCD74 RNA levels normalized to 18S RNA and relative to untreated\ncontrols, after exposure to urease subunits or H. pylori strains (C). The\nmeans and standard errors of the means are shown as the results of\nduplicates in four experiments (n \t 8) in panel C.\n\nVOL. 74, 2006 H. PYLORI UREASE B BINDS TO CD74 1153\n\n\n\nBecause urease B and H. pylori bind to CD74, this upregulation\nmay be important to enhance the binding of bacteria and in\npromoting the associated pathogenesis.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAs one of the major virulence factors of H. pylori, urease has\nbeen utilized in clinical aspects, from detection of infection to\nvaccine development studies. In animal models, it has been\nshown to be required for colonization of the gastric mucosa\n(11, 12, 49) and has been demonstrated as a successful vaccine\n(16, 46). H. pylori is known to activate professional antigen-\npresenting cells and play an important role in inflammatory\nresponses elicited by these cells during H. pylori infection, and\nurease alone has been shown to activate these cells (18, 19, 29).\nStudies with gastric epithelial cells have suggested that urease\nis toxic to them (44) and leads to increased cell death (15).\nUrease has also been shown to induce proinflammatory re-\nsponses from gastric epithelial cells, which may lead to the\npathogenesis seen in gastritis and peptic ulcers (35, 48).\nClearly, urease plays an important role in the inflammatory\nresponse triggered by H. pylori and in the associated tissue\ndamage.\n\nGastric epithelial cells have been suggested to be nonpro-\nfessional antigen-presenting cells and express high levels of\nclass II MHC and CD74 on the cell surface (3, 7). Although\nCD74 is best known for its role in regulating the intracellular\nbiology of class II MHC molecules, CD74 has recently been\nsuggested to have functions independent of class II MHC. One\nrecently discovered function for CD74 is its role as a receptor\nfor macrophage migration Inhibitory factor. MIF binding to\nCD74 leads to signaling events such as extracelluar signal reg-\nulated kinase activation, cell proliferation, and prostaglandin\nE2 production (27, 33). Other studies have indicated that\nCD74 is required for signaling that induces B-cell maturation\n(31, 33). In B cells, MIF binding to CD74 results in activation\nof transcription factors, including NF-�B, which is an impor-\ntant control in immune and inflammatory responses (26). The\nvariety of functions and signaling leading to immune responses\nthat have recently implicated CD74 in initiating signaling pro-\ncesses suggests that there is much more to be revealed about\nthe functions of this molecule.\n\nWe have previously shown that H. pylori utilizes gastric ep-\nithelial cell surface-expressed CD74 as a point of attachment\n(7). We have also shown that urease binds to class II MHC\n(15). In this study, we expanded upon these findings to discover\nthat urease B binds to CD74, while urease A appears to have\na higher affinity for class II MHC. Recent studies have shown\nurease to be among surface proteins in the sarcosine-insoluble\nouter membrane fraction of H. pylori (1). We further demon-\nstrated that urease appears to be among the H. pylori surface\nproteins because it was biotinylated before live bacterial lysis\nby sonication. Many studies have attributed surface urease to\nbacterial autolysis (30, 39), so it is probable that the urease in\nour biotinylated outer membrane proteins can be attributed to\nautolysis as well. The importance of surface-associated urease\nwas demonstrated in one study where H. pylori did not survive\nin acidic conditions in the absence of surface-associated urease\n(23). Studies by Icatlo et al. have shown that urease binds\nsulfated polysaccharides (22), and we have shown that class II\n\nMHC-associated CD74 has an important chondroitin sulfate-\nmodified isoform (4) that may play a role in urease binding and\nshould be further investigated.\n\nSimilar to professional antigen-presenting cells, gastric epi-\nthelial cells respond to H. pylori with comparable cytokine\nprofiles (5, 48). H. pylori urease B similarly elicits a Th1 re-\nsponse from antigen-presenting cells (19, 35). In this study, we\nhave shown that urease B represents a ligand for CD74, which\nleads NF-�B activation and IL-8 production. N87 cells, HS-738\ncells, and M1-p33 CD74-transfected fibroblast cells, which ex-\nhibit very little response when transfected with the vector\nalone, all responded in the same way to urease treatment, and\nthat response was negated by blocking CD74 with specific\nantibodies. In contrast, recombinant urease A did not bind well\nto M1-p33 CD74-tranfected fibroblasts and did not stimulate\nthem to produce IL-8. Together, these observations suggest\nthat urease A probably attaches to class II MHC and could\nthen be in involved in the induction of apoptosis, as we dem-\nonstrated in a previous study (15).\n\nThe interaction of urease B with CD74 and the elevated\nresponses were further examined using urease B-deficient\nstrains compared to parental strains. Decreases were seen in\nattachment and IL-8 responses with the urease B mutants\ncompared to the wild-type strains. Because there are multiple\nreceptors for H. pylori and there are multiple virulence factors\nthat induce IL-8 production (36), attachment and induction of\nIL-8 were still observed with the urease B-deficient bacteria;\nhowever, significant decreases in both were observed. These\nstudies suggest that urease plays a role specifically in the at-\ntachment of and proinflammatory immune response initiated\nby H. pylori. While the coprecipitation studies showed that two\nhigh-molecular-weight proteins, in addition to the urease sub-\nunits, were coprecipitated by CD74, their identities are at\npresent unknown. However, they are present in lower quanti-\nties than urease subunits. They could be proteins that bind\ndirectly to CD74 or that coassociate with H. pylori urease.\n\nUrease encompasses an even broader role than previously\ntheorized in the pathogenesis associated with infection of H.\npylori and should not be overlooked. Although urease is known\nfor its enzymatic activity, the dual function as an adhesion and\nimmunogen should not be surprising since bacteria contain\ngenes involved in a wide range of physiological processes, per-\nhaps as an mechanism for adaptation to an ample array of\ngrowth conditions.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants\nDK50669 and DK56338.
