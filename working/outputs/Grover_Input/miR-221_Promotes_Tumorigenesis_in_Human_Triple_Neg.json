Mehta, Sangita M. Baxi, Min-Jean Yin*\n\nOncology Research, Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, San Diego, California, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients with triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) typically have a poor prognosis. TNBCs are characterized by their\nresistance to apoptosis, aggressive cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, and currently lack molecular markers and\neffective targeted therapy. Recently, miR-221/miR-222 have been shown to regulate ERa expression and ERa-mediated\nsignaling in luminal breast cancer cells, and also to promote EMT in TNBCs. In this study, we characterized the role of miR-\n221 in a panel of TNBCs as compared to other breast cancer types. miR-221 knockdown not only blocked cell cycle\nprogression, induced cell apoptosis, and inhibited cell proliferation in-vitro but it also inhibited in-vivo tumor growth by\ntargeting p27kip1. Furthermore, miR-221 knockdown inhibited cell migration and invasion by altering E-cadherin expression,\nand its regulatory transcription factors Snail and Slug in human TNBC cell lines. Therefore, miR-221 functions as an\noncogene and is essential in regulating tumorigenesis in TNBCs both in vitro as well as in vivo.\n\nCitation: Nassirpour R, Mehta PP, Baxi SM, Yin M-J (2013) miR-221 Promotes Tumorigenesis in Human Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.

Because\n\nmiRNAs usually bind to their targets with incomplete comple-\n\nmentarity, a single miRNA can potentially regulate the translation\n\nof multiple target genes involved in various cellular processes [2,3].\n\nIn fact, miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of a variety\n\nof biological functions, including cellular proliferation, differenti-\n\nation, and apoptosis [4,5]. Growing evidence indicates that\n\nmiRNAs can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes [4],\n\nand miRNA expression profiling analyses have revealed charac-\n\nteristic miRNA signatures in a variety of human cancers [6,7].\n\nFurthermore, miRNAs are frequently located at fragile genomic\n\nregions susceptible to amplification, deletion, or translocation\n\nduring tumor development [8]. Since miRNAs are believed to be\n\npivotal players in tumor development, investigations of differential\n\nexpression of miRNAs and their corresponding targets might\n\nprove to be instrumental for the diagnosis and treatment of various\n\ncancers.\n\nMolecular profiling has allowed us to classify breast cancers\n\nto five subtypes based on their distinctive gene expression\n\nsignatures [9]. The five subtypes are luminal A, luminal B,\n\nHuman Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) positive,\n\nbasal-like, and normal-like breast cancers. Basal-like tumors are\n\ncharacterized by the expression of genes specific for basal\n\nepithelial cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptotic pathways, and\n\naggressive migration and invasion [9–11]. Basal-like breast\n\ncancers (BLBCs) are often stained negative by immunochemistry\n\nfor estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and\n\nHER2 and thus are called triple negative breast cancers\n\n(TNBCs). Although BLBC and TNBC share numerous clinical\n\nand pathological features, they are not identical [12,13]. In the\n\nmajority of cases, however, these two categories share similar\n\nclinical characteristics, prognosis and treatment options and\n\nthus, the term ‘‘TNBC’’ will be used in this study to collectively\n\ndescribe BLBC and TNBC cell lines and patient populations.\n\nClinical studies have shown that TNBCs are the most aggressive\n\nbreast cancer type and TNBC patients are frequently faced with\n\npoor prognosis and high mortality [14,15]. Thus, the de-\n\nvelopment of targeted therapies for TNBCs is urgently and\n\ncritically needed for this patient population.\n\nmiR-221 and miR-222 are encoded in tandem from a gene\n\ncluster located on chromosome X and have been shown to be up-\n\nregulated in a panoply of cancer types. Due to their seed sequence\n\nsimilarity, both miRNAs have been shown to directly target\n\np27\nkip1\n\n, Bmf, PTEN, Mdm2, PUMA, and TRPS1 [16–22]. In\n\nbreast cancer, miR-221/miR-222 have been shown to be involved\n\nin regulation of ERa expression, suppression of ERa-mediated\nsignaling, as well as drug resistance mechanisms [23–27]. More\n\nrecently miR-221/miR-222 have been shown to be over-expressed\n\nin triple-negative primary breast cancers or cell lines [28–30]. In\n\nthis study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of cellular\n\ntransformation regulated by miR-221/222 specifically in a panel\n\nof human TNBC cell lines compared to other breast cancer types\n\nand validated our findings in vivo. We show that miR-221 is an\n\noncogene and modulates cell proliferation and tumor progression\n\nvia targeting p27\nkip1\n\nand EMT transition in TNBCs both in vitro as\n\nwell as in vivo.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62170\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell Culture\nAll cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture\n\nCollection and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s\n\nmedium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)\n\nsupplemented with L-glutamine and grown in a humidified\n\natmosphere of 5% CO2 in air at 37uC.\n\nStable Cell Line Generation\nSystem Bioscience’s miRZip\n\nTM\nanti-sense miRNAs are stably\n\nexpressed RNAi hairpins that inhibit miRNA activity. The\n\nmiRZip shRNAs produce short, single-stranded anti-miRNAs\n\nthat competitively bind their endogenous miRNA target and\n\ninhibit its function.

Total\n\nRNA extracted by mirVana (Life Technologies) was reverse\n\ntranscribed in a reaction mixture containing miR-specific stem-\n\nloop RT primers. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\n\nwas performed in triplicate with reactions containing amplified\n\ncDNA and TaqMan primers in Universal Master Mix without\n\nAmpErase UNG (Applied Biosystems). The qPCR was conducted\n\nat 95uC for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 15\nseconds and 60uC for 60 seconds in 7900 HT Real Time PCR\nsystem (Applied Biosystems) and threshold cycles (CT) were\n\ncalculated using Sequence Detection Software (SDS v2.2.1,\n\nApplied Biosystems). All mRNA quantification data were normal-\n\nized to GAPDH. All miRNA data are expressed relative to\n\na RNU48 small nuclear (sn) RNA TaqMan PCR performed on\n\nthe same samples, unless otherwise specified. Fold expression was\n\ncalculated from the triplicate of CT values following the 2\n2DDCt\n\nmethod.\n\nImmunoblotting\nCells were lysed in buffer composed of 150 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM\n\nMgCl2, 50 mM HEPES, 10% glycerol, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton\n\nX-100, 0.5% NP-40 supplemented with 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM\n\nPMSF, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM b-glycerophosphate, protease inhibitor\ncocktail (Roche), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche) added\n\nprior to use. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA\n\nProtein Assay (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific) per manufac-\n\nturer’s instructions. Protein (30–50 mg) was resolved by SDS-\nPAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were\n\nprobed with primary antibodies to detect proteins of interest. After\n\nincubation with secondary antibodies, membranes were visualized\n\nby chemiluminescence (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific). All\n\nantibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, with\n\nthe exception of GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\n\nCell Proliferation, Apoptosis Assay, Migration, and\nInvasion Assays\nResazurin Fluorescent Assay was used for the proliferation\n\nstudies. Briefly, Cells were seeded at 3000–5,000 cells/100ul/well\n\nin DMEM +10% FBS in a 96 well plate, and incubated overnight\nat 37uC in 5% CO2. Resazurin (Sigma) fluorescent dye was added\n(1:100) to each well. The cells were incubated at 37uC in 5% CO2\nfor 4 hours at which point the plate was read for fluorescence at\n\n530/590 nm on the HTS 7000 plate reader. Cell Signaling\n\nTechnologies PathScanH Apoptosis Multi-Target Sandwich\nELISA Kits were used in the apoptosis assays. Briefly, antibodies\n\nfor cleaved caspase 3 and phosphorylated BAD had been coated\n\nonto microwells. After incubation with the cell lysates, the target\n\nprotein was captured by the coated antibody. Following extensive\n\nwashing, a detection antibody was added to detect the captured\n\ntarget protein. An HRP-linked secondary antibody was then used\n\nto recognize the bound detection antibody. HRP substrate, TMB,\n\nwas added for color development which was measured to quantity\n\nthe level of bound target protein. Cell Biolab’s CytoSelect\nTM\n\nCell\n\nMigration Assay Kit containing polycarbonate membrane inserts\n\n(8 mm pore size) in a 24-well plate was used in our migration\nassays. Migratory cells were able to extend protrusions towards\n\nFBS (used as the chemo-attractant), and pass through the pores of\n\nthe polycarbonate membrane. The non-migratory cells were\n\nremoved from the top of the membrane and the migratory cells\n\nwere stained and quantified. Similarly, Cell Biolabs CytoSelect\nTM\n\nCell Invasion Assay Kit containing basement membrane-coated\n\ninserts were used to assay the invasive properties of the cells. The\n\nupper surface of the insert membrane is coated with a uniform\n\nlayer of dried basement membrane matrix solution. This basement\n\nmembrane layer serves as a barrier to discriminate invasive cells\n\nfrom non-invasive cells. The non-invasive cells were removed from\n\nthe top of the membrane and the invading cells were stained and\n\nquantified.\n\nCell Cycle Analysis\nMDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 parental cells and\n\ncells stably expressing miR-221-ZIP, or scramble miRNA-ZIP\n\nwere cultured to 70–90% confluency and allowed to adhere\n\novernight. Cells were collected, fixed, and permeabilized using the\n\nCell Cycle Phase Determination Kit (Cayman Chemical) following\n\nthe manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were stored at 220uC until\nDNA stained with propidium iodide and read on a BD\n\nFACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was done with\n\nFCS Express (De Novo Software). All experiments were repeated\n\nat least 3 times and representative data set is shown.\n\nAnimal Studies\nSix- to eight-week-old nu/nu athymic female mice were\n\nobtained from Jackson Labs. The mice were maintained in\n\npressurized ventilated caging at the Pfizer La Jolla animal facility.\n\nAll animal studies were done under the ethical approval by Pfizer\n\nInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committees. Tumors were\n\nestablished by injecting 56106 cells suspended 1:1 (v/v) with\nreconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel, BD Biosciences).\n\nTumor dimensions were measured with Vernier calipers, and\n\ntumor volumes were calculated using this formula: p/66(larger\ndiameter)6(smaller diameter)2. Tumor growth inhibition percent-\nage (TGI %) was calculated as 1006(12DT/DC). One way\nANOVA Statistical analysis were performed and noted as ***\n\ndepicting p-value less than or equal to 0.001.\n\nResults\n\nmiR-221 is Specifically Up-regulated in Human TNBC Cell\nLines\nThe expression level of miR-221 and miR-222 were examined\n\nby qRT-PCR in 4 TNBC lines: MDA-MB-231, Hs-578T, BT-20,\n\nand MDA-MB-468; 2 HER2 positive lines: SKBR3 and MDA-\n\nMB-361; and 3 ER positive lines: T47D, ZR75–1, and MCF-7. In\n\ncomparison to the expression level in normal breast tissue (RNA\n\nacquired from Applied Biosystems), miR-221 is up-regulated in all\n\nthe TNBC lines while down-regulated in the non-TNBC lines\n\n(Figure 1A). Surprisingly, although clustered with miR-221, the\n\nexpression level of miR-222 is only up-regulated mildly (1–1.5 fold)\n\nin Hs-578-T and BT-20 (compared to normal breast tissue), but\n\nMDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing anti-miR-221 or scramble miR-ZIP depicting changes in p27 protein level.

These results indicate that although miR-221/\n\nmiR-222 are both down-regulated in non-TNBC cells, miR-221 is\n\nspecifically over-expressed in the TNBC cell lines in comparison to\n\nnormal breast tissue. Therefore, over-expression of miR-221 may\n\nbe important in maintaining the characteristics of triple negative\n\nbreast cancer cells.\n\nmiR-221 Targets p27kip1 to Regulate Cell Cycle\nProgression in TNBCs\np27\n\nkip1\n, an inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase involved in the\n\nregulation of the cell cycle, has previously been shown to be\n\na potential target of miR-221 in a variety of cancers [17,24,31,32].\n\nSince highly activated cell proliferation is one of the major\n\ncharacteristics of TNBCs, we investigated whether miR-221 also\n\ntargets p27\nkip1\n\nin this particular breast cancer subtype. If so, we\n\nwould expect an inverse relationship between the miR-221 and\n\np27 levels. We thus measured the expression level of p27 in\n\na variety of breast cancer cell lines as shown in Figure 2A. As\n\nexpected, p27 is expressed at much lower levels in TNBCs than in\n\nother types of breast cancer cell lines. In fact, p27 expression level\n\nwas inversely correlated to miR-221 expression level in most the\n\nbreast cancer cell lines tested as shown in Figure 1A and Figure 2A.\n\nSince miR-221 and miR-222 are highly homologous and contain\n\nidentical seed sequences, one might expect them to regulate the\n\nsame target genes and play similar biological functions in cancer\n\ncells [17]. However, the relative expression level of miR-221 versus\n\nnormal breast tissue is higher in the comparison to miR-222, and\n\nsince miR-221, but not miR-222, was specifically over expressed in\n\nthe TNBCs tested, we focused our experiments on miR-221. Next,\n\nwe successfully and stably knocked down miR-221 using a miR-\n\nZIP lentiviral vector in various breast cancer cells, as shown in\n\nFigure 2B. Briefly, miRZip are short, single-stranded anti-miRNAs\n\nin a lentivirus backbone that can be stably expressed to specifically\n\ntarget miRNAs of interest and alter translation. Knockdown of\n\nFigure 4. Down regulation of miR-221 increases E-cadherin\nlevels and decreases the expression levels of Snail and Slug.

(B) E-cadherin and vimentin\nexpression levels were measured in MDA-MB-231, BT-20, MDA-MB-468\nparental cells, as well cells harboring miR-221-ZIP, or scramble-ZIP. Data\nare normalized to the expression level in parental cells. Western blot\nanalysis was also performed to examine the protein levels of E-cadherin\nand vimentin.

Since p27\nkip1\n\nis involved in cell cycle regulation by\n\nmodulating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity [33], we also\n\ninvestigated the effects of miR-221 inhibition on cell cycle\n\nprogression in TNBC cell lines. miR-221 knockdown induced\n\na G1 arrest as evidenced by observing a higher number of cells in\n\nG1 phase compared to S phase (as shown in Figure 2E).\n\nFurthermore, cell cycle profile analysis demonstrated that miR-\n\n221 knockdown in MDA-MB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468\n\ncells exhibited higher sub-G1 cell population, again suggesting that\n\nmiR-221 knockdown restored p27\nkip1\n\nlevels and subsequently\n\ninduced apoptosis probably by blocking the aggressive cell cycle\n\nprogression in these TNBC cell lines.\n\nDown Regulation of miR-221 in TNBCs Inhibits Cell\nProliferation and Tumor Growth in Mice\nSince cell cycle analysis demonstrated that miR-221 knockdown\n\nwas able to block cell cycle progression and induce higher sub-G1\n\ncell population, we next investigated whether miR-221 knockdown\n\nalso induced apoptosis by direct measurement of apoptosis\n\nmarkers: cleaved caspase 3 and BAD phosphorylation (pBAD).\n\nAs shown in Figure 3A, down regulation of miR-221 induced\n\nsignificantly higher levels of cleaved caspase 3 in MDA-MB-231\n\nand BT-20 cells, and slightly higher levels of cleaved caspase 3 in\n\nMDA-MB-468 cells. Knocking down miR-221, however, did\n\ndecrease phosphorylation of Bcl-2-associated death promoter\n\n(BAD), a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 gene family whose\n\nactivity is regulated by survival kinases such as AKT, in all three\n\nTNBC cell lines (Figure 3A). We next investigated the cell\n\nproliferation rates of TNBCs with miR-221 knockdown. Down-\n\nregulation of miR-221 in all three TNBC lines (MDA-MB-231,\n\nBT-20, MDA-MB-468) decreased cell proliferation rates\n\n(Figure 3B), likely due to the cell cycle block and increased\n\napoptosis induced by miR-221 knockdown. Although we did not\n\nobserve a significant increase of cleaved caspase 3 in MDA-MB-\n\n468 cells, miR-221 knockdown indeed was able to decrease pBAD\n\n(Figure 3A) and induced G1 arrests (Figure 2E) and subsequently\n\nresulted in cell proliferation inhibition probably through mito-\n\nchondrial apoptosis regulated by BCL2 family [34,35].\n\nTo expand on our in vitro results, we also investigated whether\n\nmiR-221 is required for in vivo tumor growth. miR-221 stably\n\nknocked down MDA-MB-231 cells were implanted in nude mice\n\nand tumor growth was measured and plotted to compare with the\n\ntumor growth of MDA-MB-231 parental cell line and cells\n\ninfected with the control ZIP vector alone as shown in Figure 3C.\n\nOur results indicated that miR-221 knockdown also inhibited\n\nin vivo tumor growth in TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231. Therefore,\n\nboth the in vitro assays and in vivo studies confirm that miR-221\n\nfunctions similar to an oncogene and is essential in mediating cell\n\nproliferation and tumor progression in TNBC.\n\nmiR-221 Modulates Cell Migration and Invasion by\nRegulating Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition\nRelative to luminal subtypes, TNBCs, having undergone an\n\nepithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), express higher levels\n\nof vimentin and low levels of E-cadherin which allow for their\n\ncharacteristic high migration and invasion capabilities through the\n\nbasement membrane to promote metastasis [36]. Since miR-221\n\nknockdown can inhibit cell proliferation and tumor growth in mice\n\n(Figure 3), we wanted to investigate the molecular mechanism for\n\nthe miR-221 mediated cell transformation activity in TNBC\n\nhuman cell lines. Therefore, we next examined the levels of EMT\n\nmarkers and performed cell migration and invasion assays. The\n\nlevels of E-cadherin and vimentin in a variety of breast cancer cells\n\nwere quantified relative to the normal breast tissue as shown in\n\nFigure 4A. As expected, E-cadherin is highly expressed in luminal\n\nand HER2 positive cells but not in TNBC cell lines. Conversely,\n\nvimentin is expressed in higher levels in TNBC cell lines compared\n\nto non-TNBC cells. E-cadherin and vimentin levels were\n\nmeasured at both the transcript and protein levels in parental,\n\nvector control and miR-221 knocked down MDA-MB-231, BT-\n\n20, and MDA-MB-468 cells. Results indicate that knocking down\n\nmiR-221 in these TNBCs significantly increased both the mRNA\n\nand protein levels of E-cadherin as shown in Figure 4B. In-\n\nterestingly, vimentin levels were not altered by knocking down\n\nmiR-221 in these cell lines. These data suggest that although\n\nsuppression of E-cadherin is regulated by miR-221, the vimentin\n\nlevel in TNBCs is probably regulated by other mechanisms. Since\n\nE-cadherin lacks a miR221 binding site and is likely not a direct\n\ntarget, we next investigated if this regulation is mediated by any of\n\nthe transcription factors that have previously been reported to\n\ndirectly regulate E-cadherin expression [37]. Figure 4C outlines\n\nthe effects of miR-221 knockdown on some of the EMT\n\ntranscription factors known to regulate E-cadherin levels. We\n\nobserved a robust decrease in the expression levels of mesenchy-\n\nmal markers Snail and Slug by miR-221 knockdown in MDA-MB-\n\n231, BT20 and MDA-MB-468 (Figure 4C). As previously reported\n\nhowever, the expression level of Slug in MDA-MB-468 was much\n\nlower than the other two TNBC cell lines tested [38].\n\nWe next investigated the effects of miR-221 knock down on cell\n\nmigration and invasion of TNBC cell lines. As expected, MDA-\n\nMB-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468 showed high migratory and\n\ninvasive properties in the migration and invasion assays performed\n\nupon stimulation with 10% FBS. Knocking down miR-221\n\ndecreased the FBS stimulated migration and invasion in all three\n\ncell lines as shown in Figure 5A and Figure 5B. Our data thus\n\nindicate that miR-221 alters the migration and invasion properties\n\nof TNBCs by suppressing E-cadherin expression. miR-221\n\nknockdown in TNBCs restored E-cadherin expression and the\n\nincreased E-cadherin in these TNBC cells was sufficient to block\n\nthe activity of cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, although\n\nvimentin levels did not change with miR-221 knock down and\n\nhigh vimentin levels were maintained in these transduced TNBCs,\n\nit was not sufficient to maintain their migration and invasion\n\ncapabilities. Therefore, these results suggest that the modulation of\n\nE-cadherin by miR-221 plays a critical role in maintaining the\n\ntriple negative cell phenotype and knockdown of miR-221 can\n\nlead to increased E-cadherin and subsequently inhibit cell\n\nmigration and invasion independent of vimentin levels.\n\nDiscussion\n\nmiR-221 has been reported to be dysregulated in a variety of\n\ntumor types and has previously been shown to be involved in\n\nsuppression of ERa expression in luminal breast cancer cells and\nEMT transition in basal-like breast cancers [23–26,29,30,39].\n\nHere we demonstrate that miR-221 is specifically over expressed\n\nin TNBCs and that miR-221 knockdown induces G1 arrest and\n\napoptosis, inhibits cell proliferation and tumor growth (probably\n\nby altering expression levels of p27\nkip1\n\n), and suppresses the\n\nmigratory phenotypes of TNBCs by restoring E-cadherin levels.\n\nThese results suggest that miR-221 is essential in regulating the\n\naggressive characteristics of triple negative or basal like of breast\n\ncancer cells, including cell proliferation, suppressed apoptosis, high\n\nmiR-221 Promotes Tumorigenesis in TNBCs\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62170\n\n\n\nmigratory and invasive abilities, as well as accelerated in-vivo tumor\n\ngrowth. Therefore, our results provide direct evidence that\n\noverexpression of miR-221 leads to in vitro and in vivo tumorigen-\n\nesis in TNBCs.\n\nTherefore, miR-221 regulates two key mechanisms to promote\n\nthe aggressive tumorogenic characteristics observed for TNBC: it\n\npromotes cell cycle progression by inhibiting p27\nkip1\n\nand it\n\npromotes EMT transition by inhibiting the expression of E-\n\ncadherin. Both of these mechanisms may account for the\n\naggressive cellular proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, as well\n\nas higher cell migration and invasion characteristics associated\n\nwith BLBCs and TNBCs [9–11]. Although, we could not rule out\n\nalternative targets of miR-221 that may explain the cellular\n\nphenotypes observed, knockdown of miR-221 alone is sufficient to\n\ninduce in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activities in the TNBC cell\n\nlines tested. Hence, the translational suppression of miR-221\n\ntargets is crucial in maintaining the aggressive tumor progression\n\nof TNBCs. Previously, miR-221 over expression has been shown\n\nto alter E-cadherin/vimentin levels in an EMT-induced MCF-7\n\ncell line, which normally does not express endogenous miR-221\n\n[39]. Additionally, EMT transcription factor Slug has previously\n\nbeen shown to decrease both miR-221 and E-cadherin/vimentin\n\nlevels in MDA-MB-231 cells [30]. In this study, although we did\n\nobserve changes in Slug and Snail, we did not detect changes in\n\nvimentin expression after stable miR-221 knockdown in MDA-\n\nMB-231, BT20, and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Although vimentin\n\nlevels were not altered, E-cadherin expression changed signifi-\n\ncantly with miR-221 knockdown. Our data suggest that increasing\n\nE-cadherin while maintaining vimentin levels in TNBCs seems to\n\nbe sufficient for inhibiting cell migration and invasion. Therefore,\n\nE-cadherin seems to be critical in regulating cell motility, at least in\n\nthe TNBC cell lines, MDA-MD-231, BT-20, and MDA-MB-468.\n\nAlthough miR-221 was able to regulate E-cadherin expression, we\n\nwere unable to identify the complementary sequence in the\n\n39UTR of this protein. Therefore E-cadherin may not be a direct\n\ntarget of miR-221, and its expression is likely affected by alteration\n\nin EMT transcription factors Snail and Slug.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that miR-221 is a potential\n\noncomiR and functions as an oncogene to mediate tumor\n\nprogression of TNBCs via targeting p27\nkip1\n\nand inhibiting E-\n\ncadherin levels to mediate EMT transition. These results may\n\nprove useful for therapeutic options for TNBCs when systemic\n\ndelivery of anti-miR-221 becomes feasible.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Tod Smeal, Timothy S Fisher, and Lars\n\nEngstrom for their help and support.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: RN MJY.
