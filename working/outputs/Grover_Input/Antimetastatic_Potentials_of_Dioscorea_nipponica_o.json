In the present study, we extracted Dioscorea nipponica\nMakino with methanol (DNE1), chloroform (DNE2), ethyl acetate (DNE3), n-butanol (DNE4), and water (DNE5). We first\ndemonstrate that DNE3 was found to be effective in reducing the lung metastases formation by about 99.5% as compared to\nvehicle-treated control animals. When a nontoxic concentration of the extract was treated directly to highly metastatic murin\nmelanoma cells (B16F10) and human melanoma cells (A2058) in vitro, it exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the invasion\n(P < .001), motility (P < .001), secretion of MMPs (P < .001), and u-PA (P < .001) of both cell lines. To investigate the possible\nmechanisms involved in these events, we performed western blot analysis to find that DNE inhibited phosphorylation of Akt.\nA treatment with DNE3 to B16F10 cells also inhibited the activation of NF-κB and increased the expression of IkappaB. Taken\ntogether, these findings suggested that DNE3 could reduce the metastasis of melanoma cells, thereby constituting an adjuvant\ntreatment for metastasis control.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown that a diet rich in\nvegetables and fruits might protect against cancer by mech-\nanisms that have not been well defined yet. In recent\nyears, naturally occurring plant products have been getting\nincreased attention for the intervention of malignant invasive\nprogression in the late stage of neoplastic diseases [1, 2].\nOn the basis of this idea, certain foods, including many\nvegetables, fruits, and grains, as well as phytochemicals of\ndiversified pharmacological efficacies have been shown to\noffer a significant protection against various cancers [3–5].\n\nFurthermore, there is an increase focus on providing sci-\nentific basis to use these agents in the prevention strategy\nfor people with a high risk for cancers. Dioscorea nipponica\nMakino has long been used as a folk medicine for bronchitis,\nasthma, and rheumatoid arthritis. These compounds were\neffective for preventing both the body and adipose tissue\nweight gains in rodents induced by a high-fat diet [6].\nHowever, limited studies are available concerning the effect\nof Dioscorea nipponica Makino in anticancer.\n\nInvasion and metastasis of solid tumor involves multiple\nprocesses and various cytophysiological changes, including\nchanged adhesion capability between cells and extracellular\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nDioscorea nipponica Makino 50 g\n\nH2O layer\n\nH2O layer\n\nH2O layer\n\nH2O layer\n\nExtract with CHCl3\n\nExtract with EtOAc CHCl3 layer\n(DNE2)\n\nEtOAc layer\n(DNE3)\n\nExtract with n-BuOH\n\nn-BuOH layer\n(DNE4)\n\nResidue\n\nExtract with MeOH\n\nMeOH layer\n(DNE1)\n\n(DNE5)\n\n(a)\n\nC\nel\n\nl\nin\n\nva\nsi\n\no\nn\n\n(c\no\n\nn\ntr\n\no\nl\n\n%\n)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\nControl DNE1 DNE2 DNE3 DNE4 DNE5\n\n100 μg/mL\n\n∗∗∗\n\n∗∗\n\n(b)\n\nA\nU\n\n1.2\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\nP1\n\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30\n(minutes)\n\n(c)\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne\nab\n\nu\nn\n\nd\nan\n\nce\n\n200 250 300 350 400 450 500 550 600\n\n410.87\n\n392.97\n\n285.06 426.97\n\n291.05272.95231.17\n\n545.12243.08 303.09 503.01266.9 439.21203.03 594.35178.88 341.08 356.45\n\n100\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n582.75\n438.81\n\nm/z\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 1: The chemical profile of Dioscorea nipponica extract was analyzed by HPLC-mass spectrometry.

The purpose of the present study was to\ncharacterize the effects of Dioscorea nipponica Makino on\ntumor cell metastasis in vivo, and cell invasion, migration,\nmotility, adhesion, and proteinase expression in vitro.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Chemicals. Dioscorea nipponica Makino was obtained\nfrom a plantation of the Green Health Biotechnology\n\nCorporation (Yunlin, Taiwan) and identified by Profes-\nsor Yih-Shou Hsieh, Chung Shan Medical University.\n3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-\nmide (MTT) and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium\n(DMEM) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis,\nMO, USA) and Matrigel was purchased from BD Biosciences\n(Bedford, MA, USA). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against\nc-Jun and c-Fos were purchased from Biosource (Camar-\nillo, CA, USA) and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against\ntissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2)\nwas purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK). Monoclonal\nantibodies against nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and C23 and\nrabbit polyclonal antibodies against Extracellular signal-\nregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), p38, and Akt, the total and\nphosphorylated protein, were purchased from Santa Cruz\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nB16F10\n\n100x\n\n(a)\n\nWT\n\n100x\n\n(b)\n\nDNE3 0.1 g\n\nB16F10\n\n100x\n\n(c)\n\nDNE3 0.2 g\n\nB16F10\n\n100x\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 3: Histopathology of lung of metastatic tumor bearing animals (×100).

A monoclonal\nantibody against plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) was\nobtained from American Diagnostics Inc. (Greenwich, CT,\nUSA). ECL Plus detection kit was obtained from Amersham\nLife Sciences, Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). Lightshift kit was\npurchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA).\n\n2.2. Preparation of Dioscorea nipponica Makino Extracts. Air-\ndried Dioscorea nipponica Makino (50 g) was extracted 3\ntimes with boiling water (500 mL) for 30 minutes, and\nthe filtrate was partitioned with chloroform (DNE2), ethyl\nacetate (DNE3), and n-butanol (DNE4), and the residue was\nextracted with methanol (DNE1). Afterwards, solvent was\nremoved by a vacuum rotary evaporator and these fractions\nwere lyophilized and stored at −20◦C . Furthermore, the\nchemical profile of ethyl acetate soluble fraction was analyzed\nby using high-pressure liquid chromatograms- (HPLC-)-\nmass spectrometer. Briefly, DNE3 was analyzed by HPLC-\nmass spectrometer using a HPLC (Hitachi L-6200 with an\nL-4500 Diode Array detector) with a PE Sciex Qstar Pulsar\nESI-TOF mass spectrometer. Samples (10 μl) were injected\n\ninto a Merck LiChrospher 100 RP-18 column (4× 250 mm).\nThe column was equilibrated in 0.05% acetic acid/water\n(solution A), and elution of the components was performed\nby increasing the concentration of acetonitrile (solution B)\nfrom 0% to 60% in 30 minutes at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nThe main product peak with a retention time of 16.644\nminutes was then subjected to electrospray ionisation mass\nspectra using multiply-charged ion profile based on the\nmodified method of Wong et al. [14].\n\n2.3. Cell Culture. Cell lines including A2058 from human\nmelanoma, B16F10 from a mouse melanoma, and HS68\nfrom a human foreskin fibroblast cells were obtained from\nAmerican Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA)\nand cultured in DMEM (for A2058 and B16F10) or RPMI\n(for HS68).\n\n2.4. Measurement of Lung Metastasis in B16F10-Bearing\nMice.

(d)\nDetermined migration ability of B16F10 was subsequently quantified with that of control being 100% (without DNE3 for 48 h). Cells were\ntreated with DNE3 for 24 hours and then subjected to analyze for (e and f) motility, invasion, and (g) adhesion as described in Materials and\nMethods. Results were statistically evaluated by using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s test ( ∗∗∗P < .001). Results from 3 repeated\nand separated experiments were similar.\n\naccess to standard rodent chow diet (Laboratory Rodent Diet\n5001, LabDiet, St. Louis, MO). Cells (2×105 cells) suspended\nin 0.1 mL of PBS were injected into the tail vain of C57BL/6\nmice. On the following day (Day 1), mice were randomly\ndivided into three groups (n = 8 for each group) to be\nfed by oral gavage with saline (control) or DNE3 (0.1 g/kg\nand 0.2 g/kg of body weight, daily). Five untreated mice\nwere used as wild type control. After 21 days, animals were\neuthanized with CO2. The lungs were isolated and weighed,\nand metastatic nodules on the surface of lungs were counted\nunder a microscopy. Lungs were fixed in neutral buffered\n5% formalin, and sections were taken and stained with\nhematoxyline and eosine for morphological studies [15].\n\n2.5. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). Cells were\ntreated with DNE3 (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL) for 24\nhours. After treatment, cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/mL\nMTT in culture medium for an additional 4 h, and the blue\nformazan crystals of viable cells were dissolved by lysis buffer\n(isopropyl alcohol containing 10% Triton X-100 and 0.1 N\nHCl) and measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm [4].\n\n2.6. Transwell Cell Invasion and Motility Assays. After a pre-\ntreatment with DNE3 for 24 hours, cells were harvested and\nseeded to BD Falcon cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences,\nBedford, MA, USA) at 5 × 104 cells/well in serum-free\nmedium and then incubated for another 12 h at 37◦C. For\ninvasion assay, 100 μl Matrigel (1 mg/1 mL) was applied to\nthe membrane filters with a pore size of 8 μm and the bottom\nchamber contained standard medium. Filters were then air-\ndried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. The invaded cells were\n\nfixed with methanol and stained with Giemsa. Cell numbers\nwere counted under a light microscope. The motility assay\nwas carried out as described in the invasion assay with no\ncoating of Matrigel [16].\n\n2.7. Wound Healing Migration Assay. Wounds were intro-\nduced to the confluent monolayer of cells with a yellow\nplastic pipette tip to create a cleared line. The medium was\nremoved and replaced with DMEM containing 1% FBS, and\nthen DNE3 was added. The cells were incubated at 37◦C, and\ncell movement into the wound area was photographed at 0 h,\n24 hours and 48 hours using a microscope.\n\n2.8. Cell-Matrix Adhesion Assay. After a 24-hour treatment\nwith DNE3, cells were plated on 24-well dishes coated\nwith 150 μl type I collagen (10 μg/mL) and cultured for 30\nminutes. Nonadherent cells were removed by PBS washes and\nadherent cells were fixed in ethanol. After staining with 0.1%\ncrystal violet, fixed cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 and\nthe absorbance was measured at 550 nm [17].\n\n2.9. Determination of MMP-2, -9, and u-PA. In gelatin\nzymography, collected media were prepared with sodium\ndodecyl sulphate (SDS) sample buffer without boiling or\nreduction and subjected to 0.1% gelatin-8% SDS polyacry-\nlamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) to determine the\nMMPs. After electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5%\nTriton X-100 and then incubated in reaction buffer (40 mM\nTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM CaCl2, 0.01% NaN3) for 16 h at\n37◦C.

The blot was\nsubsequently operated with standard procedures and probed\nwith each specific antibody at 4◦C overnight.

Effects of DNE on the Invasion of Human Melanoma Cells.\nTo evaluate the bioactive compound of Dioscorea nipponica\nMakino, we successively extracted the Dioscorea nippon-\nica with methanol (DNE1), chloroform (DNE2), ethyl\nacetate (DNE3), n-butanol (DNE4), and water (DNE5)\n(Figure 1(a)). B16F10 cells were treated with different\nDioscorea nipponica extracts, and a decrease of invasion was\ndetected by Transwell invasion assay. Among these extracts,\nDNE3 was the most effective Dioscorea nipponica ingredient\nthat reduces invasion activity in our assay (Figure 1(b)).\nChromatographic patterns from HPLC analysis of DNE3\nextracts showed peaks corresponding to the retention times.\nAbsorbance was monitored at 254 nm (Figure 1(c)). The\nmain product peak (P1) with a retention time of 16.644\nminutes as shown in Figure 1(c) was then subjected to\nelectrospray ionisation mass spectra using multiply-charged\nion profile (Figure 1(d)).\n\n3.2.

Cells were\ntreated with DNE3 for 24 hours and then subjected to analyze for motility ((a) and (c)) and invasion ((b) and (d)). Condition media were\nsubjected to gelatin zymography and casein zymography to analyze the activities of MMPs (e) and u-PA (f), respectively. Data represented\nthe mean± SD of at least 3 independent experiments. Results were statistically evaluated by using one-way ANOVA with post hoc Dunnett’s\ntest ( ∗P < .05; ∗∗P < .01; ∗∗∗P < .001).\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11\n\nB16F10 cells mainly form lung tumors. C57BL/6 mice were\ninjected via the tail vein with B16F10 melanoma cells, and\nadministration of the ethyl acetate extracts of DEN3 reduced\npulmonary metastasis formation of B16F10 cells. Within 21\ndays of injection, the control mice were visibly riddled with\nmetastatic tumor nodules compared with the lungs of DNE3\ntreated mice (Figure 2(a)). Mean lung weights for animals\nreceiving 0.1 g/kg/day DNE3 (0.1964 ± 0.0594 g; P < .001)\nand 0.2 g/kg/day DNE3 (0.1240 ± 0.0125 g; P < .001) were\nsignificantly lower than those from control animals (0.4570±\n0.1488 g; Figure 2(b)). Vehicle-treated control animals had\nmassive growth of tumor and was given an arbitrary-\nmaximum countable number about 275 ± 45.3. It was\nreduced to 14 ± 5.4 (0.1 g/kg/day; P < .001) and 1.2 ± 1.7\n(0.2 g/kg/day; P < .001) countable colonies by DNE3\ntreatment (Figure 2(c)). The average body weight of DNE3\ntreated mice was higher than control group (Figure 2(d)).\nHistopathology of the lung also showed marked reduction in\ntumor mass in the lungs of DNE3-treated animals (Figure 3).\n\n3.3. Effect of DNE3 on Cell Viability. Results of MTT assay\nshowed that DNE3 has no cytotoxicity on B16F10 cells\n(Figure 4(a)). Results from same procedures performed on\nnormal human foreskin fibroblast cell lines, HS68, revealed\nthat this compound did not have any significant cytotoxicity\non these cells (Figure 4(b)).\n\n3.4. Effects of DNE3 on the Invasion, Motility, Migration, and\nAdhesion. Incubation of B16F10 with 1% FBS produced a\nmarked cell migration in the wound area 24 hours and\n48 hours after wounding whereas wounds treated with\nDNE3 showed significant delays in wound healing under the\nsame conditions (Figures 4(c) and 4(d)). To screen for the\npreventive effectors against cancer metastasis, the inhibitory\neffect of DNE3 on invasion and motility of B16F10 cells\nwas examined with Transwell. The result showed that DNE3\nsignificantly reduced the motility and invasion of B16F10\ncells in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 4(e) and\n4(f)).\n\nCancer cells, invading the host tissue, break from their\ncell-cell contacts and make new contact with the ECM.\nTherefore, DNE3 was tested to determine their effects on\nthe cell-matrix adhesion. The results showed that DNE3\nsignificantly reduced the cell-matrix interactions of B16F10\ncells (Figure 4(g)).\n\n3.5. Effects of DNE3 on the Activities of MMP-2, u-PA,\nand TIMP-2. Via gelatin and casein zymography assays,\nrespectively, it has been shown that DNE3 significantly\nreduced MMP-2 (Figure 5(a)) and u-PA (Figure 5(b)) activ-\nity in dose-dependent manner. The immunoblotting showed\nthat MMP-2 protein level was gradually decreased along\nwith the concentration of DNE3 (Figure 5(c)). Physiological\nactivity of MMP-2 is greatly related to that of their specific\nendogenous inhibitors, TIMP-2, therefore western blotting\nwas employed to see the effect of DNE3 on TIMP-2\nexpression, and results showed that TIMP-2 protein levels\n\nwere significantly increased along with the concentration of\nDNE3 in B16F10 (Figure 5(d)).\n\n3.6. The Inhibition of Akt Phosphorylation by DNE3. The\nimmunoblotting showed that PI3K protein level was grad-\nually decreased along with the concentration of DNE3\n(Figure 6(a)). DNE3 significantly inhibited the activation of\nAkt as evidenced by a decrease in the levels of phospho-Akt\nproteins in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 6(b)) whereas\nit has no significant effect on p38 and ERK1/2 activity\n(Figures 6(c) and 6(d)).\n\n3.7. Effects of DNE3 on the Activation of NF-κB, c-Jun, and c-\nFos. To examine the effect of DNE3 on the activation of NF-\nκB and AP-1, B16F10 cells were treated with DNE3 for 24\nhours. Nuclear extract was analyzed by EMSA for AP-1 and\nNF-κB DNA binding activity, and results showed that DNA\nbinding activity of NF-κB (Figure 7(a)) was significantly\ninhibited by a treatment with 100 μg/mL DNE3 whereas the\nAP-1 activity was unchanged (Figure 7(b)). Subsequently,\nwestern blot was performed to further confirm these results,\nand it was found that a pretreatment of DNE3 suppressed the\nnuclear levels of NF-κB while it has no significant effect on\nthe c-Jun and c-Fos expression, with C23 being the internal\ncontrol (Figure 7(c)). The activity of NF-κB is related to\nthat of their endogenous inhibitors, IkappaB (IκB), therefore\nWestern blotting was employed to see the effect of DNE3 on\nIκB expression, and results showed that IκB protein levels\nwere significantly increased along with the concentration of\nDNE3 (Figure 7(d)).\n\n3.8. DNE3 Inhibit Invasion and MMP-2 and u-PA Secretion\nin Human Melanoma Cell Lines. Similar experiments were\nperformed, using human melanoma cells, A2058, in order to\ndetermine if the anti-invasive activity of DNE3 can generally\nbe applicable to other types of melanoma cells. DNE3\ninhibited the motility (Figures 8(a) and 8(c)) and invasion\n(Figures 8(b) and 8(d)) of A2058 cell lines, and DNE3 clearly\ninhibited the secretion of MMP-2, MMP-9 (Figure 8(e)),\nand u-PA (Figure 8(f)), thus indicating that DNE3 might\nhave anti-invasive properties against a broad spectrum of\nmelanoma cells.\n\n4. Discussion and Conclusions\n\nChemopreventive properties have long been attributed to\nphenolic compounds present in the human diet and are\nthe use of agents to delay, inhibit, or reverse tumorigenesis.\nThese natural substances are of interest as they are potential\nsources of anticancer compounds with minimal debilitating\ntoxicity and side effects [19–21]. In the present study,\nwe demonstrated that Dioscorea nipponica are effective in\nvarious aspects of tumor formation in the B16F10 mouse\nmelanoma model in vitro. This model was chosen on the\nbasis of aggressive behavior and high metastatic potential\nof this cell line. One day after the intravenous injection of\ntumor cells, mice were treated with daily oral administration\n\n\n\n12 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nof the DNE3 and resulted in a significant, dose-dependent\ndelay in lung colonization.\n\nThe metastatic process comprises a series of complicated\nevents that can be subdivided into a number of steps involv-\ning cell motility, cell invasion, surface adhesion properties,\nand degradation of ECM. Thus, in the present study, we tried\nto investigate the antimetastatic activity of DNE3 associated\nwith tumor thrombosis by tumor cell invasion, migration,\nadhesion, and proteinase expression.\n\nAdhesive interaction of tumor cells to ECM and its inva-\nsive action into ECM are known to be fundamental events\nin tumor metastatic process [22]. Here, DNE3 inhibited the\nadhesion of B16-F10 cells to type I collagen, one of the ECM\ncomponents, as well as effectively suppressed the invasion of\nB16-F10 cells in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\nThe secretion of extracellular proteases plays an impor-\ntant role in cancer cell invasion and metastasis [23]. Of\nthese proteases, MMPs, a family of zinc-dependent ECM-\ndegrading enzymes, are involved in invasion, migration,\nand angiogenesis in tumor cells. There have been reports\nsuggesting that the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9\ncorrelates with the progression of various types of tumors\n[24]. In addition to MMPs, the serine protease u-PA\nconverts inactive plasminogen into plasmin and therefore\nplays a key role to initiate a cascade of proteolytic steps\naccumulating in the degradation of the extracellular matrix.\nu-PA is found in cellular structures at the leading edge of\nmigrating cells that are involved in cell adhesion, migration,\ninvasion, and metastatsis [25]. MMP-2 is a proteolytic\nenzyme capable of degrading the structural support network\nfor normal and malignant cells, and their expression and\nactivity against matrix macromolecules have been shown\nto overbalance their endogenous inhibitors. TIMP-2 has\nbeen shown to suppress tumor growth and metastatic\npotential in cell and animal model systems [26]. The\ndata presented here demonstrated that DNE3 inhibits the\ninvasion of melanoma cancer cells and this inhibitory activity\nappeared to be dependent on the decreased expression of\nMMP-2, MMP-9, and u-PA, while that of TIMP-2 was\nenhanced.\n\nThe role of PI3K-Akt and MAPKs pathways in the\nregulation of u-PA or MMPs expressions in carcinoma\ncells has been well studied [23]. It has been shown that\nan inhibition of p-Akt may lead to a reduction in the\nexpression of MMP-2 or u-PA as well as in the invasion\nof tumor cells. As shown in Figure 6, DNE3 could reduse\nthe phosphorylation of Akt in B16-F10 cells. To make a\nlinkage between p-Akt and protease expressions, the effects\nof DNE3 on several transcription factors were examined. It\nis well known that the activation of AP-1 and NF-κB and\nthe downstream of the PI3K-Akt pathway are associated with\ninflammation, cell invasion, migration, and angiogenesis\n[27], and that suppression of any of these transcription\nfactors is potentially an effective means to block tumor\ninvasion or metastasis, as well as blocking the factors that\nbind to these regulatory elements, and therefore represents\nan appropriate approach to inhibit the synthesis of MMPs or\nu-PA. In our studies, DNE3 was found to effectively suppress\nthe DNA binding activity and the expression of NF-κB while\n\nthe protein level of IκB, the endogenous inhibitor of NF-\nκB, was gradually increased along with the concentration of\nDNE3.\n\nThe major drawbacks of many effective cancer chemo-\ntherapeutic agents are systemic toxicity and drug resistance.\nIn this regard, dietary supplement as well as phytotherapeutic\nagents with high anticancer activity and less toxicity to\nnormal tissues has been suggested as possible candidates\nfor their capability to improve the efficacy of anticancer\ndrugs [28, 29]. In the present study, HS68, human foreskin\nfibroblast cells, was used to demonstrate that DNE3 exerted\nno cytotoxicity on normal foreskin fibroblast cells. In\nconclusion, Dioscorea nipponica potently inhibits melanoma\ninvasive and metastatic potential; therefore, they may consti-\ntute a valuable tool in the combination therapy of metastatic\nmelanoma and in the prevention of melanoma metastases.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by Grants of the National Science\nCouncil, Taiwan (NSC 98-2313-B-166-004-MY3 and NSC\n98-2313-B-040-004-MY3).
