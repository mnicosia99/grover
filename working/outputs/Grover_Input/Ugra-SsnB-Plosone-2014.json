Despite the standard therapy for advanced disease including chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation, the mortality\nrate remains high for these patients. Hence, novel therapeutic agents are desperately needed. Here we examined the\nanticancer activity of a novel plant-derived compound, sparstolonin B (SsnB; 8,59-dihydroxy-4-phenyl-5,29-oxidoisocou-\nmarin) using neuroblastoma cell lines of different genetics. SsnB was recently isolated from an aquatic Chinese herb,\nSparganium stoloniferum, and tubers of this herb have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of\nseveral inflammatory diseases and cancers. Our cell viability and morphological analysis indicated that SsnB at 10 mM\nconcentration significantly inhibited the growth of both N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2), NGP, and IMR-32 cells) and N-myc\nnonamplified (SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells) neuroblastoma cells. The flow cytometric analyses suggested that SsnB arrests the\ncell cycle progression at G2-M phase in all neuroblastoma cell lines tested. Exposure of SsnB inhibited the compact spheroid\nformation and reduced the tumorigenicity of SH-SY5Y cells and SK-N-BE(2) cells in in vitro 3-D cell culture assays\n(anchorage-independent colony formation assay and hanging drop assay). SsnB lowers the cellular level of glutathione\n(GSH), increases generation of reactive oxygen species and activates the cleavage of caspase-3 whereas co-incubation of a\nGSH precursor, N-acetylcysteine, along with SsnB attenuates the inhibitory effects of SsnB and increases the neuroblastoma\ncell viability. Our results for the first time demonstrate that SsnB possesses anticancer activity indicating that SsnB-induced\nreactive oxygen species generation promotes apoptotic cell death in neuroblastoma cells of different genetic background.\nThus these data suggest that SsnB can be a promising drug candidate in neuroblastoma therapy.\n\nCitation: Kumar A, Fan D, DiPette DJ, Singh US (2014) Sparstolonin B, a Novel Plant Derived Compound, Arrests Cell Cycle and Induces Apoptosis in N-Myc\nAmplified and N-Myc Nonamplified Neuroblastoma Cells.

In vivo and in vitro studies revealed its anti-\n\ninflammatory [1,2] and anti-angiogenic [3] properties. SsnB acts\n\nas an antagonist to Toll-like Receptors 2 and 4 (TLR2 and TLR4),\n\nand exhibits anti-inflammatory property by selectively inhibiting\n\nTLR2 and TLR4-triggered inflammatory response in mouse and\n\nhuman macrophages [1,2]. In traditional Chinese medicine\n\n(TCM), the tubers of this herb have been used for the treatment\n\nof several inflammatory diseases, and the crude extract prepared\n\nform this herb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4–\n\n6]. As revealed by NMR and X-ray crystallography, SsnB (8,59-\n\ndyhydroxy-4-phenyl-5,29-oxidoisocoumarin) is a polyphenol with\n\nstructural similarities to isocoumarins and xanthone. Isocoumarins\n\nand xanthone family of compounds are well known for their anti-\n\ninflammatory and anti-tumor properties [7–10]. Due to the\n\nstructural similarities of SsnB with isocoumarins and xanthone, we\n\ndecided to examine the anticancerous properties of SsnB.\n\nNeuroblastoma is a malignant pediatric cancer of the postgan-\n\nglionic sympathetic nervous system and derived from the neural\n\ncrest cells during embryonic development. Initially it develops in\n\nthe adrenal gland and metastasizes to liver, bone, bone marrow,\n\nlymph nodes, neck and chest. It is the most common cancer in\n\nbabies younger than one and second most common tumor in\n\nchildren [11,12]. It accounts for 7% of all childhood cancers\n\n(Cancer Facts & Figures 2013. Atlanta, GA: American Cancer\n\nSociety, 2013), and is responsible for 15% of all cancer deaths in\n\nchildren younger than 15 years. About 30%–50% of children with\n\nhigh-risk neuroblastoma experience long-term survival.\n\nNeuroblastoma tumor comprises of various heterogeneous\n\npopulation of cells which differ at morphological, biochemical\n\nand genetic levels [13–15]. Genomic amplification of N-myc gene,\n\nrearrangement or deletion of distal region of the chromosome 1\n\n(1p31-arm) [16,17] or alterations in chromosomes 11, 14 and 17\n\n[18,19] are most common cytogenetic features identified in low to\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0096343&domain=pdf\n\n\nadvance stages of neuroblastomas. Mutations in tumor suppresser\n\ngenes, i.e., p53, retinoblastoma, RET, p16, p18 or p27 have been\n\nreported to promote tumorigenesis [20–22]. These karyotype and\n\ncytogenetic alterations render tumors resistant to available\n\nchemotherapies [23]. For example, retinoic acid induces neuronal\n\ndifferentiation in neuroblastoma cells [24,25] and commonly used\n\nas in residual therapy. However, neuroblastoma cells with N-myc\n\namplified oncogene do not respond to retinoic acid [26,27].\n\nTherefore, it is crucial to find new therapeutic agents that can\n\nexhibit anti-proliferative effects on neuroblastoma cells irrespective\n\nof their genetic abnormalities.\n\nIn the present study, for the first time we have reported the\n\nanticancer activity of SsnB and have demonstrated that SsnB\n\ninhibits the growth of human neuroblastoma cells of different\n\ngenetic background by arresting cell cycle progression and by\n\ninducing apoptotic cell death through generation of reactive\n\noxygen species.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nHuman Neuroblastoma Cell Culture and SsnB Treatments\nHuman neuroblastoma cell lines (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, SK-N-\n\nBE(2) and SKNF-1 cells) were obtained from The American Type\n\nCulture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA), and NGP cells were\n\nkind gift from Garrett M. Brodeur (The Children’s Hospital of\n\nPhiladelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) [28]. All cell lines were\n\nmaintained in complete Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium\n\n(DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;\n\nAtlanta Biologicals, Lawrenceville, GA) and 16 antibiotic-\nantimycotic solution (containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml\nstreptomycin and 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B), and grown at 37uC\nin a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Stock solution of SsnB\n\nwas prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Cells treated with\n\ndifferent concentrations of SsnB in DMEM with 10% FBS were\n\ngrown for subsequent days. Cells treated with equal volume of\n\nDMSO were used as control.\n\nCell Viability Assay\nThe viability of SsnB-treated cells was determined by MTT\n\nassay following manufacturer’s instructions (Roche diagnostics\n\ncorporation, Indianapolis, IN). Briefly, cells (16104 cells/well)\ngrown in 96-well cell culture plate were incubated with SsnB in\n\n100 ml of complete culture medium with 10% FBS. After\ntreatments, cells were incubated with 10 ml of MTT reagent for\n4 h and then incubated overnight in solubilization buffer (100 ml)\nat 37uC. Absorbance of the formazan product was read at 575 nm\nin spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,\n\nCA). A reference wavelength of 690 nm was used to detect\n\nbackground. The measured absorption directly correlates with the\n\nnumber of viable cells in culture. The experiments were performed\n\nin triplicates and repeated at least three times.\n\nCell Cycle Analyses by Flow Cytometry\nThe cell cycle progression was determined by flow cytometer\n\nanalysis [29]. Neuroblastoma cells were treated with SsnB or\n\nDMSO in DMEM with 10% FBS. Cells were collected after\n\ntrypsinization with trypsin-EDTA solution (Atlanta Biologicals)\n\nand washed with 16 phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Approxi-\nmately 16106 cells were suspended in 300 ml of ice-cold 16PBS,\nfixed by adding 700 ml of chilled absolute ethanol (to make final\nethanol concentration 70%) drop wise and incubated for overnight\n\nat 220uC. Cells were pelleted at 10006 rpm for 5 min at 4uC,\nwashed with 16 PBS for 3 times and stained with propidium\niodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) by adding 1 ml of\n\npropidium iodide staining solution (containing 20 mg/ml propi-\ndium iodide and 10 mg/ml DNase-free RNase A in 0.1% Triton\nX-100/PBS) for 1 h on ice in dark. Samples were subjected to\n\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses utilizing Beckman\n\nCoulter flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN). A\n\nminimum of 10,000 events were analyzed in each experiment.\n\nImmunofluorescence Microscopy\nFor immunofluorescence staining, cells grown in Lab-TekII\n\nchamber slides (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) were treated with\n\nSsnB compound in complete culture medium. After treatments,\n\ncells were washed with 16PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/\nPBS for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100/PBS\n\nfor 10 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with 16PBS\nfor 3 times and blocked with 5% immunoglobulin (IgG) free-\n\nbovine serum albumin (BSA; Jackson ImmunoResearch Labora-\n\ntories, West Grove, PA) in 16 PBS for overnight at 4uC. Cells\nwere incubated with antibody raised against active form of\n\ncaspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) diluted in\n\n2.5% BSA/PBS for overnight at 4uC. Primary antibodies were\ndetected with secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorescein\n\nisothiocyanate (FITC; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for\n\n2 h at room temperature. After washing with 16 PBS, cells were\nmounted with antifade Vectashield mounting media (Vector\n\nLaboratories, Burlingame, CA), and signals were visualized under\n\nNikon-E600 fluorescence microscope. Nuclei were counterstained\n\nwith 49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma).\n\nTotal Cell Protein Isolation and Western Blot Analyses\nAfter treatment with SsnB, cells were collected, washed with 16\n\nPBS, and lysed with 16 cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Danvers, MA) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl\n\nfluoride (PMSF) and protease inhibitors (aprotinin and leupeptin)\n\nfor 30 min on ice, and centrifuged at 120006 rpm for 10 min at\n4uC. Supernatant (total cell protein) was collected and stored at 2\n80uC. Protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid\nmethod using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce/ThermoScientific,\n\nWaltham, MA). Equal amount of proteins were diluted with 5 x\n\nLaemmli samples loading buffer and boiled for five minutes. The\n\nproteins were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-\n\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blots\n\n[30]. Briefly, after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred on\n\npolyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane at 100 volt for 3 h in\n\ncold room. Membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk/\n\nTBST (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl with 0.1% Tween-\n\n20) for 4 h at room temperature followed by incubation in primary\n\nantibodies diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk/TBST for overnight\n\nat 4uC. After washing with TBST, membrane was incubated with\nsecondary antibodies (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat\n\nanti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\n\nDallas, TX) diluted in 2.5% non-fat dry milk/TBST for 3 h at\n\nroom temperature. Signals were detected by chemiluminiscence\n\ndetection kit (Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL).\n\nPrimary antibodies used were cleaved caspase-3 and b-actin (Cell\nSignaling Technology), N-myc and p53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-\n\nogy).\n\nDetection of Reactive Oxygen Species Generation\nThe production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in SsnB-\n\ntreated neuroblastoma cells was detected by a cell-permeable\n\nfluorescence probe H2DCFDA (carboxy-29,79-dichlorodihydro-\n\nfluorescein diacetate) according to the manufacturer’s instructions\n\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) [31]. Briefly, neuroblastoma cells were\n\ncultured in DMEM with 10% FBS in Lab-TekII chamber slides\n\nSparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer Activity\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343\n\n\n\n(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburg, PA) and treated with SsnB for 2 days\n\n(SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cell) or 4 days (SKNF-\n\n1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells). After treatments, cells were washed with\n\nHank’s buffered salt solution (HBSS; Thermo Scientific, Waltham,\n\nMA) and incubated with 25 mM of carboxy-H2DCFDA dye for\n30 min at 37uC in dark. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.\nCells were washed three times with HBSS, mounted with\n\nVectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories), and imme-\n\ndiately examined under Nikon-E600 fluorescence microscopy\n\nequipped with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter [32].\n\nOxidation of H2DCFDA probe occurs almost exclusively in the\n\ncytosol, and generates a fluorescence that is proportional to ROS\n\ngeneration in that cell. As a negative control, cells without\n\nH2DCFDA dye were used to detect autofluorescence. The\n\nfluorometric analysis to detect generation of ROS was performed\n\nas described previously [33]. Briefly, after treatments with SsnB as\n\nmentioned above, cells were labelled with carboxy-H2DCFDA dye\n\n(25 mM) for 30 min at 37uC. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and\nre-suspended in PBS and fluorescence intensity was monitored at\n\nexcitation wavelength 485 nm and emission wavelength 530 nm\n\nwith a spectramax spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sun-\n\nnyvale, CA).\n\nColony Formation Assay\nA two layer soft agarose assay system was used in these studies\n\nwith some modifications [34]. Approximately 16104 cells were\nsuspended in 0.35% agarose in DMEM with 10% FBS, and were\n\ngently laid on the bottom agarose layer containing 0.8% agarose\n\nwith DMEM+10% FBS in 35 mm2 cell culture dishes. Once\nsolidified, the dishes were incubated at 37uC in a humidified\nchamber with 5% CO2. Next day, 500 ml of complete cell culture\nmedium with respective concentrations of SsnB was added, and\n\ncells were allowed to grow for 45 days in an incubator chamber.\n\nFresh medium with respective concentrations of SsnB was added\n\nto the dishes in every 5 days. Cells treated with equal volume of\n\nDMSO were used as control. At the end of experiments, cells were\n\nstained with 0.1% crystal violet and cell colonies (more than 15\n\ncells per colony) were counted under the light microscope.\n\nHanging-drop Assay for Spheroid Formation\n3-D in vitro hanging drop assay was carried out to detect the\n\nSsnB effect in neuroblastoma spheroid formation [35]. Neuro-\n\nblastoma cells were prepared as single cell suspension in complete\n\nculture medium (DMEM+10% FBS) without or with SsnB (1 and\n10 mM). Twenty microliter drop of each prepared cell suspension\ncontaining 20,000 cells/drop were pipetted into the inner side of\n\nthe lid of a 60 mm diameter tissue culture dish. The lid was gently\n\ninverted and placed on top of the culture dish filled with 5 ml of\n\nsterile 16PBS to humidify the culture chamber. The drops were\nincubated under tissue culture conditions (at 37uC and 5% CO2)\nallowing the cells to form aggregate at the base of the droplet. The\n\ncells in each droplet were photographed using Olympus SZX2\n\nstereo microscope (Olympus America Inc., Center Valley, PA).\n\nMeasurement of Glutathione (GSH) Level\nCells treated with SsnB or DMSO were washed and re-\n\nsuspended in PBS and the intracellular GSH level was measured\n\nby luminescence based GSH-Glo glutathione assay kit (Promega,\n\nMadison, WI) following manufacturer’s protocol. The lumines-\n\ncence was monitored in a luminometer (Promega Biosystems,\n\nSunnyvale, CA).\n\nData Analysis\nData are presented as the mean and standard deviation (S.D.) of\n\nat least three independent experiments. Comparisons were made\n\namong the groups using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey-\n\nKramer ad hoc test (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA). A p-\n\nvalue,0.05 was considered significant.\n\nResults\n\nSsnB Inhibits the Survival of Neuroblastoma Cells\nTo test the inhibitory effects of SsnB on neuroblastoma cell\n\nsurvival, we treated human neuroblastoma cell lines of different\n\ngenetic background (SH-SY5Y, SKNF-1, NGP, IMR-32 and SK-\n\nN-BE(2) cells) with 1 mM, 5 mM, 10 mM or 20 mM concentration\nof SsnB under in vitro conditions. Following SsnB treatments,\n\nneuroblastoma cell were grown for subsequent days and were\n\nphotographed under light microscope to evaluate the cell\n\nmorphology. The phase contrast images as shown in Figure 1A\n\ndemonstrated that SsnB alters the cellular appearance and\n\npromotes cell death (as evaluated by cell morphology; round and\n\nclumping of cells is indication of cell death) in all these\n\nneuroblastoma cell lines. SsnB at 10 mM and above concentrations\nchanged the morphology (as evaluated by rounded cells and\n\nindication of cell death) of SH-SY5Y cells and IMR-32 cells (after\n\n2 days treatment), NGP (after 3 days treatment), SKNF-1 and SK-\n\nN-BE(2) cells (after 4 days treatment) compared to control DMSO-\n\ntreated cells. However, such morphological changes were not\n\nsignificant at 1 or 5 mM conc. of SsnB in any cell line tested.\nWe further carried out MTT assay to examine the effects of\n\nSsnB on viability of all the above listed neuroblastoma cells. After\n\n2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days\n\n(SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) treatment with SsnB (1, 5, 10 and\n\n20 mM), MTT cell viability assays were performed. The bar\ndiagram in Figure 1B showed that SsnB inhibited, effectively and\n\ndose-dependently, the viability of all neuroblastoma cell lines\n\ntested. Compared to DMSO, SsnB at and above 10 mM\nconcentration significantly reduced the viability of these cell lines\n\n(*p,0.05 vs DMSO) and the IC20 and IC50 were found to be in the\n\nrange of 6–8 mM and 10–12 mM, respectively. We did not observe\nsignificant difference in cell survival at SsnB at 1 mM or 5 mM\nconcentrations compared to control DMSO-treated neuroblasto-\n\nma cells (p.0.05 vs DMSO). No cytotoxic response of SsnB at\n\nthese concentrations (and up to ,100 mM) was observed in\nvarious normal human cells e.g. human monocytic THP-1 cells,\n\nphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophag-\n\nes, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human aortic\n\nsmooth muscle cells as reported in reference [1]. These data\n\ndemonstrate the anti-proliferative activity of SsnB on human\n\nneuroblastoma cells, and suggest that SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells\n\nwere most sensitive, NGP cell was moderately sensitive, SKNF-1\n\nand SK-N-BE(2) cell lines were least sensitive towards SsnB\n\ntreatment. Since 50% cell viability was observed in range of 10–\n\n12 mM SsnB conc., we used 10 mM as higher conc. and 1 mM\nlower conc. in our further experiments.\n\nSsnB Regulates Cell Cycle Progression in Neuroblastoma\nCells\n\nTo test whether SsnB-induced cell growth inhibition occurs\n\nthrough cell cycle arrest, we analyzed cell cycle distribution by\n\nflow cytometry after DNA staining with propidium iodide.\n\nRepresentative histogram in Figure 1C showed that 2 days (SH-\n\nSY5Y, IMR-32) or 3 days (NGP cells) exposure of SsnB (10 mM)\nresulted in increase of G2-M phase cells when compared with\n\nDMSO-treated controls (G2/M for SH-SY5Y, SsnB\n\nSparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer Activity\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343\n\n\n\n10 mM = 23.98% vs control = 14.33%; for IMR-32, SsnB\n10 mM = 23.45% vs control = 19.25%; and for NGP, SsnB\n10 mM = 26.98% vs control = 17.87%). Similarly, SsnB treatment\nfor 4 days increases the number of SK-N-BE(2) cells and SKNF-1\n\ncells in G2/M phase, compared to control (G2/M for SKNF-1,\n\nSsnB 10 mM = 14.53% vs control = 20.91%; for SK-N-BE(2) cells,\nSsnB 10 mM = 27.15% vs control = 22.26%). The SsnB (10 mM)\ninduced increase in G2/M fraction was accompanied by a\n\ndecrease in G0/G1 phase cells. SsnB at 1 mM concentration did\nnot affect cell cycle progression compared to DMSO-treated\n\ncontrols. These results indicated that the exhibited anti-prolifer-\n\native effect of SsnB (10 mM) may be exerted by cell cycle arrest at\nG2-M transition in these neuroblastoma cell lines.\n\nSsnB Generates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in\nNeuroblastoma Cells\n\nIsocoumarin and coumarin derivative compounds are well\n\nknown to exhibit their anti-tumor effects by reactive oxygen\n\nspecies-induced cell death [36,37]. To test whether SsnB-induced\n\ncell death is resulted from increased level of reactive oxygen\n\nspecies (ROS), we performed H2DCFDA staining [31,32].\n\nH2DCFDA is a cell-permeable non-fluorescent indicator for\n\nROS that is oxidized in presence of reactive oxygen species to\n\nfluorescent molecule carboxy-DCF. Neuroblastoma cells treated\n\nwith SsnB for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells)\n\nor 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) were labelled with\n\nH2DCFDA dye for 30 min and cells were immediately examined\n\nunder fluorescence microscopy. The carboxy-DCF positive cells\n\nwere quantitated by ImageJ software and plotted. The represen-\n\ntative fluorescence images of SH-SY5Y cells in Figure 2A\n\nindicated that the number of carboxy-DCF positive cells (green)\n\nwas significantly increased at 10 mM concentration of SsnB\ncompared to DMSO-treated samples (*p,0.05 vs DMSO;\n\nFigure 2B). The ROS generation was observed exclusively in\n\nthose SsnB treated cells which contain fragmented nuclei (blue).\n\nSimilar to SH-SY5Y cells, SsnB (10 mM) significantly increased\n\nFigure 1. SsnB inhibits cell growth and viability of neuroblastoma cells. (A) Phase contrast images showing the morphology of\nneuroblastoma cells after treatments with SsnB. Neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32, NGP, SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) were grown in presence of\nDMSO or SsnB (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) in complete culture medium and were photographed on indicated times. (B) Bar diagrams showing the cell\nviability after SsnB treatment as evaluated by MTT assays. Neuroblastoma cells were treated with SsnB (1, 5, 10, and 20 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and\nIMR-32), 3 days (NGP) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells) and cell viability was measured by MTT assay at 575 nm.

In negative\n\ncontrol, no such green staining was observed in cells processed\n\nwithout H2DCFDA dye ruling out the autofluorescence (data not\n\nshown). These results suggest that SsnB compound promotes\n\nintracellular ROS production in neuroblastoma cell lines. We\n\nfurther evaluated SsnB-induced generation of ROS by fluorom-\n\netry assay. Neuroblastoma cells as treated above were incubated\n\nwith H2DCFDA dye for 30 min and the fluorescence intensity was\n\nmeasured at 485 nm (excitation wavelength) and 530 nm (emis-\n\nsion wavelength). The H2DCFDA fluorescence intensity (as\n\nmeasure of generation of ROS) was significantly increased in cells\n\ntreated with SsnB (10 mM) compared to DMSO control (*p,0.05,\nSsnB 10 mM vs DMSO; Figure 2C) whereas the H2DCFDA\nfluorescence intensity levels were almost similar in SsnB (1 mM)\nand DMSO-treated cells (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vs\nDMSO; Figure 2C).\n\nIn a reaction system, after the removal of acetate group by\n\ncellular esterases and oxidation by reactive oxygen species, the\n\nnon-fluorescent carboxy-H2DCFDA dye is oxidized to fluores-\n\ncent molecule carboxy-DCF. To measure the ROS-generating\n\nactivity of SsnB, we also monitored the oxidation of carboxy-\n\nH2DCFDA dye in a cell-free system containing carboxy-\n\nH2DCFDA dye, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and SsnB at\n\n540 nm [38]. HRP was used to supply esterase since without\n\nesterase carboxy-H2DCFDA is not sensitive to oxidant. As shown\n\nin Figure 2D, the optical density (OD) value of reaction\n\ncontaining SsnB (10 mM) + H2DCFDA dye (25 mM) remained\nconstant throughout the experiment suggesting that SsnB\n\n(10 mM) alone was not able to oxidize H2DCFDA to the\nfluorescent compound carboxy-DCF. After addition of HRP\n\n(5 units/ml) in the reaction mixture containing SsnB (10 mM) +\nH2DCFDA dye (25 mM), the OD value increased by 2% in the\nfirst 240 sec and further increased by 8% after 15 min compared\n\nto H2DCFDA + HRP reaction, indicating the increased\noxidation of H2DCFDA to the fluorescent compound. These\n\nresults suggest that SsnB in presence of cellular peroxidases\n\noxidizes non-fluorescent H2DCFDA dye into the fluorescent\n\ncompound. Addition of GSH (0.25 mM or 2.5 mM) in a reaction\ncontaining SsnB (10 mM) + H2DCFDA dye (25 mM) + HRP\n(5 units/ml) lowers the OD value in a dose dependent manner\n\nindicating that GSH as an antioxidant removes the free radicals\n\ngenerated by SsnB in reaction mixture which in turn inhibits the\n\noxidation H2DCFDA dye (Figure 2E).\n\nAt cellular level, reduced glutathione (GSH) protects cells from\n\noxidative damage resulted from increased superoxides, peroxides\n\nand free radicals [39]. Since SsnB induces oxidative stress, we\n\nasked whether SsnB affects intracellular levels of GSH in\n\nneuroblastoma cells. After treatments with SsnB for 2 days (SH-\n\nSY5Y and IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and\n\nSK-N-BE(2) cells), the cellular GSH level was measured by\n\nluminescence based glutathione assay kit. Compared to control,\n\nthe GSH level was significantly decreased (,40% of control) in\ncells treated with 10 mM SsnB (*p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM vs control;\nFigure 2F). However, the level of GSH at 1 mM SsnB concentra-\ntion was slightly higher or equals to control levels (#p#0.05 vs\ncontrol) suggest that at initial stage basal antioxidant mechanism\n\ntrying to protect the cell against the toxic effects of SsnB. These\n\nresults indicated that the GSH depletion was unable to protect\n\nneuroblastoma cells against SsnB (10 mM)-induced increased\noxidative stress.\n\nSsnB Promotes DNA Fragmentation in Neuroblastoma\nCells\n\nIncreased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to\n\ninduce oxidative stress which in turn cleaves DNA that leads to cell\n\ndeath. We next examined SsnB-induced DNA fragmentation in\n\nneuroblastoma cells by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase\n\ndUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as described previously\n\n[32]. In this assay, nicked DNA is identified by the addition of\n\nfluorophore-labelled dUTPs by enzyme terminal deoxynucleotidyl\n\ntransferase (TdT) to the terminal ends of damaged DNA in\n\napoptotic cells. The TUNEL-positive cells (green) were quantitat-\n\ned by ImageJ programme and plotted. The number of TUNEL-\n\npositive cells at 10 mM concentration of SsnB were significantly\nhigher in all neuroblastoma cells compared to control (*p,0.005 vs\n\ncontrol; Figure 3A). The TUNEL-positive cells in SsnB (1 mM)\nwere almost similar to DMSO-treated samples (ns = nonsignif-\n\nicant vs control, p.0.05). The representative fluorescence images\n\nfrom SH-SY5Y cells as shown in Figure 3B indicated that SsnB at\n\n10 mM concentration induced DNA fragmentation (green), and\nthe staining for fragmented DNA (TUNEL-positive staining, green\n\nin color) and nuclei (blue) were overlapped in a single cell (as\n\nshown in enlarged image) suggest that SsnB promotes apoptosis in\n\nthese cells. However, such TUNEL-positive cells were not detected\n\nin DMSO- or SsnB (1 mM)-treated cells.\n\nSsnB Activates Caspase-3 in Neuroblastoma Cells\nAt cellular level, mitochondria- or receptor (Fas/FasL)-mediat-\n\ned pathways activate caspase signaling cascade which in turn\n\ninduces DNA damage and initiates programmed cell death\n\n(apoptosis) [40]. To determine whether SsnB-induced cell death\n\nis mediated by caspase activation, we performed Western blotting\n\nas well as immunofluorescence assay to detect active form of\n\ncaspase-3 in neuroblastoma cells treated with SsnB for 2 days (SH-\n\nSY5Y and IMR-32 cells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1\n\nand SK-N-BE(2) cells). The number of cleaved caspase-3 positive\n\ncells (green) were quantitated by ImageJ programme and plotted.\n\nThe bar diagram in Figure 3C demonstrated that SsnB at 10 mM\nsignificantly increased the cleaved caspase-3 positive cells (green)\n\ncompared to DMSO or SsnB (1 mM) treated neuroblastoma cells\n(*p,0.005, SsnB 10 mM vs control). The representative immuno-\nfluorescence images for SH-SY5Y in Figure 3D indicated that the\n\ncolor intensity of cleaved caspase-3 (green) was significantly\n\nincreased in SsnB-treated (10 mM) cells and the cleaved caspase-\n3 fluorescence signals were exclusively present in cytoplasm and\n\ndid not overlap with nucleus (blue). The corresponding Western\n\nblots in Figure 3E demonstrated that the cleaved and active form\n\nof caspase-3 protein bands (17 and 19 kDa) were present in\n\nprotein samples prepared from 10 mM SsnB treated cells (*p,\n0.005, SsnB 10 mM vs control, Figure 3E and F), while proteins\nsamples from DMSO and SsnB (1 mM) had almost undetectable\nlevels of cleaved caspase-3 (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vs\ncontrol; Figure 3E and F). We further examined the activation of\n\ncaspase-3 by SsnB (10 mM) at different time points (6, 12, 24 and\n48 h) in SH-SY5Y cells. The presence of an active form of\n\ncaspase-3 protein band (,19 kDa) showed that SsnB induces\ncleavage of caspase-3 in these cells even as early as 6 h SsnB\n\nexposure (Figure 3G, upper panel). Thus, these data suggest that\n\nSsnB induces apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 in all\n\nneuroblastoma cell lines tested. We also observed increased\n\nexpression of p53 in SsnB (10 mM) treated cells compare to\nDMSO-treated cells (middle panel; Figure 3G). Activation of p53,\n\na tumor suppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2\n\nphase of cell cycle, hence, increased expression of p53 by SsnB\n\nSparstolonin B Exhibits Anticancer Activity\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 May 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 5 | e96343\n\n\n\nsuggested that p53 might also involve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity\n\nin p53-containing neuroblastoma cells.\n\nSsnB Reduces Expression of N-myc in Neuroblastoma\nCells\n\nN-myc proto-oncogene act as a transcription factor, and\n\namplification and overexpression of N-myc gene promotes\n\ntumorigenicity in neuroblastoma cells [41]. We evaluated level\n\nof N-myc proteins from 2 days (IMR-32), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4\n\ndays (SK-N-BE(2) cells) SsnB-treated N-myc amplified neuroblas-\n\ntoma cells by Western blotting, and protein signal intensity was\n\nmeasured by ImageJ programme and plotted. Western blot in\n\nFigure 4A demonstrates that SsnB at 10 mM inhibited the\n\nexpression of N-myc protein in these cell lines (*p,0.005, SsnB\n\n10 mM vs control; Figure 4A and B). However such reduction in\nprotein expression was not observed at 1 mM concentration of\nSsnB (ns = nonsignificant, SsnB 1 mM vs control; Figure 4A and\nB).\n\nN-acetylcystamine (NAC) Attenuates the Inhibitory\nEffects of SsnB in Neuroblastoma Cells\n\nThe reduced cell viability, increased ROS and decreased GSH\n\nlevels by SsnB indicated that depletion of glutathione may be a\n\nprimary cause for the cell death. Next, we examined whether\n\naddition of N-acetylcystamine (NAC), a GSH precursor and an\n\nantioxidant, can protect neuroblastoma cells from SsnB-induced\n\nFigure 2. SsnB induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. ROS levels were evaluated by H2DCFDA staining after SsnB treatments\n(1 mM or 10 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y, IMR-32), 3 days (NGP) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells).

To test this hypothesis, neuroblastoma cells were\n\npretreated with NAC (0.5, 1 and 5 mM) for 1 h followed by\n\ntreatment with SsnB (10 mM) for 2 days (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32\ncells), 3 days (NGP cells) or 4 days (SKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2)\n\ncells), and cell viability was measured by MTT assay. MTT cell\n\nviability assays showed that NAC treatment suppresses SsnB-\n\ninduced cell death in a concentration dependent manner\n\n(Figure 5A). SsnB (10 mM) induced neuroblastoma cell death in\nrange of 40–60% (*p,0.05 vs control) whereas presence of NAC\n\n(1 mM or 5 mM) significantly increased the viability of SsnB-\n\ntreated cells (#p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM alone vs SsnB 10 mM + NAC\n1 or 5 mM). Next we measured the levels of ROS in SsnB-treated\n\ncells preincubated with NAC by fluorometry assay using\n\nH2DCFDA dye. NAC at 1 and 5 mM concentration significantly\n\nreduces ROS levels in SsnB (10 mM) treated neuroblastoma cells\n(#p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM alone vs SsnB 10 mM + NAC 1 or 5 mM;\nFigure 5B). These data suggest that NAC as an ROS scavenger\n\nremoves SsnB-induced generation of reactive oxygen species in\n\ncells.\n\nWe further examined cleaved caspase-3 level in SH-SY5Y cells\n\n(2 days treatment) and SK-N-BE(2) cells (4 days treatment)\n\nincubated with SsnB (10 mM) with or without NAC (0.5, 1 or\n5 mM) by Western blotting.

SsnB-treated neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 for 2 days, NGP for 3 days, and\nSKNF-1 and SK-N-BE(2) cells for 4 days) were used to monitor DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay (A and B), and cleaved caspsase-\n3 by immunofluorescence (C and D), and Western blotting (E and F). DAPI (blue) was used to stain nuclei.

Agarose gel colony\n\nformation assay is an anchorage-independent in vitro cell transfor-\n\nmation assay, and mimics the process of in vivo carcinogenesis [34].\n\nNeuroblastoma cells (N-myc amplified cell, SK-N-BE(2), and N-\n\nmyc nonamplified cell, SH-SY5Y) were grown in agarose in\n\npresence or absence of SsnB (1 mM and 10 mM) and after 45 days\nnumber of colonies were counted. The representative phase\n\ncontrast images in Figure 6A showed that the size of colonies in\n\nSsnB 10 mM treated samples were significantly smaller than the\ncontrol and SsnB (1 mM) treated samples. The representative bar\ndiagram demonstrated that SsnB at 10 mM concentration\nsignificantly inhibited the colony formation capability of both\n\ncells (*p,0.05, SsnB 10 mM vs control; Figure 6B).\nSince SsnB inhibits the formation of neuroblastoma colony in\n\nanchorage-independent agarose gel assay, we further tested if the\n\ninhibitory effects of SsnB inhibit the initiation of neuroblastoma\n\ntumors in hanging drop assay method. In hanging drop assay the\n\ncells under the force of gravity and surface tension start\n\naccumulating at the bottom of the hanging drop and join together\n\nto form a spheroid. Spheroids represent an in vitro 3D tissue\n\nstructure that mimics in vivo tumor tissue organization and\n\nmicroenvironment, and 3D culture better reflect cancer cells in\n\ntheir native, in vivo, environment [35]. As shown in Figure 6C and\n\nD, within 24 hour, both neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells, C;\n\nand SK-N-BE(2) cells, D) grown in hanging drop culture start\n\naggregating at the bottom of the droplet. On day 12, the shape of\n\nthe aggregates became rounder and smoother with a gradual\n\ndecrease in the radius of the spheroid, and form compact cell\n\nclusters in DMSO- and SsnB (1 mM)-treated SH-SY5Y and SK-N-\nBE(2) cells. The decrease in size is the result of higher cell–cell\n\ncohesion, which yields more compact aggregates. However, at\n\n10 mM SsnB concentration the cells are loosely attached in\nspheroids suggesting that SsnB at 10 mM inhibits cell-cell\nattachment in both cell lines (SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2) cells)\n\nas a result these cells are unable to aggregate to form compact\n\nspheroids.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNeuroblastoma has heterogeneous population of cells of\n\ndifferent genetic background [15]. Increasing evidence supports\n\nthat molecular and genetic factors such as N-myc oncogene\n\namplification, deletion of short arm of chromosome 1 and high\n\nexpression of neurotrophin receptors (TrkA and TrkB) are\n\nassociated with malignant transformation and progression of\n\nneuroblastoma. Despite targeting new molecular targets, and the\n\nuse of multimodal therapy which includes surgery, radiotherapy in\n\nconjunction with chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody based\n\nimmunotherapy, approximately 40% of children with high-risk\n\nneuroblastoma remain incurable [23,43,44]. Hence, the identifi-\n\ncation and development of new therapeutic compounds with less\n\ntoxicity are urgently needed.\n\nWe used a novel naturally-occurring compound, Sparstolonin B\n\n(SsnB), isolated from the tubers of an aquatic Chinese herb,\n\nSparganium stoloniferum [1]. The crude extract prepared from this\n\nherb has anti-spasmodic and anti-tumor properties [4–6]. In the\n\npresent study SsnB at 10 mM and above concentrations signifi-\ncantly inhibits the growth and viability of human neuroblastoma\n\ncells of different genetic background such as N-myc amplified with\n\nwild p53 cells (IMR-32 and NGP cells), N-myc amplified with\n\nmutated p53 cells (SKN-BE(2) cell), and N-myc nonamplified cell\n\n(SH-SY5Y and SKNF-1 cells). However, the sensitivity of these\n\ncells towards SsnB is different, SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells are\n\nsensitive, NGP cells are moderate sensitive, and SKNF-1 and SK-\n\nN-BE(2) cells are least sensitive (as shown by cell morphology and\n\nMTT cell viability assays in Figure 1A and B). The reduced\n\nviability by SsnB losses neuroblastoma cells ability to form\n\ncompact spheroids that decreases the tumorigenic potential of\n\nboth N-myc amplified (SK-N-BE(2) cells) and N-myc nonamplified\n\nneuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y cells) tested as seen in hanging\n\ndrop method and anchorage-independent colony formation assay\n\n(Figure 6). These in vitro 3-D culture results further confirmed the\n\nanti-tumorigenic activity of SsnB against human neuroblastoma.\n\nThe SsnB exerts its inhibitory effects only in neuroblastoma cell\n\nlines, and up to ,100 mM concentration SsnB did not exhibits\ncytotoxicity towards various normal non-tumor human cells such\n\nas human monocytic THP-1 cells, phorbol 12-myristate 13-\n\nacetate-differentiated THP-1 macrophages, human umbilical vein\n\nendothelial cells and human aortic smooth muscle cells [1].\n\nThe inhibitory effects of SsnB on cell growth and viability are\n\nresulted from the caspase-mediated cell death (Figure 3C–F).

The presence of apoptotic nuclei in SsnB-\n\ntreated neuroblastoma cells compared to control DMSO-treated\n\ncells (as revealed by TUNEL assay, Figure 3A and B) indicates that\n\nactivation of caspase cascade by SsnB trigger apoptotic cell death\n\npathways. In addition, we also found that SsnB promotes ROS\n\ngeneration in both N-myc amplified and N-myc nonamplified\n\nneuroblastoma cells (Figure 2A–C). The ROS generating capacity\n\nof SsnB was confirmed by our cell-free system in which SsnB in\n\npresence of peroxidase (HRP) oxidized H2DCDA to fluorescent\n\ncompound (Figure 2D and E). Reactive oxygen species such as free\n\nradicals and peroxides increases cellular oxidative stress which\n\npromotes lipids peroxidation and oxidation of nucleic acid and\n\namplifies the cell death. The imbalance between the generation of\n\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant defense status\n\ndisrupt the redox homeostasis [39]. In our present study, we\n\nobserved that SsnB significantly decreased glutathione (GSH) level\n\nin neuroblastoma cells (Figure 2F). GSH acts as an antioxidant\n\nand its role to remove oxidative stress caused by reactive oxygen\n\nspecies is well known hence GSH depletion in presence of SsnB\n\nfail to remove free radicals and this might be the primary cause of\n\nSsnB-induced cytotoxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. The\n\ncritical role of GSH in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity was further\n\nsupported by our observations obtained with N-acetylcystamine\n\n(NAC). NAC is a GSH precursor and functions as an antioxidant.\n\nCo-incubation of NAC removes free radicals from the SsnB-\n\ntreated cells and inhibits the activation of cleaved caspase-3\n\n(Figure 5B–D). These events thus protect the cells against the\n\noxidative insults caused by SsnB and increased the cell viability\n\n(Figure 5A). Hence these data suggest that SsnB-induced cytotoxic\n\nFigure 5.

The cell cycle arrest at\n\nG2/M transition is a potential target for cancer therapy as it\n\nprevents DNA-damaged cells from entering mitosis, and cell cycle\n\nblockage at this checkpoint is carried out by cell cycle-related\n\nproteins such as p53 and cyclins. Activation of p53, a tumor\n\nsuppressor protein, leads to growth arrest at G1 or G2 phase of cell\n\ncycle [46]. The results in present study demonstrate that treating\n\nneuroblastoma cells with SsnB (10 mM) resulted in cell cycle block\nin G2/M phase (flow cytometry analysis, Figure 1C) and increase\n\nin expression of p53 compared to DMSO treated cells (Figure 3G).\n\nThese findings suggested that p53-mediated apoptosis might also\n\ninvolve in SsnB-induced cytotoxicity in p53-containing neuroblas-\n\ntoma cells.\n\nIt is well known that N-myc amplification is associated with\n\nneuroblastoma tumor progression and drug resistance [41,47]. N-\n\nmyc, a member of the myc family of proto-oncoprotein, acts as a\n\ntranscription factor and regulates the expression of genes involved\n\nin cell cycle, DNA damage and apoptosis, and overexpression of\n\nN-myc in trasnsgenic mice results in neuroblastoma development\n\n[48]. However, downregulation of N-myc expression has been\n\nshown to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in neuroblastoma\n\ncells [49,50]. In the current study, we found that SsnB at 10 mM\nconcentration suppresses the N-myc expression in IMR-32, NGP\n\nand SK-N-BE(2) cells (Figure 4) which might be correlated with\n\nthe SsnB-mediated anticancer activity on human neuroblastoma\n\ncells.\n\nIn summary, the present study for the first time demonstrated\n\nthe anticancer property of SsnB on human neuroblastoma cells.\n\nSsnB induces apoptosis in a wide range of neuroblastoma cell lines.\n\nThe reduced tumorigenic ability of both N-myc amplified and N-\n\nmyc nonamplified cells resulted from SsnB in our colony\n\nformation and hanging drop assays, and a recent published study\n\nshowing that SsnB exerts anti-angiogenic property by downreg-\n\nulating mRNA level of cell cycle regulatory proteins [3] indicated\n\nthat SsnB can be a used as a novel therapeutics anticancer agent.\n\nDrugs that generate ROS and induce apoptosis are used alone or\n\nin combination with other therapies to treat cancer, suggesting\n\nthat SsnB can be a promising antitumor agent for neuroblastoma\n\nand requires preclinical studies on animal models [51].\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: AK USS.
