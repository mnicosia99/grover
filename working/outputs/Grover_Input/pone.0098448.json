migration of\nglioma and endothelial cells, a key process in tumorigenesis and angiogenesis during cancer progression. C6 glioma and\nhuman microvascular endothelial cells were treated with conditioned medium from cultures of glioma cells irradiated at a\nrange of doses and the migration of both cell types, tube formation by endothelial cells, as well as the expression and\nsecretion of migration-related proteins were evaluated. Exposure to X-ray radiation-conditioned medium induced dose-\ndependent increases in cell migration and tube formation, which were accompanied by an upregulation of vascular\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 expression. However, glioma cells treated with\nconditioned medium of cells irradiated at a carbon ion dose of 4.0 Gy showed a marked decrease in migratory potential and\nVEGF secretion relative to non-irradiated cells. The application of recombinant VEGF165 stimulated migration in glioma and\nendothelial cells, which was associated with increased FAK phosphorylation at Tyr861, suggesting that the suppression of\ncell migration by carbon ion radiation could be via VEGF-activated FAK signaling. Taken together, these findings indicate\nthat carbon ion may be superior to X-ray radiation for inhibiting tumorigenesis and angiogenesis through modulation of\nVEGF level in the glioma microenvironment.\n\nCitation: Liu Y, Liu Y, Sun C, Gan L, Zhang L, et al.

Radiotherapy, a standard adjuvant\n\nto surgery, improves survival rates in patients, but resistance to\n\ntreatment by some gliomas limits the success of clinical application\n\n[2].\n\nHigh linear energy transfer (LET) heavy ions such as carbon\n\nions have attracted attention as alternatives to conventional\n\nradiation for radiotherapy—particularly for tumors that are\n\nradiation-resistant under hypoxic conditions—owing to their\n\nsuperior physical characteristics and high lethality for tumor cells\n\ncompared to low-LET radiation such as X- and c-rays [3–4]. Our\nown studies have shown that carbon ion radiotherapy offers a high\n\ndegree of control for targeting tumors and increases progression-\n\nfree survival rates without significant radiation-induced toxicity in\n\nskin carcinoma patients [5].\n\nEmerging evidence indicates that the tumor microenvironment\n\ncontributes to radiation resistance [6] by regulating the levels of\n\ncytokines and growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth\n\nfactor (VEGF) [7], epidermal growth factor (EGF) [8], hepatocyte growth\n\nfactor (HGF) [9], and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) [10], and\n\npromoting extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloprotei-\n\nnases (MMPs) [11].\n\nDue to the scarcity of particle accelerators that can produce\n\nheavy ion radiation, it has not yet been established whether carbon\n\nions can modify the glioma microenvironment and affect the\n\nmigratory behavior of cells during tumor progression and\n\nmetastasis. To address this question, the present study evaluated\n\nthe contribution of carbon ion radiation to the motility of glioma\n\nand endothelial cells using tumor-conditioned culture medium as\n\nan inducer.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell culture techniques\nC6 glioma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were\n\ngrown in Ham’s F-12 media (Gibco, Invitrogen Crop, USA)\n\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone,\n\nChina). Human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1, Amer-\n\nican Type Culture Collection) were grown in a modified MCDB\n\n131 (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO, USA) medium containing\n\n20% FBS and 1.0 mg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng/ml\nhuman epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma). All cells were\n\ncultured in 5% CO2 in humidified air at 37uC.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0098448&domain=pdf\n\n\nIrradiation Procedure\nC6 glioma cells were irradiated by heavy ion beams and X-rays.\n\nCarbon ion irradiation was performed by the equipment at the\n\nHeavy Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL-CSR, Institute\n\nof Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou,\n\nChina). Glioma cells were exposed to carbon ion irradiation at\n\nenergy 350 MeV u\n21\n\nand LET 15.4 keV mm21, with a dose rate\nof 0.5 Gy min\n\n21\n. X-rays were from a cabinet X-ray irradiation\n\nsystem (100 kpv, 3 mA, beryllium window thickness 0.76 mm,\n\nFaxitron X-ray corp.). The dose rate was set to about 1.3 Gy/min.\n\nThe film-to-source distance was set to 40.6 cm. Glioblastoma cells\n\nwere irradiated with 0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0 Gy.\n\nTumor cell conditioned medium (TCM) and Irradiated\nconditioned medium (ICM) preparation\n\nTo generate TCM, C6 glioma cells were seeded at a density of\n\n56105 cells/25 cm2 culture flasks. At 90% confluence of cell\nmonolayer, culture medium was discarded to remove growth\n\nfactors. Thereafter, cells were rinsed with saline solution and fed\n\nwith fresh serum-free medium. TCM were collected from sham-\n\nirradiated cells considered as control conditioned medium. To\n\nobtain the ICM, cells were irradiated with carbon ion beams or X-\n\nrays under sterile conditions. And then irradiated cells were\n\nimmediately rinsed three times with saline solution and fed with\n\nfresh serum-free medium. After 24 h of incubation, the superna-\n\ntants was harvested and centrifuged at 20006g for 15 min and\npassed through a 0.22 mm filter to remove cells and cell debris.\nThis supernatant was stocked in 1.5 ml tubes and kept at 280uC.\n\nTranswell migration assays\nThe in vitro cell migration assays were performed by using a\n\nmodified Boyden chamber inserted with polyethylene terephthal-\n\nate filter membrane containing 8 mm pores in 24-well plates\n(Millipore, Milan, Italy). The upper chamber contained C6 glioma\n\ncells or HMEC-1 cells in serum-free culture medium, and the\n\nlower chamber contained TCM or ICM. After 24 h of incubation,\n\nmigrated cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 1 h and then\n\nstained with Giemsa stain (Sigma) for 10 min and images were\n\nprocessed using AxioVs40 software (Ver. 4.8.0.0, Carl Zeiss,\n\nGermany). Data were obtained by measuring ten randomly\n\nselected fields of transwell-migrated cells using Image-Pro Plus 6.0\n\nsoftware (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).\n\nGene expression analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted form glioma cells at 24 h after carbon\n\nion or X-ray irradiation using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen Life\n\nTechnologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufactur-\n\ner’s instructions. The cDNA was synthesized from 1 mg total RNA\nusing RT reagent kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara, Tokyo, Japan)\n\nfollowing the manufacturer’s protocols. Real-time polymerase\n\nchain reaction (quantitative PCR) was carried out the SYBR\n\nPremix EX Taq II kit (Takara, China) on an FTC-3000+\ninstrument (Funglyn Biotech INC, Toronto, ON, Canada). Gene\n\nexpression was detected using qPCR primers for VEGF and b-\nactin which was used to normalize the mRNA and cDNA quantity\n\nand quality. Sequences of the primers are as follows: VEGF sense,\n\n59-GATCATGCGGATCAAACCTCACC-39, and antisense, 59-\n\nCCTCCGGACCCAAAGTGCTC-39; b-actin sense, 59-\nTGAGCGCAAGTACTCTGTGTGGAT-39, and antisense, 59-\n\nTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGCACGATG-39. The PCR program\n\nwas denatured at 95uC for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for\n5 s, 60uC for 30 s. The fold changes of gene expression of the\ntreatment groups were calculated by the 2\n\n-DDCt\nmethod [12].\n\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay\nThe LDH leakage was determined by using commercially\n\navailable kits (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China). The\n\ncells were washed twice with PBS and then lysed to release the\n\nintracellular LDH into the new supernatant at 24 h after exposure\n\nto radiation. The supernatant (120 ml) was mixed with 60 ml of\nLDH reagent solution, sheltered from light and incubated at room\n\ntemperature for 30 min. The LDH activity of the medium (LDH\n\nmedium) and the cell lysate (LDH cells) were determined using a\n\ncolorimetric assay at an absorbance wavelength of 490 nm and a\n\nreference wavelength of 630 nm using an Infinite M200 micro-\n\nplate reader (TECAN, Switzerland). The measured LDH activities\n\nwere calculated by percentage of LDH released in the supernatant\n\nto that of cell lysates from intact cells (% LDH released).\n\nWound-healing assay\nCells were seeded in a six-well plate at a concentration of 56105\n\nper well and allowed to form a confluent monolayer. The layer of\n\ncells was scratched with a 1000 ml micropipette tip. Cells were\nthen washed twice with fresh medium and replaced with TCM or\n\nICM. Cells migrated into the wounded area, and photographs\n\nwere taken immediately (0 h) and 24 h. The ability of cell motility\n\nwas calculated by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software (Media Cybernet-\n\nics, Silver Spring, MD, USA) in the following way: the area\n\ncovered by the migrating cells (24 h)/the wound area (0 h).\n\nTube formation assay\n96-well plates were coated with 60 ml of Matrigel (BD\n\nBiosciences, San Jose, CA) and allowed to solidify at 37uC for\n1 h. After the Matrigel solidified, HMEC-1 endothelial cells\n\n(86105 cells/ml) were added in 200 ml of TCM or ICM. The cells\nwere incubated at 37uC with humidified 95% air/ 5% CO2 for\n8 h and photographed with the Carl Zeiss. Five randomly selected\n\nmicroscopic tube length was assayed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0\n\nsoftware (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD, USA).\n\nCytokine protein quantification\nWe measured tumor-derived secreted cytokines according to the\n\nmanufacturer’s instructions. VEGF (ExCell Biology, Inc., Shang-\n\nhai, China), MMP-2 and MMP-9 (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,\n\nChina) in the TCM or ICM of C6 glioma cells were detected by\n\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein sample preparation was basically performed as previ-\n\nously described [13]. Protein samples were load onto 10%\n\nacrylamide gels for Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel\n\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then the proteins were trans-\n\nferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore Corpo-\n\nration, USA). The membrane was blocked and subsequently\n\nincubated with anti-phospho-FAK antibody (Tyr861, Cell Signal-\n\ning Technology, MA, USA) and anti-b-actin antibody (Santa Cruz\nBiotechnology Inc., USA). Secondary probes were detected by\n\nECL Western blot detection reagents (GE Healthcare, USA). And\n\nthe images were captured and analyzed by a FluorChem 2\n\nimaging system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA, USA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe results were expressed as means 6 standard error of the\n\nmean (SEM). Multiple comparisons were performed using one-\n\nway ANOVA followed by LSD as a post-hoc test. Statistical\n\ndifferences between the two groups were analyzed by Student’s t-\n\nCarbon Ion Radiation Inhibits Cell Migration\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e98448\n\n\n\ntest. A p-value less than 0.05 was selected as a criterion for a\n\nstatistically significant difference.\n\nResults\n\nCancer cell migration and invasion into adjacent tissues, and\n\nintravasation into blood/lymphatic vessels are key events in\n\nmalignant tumor progression. To investigate the effect of radiation\n\non these processes, glioma and endothelial cells were treated with\n\nconditioned media from glioma cell cultures exposed to varying\n\ndoses of radiation. Tumor-conditioned media from cultures\n\nexposed to carbon ion radiation suppressed migration by 11.8%\n\nat 2.0 Gy and 17.4% at 4.0 Gy compared to control cells treated\n\nwith medium from unirradiated cultures after 24 h of exposure\n\n(Fig. 1A). In contrast, cell migration was markedly enhanced when\n\nmedia from X-ray-irradiated cultures was used as a chemoat-\n\ntractant (Fig. 1B).\n\nEndothelial cell migration is essential for angiogenesis, a process\n\nthat is closely associated with tumorigenesis and cancer progres-\n\nsion. HMEC-1 cells incubated with conditioned media from\n\ncarbon ion-irradiated cultures showed a decrease in migration at\n\n4.0 Gy compared to controls (Fig. 2A, C), while in cells incubated\n\nwith media from X-ray-irradiated cultures, a dose-dependent\n\nincrease in migration was observed compared to control cells\n\n(Fig. 2B).\n\nIn later stages of angiogenesis, endothelial cells self-assemble\n\ninto tubes to form new blood vessels. To investigate the effect of\n\nradiation on neovascularization, HMEC-1 cells were cultured on\n\nMatrigel-coated plates in the conditioned media. After an 8 h\n\nincubation, control cells formed tubular structures (Fig. 3A, B).\n\nCells cultured in media from X-ray-irradiated glioma cell cultures\n\nformed a greater number of capillary-like structures than control\n\ncells (Fig. 3B); however, cells exposed to media from heavy ion-\n\nirradiated cells formed fewer tubules than controls (Fig. 3C).\n\nVEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels in conditioned media from\n\ncultures of glioma cells treated with varying doses of X-ray or\n\ncarbon ion radiation were evaluated by ELISA. All three proteins\n\nwere present at higher levels in the media of X-ray-irradiated\n\ncultures than in unirradiated cell culture medium (Fig. 4). There\n\nwere no differences in the secretion of MMP-2 and -9 between\n\ncarbon ion-irradiated cells and controls; however, VEGF concen-\n\ntration was 17.5% lower in the medium of cells irradiated with\n\ncarbon ion at 4.0 Gy compared to the control culture (Fig. 4A).\n\nTo determine whether the altered levels of VEGF protein in\n\ntumor-conditioned media were due to transcriptional upregula-\n\ntion, the VEGF mRNA level in glioma cells was assessed by RT-\n\nFigure 1.

VEGF transcript levels in the 2.0, 4.0,\n\nand 8.0 Gy X-ray radiation groups were higher by approximately\n\n1.44-, 1.79-, and 2.66-fold relative to the control group (Fig. 5A).\n\nIn contrast, exposure to carbon ion radiation resulted in the\n\ndownregulation of VEGF gene expression at 4.0 (0.4660.09) and\n\n8.0 Gy (0.4860.09). LDH is a sensitive indicator of the metabolic\n\nstate of cells, and is rapidly released into the culture medium upon\n\ndamage to the plasma membrane. Irradiated glioma cells had\n\nhigher LDH activity in the medium compared to unirradiated\n\ncontrol cells (Fig. 5B). Notably, cells exposed to 8.0 Gy carbon ion\n\nradiation had increased LDH in the medium compared to those\n\nexposed to the lower doses of 2.0 and 4.0 Gy, indicating that\n\nhigher carbon ion radiation doses produced greater plasma\n\nmembrane damage.\n\nTo examine the functional significance of altered VEGF level in\n\nthe culture medium of irradiated tumor cells, conditioned media\n\nwere supplemented with recombinant VEGF165 (50 ng/ml) and\n\nthe effect on cell migration was evaluated by wound-healing assay.\n\nThe migration of HMEC-1 and C6 glioma cells was increased by\n\n1.31- and 1.58-fold, respectively, in the presence of VEGF165\n\n(Fig. 6C). Moreover, after a 4 h incubation in media from carbon\n\nion-irradiated cell cultures supplemented with VEGF165, both cell\n\ntypes showed increases in levels of phosphorylated FAK (Y861)\n\n(Fig. 6D).\n\nDiscussion\n\nRadiotherapy with or without surgery is a standard treatment\n\nfor malignant gliomas [14]. However, tumor cell responses to\n\nradiation are complex, with evidence suggesting that radiation\n\nfrom X- and c-rays not only cause the death of tumor cells, but\ncan alternatively lead to the emergence of greater aggressivity and\n\nmalignancy, allowing cells to escape the lethal effects of radiation\n\nand remain resistant to conventional therapy [15–16].\n\nHeavy ion radiation therapy has shown promise for the\n\ntreatment of head and neck cancers—even those that are resistant\n\nto standard radiation by directly targeting the DNA of tumor cells\n\n[17–18]. In the present study, the effects of high LET carbon ion\n\nand low LET X-ray radiation on glioma and endothelial cell\n\nmigration were compared, using tumor-conditioned medium as an\n\ninducer. Media from cultures of C6 glioma cells exposed to 2.0 or\n\n4.0 Gy carbon ion radiation suppressed migration of both cell\n\ntypes (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting that irradiation with heavy ions\n\ncan potentially attenuate the growth and metastasis of glioblasto-\n\nmas. In addition, the formation of endothelial cell tubules was\n\ninhibited upon incubation with the same conditioned medium\n\n(Fig. 3), implying that angiogenesis can be similarly blocked.\n\nCarbon ion radiation has been shown to suppress migration and\n\nthe formation of capillary-like tube structures in ECV304 and\n\nhuman umbilical vascular endothelial cells at a dose of 0.1 Gy\n\nFigure 2.

In contrast, conditioned media from tumor cells exposed to\n\nX-ray radiation stimulated cell migration and tube formation,\n\nconsistent with previous findings [20]. The migration and invasion\n\nof glioma cells into surrounding normal brain tissue and blood\n\nvessels contributes to the limited responsiveness of gliomas to\n\nconventional radiation treatments [21–22]. Thus, for resistant\n\ntumors, carbon ions can offer greater therapeutic effectiveness\n\ncompared to X-rays owing to the superior physical properties of\n\nhigh LET particles that transfer a greater amount of energy per\n\nunit length of track, which consequently increases the spatial\n\ndensity of energy deposition events [23].\n\nThe tumor microenvironment is dynamic and can be altered by\n\nradiation treatment. In accordance with earlier studies [20,24–25],\n\nthe present data showed that X-ray radiation enhanced the\n\nsecretion of VEGF, a potent angiogenic growth factor [26], as well\n\nas that of MMP-2 and -9, which degrade the basement membrane\n\nand extracellular matrix during tumor cell invasion and metastasis\n\n[27]. In contrast, VEGF and MMP-2 and -9 levels were not\n\nsignificantly increased by carbon ion radiation; indeed, VEGF\n\nsecretion was reduced at 4.0 Gy (Fig. 4), implying that carbon ions\n\nmay suppress glioblastoma angiogenicity and tumorigenicity by\n\nmodulating VEGF production and release into the tumor\n\nmicroenvironment. However, the secreted VEGF induced by\n\ncarbon ion radiation was not dose-dependent, and reached a\n\nminimum at 4.0 Gy. One explanation for this observation is that\n\nthe expression of pro-angiogenic genes and disruption of tumor\n\ncell membrane integrity are largely determined by growth factor\n\nsecretion. Thus, although VEGF transcript expression was\n\nsuppressed at 4.0 and 8.0 Gy carbon ion radiation, the increase\n\nin the permeability of the cell membrane as reflected by LDH\n\nactivity in the culture medium was more obvious at 8.0 Gy,\n\nbecause damage to the plasma membrane at the higher radiation\n\ndose resulted in the release of proteins into the medium.\n\nTherefore, in view of the combined effects of above-mentioned\n\nfactors, the minimum production of VEGF in the conditioned\n\nmedium was exhibited at 4.0 Gy carbon-ion radiation group.\n\nTo identify the mechanism by which carbon ion radiation-\n\ninduced VEGF stimulates cell motility, cells were treated with\n\nrecombinant VEGF165 and the phosphorylation status of the\n\ndownstream factor FAK was examined. FAK is a non-receptor\n\ntyrosine kinase present at cell-cell contacts that is involved in\n\nintegrin-mediated signal transduction [28], and tyrosine phos-\n\nphorylation of FAK is required for cell migration [29–30]; VEGF\n\ninduces FAK phosphorylation at Y397, Y407, and Y861 [31–32].\n\nHere, the application of exogenous VEGF increased migration in\n\nendothelial and glioma cells concomitant with increased FAK\n\nphosphorylation at Y861 (Fig. 6), indicating that carbon ion\n\nradiation may promote the metastatic and angiogenic potential of\n\ntumors through VEGF/FAK signaling.\n\nIn summary, the present results demonstrate that high-LET\n\ncarbon ion radiation is superior to low-LET X-rays for suppressing\n\nthe migration of glioma and endothelial cells, and thus inhibiting\n\ntumorigenesis and angiogenesis via regulation of VEGF-mediated\n\nsignaling in the tumor microenvironment. These findings provide\n\nevidence in favor of carbon ion over X-ray radiation for the\n\ntreatment of tumors that are resistant to conventional radiother-\n\nFigure 3.
