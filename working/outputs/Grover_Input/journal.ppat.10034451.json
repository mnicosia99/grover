of the components for mounting this type of immunological memory is\nnot well known. We identified an extracellular subtilase from Arabidopsis, SBT3.3, the overexpression of which enhances\ninnate immune responses while the loss of function compromises them. SBT3.3 expression initiates a durable autoinduction\nmechanism that promotes chromatin remodeling and activates a salicylic acid(SA)-dependent mechanism of priming of\ndefense genes for amplified response. Moreover, SBT3.3 expression-sensitized plants for enhanced expression of the OXI1\nkinase gene and activation of MAP kinases following pathogen attack, providing additional clues for the regulation of\nimmune priming by SBT3.3. Conversely, in sbt3.3 mutant plants pathogen-mediated induction of SA-related defense gene\nexpression is drastically reduced and activation of MAP kinases inhibited. Moreover, chromatin remodeling of defense-\nrelated genes normally associated with activation of an immune priming response appear inhibited in sbt3.3 plants, further\nindicating the importance of the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase in the establishment of immune priming. Our results also\npoint to an epigenetic control in the regulation of plant immunity, since SBT3.3 is up-regulated and priming activated when\nepigenetic control is impeded. SBT3.3 represents a new regulator of primed immunity.\n\nCitation: Ramı́rez V, López A, Mauch-Mani B, Gil MJ, Vera P (2013) An Extracellular Subtilase Switch for Immune Priming in Arabidopsis.

They counteract microbial infections via activa-\n\ntion of an innate immune system in a timely, accurate, and\n\neffective manner following pathogen recognition. The innate\n\nimmune response is thought to act naı̈vely to individual pathogen\n\nencounters and is dependent on the recognition of broadly\n\nconserved molecular features, known as microbe-associated\n\nmolecular patterns (MAMPs), by plasma membrane proteins\n\nknown as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). PRR perception of\n\nMAMPs at the cell surface leads to a pattern-triggered immune\n\nresponse called PTI [1]. PTI is characterized by the rapid\n\ngeneration of ion fluxes, production of reactive oxygen species\n\n(ROS), phosphorylation cascades, and a transcriptional repro-\n\ngraming that favors defense responses over routine cellular\n\nrequirements [2]. The defense programme is ultimately controlled\n\nthrough the build-up of specific signalling hormone blends, of\n\nwhich salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are particularly\n\nimportant, and eventually establish a broad systemic alert state\n\nthroughout the plant.\n\nPlants develop heightened activation of the innate immune\n\nresponse state resulting from the initial infection manifested in the\n\nform of enhanced resistance to subsequent infections by a broad\n\nspectrum of pathogens. This type of induced resistance (IR) or\n\ncross-protection exhibits memory characteristics after the first\n\nencounter with a pathogen - training effect - and appears\n\nevolutionarily conserved, even outside the plant kingdom. Netea\n\net al. [3] coined the term ‘‘trained immunity’’ to differentiate it\n\nfrom ‘‘innate immunity’’ (as it is induced only secondarily in hosts\n\nthat have previously encountered a primary infection), or from\n\n‘‘adaptive immunity’’ (as this implies specificity through T and B\n\ncells). In plants, two distinct types of this resistance form have been\n\ndescribed: systemic acquired resistance (SAR), and induced\n\nsystemic resistance (ISR) [4,5]; both represent a functional\n\nimmune acclimation requiring the defense response regulator\n\nNPR1.\n\nParticularly relevant in IR responses is the observation that\n\ndefence genes, in both the local (infected) and distal tissue, respond\n\nto much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more rapid and\n\nrobust manner than controls, thus revealing a ‘‘priming’’\n\nphenomenon. In fact, priming has long been known as a\n\ncomponent of IR responses in plants [6,7] and mammals [8–10],\n\nand more recently in invertebrates, which like plants lack adaptive\n\nimmunity [11]. Similarly, Arabidopsis mutants attenuated in\n\npathogen defense (i.e. npr1) are also compromised in priming\n\n[12,13]. Organic and inorganic compounds can also induce this\n\nform of resistance in plants [14]. Among these, azelaic acid [15],\n\nSA, and its functional analogue benzo(1,2,3)thiadiazole-7-car-\n\nbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) [16], or the non-protein amino\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\nacid b-aminobutyric acid (BABA) [17] have attracted marked\ninterest as they potentiate pathogen-specific defense mechanisms,\n\nand induction of a primed state. However, very little is known\n\nabout the molecular mechanism(s) and signals that set a priming\n\nstate in motion, or the identity of molecular components that\n\npertain to the maintenance of a long lasting immune primed state,\n\nsuch as SAR.\n\nConrath et al. [18] hypothesized that IR or cell priming could be\n\nbuilt on the accumulation of dormant or inactive signalling\n\nproteins, integral in signal amplification that becomes operative\n\nfollowing a challenge with another pathogen, thereby initiating\n\nsignal amplification leading to a faster and stronger activation of\n\ndefense responses. However, the identity of such signalling\n\ncomponents remains elusive. Interestingly, Beckers et al. [12] have\n\nshown that during development of BTH induced resistance in\n\nArabidopsis, priming is associated with accumulation of inactive\n\nproteins of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MPKs), MPK3 and\n\nMPK6. Exposure to the challenges of biotic and abiotic stressors\n\nresults in stronger activation of the two kinases in primed plants\n\nrelative to non-primed plants, which is linked to enhanced defense\n\ngene expression. Priming of defense gene expression was reduced\n\nin mpk3 or mpk6 mutants, showing that pre-stress deposition of a\n\nMPK cascade is a critical step in priming plants for a full defense\n\nresponse induction during IR [12].\n\nEssential IR response components must rely in a plant’s\n\ncapacity to reprogram gene expression. Among the mechanisms\n\ninvolved in immune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the\n\nimportance of chromatin remodeling and covalent histone\n\nmodifications is emerging [19]. Jaskiewicz et al. [20], reported\n\nthat during primed BTH immunity, increased acetylation of\n\nhistone H3 at Lys-9 (H3K9ac) and trimethylation of histone H3 at\n\nLys-4 (H3K4me3) was detected at promoter regions of several SA-\n\nresponsive genes encoding transcription factors (i.e. WRKY6,\n\nWRKY29, and WRKY52). Similarly, constitutively increased\n\nH3K4me3 and H3K9ac mark setting in chromatin of the SA-\n\ndependent PR1 gene was initially reported in sni1 (suppressor of nrp1-\n\n1, inducible 1) mutant [21]. The settling of these histone\n\nmodifications lead chromatin into a suitable state for efficient\n\nSA-responsive gene induction when needed. The results also\n\nindicated a causal link between priming and chromatin remod-\n\neling, pointing to a histone memory for information storage in the\n\nplant stress responses [19]. On the other hand RNA Polymerase V\n\nis an enzyme critical in the epigenetic RNA-directed DNA\n\nmethylation (RdDM) pathway and is involved in regulating both\n\nDNA methylation and histone modifications [22]. In this context,\n\nLópez et al. [23] reported that RNA Polymerase V defective\n\nmutants carry a constitutive priming phenotype where SA-related\n\ndefense genes are poised for enhanced activation via similar\n\nH3K4me3 and H3K9ac histone modifications in their promoters.\n\nThese results emphasized the importance of epigenetic control as\n\nan additional layer of complexity in plant immunity and IR\n\nregulation [23]. Furthermore, DNA methylation has been\n\nimplicated in the transmission of a priming state or stress memory,\n\nendowing progeny of pathogen-inoculated plants with heightened\n\nresistance (transgenerational IR), suggesting plants can inherit\n\npriming sensitization [24,25].\n\nIn the present study, we report on identification and charac-\n\nterization of the inducible Arabidopsis subtilase SBT3.3 to\n\ncharacterize additional cellular components mediating initiation\n\nand or/maintenance of primed immunity. This extracellular\n\nproteolytic enzyme serves a signaling role in establishing immune\n\npriming. The mechanism subsequently activates chromatin\n\nremodeling and defense genes become poised for enhanced\n\nactivation following pathogen attack. Our study provides strong\n\nevidence that SBT3.3 is a primary switch in immune priming, and\n\nit may represent one of the missing components in systemic IR\n\nestablishment.\n\nResults\n\nThe Arabidopsis subtilase gene SBT3.3 is up-regulated in\nthe csb3 mutant\n\nThe Arabidopsis enhanced disease resistance csb3 (constitutive\n\nsubtilisin3) mutant [26] was isolated during a search for negative\n\ndisease resistance regulators in a mutant screening that evaluated\n\nconstitutive expression of GUS activity driven by the 59 promoter\n\nregion of a pathogen-induced subtilase gene (P69C) from tomato\n\nplants [27]. Arabidopsis possess fifty-six highly similar genes\n\nencoding subtilases [28], therefore constitutive expression of the\n\nArabidopsis gene homologous to P69C would be similarly up-\n\nregulated in the csb3 mutant. Constitutively expressed genes\n\ndifferentially expressed in the csb3 mutant with respect to wild-type\n\nplants were identified by microarray analysis of RNA transcripts\n\nusing ATH1 Affymetrix chips. The microarray analysis (NCBI\n\nGEO Series number GSE35507) identified one hundred down-\n\nregulated genes and 367 up-regulated genes in the csb3 mutant\n\n(Supplemental Table S1 and Figure S1). Among the genes up-\n\nregulated $2-fold (p values,0.05) in the csb3 mutant, we\n\nidentified 23 genes that could be linked to disease resistance and\n\nSA-mediated responses based on published results (Supplemental\n\nTable S2). It was notable that among them one encoded a\n\nsubtilase: SBT3.3 (At1g32960). Moreover, public microarray data\n\nmining showed that SBT3.3, out of the 56 paralogous subtilases\n\nfrom Arabidopsis, with the exception of At1g32940, is the one\n\nshowing strongest response to pathogen attack and to pathogen-\n\nrelated stress signals (Supplementary Figure S2).\n\nCoincident with what has been described in the tomato\n\ngenome, where the P69C subtilase clusters with three additional\n\nP69C-like ORFs (i.e. P69A, P69D, P69C, and P69B) [29], the\n\nSBT3.3 subtilase gene was similarly embedded in a genomic\n\ncluster encompassing three additional subtilases (i.e. SBT3.5,\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nFollowing a first encounter with a pathogen, higher\neukaryotes develop enhanced resistance to subsequent\ninfections by a broad spectrum of pathogens. This type of\ninduced resistance (IR) exhibits memory characteristics\nafter the first encounter with a pathogen —training\neffect— and appears evolutionarily conserved. IR response\ncomponents must reside in a plant’s capacity to reprogram\ngene expression. Among the mechanisms involved in\nimmune-related transcriptional reprogramming, the im-\nportance of chromatin remodelling is emerging. Recent\nstudies indicated a causal link between priming and\nchromatin remodelling, pointing to a histone memory for\ninformation storage in the plant immune response. These\nresults emphasized the importance of epigenetic control\nas an additional layer of complexity in plant immunity.\nHowever, the nature of the components for activating this\ntype of immunological memory remains elusive. Here, in a\nsearch aiming to identify cellular factors integral in\nregulating immunity in Arabidopsis, we found that the\nSBT3.3 gene, encoding an extracellular subtilase enzyme, is\npivotal for establishing plant immune priming. Moreover,\nbased on molecular and genetic evidences, our results\nindicate that SBT3.3 expression is under epigenetic control\nthus highlighting the importance of this mechanism of\ngene regulation in the control of plant immunity and IR.\n\nSBT3.3 and Immune Priming\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\nSBT3.4, SBT3.3 and SBT3.2) in Chromosome 1 (Fig. 1A). Thus, it\n\nseems very likely that the Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase, could\n\nrepresent the evolutionarily conserved ortholog of the P69C\n\nsubtilase from tomato, and the promoter activation was the clue\n\nfor identifying the csb3 mutant.\n\nThe SBT3.3 gene encodes a 777 amino acid preproenzyme\n\n(Fig. 1B and Supplemental Figure S3) containing a N-terminal 25\n\namino acid signal peptide followed by an 86-amino acid\n\npropolypeptide (aa 26 to 111), and a 666-amino acid mature\n\npolypeptide with a predicted molecular weight of 71237 Da. The\n\nmature polypeptide comprises eight potential asparagine-linked\n\nglycosylation sites (NXS/T). On the basis of sequence similarities\n\nwith other subtilases, including P69C [30], the amino acid residues\n\nSer-555, Asp-145, and His-223 were identified as residues of the\n\ncatalytic triad (Fig. 1B).\n\nExpression pattern of SBT3.3 following pathogen\ninoculation\n\nTo mode of SBT3.3 gene regulation in plant immunity was\n\nassessed by inoculating Col-0 leaves with the bacterial pathogen\n\nPseudomonas syringae DC3000 (PsDC3000), carrying or not the\n\navirulence gene AvrRpm1, and temporal gene expression patterns\n\nwere determined by quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). SBT3.3\n\nwas barely detectable in mock-inoculated plants, but strongly\n\ninduced during the PsDC3000 immune response (Fig. 1C).\n\nHowever, inconsistent with observations for SA-regulated\n\nmarker genes (i.e. PR-1 and PR-2), SBT3.3 induction was\n\ntransient, peaking at 48 hpi (hours post inoculation) and\n\nabruptly decaying thereafter. The strongest induction was\n\nobserved following inoculation with the avirulent strain\n\nPsDC3000 (AvrRpm1) (Figure 1C); induction was again transient,\n\npeaking at 12 h.p.i, and decayed thereafter. SBT3.3 expression\n\npreceded PR-1 and PR-2 gene induction, suggesting that the\n\nsignals that set in motion transcriptional reprogramming of\n\nthese two types of gene responses might differ. Expression of PR-\n\n1 and PR-2 genes in the distal non-inoculated leaves was also\n\nobserved for SBT3.3, although distal expression was not as high\n\nas that attained in local leaves (Fig. 1C). High and rapid (within\n\nan hour) induced SBT3.3 expression was also promoted by\n\nbacterial PAMP flg22 application to Col-0 plants (Supplemental\n\nFig. S4), providing additional support for the association\n\nof SBT3.3 expression with early innate immune response\n\nactivation.\n\nSBT3.3 functions in disease resistance\nThe importance of SBT3.3 in plant immunity was investi-\n\ngated by characterizing the response of two independent T-\n\nDNA insertion lines for SBT3.3 (sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2; Fig. 1A)\n\nto PsDC3000 infection (Fig. 2A). We also characterized the\n\nresponse of two independent T-DNA lines available for one of\n\nthe linked subtilase genes (i.e. SBT3.4) within the same genomic\n\ncluster (sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2; Fig. 1A). The enhanced disease\n\nsusceptibility mutant npr1-1 was incorporated into the experi-\n\nments as a control. Disease performance was assayed by\n\nmeasuring bacterial growth in the inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A).\n\nThe two control mutant lines, sbt3.4-1 and sbt3.4-2 behaved as\n\ninoculated Col-0 plants, indicating that SBT3.4 is not essential\n\nto activate immune responses. However, npr1 plants, and either\n\none of the two sbt3.3 mutants, supported significant increases in\n\nbacterial growth. The enhanced disease susceptibility was\n\naccompanied by development of disease symptoms in the form\n\nof visible chlorotic lesions on inoculated leaves (Fig. 2A). The\n\nresults suggest that SBT3.3 positively regulates disease resistance\n\nto PsDC3000.\n\nChanges in the susceptibility of sbt3.3 plants to biotrophic\n\npathogens were further investigated by inoculating plants with a\n\nvirulent strain of the obligate oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidop-\n\nsidis (isolate Noco) (Fig. 2B). Disease severity was assessed at\n\n7 d.p.i in lactophenol trypan-blue-stained leaves. The leaves were\n\nFigure 1.

Both, sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-\n\n2 mutant plants exhibited a significantly higher degree of\n\ncolonization by the oomycete than the control Col-0 plants\n\n(Fig. 2B), becoming heavily covered with sporangiophores, which\n\nelicited appearance of chlorosis and eventual leaf collapse\n\n(namely Class V). The observed enhanced disease susceptibility\n\nof sbt3.3-1 and sbt3.3-2 plants to H. arabidopsidis was corroborated\n\nby directly counting of spore production in inoculated plants\n\n(Supplemental Fig. S5). These results confirmed that loss of\n\nSBT3.3 function also enhanced plant susceptibility to H.\n\narabidopsisdis, further substantiating its value in establishing an\n\neffective plant immune response.\n\nSBT3.3 is required for expression of SA-responsive genes\nCompromised expression of SA-responsive genes is observed in\n\nmutants defective in resistance to biotrophic pathogens (i.e. npr1;\n\n[31]). Consequently, we considered the possibility that the\n\nincreased susceptibility towards pathogens observed in SBT3.3\n\ndefective mutants might be similarly accompanied by a compro-\n\nmised expression of SA-responsive genes. Therefore, induction of\n\nPR-1 accumulation was examined by Western blot in sbt3.3, npr1,\n\nand Col-0 plants following inoculation with PsDC3000. The PR-1\n\nprotein, as expected, was nearly absent in npr1 plants, even at\n\n48 hpi with PsDC3000 (Fig. 2C), while PR-1 accumulation was\n\nnotable in Col-0 following inoculation. Interestingly, sbt3.3-1 and\n\nsbt3.3-2 plants exhibited results similar to the npr1 mutant, showing\n\nFigure 2.

These results were confirmed at\n\nthe transcriptional level by measuring PR-1 transcript level by RT-\n\nqPCR (Fig. 2D). As for NPR1 being required for full immunity,\n\nour results suggest that SBT3.3 is required for full expression of\n\ndownstream SA-responsive genes. This helps explaining why\n\nmutants defective in SBT3.3 are compromised in disease\n\nresistance (Figure 2A and B).\n\nSBT3.3 expression is SA-independent and responds to\nH2O2\n\nThe same mRNA preparations shown in Figure 2D were used\n\nto quantify SBT3.3 transcript accumulation following inoculation\n\nwith PsDC3000 in Col-0 and npr1 plants (Fig. 2E). RNA\n\npreparations from sbt3.3 plants (here used as a control) served to\n\ndemonstrate that in the mutant induced SBT3.3 expression was\n\ndrastically down-regulated due to the T-DNA insertion. In marked\n\ncontrast with the substantial reduction observed for PR-1\n\nactivation (Figure 2D), SBT3.3 expression in npr1 plants was\n\nidentical to that attained in Col-0 plants. Furthermore, in sid2-1\n\nmutant plants (defective in SA synthesis) induction of SBT3.3\n\nexpression upon inoculation with PsDC3000(AvrRpm1), remained\n\nunchanged with respect to Col-0 plants (Fig. 3A). This differs with\n\nthe compromised expression of PR-1 occurring in sid2 plants\n\n(Fig. 3A). These contrasting differences indicated that for\n\npathogen-induced SBT3.3 expression, SA synthesis and its\n\nperception through NPR1 are dispensable.\n\nSince oxidative burst and concurrent H2O2 accumulation\n\npreceded SA build-up during basal immunity activation [32]\n\nand SBT3.3 induction appeared as an early event preceding PR\n\ngene induction by SA (Fig. 1C–D), we hypothesized that H2O2\ncould mediate SBT3.3 induction. In fact, spraying Arabidopsis\n\nleaves with a 1 mM solution of H2O2 elicited a rapid SBT3.3\n\ninduction which was notable at 1 to 3 hours after treatment\n\n(Fig. 3B). Similarly, expression of the OXI1 gene, which encodes a\n\nkinase highly induced under oxidative stress conditions [33] was\n\ntriggered by H2O2 (Fig. 3B). However, under similar inductive\n\nconditions expression of the SA-regulated gene PR-1 remained\n\nunchanged (Fig. 3B). Moreover, the cat2 mutant defective in the\n\ndismutation of H2O2 and exhibiting enhanced H2O2 accumula-\n\ntion, revealed increased SBT3.3 expression compared to Col-0\n\n(Fig. 3C). These observations indicated that SBT3.3 activation\n\nmight result from early H2O2 production during the immune\n\nresponse.\n\nSBT3.3 is secreted and accumulates extracellularly\nPlant subtilases are synthesized in the form of preproprotein\n\nprecursors, translocated via a signal peptide into the endomem-\n\nbrane system, and activated through further cleavage of the\n\npropeptide [34]. Most plant subtilases are considered glycopro-\n\nteins that predominantly accumulate extracellularly [30,34,35].\n\nSBT3.3 subcellular localization was determined by fusing mono-\n\nmeric cherry fluorescent protein (mCherry) to the C-terminus of\n\nthe full length SBT3.3, and the construct, driven by 35S promoter,\n\nexpressed in Nicotiana benthaminana leaves using agro-infiltration.\n\nLocalization of the fusion protein was confirmed by confocal\n\nmicroscopy. Results showed that SBT3.3-mCherry fluorescence\n\nwas uniformly distributed in the pericellular apoplastic space\n\n(Fig. 4A). Similar pericellular localization was observed in\n\ntransgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a 35S::SBT3.3-GFP gene\n\nconstruct (Supplemental Fig. S6). The mCherry-tagged subtilase\n\nwas co-expressed with either a construct bearing the plasma\n\nmembrane integral protein PIP1 fused to YFP, or alternatively\n\nwith a free cytosolic YFP protein to more precisely define its\n\nlocalization. SBT3.3-mCherry was localized externally to the\n\ncytoplasm, as revealed when co-expressed with a free cytosolic\n\nYFP (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, SBT3.3-mCherry was found to be\n\nsandwiched between the PIP1-YFP-tagged plasma membrane\n\nmarker of adjacent cells (Fig. 4B) and thus unambiguously\n\nlocalized to the extracellular matrix. SBT3.3 extracellular local-\n\nization was also confirmed upon expression of a SBT3.3-GFP\n\nprotein fusion in the presence of FM4-64, a plasma membrane\n\nspecific fluorescent dye (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, expression of an\n\nSBT3.3noSP-GFP gene construct in which the N-terminal 25\n\namino acid signal peptide of SBT3.3 has been deleted, revealed\n\nthat the SBT3.3noSP-GFP protein fusion was not secreted to the\n\nextracellular matrix and was retained in the cytoplasm, as\n\ndelineated by the co-localization with FM4-64 (Fig. 4D). These\n\nresults indicate that SBT3.3 is secreted and accumulated in the\n\nplant extracellular matrix, and secretion depends on the presence\n\nof its signal peptide.\n\nFigure 3.

[36] demonstrated that following agro-\n\ninfiltration with a GFP-tagged phytaspase, an Arabidopsis cell\n\ndeath-associated subtilase of similar size to SBT3.3; two proteins of\n\n,110 and ,120 kD corresponding to the mature and the pro-\nprotein phytaspases, respectively, accumulated in crude extracts\n\n[34]. Following expression of SBT3.3-GFP, two similar protein\n\nbands of ,110 and ,120 kD were detected in Western blots using\nan anti-GFP antibody (upper panel; Fig. 4E). The difference\n\nbetween the theoretical mature 98,2 kD SBT3.3-GFP fusion and\n\nthe observed mature 110 kD proteins must be due to posttrans-\n\nlational modifications. In fact, glycosylation was early proposed to\n\nregulate activity of plant subtilases [37,38]. We performed\n\nWestern blots of the same leaf extracts and developed the\n\nnitrocellulose filters with Concanavalin A (Con A) coupled to\n\nhorseradish peroxidase to identify if SBT3.3 is glycosylated. These\n\nanalyses revealed that Con A recognized the 120/110 kD doublet\n\n(Fig. 4E) in extracts expressing the SBT3.3-GFP construct, thus\n\nconfirming that SBT3.3 is glycosylated. Interestingly, Con A also\n\nrecognized a band of ,70 kD that only accumulated following\nSBT3.3-GFP expression (Figure 4E). This ,70 kD band was\nreminiscent of a glycosylated 69 kD P69 subtilase conserved in the\n\nSolanaceous species [27,30]. To verify this possibility, Western\n\nblots were developed with anti-P69C antibodies [30]. Results\n\nrevealed that the ,70 kD Con-A reacting band was recognized by\nanti-P69 antibodies (Fig. 4E) indicating that SBT3.3-GFP signaled\n\ntobacco cells to activate expression of an endogenous P69 subtilase\n\nhomologue. Interestingly, when we extended this analysis to other\n\ndefense-related proteins, i.e. by using antibodies against the PR-1a\n\nisoform from tobacco, we observed that overexpression of SBT3.3-\n\nGFP similarly triggered SA-responsive PR-1a protein accumula-\n\ntion (lower panel; Fig. 4E). We subsequently created a missense\n\nmutant in the SBT3.3-GFP ‘‘catalytic triad’’ (S555A; SBT3.3m-\n\nFigure 4.

Expression of the missense\n\nmutant in N. benthamiana no longer promoted local accumulation\n\nof the corresponding endogenous P69 subtilase, or the PR-1a\n\nprotein (Supplemental Figure S7). All of these observations are\n\nconsistent with a model in which Arabidopsis SBT3.3 subtilase\n\nlocal expression autonomously triggers immune-like responses in a\n\nheterologous system, and the serine proteolytic activity of the\n\nsubtilase is necessary for this effect. As occurs in SBT3.3OEX1\n\nplants (see below), expression of the SBT3.3-GFP gene construct in\n\ntransgenic Arabidopsis plants conferred enhanced disease resis-\n\ntance to PsDC3000 and is in contrast with the lack of effect\n\nobserved for the SBT3.3m-GFP construct (Supplemental Figure\n\nS8). Moreover, the same SBT3.3-GFP gene construct is able to\n\nabrogate the characteristic enhanced disease susceptibility pheno-\n\ntype of sbt3.3 plants, conferring enhanced disease resistance to\n\nPsDC3000 to the stably transformed sbt3.3 mutant plants\n\n(Supplemental Figure S9). This further indicates functionality of\n\nSBT3.3-GFP fusion protein in promoting immune responses in\n\nArabidopsis.\n\nSBT3.3 artificial expression in transgenic Arabidopsis\ntriggers expression of the endogenous gene\n\nThe above observations indicated that SBT3.3 promotes the\n\nexpression and accumulation of a homologous subtilase (i.e. P69)\n\nin N. benthamiana. We studied a stable transgenic Arabidopsis\n\nline constitutively expressing SBT3.3 under the control of the 35S\n\npromoter (SBT3.3OEX) by measuring activation on the corre-\n\nsponding endogenous SBT3.3 gene to test if the same phenom-\n\nenon could be reproduced in Arabidopsis. Antibodies against\n\nSBT3.3 were not available; therefore we instead performed RT-\n\nqPCR measurements using 2 different pairs of oligonucleotides.\n\nOne of those pairs discriminates between the endogenous SBT3.3\n\nmRNAs (endoSBT3.3), transcribed from its own gene, and the other\n\npair was designed to measure the whole amount of SBT3.3\n\nmRNAs (SBT3.3). In Col-0 plants, as expected, both SBT3.3 and\n\nendoSBT3.3 transcript expression was very low (Fig. 4F). In\n\ncontrast, in the transgenic SBT3.3OEX line, SBT3.3 transcript\n\naccumulation was prominent (Fig. 4F), and importantly, this was\n\nalso followed by a high endoSBT3.3 transcript accumulation. This\n\neffect gives support to the hypothesis that SBT3.3 expression is\n\nable per se to signal its own gene activation. This induction appears\n\n‘‘self’’ controlled, since endogenous PR-1 transcript levels in\n\ntransgenic plants do not exhibit significant variation with respect\n\nto Col-0 plants (Fig. 4F). However, in agro-infiltrated tobacco\n\nleaves we observed that SBT3.3-GFP expression promotes\n\naccumulation of both the endogenous P69 subtilase homolog,\n\nand the SA-dependent PR-1a protein. This difference can only be\n\nexplained by noting that in the experiments with N. benthamiana, A.\n\ntumefaciens is inevitably present, which in turn may supply PAMPs\n\nin collaboration with SBT3.3, triggering a downstream SA\n\nsignaling pathway, and in turn SA-defense related gene activation.\n\nIf this mechanism operated effectively, then SBT3.3 would be\n\nrequired to facilitate early immune signaling preceding defense\n\nresponse activation.\n\nSBT3.3 overexpression confers enhanced disease\nresistance to PsDC3000 and H. arabidopsidis\n\nTwo independent Arabidopsis transgenic lines that overex-\n\npress SBT3.3 were inoculated with PsDC3000 and disease\n\nresponse recorded to further assess the role of SBT3.3 subtilase\n\nin plant immunity (i.e. SBT3.3OEX1 and SBT3.3OEX2). The\n\nenhanced disease resistance line overexpressing the NPR1\n\nregulator (NPR1-H, [39]), one of the SBT3.3 defective mutants\n\n(i.e. sbt3.3-1), and Col-0 were included in this experiment for\n\ncomparison. Figure 5A shows that the two SBT3.3OEX lines\n\nexhibited significant enhanced disease resistance responses to\n\nPsDC3000 compared to Col-0. This enhanced resistance was of\n\na magnitude similar to that attained by NPR1-H plants. In\n\ncontrast, the sbt3.3-1 mutant reproduced the expected increased\n\ndisease susceptibility previously shown in Figure 2.\n\nThe SBT3.3 overexpressing lines exhibited an enhanced disease\n\nresistance phenotype when exposed to H. arabidopsidis (Fig. 5B).\n\nThe two lines overexpressing SBT3.3 exhibited a significantly\n\nlower colonization of the oomycete than the control Col-0 plants\n\nor the highly susceptible sbt3.3-1 mutant (Fig. 5B). The observed\n\nenhanced disease resistance of sbt3.3-1 to H. arabidopsidis was\n\ncorroborated by directly counting of spore production in\n\ninoculated plants (Supplemental Fig. S5). The observed height-\n\nened resistance against these two pathogens indicated that SBT3.3\n\nfunctions as a positive plant immunity regulator. Furthermore,\n\nwhen the SBT3.3 overexpression phenotype was assayed in an nrp1\n\nor sid2 mutant background, the enhanced disease resistance to\n\nPsDC3000 was abrogated (Fig. 5C). These results indicate that\n\nSBT3.3, as a positive plant immunity regulator, operates upstream\n\nof the SA pathway.\n\nSBT3.3 expression confers enhanced activation of MPK\nkinases\n\nElevated mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation\n\nis genuinely linked to IR development [12], and in general to\n\ninnate immune responses [40,41,42]. Therefore, our next objec-\n\ntive was to demonstrate if the enhanced resistance phenotype\n\nmediated by the sole SBT3.3 subtilase expression could elicit\n\nelevated MPKs activation. We subsequently employed an\n\nantibody recognizing the phosphorylated residues within the\n\nMAPK activation loop (the so called pTEpY motif, where p\n\ndenotes the phosphorylated residue). Western blot analysis of\n\nprotein extracts derived from healthy Col-0 plants or from two\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines revealed positive immunoreactive signals in two\n\npolypeptides corresponding to MPK6 and MPK3 [42]. Following\n\ndensitometric scanning of Western blots, the two immunoreactive\n\nbands appeared moderately more intense in the overexpression\n\nlines relative to Col-0 control lines (Fig. 5D–E). Inoculation with\n\nPsDC3000 promoted a further activation-associated dual TEY\n\nphosphorylation of MPK3 and MPK6, which was higher in the\n\ntwo SBT3.3OEX lines than in Col-0 plants (Fig. 5D–E). In\n\naddition, MPK4/MPK11, which migrated as a single band on\n\nSDS-PAGE [42], became activated only following bacterial\n\ninoculation, and activation was again more intense in the two\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines. Therefore, dual phosphorylation of the TEY\n\namino acid motif within the MPK activation loop, which is\n\nrequired for kinase activity appeared increased in plants expressing\n\nSBT3.3. However, despite these differences at the protein level, no\n\nsignificant differences were detected with respect to transcript\n\naccumulation induction for these MPKs between Col-0 and\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines (Fig. 5F).\n\nOXI1 is a serine/threonine kinase of the AGC protein kinase\n\nfamily required for oxidative burst-mediated signaling in Arabi-\n\ndopsis; its expression was consistent with that of SBT3.3, and was\n\ninduced by H2O2 ([33]; and Fig. 3B). OXI1 was required for\n\nMPK3 and MPK6 activation and for basal resistance to H.\n\narabidopsidis [33]. In view of these observations, we hypothesized\n\nthat the imposed SBT3.3 expression might sensitize cells to bring\n\nearlier or higher OXI1 expression levels following pathogen\n\ninfection, and in turn provide an explanation for the higher\n\nactivation observed in MPKs. We measured OXI1 comparative\n\nSBT3.3 and Immune Priming\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 8 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\ntranscript level between Col-0 and two SBT3.3OEX lines following\n\nPsDC3000 infection by RT-qPCR. Results indicated the two\n\nSBT3.3OEX lines expressed OXI1 to higher levels than Col-0\n\n(Fig. 5G). This offers a viable explanation as to why MPKs\n\nexhibited increased activation in SBT3.3OEX plants following\n\npathogen attack, even in the absence of differential gene\n\nexpression relative to Col-0. Moreover, in sbt3.3 mutant lines\n\nMPKs activation following inoculation with PsDC3000 was\n\ndrastically reduced in comparison to Col-0 (Figure 5H). This\n\nobservation reinforces the consideration that SBT3.3 appears to\n\nfunction as a positive regulator of the pathway leading to\n\nactivation of MAP kinases. Interestingly, MPKs activation was\n\nnot altered in the enhanced disease susceptibility nrp1 mutant\n\n(Figure 5H) and neither was the expression of the SBT3.3 gene\n\naltered in this same mutant (Figure 3F). This served as a control\n\ntowards the specific requirement of SBT3.3 for MAKs activation\n\nand suggest that this specific signal module operates upstream of\n\nthe NPR1 regulator.\n\nSA-mediated defense genes are poised for enhanced\nactivation in plants overexpressing SBT3.3\n\nThe above results prompted us to search if SA-dependent genes\n\nwere poised for increase activation following SBT3.3 expression.\n\nTherefore, we inoculated Col-0 plants, and one SBT3.3OEX line\n\nwith PsDC3000, and compared PR-1 expression patterns.\n\nInterestingly, after pathogen inoculation induction of PR-1 gene\n\nexpression showed a notorious enhancement in SBT3.3OEX plants\n\nwhen compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6A). Moreover, the genes encoding\n\nthe transcription factors WRKY6, WRKY53, and WRKY35,\n\nmediating transcriptional regulation of SA-related genes, including\n\nPR-1 [43], themselves induced by pathogen infection [44], showed\n\nsimilar enhanced induced expression in SBT3.3OEX plants\n\n(Fig. 6A). Thus, SBT3.3 mediated poising of defense genes for\n\nenhanced activation following perception of a pathogenic cue,\n\ninvoking a role for SBT3.3 in priming immune responses.\n\nPoising SA–related genes and primed immunity concur in\n\nplants defective in the RdDM pathway, such as mutants affected in\n\ndifferent subunits of the RNA Pol V (i.e. nrpd2) [23], and also\n\nfollowing pharmacological treatment with the priming agent BTH\n\n[20]. In both cases, chromatin histone activation marks appeared\n\nenriched in SA-related gene promoters. Consequently, we\n\nhypothesized that following expression of SBT3.3 SA-related\n\ndefense genes could be poised for enhanced activation by\n\ndifferential histone modification. By using chromatin immunopre-\n\ncipitation (ChIP), we analyzed H3 Lys4 trimethylation\n\n(H3K4me3) and H3 Lys9 acetylation (H3K9ac) on the PR-1,\n\nWRKY6 and WRKY53 gene promoter region in both Col-0 plants\n\nand SBT3.3OEX plants. The enhanced disease resistant mutant\n\nnrpd2, defective in RNA PolV activity and compromised in the\n\nRdDM pathway [23], was included as a control. On the PR-1\n\npromoter, H3K4me3 and H3K9ac activation marks increased\n\nmore than two and three-fold, respectively in SBT3.3 overex-\n\npressing plants when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 6B). The two\n\nactivation marks were similarly increased in nrpd2 plants, with only\n\nsome differences in intensity (Fig. 6B). As for PR-1, the histone\n\nmarks also showed increases in the WRKY6 and WRKY53\n\npromoters in SBT3.3 overexpressing plants, and to a lesser extent\n\nin nrpd2 plants, relative to Col-0 plants (Fig. 6B). Therefore,\n\nchromatin marks normally associated with active genes abound in\n\nthe promoter regions of SA-related genes in SBT3.3 overexpress-\n\ning plants, although gene activation does not occur in these plants.\n\nThe marks appear to serve as an on-switch for priming, and helps\n\nexplain why the same genes show enhanced induction in\n\nSBT3.3OEX plants upon pathogenic attack (Fig. 6A).\n\nSBT3.3 expression increases H3K4me3 activation marks in\nits own promoter\n\nResults showed the sole expression of SBT3.3 in transgenic\n\nArabidopsis plants was able to promote activation of the\n\nendogenous gene (Figure 4F). Therefore, SBT3.3 per se might\n\nbe signaling chromatin remodeling of its own promoter as it\n\ndoes for the PR-1 gene promoter (Fig. 6B). ChIP for H3K4me3\n\nand H3K9ac marks at the SBT3.3 promoter region in SBT3.3\n\noverexpressing plants revealed that the H3K4me3 mark was\n\nnotably increased compared to Col-0 plants, and moreover, the\n\nenhancement in H3K4me3 marks was mirrored in nrpd2 plants\n\n(Fig. 7A). However, H3K9ac marks in the SBT3.3 gene\n\npromoter did not increase in the SBT3.3 overexpressing plants\n\nand the nrpd2 mutant when compared to Col-0 (Fig. 7A). These\n\nresults contrasted with the common increase of both activation\n\nmarks in the PR-1 gene (Fig. 6B), and suggested the existence of\n\nspecific histone codes regulating gene expression. Alternatively,\n\nbecause the increase in H3K4me3 activation marks observed in\n\nthe SBT3.3 gene promoter between nrpd2 and SBT3.3OEX\n\nplants were matched, we reasoned that nrpd2 plants might also\n\ncarry constitutive SBT3.3 gene expression. SBT3.3 transcript\n\nlevel determination by RT-qPCR in Col-0 and nrpd2 plants\n\nshowed the mutant constitutively expressing SBT3.3 (Fig. 7B).\n\nThese results suggest that SBT3.3 expression is under negative\n\nepigenetic control, and expression is relieved following inhibi-\n\ntion of RdDM. In fact, treatment of Col-0 seedlings with\n\nsulfamethazine (SMZ), a chemical suppressor of epigenetic gene\n\nsilencing (i.e. RdDM) that derepress silenced genes [45],\n\nrelieved SBT3.3 and promoted transcript accumulation\n\n(Fig. 7C), to levels similar to those attained in nrpd2 plants.\n\nThese observations therefore support the contention of an\n\nepigenetic control towards SBT3.3, and indicate that SBT3.3\n\nacts as a positive regulator of a priming phenomenon for more\n\nefficient deployment of immune responses. In addition, a low\n\nconcentration (100 mM) pharmacological treatment with of the\npriming agent BTH administered to Col-0 plants promoted the\n\nenhanced deposition of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac marks in the\n\nPR-1 gene promoter, and to a minor extent also in WRKY6 and\n\nWRKY53 gene promoters (Fig. 7D), as was observed in previous\n\nstudies [20,23]. Similarly, BTH also induced H3K4me3\n\nactivation marks, and to a less extent also of H3K9ac marks,\n\nin the SBT3.3 gene promoter in Col-0 plants. Thus, as a priming\n\nagent, BTH not only induced chromatin remodeling of SA-\n\nrelated genes similar to the RdDM-defective and enhanced\n\nresistance mutant nrpd2; it also mimicked SBT3.3 chromatin\n\nremodeling triggered by the SBT3.3 itself.\n\nThe importance of SBT3.3 in mediating activation of\n\nchromatin remodeling during priming induction was further\n\nevaluated in SBT3.3 defective plants. Figure 7D, F and G show\n\nthat BTH-mediated increases of H3K4me3 and H3K9ac\n\nactivation marks in the PR-1, WRKY6 and WRKY53 gene\n\npromoters was partially impeded in sbt3.3 plant when\n\ncompared to Col-0 plants. For the SBT3.3 gene promoter\n\n(Fig. 7E), the reduction in histone activation marks following\n\nBTH treatment of sbt3.3 plants was most dramatic. This severe\n\nreduction was most notorious in the case of H3K4me3\n\nactivation marks for which a full inhibition was observed in\n\nBTH-treated sbt3.3 plants when compared to BTH-treated Col-\n\n0 plants (Figure 7D). All the above observations therefore imply\n\nthat the extracellular SBT3.3 subtilase is an integral component\n\nmediating establishment of primed immunity, and moreover, it\n\nappears to be targeted for negative epigenetic control of this\n\nsame mechanism.\n\nSBT3.3 and Immune Priming\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 June 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e1003445\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nPriming, an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon where cells\n\nrespond to much lower levels of a pathogenic stimulus in a more\n\nrapid and robust manner, is an important component of the\n\nvarious forms of IR described in mammals [8–10], plants [6,18]\n\nand invertebrates [11]. Despite the importance of priming, the\n\nsignal component(s) mediating this sensitized state remain elusive.\n\nThe sensitized state is in part explained by presumably dormant or\n\nsilent component characters, which accumulate during priming,\n\nand are required only after pathogenic challenge [18]. In this\n\nrespect, pre-stress deposition of two MPK family members of\n\nsignaling enzymes, MPK3 and MPK6, has been described to play\n\nan important role for priming in Arabidopsis [12]. However, it\n\nremains undetermined whether or not activation of additional\n\nfactors operating upstream of the two MPKs is required to\n\nestablish priming.\n\nReverse genetic analysis was applied to identify the Arabidospsis\n\nSBT3.3 gene, encoding a serine protease of the subtilisin clan,\n\nwhich is pivotal in control of a priming mechanism that leads to\n\nsensitization for activation of SA-dependent defense responses and\n\nIR. SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants\n\nelicited enhanced disease resistance to pathogens. However, this\n\nenhanced resistance was not preceded by a high constitutive\n\nexpression of SA-responsive genes as occurs in different disease\n\nresistant mutants, which in general carry associated dwarfism, such\n\nas in cpr1, edr1 or csb3 [26, and references therein] to mention a\n\nfew. Instead, the SBT3.3-mediated resistance can be explained by\n\naccelerated and heightened activation of SA-responsive genes,\n\nonly elicited by pathogen inoculation, therefore mimicking a wild\n\ntype plant activated for priming. This phenotype is blocked in a\n\nsid2 mutant background, which lacks SA, and is also blocked in the\n\nnpr1 mutant affected in signaling downstream of SA. SBT3.3 thus\n\nfunctions as a positive regulator of innate immunity operating\n\nupstream of the SA pathway. Consistent with the gain-of-function\n\nphenotype, SBT3.3 suppression impairs induction of SA-respon-\n\nsive genes and causes enhanced susceptibility to infection by\n\npathogens.\n\nInterestingly, SBT3.3 expression is rapidly demanded during\n\nactivation of innate immunity preceding the activation of SA-\n\nresponsive genes. However, in contrast to PR genes, SBT3.3\n\nexpression does not require the SA pathway through the NPR1\n\nregulator. Moreover, SBT3.3 activation responds very rapidly to\n\nH2O2, a common ROS species generated very early during PAMP\n\nrecognition by PRR leading to activation of innate immune\n\nresponses. Consistent with other early induced and SA-indepen-\n\ndent genes [46], H2O2 might be the first signal for early\n\ntranscriptional reprogramming of SBT3.3. Congruently, Daudi et\n\nal. [47] showed that knocking down the Arabidopsis cell wall\n\nperoxidases PRX33/PRX34, required for apoplastic H2O2\ngeneration during innate immune responses, leads to changes in\n\nthe cell wall proteome with depletion of various PAMP-elicited\n\nFigure 6.

Localized\n\nSBT3.3 expression in the heterologous N. benthamiana system led to\n\nexpression of the endogenous P69 homologue. Similarly, its stable\n\nexpression in transgenic plants also led to activation of the\n\nendogenous SBT3.3 gene by what appears to be a self-induction\n\nmechanism, which adds further novelty to the SBT3.3 activation\n\nmode. We hypothesize that to a subsequent initial activation by a\n\npathogen, the expressed SBT3.3 subtilase could initiate a signaling\n\nprocess, which would lead to its own expression, at least to a\n\ncertain threshold level, as if forming a regulatory positive feedback\n\nloop circuit. Maintenance of this expression threshold level should\n\nbe sufficient to keep cells in a sustained sensitized mode. The\n\nautonomous and sustained SBT3.3 expression pattern should\n\nconsequently be the basis to explain the memory-based charac-\n\nteristics of priming and IR, manifested only secondarily in hosts\n\nafter a primary infection. Thus, SBT3.3 appears key in regulating\n\nthis type of training effect leading to IR. Interestingly, MPK3 and\n\nMPK6 activation, and to a lesser extend also MPK4/MPK11,\n\nwere enhanced in SBT3.3OEX plants following infection with\n\nPsDC3000, and conversely, this activation was compromised in\n\nsbt3.3 plants. These results are congruent with increased OXI1\n\nexpression in SBT3.3OEX plants, a kinase required for MPK3 and\n\nMPK6 activation [33], and indicates that following SBT3.3\n\nexpression, plants respond faster to pathogenic stimuli. Because\n\nthe MPK3 and MPK6 activation is critical for priming [12], and\n\nactivation requires OXI1 expression [33], our data suggest\n\nSBT3.3 positively modulates immune responses upstream of the\n\nMAPK kinase pathway, and confirms that accumulation of\n\ndefense signaling components, such as SBT3.3 itself, prior to a\n\nsecondary pathogen challenge is essential for priming and induced\n\nresistance.\n\nSimilarly, the observation that sole SBT3.3 expression poises\n\nSA-responsive defense genes for enhanced activation following\n\nperception of a pathogenic cue provides further support to SBT3.3\n\nas an integral component in mounting primed immunity. ChIP\n\nassays revealed this poising effect for enhanced gene expression\n\ntriggered by SBT3.3 was mediated by selective increases of histone\n\nactivation marks on the promoter region of SA-responsive genes.\n\nSince similar histone activation marks have been found to appear\n\nin SA–related genes when wild type plants are treated with the\n\npriming agent BTH [20], our data therefore strongly support a\n\nmodel where SBT3.3 positively mediates OXI1-mediated MPK\n\nactivation, and concurrent chromatin remodeling at SA-respon-\n\nsive genes as specific hallmarks for primed immunity. Further-\n\nmore, the observation that immune priming, and similar\n\nchromatin remodeling of SA-responsive genes is mirrored in\n\nplants defective in the RdDM pathway [23] provides support for a\n\nhypothesis that the observed SBT3.3-mediated priming mecha-\n\nnism might be under similar epigenetic control. Moreover, the fact\n\nthat SBT3.3 gene expression is constitutively up in the nrpd2\n\nmutant favors this interpretation. Furthermore, (1) the observation\n\nthat histone activation marks are established in the promoter of the\n\nSBT3.3 gene and in the promoters of SA-dependent genes by\n\nindividual SBT3.3 overexpression in transgenic plants; (2) the\n\nreproducibility of similar chromatin remodeling of the SBT3.3\n\ngene promoter in nrpd2 plants; (3) its similar remodeling in Col-0\n\nplants following BTH treatment; (4) and the observation that such\n\nchromatin remodeling is strongly abrogated in sbt3.3 plants,\n\nfurther substantiates the importance of SBT3.3 gene activation as\n\na prerequisite for establishment of immune priming.\n\nFigure 7.

One\n\nsimple explanation is via SBT3.3-mediated protein substrate\n\nprocessing that co-localizes extracellularly. This substrate could\n\nexist in a soluble form, or be an extracellular domain (ectodomain)\n\nof a larger protein, likely functioning as a receptor located in the\n\nplasma membrane. After proteolytic shedding of the ectodomain\n\nby SBT3.3, the receptor could become activated and initiate a\n\ndown stream immune signaling process. This mechanism has been\n\nidentified as common in activating a variety of signaling processes\n\nin animal through the involvement of protease-activated receptors\n\n(PARs), a group of receptors mediating different cellular processes\n\nincluding proinflammatory responses, and is also a common\n\nprinciple in various diseases [49]. Moreover, the proteolytic\n\nprocessing mechanism of an extracellular substrate is reminiscent\n\nof that mediating activation of innate immunity in invertebrates\n\nthrough the transmembrane Toll receptor, or Toll-like receptors\n\n(TLRs) in humans; PRR-type receptors consisting of a leucine-rich\n\nrepeat (LRR) ectodomain, a transmembrane domain, and a\n\ncytosolic signaling domain [Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR)], which\n\nbecomes activated only after the binding of a proteolytically\n\nprocessed peptide ligand (i.e. spätzle) by complex cascades of\n\nCLIP-domain serine proteases [50] or less common following\n\nspecific cleavage of the receptor ectodomain by extracellular\n\nproteases [51,52]. Alternatively, SBT3.3 processes the extracellu-\n\nlar substrate and the cleaved polypeptide can be released and\n\nfunction as a ligand recognized by a nearby specific extracellular\n\nreceptor, which in turn can initiate a downstream signaling.\n\nTornero et al., [30] reported SBT3.3 homologous P69C subtilase\n\ncan specifically process LRP in disease tomato plants, an\n\nextracellular LRR-containing protein of unknown function, and\n\nthe first subtilase substrate identified in plants. This suggesting\n\nSBT3.3 could similarly be involved in the cleavage and activation\n\nof LRR-containing proteins, including PRR-type receptors, which\n\nin turn may activate innate immune responses. The recent finding\n\nthat the lectin receptor kinase (LecRK)-VI.2, a member of the\n\nLRR-containing superfamily of RLKs proteins existing in\n\nArabidopsis, is required for immune priming acting upstream of\n\nMPK-mediated signaling [53] can give further support to this\n\nhypothesis.\n\nThe results of the present study identified SBT3.3 as a\n\ndeterminant host factor mediating activation of primed immune\n\nresponses. Our immediate future challenge is to identify the target\n\nsubstrate processed by this subtilase and elucidate the mechanism\n\ntransducing the substrate into a signal for immune prime\n\nactivation.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPlants growth conditions\nArabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in\n\na growth chamber (19–23uC, 85% relative humidity,\n100 mEm\n\n22\nsec\n\n21\nfluorescent illumination) on a 10-hr-light and\n\n14-hr-dark cycle.

Sporulation was expressed as\n\nintensity of pathogen sporulation on each leaf: I, no sporulation;\n\nII, ,50% of the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; III, .50%\n\nof the leaf area covered by sporangiophores; and IV, heavily\n\ncovered with sporangiophores, with additional chlorosis and leaf\n\ncollapse. When indicated, oomycete spore counting was per-\n\nformed as previously described [26].\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation\nChromatin isolation and immunoprecipitation were performed\n\nas described [55]. Chip samples, derived from three biological\n\nreplicates, were amplified in triplicate and measured by quanti-\n\ntative PCR using primers for PR-1, WRKY6, WRKY53 and Actin2\n\nas reported [21]. The rest of primers are described in Text S1 file.\n\nAll ChIP experiments were performed in three independent\n\nbiological replicates. The antibodies used for immunoprecipitation\n\nof modified histones from 2 g of leaf material were antiH3K4m3\n\n(#07-473 Millipore) and antiH3K4ac (#07-352 Millipore).\n\nWestern blot\nProtein crude extracts were prepared by homogenizing ground\n\nfrozen leaf material with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) supplemented\n\nwith 5 mM DTT, protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich), and\n\nprotein phosphatase inhibitors (PhosStop, Roche). Protein con-\n\ncentration was measured using Bradford reagent; 25 mg of total\nprotein was separated by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide w/v) and\n\ntransferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filter was stained with\n\nPonceau-S after transfer, and used as a loading control.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Pie chart categorizing genes which are\ndifferentially expressed in Col-0 and csb3 plants.
