Quorum sensing, mediated by small molecules including N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)\nhomoserine lactone (C12), regulates P. aeruginosa growth and virulence. In addition, host cell recognition of C12 initiates\nmultiple signalling responses including cell death. To gain insight into mechanisms of C12-mediated cytotoxicity, we\nstudied the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in host cell responses to C12. Dramatic protection against C12-mediated\ncell death was observed in cells that do not produce the X-box binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s). The leucine\nzipper and transcriptional activation motifs of XBP1s were sufficient to restore C12-induced caspase activation in XBP1s-\ndeficient cells, although this polypeptide was not transcriptionally active. The XBP1s polypeptide also regulated caspase\nactivation in cells stimulated with N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserine lactone (C14), produced by Yersinia enterolitica and\nBurkholderia pseudomallei, and enhanced homoserine lactone-mediated caspase activation in the presence of endogenous\nXBP1s. In C12-tolerant cells, responses to C12 including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a\nwere conserved, suggesting that C12 cytotoxicity is not heavily dependent on these pathways. In summary, this study\nreveals a novel and unconventional role for XBP1s in regulating host cell cytotoxic responses to bacterial acyl homoserine\nlactones.\n\nCitation: Valentine CD, Anderson MO, Papa FR, Haggie PM (2013) X-Box Binding Protein 1 (XBP1s) Is a Critical Determinant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nHomoserine Lactone-Mediated Apoptosis.

P. aeruginosa is the fourth most-commonly isolated\n\nnosocomial pathogen and infections can be fatal, particularly in\n\nimmuno-compromised subjects such as those with burns or\n\nundergoing chemotherapy [1,2,3,4]. Chronic conditions including\n\ncystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,\n\nacquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-CF bronchiectasis\n\nare also associated with P. aeruginosa infection [5,6,7]. Antimicro-\n\nbials are currently used against P. aeruginosa; however, infections\n\nare typically refractory to therapeutic interventions [8]. Further-\n\nmore, drug resistant P. aeruginosa strains have been isolated and\n\nbiofilm formation in chronic conditions enhances antimicrobial\n\nresistance and pathogenicity [9,10]. As such, there is urgent need\n\nto understand mechanisms of P. aeruginosa virulence and for new\n\nstrategies to combat infections [10,11].\n\nThe process of quorum sensing (QS) has evolved as a\n\nmechanism by which bacterial communities sense cell density\n\nand consequently regulate processes such as growth, biofilm\n\nformation and expression of virulence factors [12,13]. Bacteria\n\nsynthesize small, diffusible molecules to coordinate QS and a\n\nmajor signal generated by P. aeruginosa is N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)\n\nhomoserine lactone (C12, Figure 1A). In addition to regulating P.\n\naeruginosa responses, C12 activates host cell responses via a process\n\ntermed inter-kingdom signalling [14]. C12 is cytotoxic in a dose\n\ndependent manner in macrophages, neutrophils, fibroblasts and\n\nepithelial cells [15,16,17,18]. Additional C12-activated host\n\nresponses include phosphorylation of p38 mitogen activated\n\nprotein kinase (MAPK), phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation\n\ninitiation factor 2a (eIF2a) and synthesis of c-jun mRNA [17]. C12\nrepresses transcriptional activation of nuclear factor k-light chain-\nenhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) -responsive genes in\nstimulated macrophages, T-cells and fibroblasts [19,20,21]. In\n\ncontrast, C12 has also been reported to intrinsically activate pro-\n\ninflammatory responses, including elevation of prostaglandin E2\n\nand cyclooxygenase 2 levels, in certain cell types [22,23]. Finally,\n\nC12 affects calcium homeostasis by releasing calcium stores from\n\nthe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [18,24,25].\n\nKnowledge of how host cells recognize and respond to C12 is\n\nincomplete, although it is believed that C12 may interact with\n\nmultiple host targets in a cell-type dependent manner [14]. The\n\nbitter taste receptor T2R38 was recently demonstrated to\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576\n\n\n\nrecognize C12 [26]. Stimulation of T2R38 by C12 activates\n\nmucociliary clearance and nitric oxide production to facilitate\n\nbacterial clearance and killing in primary airway epithelial cultures\n\n[26]. Polymorphisms in the T2R38 gene associated with Gram-\n\nnegative sinonasal infections were demonstrated to reduce airway\n\nresponsiveness to C12 indicating that C12–host interactions are\n\npathologically relevant [26]. C12 is cell permeable and members\n\nof the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor nuclear hormone\n\nreceptor family have been proposed to respond to C12 [27]. In\n\ncontrast, it has been suggested that C12 and other similar acyl\n\nhomoserine lactones interact directly with host cell membranes to\n\nalter membrane polarity and consequently mediate cellular\n\nresponses [28]. Although innate immune system receptors are\n\ncapable of recognizing diverse pathogen-derived molecules, Toll-\n\nlike receptors (TLRs) and the nucleotide-binding, oligomerization\n\ndomain (NOD)-like receptors Nod1 and Nod2 are not required for\n\nC12 recognition [17].\n\nThe overall objective of this study was to gain insight into how\n\nC12 causes cell death. Several C12-induced cellular responses,\n\nincluding morphological changes to ER structure, phosphorylation\n\nof eIF2a and disruption of calcium homeostasis, are characteristic\nof ER stress [17,24,25]. ER stress typically activates intrinsic\n\napoptosis [29,30] and additional C12-initiated responses including\n\ncytochrome c release, mitochondrial depolarization and caspase 9\n\nactivation, suggest that this pathway is involved in C12 cytotoxicity\n\n[17,18,25]. As such, we tested the hypothesis that ER stress\n\ninitiates C12-mediated cell death. Unexpectedly, these studies\n\nidentified the X box-binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s)\n\nas a major regulator of C12-mediated cell death. In this study, we\n\nreport that: (i) XBP1s regulates C12 cytotoxicity by a novel, non-\n\ntranscriptional mechanism; (ii) XBP1s mediates cellular responses\n\nto C12 and similar acyl homoserine lactones in a cell type-\n\nindependent manner and; (iii) C12-mediated cellular responses\n\noccur via XBP1s-dependent and independent pathways.\n\nResults\n\nDeletion of inositol-requiring enzyme 1a is protective\nagainst C12-mediated cell death\n\nThree sensors monitor ER protein folding stress; PERK (protein\n\nkinase RNA-like ER kinase), IRE1a (inositol-requiring enzyme 1a)\nand ATF6 (activating transcription factor 6) [30,31]. Of these\n\nsensors, PERK and IRE1a have been associated with ER stress-\nactivated apoptotic responses [31,32,33]. Therefore, to investigate\n\nthe role of ER stress response pathways in C12 cytotoxicity, wild\n\ntype (wt) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and knockout\n\nMEFs that do not express PERK (Perk\n2/2\n\n) or IRE1a (Ire1a\n2/2\n\n)\n\nwere challenged with C12 and cytotoxic responses characterized.\n\nSignificant cell death was observed in C12-treated wt MEFs\n\n(,40% at 4 hours), as assessed by comparison of cell labelling with\nthe supravital dye calcein before and after C12-treatment\n\n(Figure 1B, first panels, and Figure 1C). The response of Perk\n2/2\n\nMEFs to C12 was similar to that in wt MEFs indicating that C12\n\ncytotoxicity is not dependent upon PERK activity (Figure 1B, third\n\npanels, and Figure 1C). In contrast, Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs were resistant\n\nto C12 cytotoxicity suggesting that C12-induced cell death is\n\nIRE1a-dependent (Figure 1B, fourth panels, and Figure 1C). RT-\nPCR and western blot analysis was performed to verify the identity\n\nof knockout cell lines used in these studies (Figure 1B, right).\n\nCaspase (cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease) acti-\n\nvation has previously been implicated in C12-mediated cell death\n\n[17,18]; however, caspases have not definitively been demonstrat-\n\ned to mediate C12 cytotoxicity. As such, caspase activity in C12-\n\nchallenged MEFs was characterized to further investigate the\n\nmechanism of C12 cytotoxicity. In wt MEFs, the pan-caspase\n\ninhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited C12-cytotoxicity (,90% cells\nremained at 4 hours) suggesting that cell death requires caspase\n\nactivation (Figure 1B, second panels and Figure 1C, grey bar). Several\n\nfamilies of cysteine proteases can be inhibited by z-VAD-fmk;\n\nhowever, inhibition of cathepsin B (CA-074-Me) or calpain\n\n(ALLN) did not reduce C12 toxicity in wt MEFs (Figure S1A).\n\nAs such, z-VAD-fmk effects in C12-treated MEFs were caspase\n\nspecific and C12 cytotoxicity is dependent upon caspase activa-\n\ntion. Direct measurements of executioner caspase (caspase 3 and 7)\n\nactivity in MEF cell lines stimulated with 25 mM C12 indicated\nthat Ire1a deletion dramatically reduced caspase activation relative\nto wt and Perk\n\n2/2\nMEFs (Figure 1D). Reported concentrations of\n\nC12 in liquid culture and biofilms vary from 5 to 600 mM [21,34];\ntherefore, we assessed caspase activation in wt MEFs in response\n\nto low C12 concentrations (Figure 1E and Figure S1B).\n\nExecutioner caspase activation was significantly enhanced by\n\n4 hour treatment with low C12 concentration (5 mM and 10 mM\nC12 produced ,2-fold and ,5-fold increases respectively) and\nprogressively increased with higher C12 doses. Taken together,\n\nthese studies indicate that C12-cytotoxicity in MEFs: (i) requires\n\ncaspases such that cell death can formally be classified as\n\napoptosis, (ii) is highly dependent on IRE1a activity and, (iii) is\nindependent of PERK activity.\n\nIRE1a deletion indirectly prevents C12 apoptosis\nIRE1a is a transmembrane protein that resides in the ER and\n\ncontains cytoplasmic kinase and endoribonuclease (RNase) activ-\n\nities [30,35]. During homeostatic conditions, IRE1a RNase\nactivity is limited, although it does mediate sequence specific,\n\nnon-conventional splicing of a pre-mRNA (Xbp1u) to generate\n\nmature mRNA (Xbp1s) that encodes the X-box binding protein 1\n\ntranscription factor (XBP1s) [30,33,35]. Xbp1u pre-mRNA also\n\nencodes XBP1u protein that binds to and regulates XBP1s stability\n\n[36]; the internal location of the Xbp1u splice site dictates that\n\nXBP1u and XBP1s share a common amino terminus. During\n\nperiods of irremediable ER stress, as observed in pathological\n\nconditions such as neurodegeneration and type II diabetes, IRE1a\nbecomes hyper-activated leading to apoptosis driven by promis-\n\ncuous IRE1a RNase activity and/or activation of apoptosis signal-\nregulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and its downstream target c-jun NH2-\n\nterminal kinase (JNK) [33,37,38,39].\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nChronic and acute infections associated with P. aeruginosa\nconstitute a major healthcare burden. Antimicrobial\napproaches are currently used against P. aeruginosa;\nhowever, infections are typically refractory to treatment\nand drug resistant strains have been isolated. As such,\nthere is urgent need to understand mechanisms of P.\naeruginosa virulence and for new strategies to fight\ninfections. The P. aeruginosa-derived quorum-sensing\nmolecule C12 is recognized by host cells and initiates\nstress responses including cytotoxicity. In this study, the X-\nbox binding protein 1 transcription factor (XBP1s) was\nidentified as a host factor critical for apoptotic responses\ninitiated by C12 and other similar quorum sensing\nmolecules. Additional C12-initiated host responses, includ-\ning phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and eIF2a were found to\nbe of lesser importance for C12-initiated cytotoxicity.\nThese studies have broad implications for our understand-\ning of bacterial virulence mechanisms and for develop-\nment of potential new strategies to combat infections.\n\nXBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576\n\n\n\nTreatment of wt MEFs with STF-083010, a selective and\n\nirreversible inhibitor of IRE1a RNase activity [39,40], did not\ninhibit C12-mediated toxicity or caspase 3/7 activation (Figure 2A,\n\nleft and Figure 2B). Similarly, treatment of wt MEFs with a JNK\n\ninhibitor (SP600125) did not reduce C12 cytotoxicity (Figure 2A,\n\nright) or activation of caspase 3/7 (Figure S1C). A prerequisite for\n\nIRE1a-mediated apoptotic signalling is IRE1a activation, a\nprocess that involves oligomerization and trans-autophosphory-\n\nlation [33,37]. Therefore, to further investigate a possible role of\n\nIRE1a in C12-mediated cytotoxic responses, IRE1a activity was\ndirectly assessed using a luciferase-based reporter (XBP1-luc). The\n\nXBP1-luc reporter encodes cDNA containing the Xbp1u pre-\n\nmRNA splice site fused upstream of a luciferase gene ([41], see also\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS). In the absence of IRE1a\nactivity, an ‘in-frame’ stop codon prevents luciferase expression\n\n(Figure 2C, top left); however, upon IRE1a-mediated pre-mRNA\nsplicing (which removes 26 nucleotides), the stop codon is shunted\n\n‘out-of-frame’ and luciferase is expressed to report IRE1a activity\n(Figure 2C, bottom left). In wt MEFs expressing XBP1-luc, IRE1a\nactivity was not increased above control levels after 2 hours of C12\n\nstimulation (Figure 2C, right). In contrast, exposure of cells to\n\nthapsigargin, a known ER stress-inducing agent, produced\n\nsignificant enhancement of IRE1a activity over the same time\nframe (Figure 2C, right). Treatment of wt MEFs for 2 hours with\n\nC12 or thapsigargin produced relatively little cell loss (,10%,\n\nFigure S1A). Data obtained in an additional cell type suggested\n\nthat the absence of significant IRE1a activation in response to C12\nstimulation is a generalized phenomenon (Figure S1D). In\n\nsummary, these studies: (i) provide pharmacological evidence that\n\nIRE1a is not directly involved in C12-mediated cytotoxicity and,\n(ii) demonstrate that C12 stimulation of cells does not significantly\n\nactivate the IRE1a ER stress sensor.\nIre1a\n\n2/2\nMEFs synthesize Xbp1u pre-mRNA; however, Xbp1u\n\nsplicing and XBP1s protein are undetectable in this cell type\n\nindicating that IRE1a is uniquely responsible for processing of\nXbp1u pre-mRNA in MEFs ([33,42], see also Figure S2A). As such,\n\nC12 cytotoxic responses were assessed directly in Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs\n\nto test the hypothesis that reduced C12 cytotoxicity in Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs results from loss of XBP1s function(s). C12 stimulation of\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs produced little apparent reduction in cell density\n\nFigure 1. Deletion of Ire1a prevents C12 cytotoxicity. A.

The identity of\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs used in these studies was confirmed by RT-PCR\n\nand western blot analysis (Figure 2D, bottom). Additional experi-\n\nments were performed to characterize the apparent tolerance of\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs to C12 cytotoxicity. Treatment of wt MEFs with\n\nC12 produced time- and dose-dependent increases in caspase 3/7\n\nactivity, similar to observations made in other cell types\n\n[15,16,17,18] (Figure 2E, black bars). In contrast, caspase 3/7\n\nactivation only increased by ,2–4-fold in Xbp12/2 MEFs\nstimulated with 25 mM C12 for up to 8 hours or with C12\nconcentrations increasing to 100 mM (Figure 2E, grey bars). Similar\nresults were obtained in Ire1a\n\n2/2\nMEFs although control\n\nexperiments verified that levels of executioner caspases in\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nand Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs were similar to those in wild type\n\ncells (Figure S1E and data not shown). As such, these studies\n\nindicate that C12 cytotoxicity requires the presence of XBP1s and\n\nthat reduced levels of the XBP1s do not merely alter the kinetics or\n\nsensitivity of cellular responses to C12.\n\nTo investigate whether XBP1s loss-of-function was directly\n\nresponsible for C12 tolerance, Xbp1\n2/2\n\nand Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs were\n\ntransiently transfected with Xbp1 cDNA and responses to C12\n\nwere characterized. As predicted from direct measurement of\n\nexecutioner caspase activation, treatment of wt MEFs with C12\n\nproduced robust caspase 3-cleavage that could be detected by\n\nimmunostaining (Figure 3A). Similarly, as expected from mea-\n\nsurements of executioner caspase activity, cleaved caspase 3 was\n\nessentially absent in C12-stimulated Xbp1\n2/2\n\nand Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs\n\n(Figure 3B and C, left panels). Transfection of Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs with\n\ncDNA encoding either Xbp1u pre-mRNA (which can be processed\n\nby IRE1a; Figure 3B, middle) or Xbp1s mRNA (Figure 3B, right)\nrestored caspase 3 cleavage upon C12 treatment in a large number\n\nof cells. In contrast, transfection of Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs with Xbp1s\n\ncDNA (Figure 3C right), but not Xbp1u cDNA (which is present\n\nendogenously but remains unspliced, Figure 3C, middle), restored\n\ncaspase-3 cleavage upon C12 treatment. In control experiments,\n\nC12-treatment of Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs transfected with an empty\n\nplasmid was not associated with caspase 3-cleavage, verifying that\n\ntransfection of this cell type was not responsible for caspase\n\nactivation (Figure S1F). Taken together, these experiments\n\nindicate that expression of XBP1s in XBP1s-deficient MEFs\n\n(Xbp1\n2/2\n\nor Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs) is sufficient to re-establish C12-\n\nmediated caspase cleavage.\n\nC12-mediated apoptosis does not require XBP1s\ntranscriptional activity\n\nXBP1s is a member of the cAMP response element-binding\n\nprotein (CREB)/ATF basic region–leucine zipper family of\n\ntranscription factors and, consistent with this function, XBP1s is\n\nmodular containing a polybasic region, a leucine zipper motif and\n\na transcriptional activation domain [36] (Figure 4B). Therefore,\n\nexperiments were conducted to investigate whether XBP1s\n\ntranscriptional activity was required for C12-mediated apoptosis.\n\nTreatment of wt MEFs with inhibitors of transcription (actino-\n\nmycin) or translation (cycloheximide) during C12 stimulation did\n\nnot prevent caspase activation (Figure 4A). As such, in response to\n\nC12-stimulation, neither acute activation of XBP1s transcriptional\n\nactivity nor acute protein synthesis of an XBP1s-dependent\n\ntranscript are responsible for C12-induced apoptosis.\n\nTo gain insight into the role of XBP1s domains in C12-\n\nmediated apoptosis, a series of XBP1s truncation constructs were\n\ngenerated (Figure 4B). In wt MEFs, XBP1s is predominantly\n\nlocalized to the nucleus, although in agreement with prior\n\nbiochemical analysis, low levels of XBP1s could also be detected\n\nin the cytoplasm [36] (Figure 4C and Figure S2B). Deletion of the\n\namino terminus and polybasic region from XBP1s produced a\n\ntruncation construct (XBP1D1) that was distributed throughout the\n\ncell (Figure 4B and 4C). When expressed in Ire1a\n2/2\n\nor Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs, XBP1D1 was able to re-establish caspase 3 cleavage upon\n\nC12 treatment (Figure 4D, left). In a similar manner, an XBP1s\n\ntruncation construct that consisted of only the leucine zipper and\n\ntranscriptional activation domains (XBP1D2) was distributed\n\nthroughout the cell (Figure 4B and 4C) and restored caspase 3\n\ncleavage in C12-stimulated Ire1a\n2/2\n\nand Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs\n\n(Figure 4D, middle). A truncation construct encompassing the\n\namino-terminal domains of XBP1s (XBP1N, Figure 4B) failed to\n\nre-establish caspase 3 cleavage in C12 stimulated Ire1a\n2/2\n\nor\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs (Figure 4D, right). As such, consideration of C12-\n\nmediated caspase 3-cleavage in XBP1s-deficient MEFs expressing\n\nXBP1D2 or XBP1N suggested that the transcriptional activation\n\ndomain of XBP1s contains a protein sequence that is responsible\n\nfor C12-mediated caspase activation. However, instability of\n\nadditional XBP1s truncation constructs that were generated\n\nprecluded further analysis to identify a minimal XBP1s region\n\nthat is necessary for C12-mediated caspase 3-cleavage. For\n\ninstance, truncation constructs such as those that encode the\n\nXBP1s transcriptional activation domain and carboxy-terminus or\n\nthe XBP1s transcriptional activation domain alone could not be\n\ndetected by immunocytochemistry or western blot analysis (Figure\n\nS2C and data not shown). As such, our analysis indicates that the\n\nleucine zipper and transcriptional activation domains of XBP1s\n\n(XBP1D2) constitute a minimal XBP1s region that can be stably\n\nexpressed and is sufficient for caspase activation in C12-treated\n\nIre1a\n2/2\n\nor Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs.\n\nNext, experiments were performed to assess the ability of XBP1s\n\ntruncation constructs to mediate transcriptional activity. In these\n\nassays, wt MEFs were co-transfected with an XBP1s-responsive\n\nluciferase reporter and either XBP1s or an XBP1s truncation\n\nconstruct [43,44]. As expected, robust transcriptional responses\n\nwere observed when XBP1s was co-expressed with the reporter\n\n(Figure 4E). In contrast, XBP1N, which lacks a transcriptional\n\nactivation domain, was not associated with transcriptional activity\n\n(Figure 4E). The XBP1D1 and XBP1D2 truncation constructs that\n\nrestore caspase 3-cleavage in C12-treated Ire1a\n2/2\n\nand Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs were also not associated with XBP1s-dependent transcrip-\n\ntional activity (Figure 4E and Figure S2A). Taken together, these\n\nstudies indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nactivation domains of XBP1s (XBP1D2) constitute a minimal,\n\nstable XBP1s fragment that restores caspase activation upon C12\n\nstimulation in XBP1s-deficient cells and; (ii) C12-mediated\n\napoptosis does not require XBP1s-transcriptional activity.\n\nXBP1s regulates a common mechanism for acyl\nhomoserine lactone-mediated caspase activation\n\nAcyl homoserine lactones are a common chemical scaffold used\n\nby diverse bacterial species for QS [12]. Therefore, experiments\n\nwere performed to investigate if XBP1s-dependent mechanisms\n\nmediate cellular responses to N-(3-oxo-tetradecanoyl) homoserine\n\nlactone (C14, Figure 5A), a QS molecule generated by the gram-\n\nnegative, pathogenic bacteria Yersinia enterolitica and Burkholderia\n\npseudomallei. Treatment of wt MEFs with C14 produced significant\n\ncell death, as assessed by calcein AM fluorescence (Figure 5B, left),\n\nand activation of executioner caspases (Figure 5C, right).

A Fisher rat thyroid (FRT) cell line was generated that was\n\nhighly enriched for expression of XBP1D2 (FRT-XBP1D2,\n\nFigure 5E, left). Treatment of FRT-XBP1D2 with C12 or C14\n\nresulted in increased activation of executioner caspases relative to\n\ncontrol cells (FRTcon, Figure 5E, right). Similarly, enhanced\n\ncaspase activation was observed in a Hela cell line enriched for\n\nXBP1D2 expression upon treatment with C12 or C14 (Figure 5F).\n\nIt is noteworthy that in all cell types studied C14 produced higher\n\nlevels of caspase activation than C12. Studies with further acyl\n\nhomoserine lactones indicated that acyl chains of .12 carbon\n\natoms and substitution at the third carbon of the acyl chain are\n\nrequired for toxicity (Figure S3). Taken together, these experi-\n\nments indicate that: (i) the leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nactivation domains (XBP1D2) of XBP1s regulate activation of\n\ncaspases in response to different homoserine lactones and, (ii)\n\nXBP1D2 results in increased caspase activation in the presence of\n\nendogenous XBP1s.\n\nC12 activates alternative cellular responses via XBP1s-\nindependent mechanisms\n\nC12 activates multiple stress response signalling pathways in\n\nhost cells [14,17]. The observation that Ire1a\n2/2\n\nand Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs are protected from C12-induced cell death afforded the\n\nopportunity to investigate whether distinct cellular signalling\n\nresponses are associated with or unrelated to C12 cytotoxicity.\n\nPhosphorylation of eIF2a and p38 MAPK have previously been\nreported in primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells\n\n[17].

As both\nIre1a\n\n2/2\nand Xbp1\n\n2/2\nMEFs are resistant to C12 cytotoxicity,\n\nthese studies also suggest that phosphorylation of p-eIF2a and p-\np38 MAPK does not contribute greatly to C12-mediated cell\n\ndeath in MEFs. Consistent with this notion, inhibition of p38\n\nMAPK activity (using SB203580 or SB202190) did not inhibit C12\n\ncytotoxicity or caspase 3/7 activation in wt MEFs (data not\n\nshown).\n\nPERK phosphorylates eIF2a during periods of ER stress [32];\ntherefore, experiments were performed to investigate whether\n\nPERK is activated by C12. Phosphorylation of eIF2a was,\nhowever, preserved in C12-treated Perk\n\n2/2\nMEFs (Figure 6B,\n\ntop; ,3-fold increase). As expected, control experiments confirmed\nthat ER stress induced by brefeldin A (BFA) produced p-eIF2a in\nwt MEFs (,4-fold increase) but not Perk2/2 MEFs (,0.9-fold\nchange) (Figure 6B, middle and bottom). Together, these studies\n\nindicate that C12 challenge activates alternative kinase(s) activity\n\nto generate p-eIF2a; however, they do not formally demonstrate\nthat PERK does not contribute to eIF2a phosphorylation.\n\nLevels of c-jun mRNA have also been reported to increase in\n\nC12-treated primary macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial cells\n\n[17]. In wt MEFs, c-Jun protein levels increased by approximately\n\ntwo-fold after 90 minutes treatment with 25 mM C12 (Figure 6C,\nleft, and Figure 6D).

At present, these studies cannot\n\ndistinguish whether c-Jun levels increase in wt MEFs in an XBP1s\n\n(or IRE1a) -dependent manner or due to C12-mediated cytotox-\nicity; however, these studies confirm that C12 cytotoxicity is\n\nassociated with increased c-Jun levels. It is noteworthy that in\n\nunstimulated conditions, c-Jun levels in wt and knockout MEFs\n\nvaried by approximately three-fold; as such, elevated levels of c-\n\nJun, at least in the absence of XBP1s, are not sufficient to mediate\n\nC12 cytotoxicity. These studies indicate that C12-mediated host\n\ncell responses occur via both XBP1s-dependent and -independent\n\nmechanisms and C12-mediated production of p-eIF2a and p-p38\nMAPK in MEFs does not contribute greatly to cell death.\n\nDiscussion\n\nInfections associated with P. aeruginosa result in significant\n\nmortality and constitute a major worldwide healthcare burden.\n\nOur understanding of P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms is\n\nlimited and there is an urgent need to identify new approaches\n\nthat can be employed to reduce P. aeruginosa infectivity. P.\n\naeruginosa employ QS to regulate growth, virulence factor\n\nexpression and biofilm formation. In addition to quorum\n\nsignalling, P. aeruginosa-derived C12 homoserine lactone activates\n\nseveral host cell responses including cytotoxicity. The major\n\nconclusion of this study is that C12-mediated host cell cytotoxic\n\nresponses largely require expression of the XBP1s transcription\n\nfactor (Figure 7). Cell death and caspase activation were\n\ndramatically reduced (,95%) in cells that cannot generate\nXBP1s (Ire1a\n\n2/2\nMEFs) or lack the XBP1 gene (Xbp1\n\n2/2\nMEFs).\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first\n\ndescription of cells that are C12-tolerant due to genetic ablation\n\nof a protein. Restoring XBP1s expression in either Ire1a\n2/2\n\nor\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs was sufficient to re-establish caspase 3 cleavage\n\nupon C12 stimulation. Although the present study does not\n\nprovide full mechanistic detail, we demonstrate that a fragment of\n\nXBP1s encompassing the leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nFigure 4.

Cellular responses, including phosphorylation of p38 MAPK\n\nand eIF2a were reported in cells exposed to 5–10 mM C12 [17]. In\nvivo studies indicate that low concentrations of C12 (1–10 mM)\nproduce profound responses [46]. Furthermore, it has been\n\nproposed that host cells may be exposed to high local C12\n\nconcentrations generated by P. aeruginosa structures including\n\nmicro-colonies and biofilms [47,48]. The only rigorous validated\n\nC12 receptor is T2R38, this bitter taste receptor is activated by\n\nC12 to stimulate host antimicrobial responses including nitric\n\noxide synthesis and mucociliary clearance [26]. In human subjects,\n\ncommon loss-of-function polymorphism in T2R38 were linked to\n\nhost susceptibility to sinonasal gram-negative bacterial infections,\n\nsuggesting that T2R38 is a key determinant of upper airway innate\n\ndefense mechanisms [26]. In primary cell cultures, TR238-\n\nmediated antimicrobial responses were stimulated by C12 in the\n\nconcentration range 10–100 mM. As such, we predict that C12\nconcentrations considered in these studies will be clinically\n\nrelevant.

In C. elegans, P. aeruginosa-mediated PMK-1\n\np38 MAPK activation during development induces ER stress that\n\nis lethal in the absence of XBP1s [55]. In general, these studies\n\nindicate that XBP1s typically acts in a protective manner to restore\n\ncellular homeostasis when protein load on the ER is excessive [35].\n\nXBP1s function has, however, been linked to cell death and over\n\nlong time courses (days) increased levels of XBP1s have been\n\nassociated with apoptosis in endothelial and pancreatic b cells\n[56,57]. The current study represents the first descriptions of an\n\nunconventional (non-transcriptional) role for XBP1s and of a\n\nfunction for XBP1s in regulating acute apoptosis.\n\nAdditional insights into the role of cell stress response pathways\n\nin C12 stimulated cells are afforded by the present study\n\n(summarized in Figure 7). Activation of ER stress response\n\npathways has been proposed as a mechanism by which C12\n\ninitiates host cell responses [14,48]. Direct assessment of IRE1a\nsplicing activity and pharmacological inhibition of apoptotic\n\npathways that are initiated by IRE1a suggests that C12 does not\nactivate IRE1a. An additional inference that can be drawn from\nthese observations is that ‘house-keeping’ levels of XBP1s are\n\nsufficient to mediate apoptotic responses to C12. However, it is\n\nnoteworthy that immune responses initiated by P. aeruginosa (via\n\nTLR4 and TLR5) will result in IRE1a-activation and increased\nlevels of XBP1s [58]. ER stress-induced PERK activation has also\n\nbeen proposed to be responsible for C12-mediated eIF2a\nphosphorylation; however, robust eIF2a phosphorylation was\nobserved in Perk\n\n2/2\nMEFs suggesting that an alternative kinase(s)\n\ncatalyzes this response. Although the present studies do not\n\nformally rule out PERK-mediated eIF2a phosphorylation, this\nscenario seems unlikely given that: (i) C12-mediated IRE1a ER\nstress responses are negligible, (ii) PERK and IRE1a sense ER\nstress by a similar mechanism [59] and, (iii) deletion of PERK does\n\nnot alter cytotoxic responses to C12. In response to cell stress,\n\neIF2a is also phosphorylated by eIF2a kinase 1 (the heme-\nregulated inhibitor kinase), eIF2a kinase 2 (protein kinase RNA-\nactivated, PKR) or eIF2a kinase 4 (GCN2) [60]; further work will\nbe required to establish which eIF2a kinase(s) responds to C12.\nThe role of individual stress response pathways to overall C12-\n\nmediated cytotoxicity is not well understood. The observations\n\nthat p38 MAPK phosphorylation is conserved in Ire1a\n2/2\n\nand\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs and that pharmacological inhibition of p38\n\nMAPK does not prevent C12-mediated apoptosis suggest that this\n\npathway is of limited importance to C12-mediated cell death.\n\nSimilarly, eIF2a phosphorylation is preserved in Ire1a\n2/2\n\nand\n\nXbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs also suggesting that this cellular response has little\n\nrelevance to C12-mediated apoptosis. Finally, it is noteworthy that\n\ncaspases are activated in Ire1a\n2/2\n\nand Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs in response\n\nto C12-stimulation, albeit at dramatically reduced levels (,5%)\nrelative to wt MEFs. As such, our study indicates that XBP1s-\n\ndependent and -independent processes that contribute to caspase\n\nactivation are initiated in C12-stimulated cells, but that XBP1s-\n\ndependent mechanisms are dominant.\n\nHow might XBP1s contribute to cell death in C12-stimulated\n\ncells? Our study formally verifies that caspase activation mediates\n\napoptotic cell death in MEFs. Executioner caspase activity was\n\nostensibly used as a metric of cell death; however, caspase 8 was\n\nalso activated in C12-stimulated MEFs (data not shown) as\n\npreviously reported in other cell types [16,18]. Caspase 8\n\nactivation typically indicates that extrinsic apoptotic pathways\n\ninitiated by cell surface receptors are operating [29]. As such, we\n\nspeculate that XBP1s promotes initiation of extrinsic apoptotic\n\nresponses through formation of the death-inducing signalling\n\ncomplex in a C12-dependent manner. Precedents of leucine\n\nzipper-containing proteins causing intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis\n\nhave been reported. Similar to XBP1s, the prostrate apoptosis\n\nresponse-4 protein (Par-4) contains a leucine zipper motif and\n\nnuclear localization sequences. Depending upon cell type, Par-4\n\nhas been demonstrated to either sensitize cellular responses to\n\napoptotic stimuli or to directly activate apoptosis; however, the\n\nmechanism of these responses is not fully elucidated [61]. Further\n\nstudies will be required to test the hypothesis that XBP1s mediates\n\nactivation of extrinsic apoptotic responses in a C12-dependent\n\nfashion.\n\nIn summary, the present study identifies XBP1s as a key\n\ndeterminant of apoptotic responses initiated by QS molecule\n\ngenerated by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterolitica and Burk-\n\nholderia pseudomallei. The leucine zipper and transcriptional\n\nactivation domains of XBP1 are sufficient to mediate apoptotic\n\nresponses; however, XBP1s transcriptional activity is not required\n\nfor cell death. These studies advance our understanding of host\n\nresponses to C12 and should facilitate rational design of\n\napproaches to investigate whether C12-mediated host cell\n\napoptosis is pathologically relevant.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell lines and cell culture\nImmortalized wt and knockout MEF cell lines used in this study\n\nwere previously described and RT-PCR analysis of these cells was\n\nperformed using published primer sequences [32,33,37,39].

For some experiments,\n\nC12 was prepared using a previously described synthetic route\n\n[62].

SB203580 (10 mM),\nSB202190 (10 mM), SP600125 (10 mM), ALLN (10 mM), brefeldin\nA (1.25 mg/ml) and actinomycin (1 mg/ml) were obtained from\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology.\n\nAntibodies, western blotting and immunocytochemistry\nAntibodies against, IRE1a, PERK, cleaved and full length\n\ncaspase 3 and 7, p-eIF2a, p-p38 MAPK and c-Jun were obtained\n\nXBP1s Is Necessary for C12-Induced Apoptosis\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 10 August 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e1003576\n\n\n\nfrom Cell Signalling. Antibody against XBP1 was purchased from\n\nSanta Cruz. Antibody against FLAG-tag was obtained from\n\nSigma. Western blotting was performed using standard procedures\n\nwith chemiluminescence detection. Immunocytochemistry was\n\nperformed on fixed and permeabilized cells using indirect\n\nimmunodetection with appropriate fluorophore-conjugated sec-\n\nondary antibodies and DAPI as a counterstain. Imaging was\n\nperformed using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope\n\nequipped with an Exfo X-Cite light source, Hamamatsu EM-CCD\n\ndeep-cooled camera and appropriate filter cubes and objectives\n\n(Nikon S Fluor 206N.A. 0.75 or Plan Fluor 406N.A. 0.75). For\nquantitative immunodetection, cell from different experiments\n\nwere labelled in parallel, imaged with identical microscope settings\n\nand analyzed using Fiji image processing software.\n\nApoptosis assays and cell density analysis\nCaspase activity was measured using Caspase-Glo homoge-\n\nneous luminescent assays (Promega). In different experiments,\n\ncaspase activation in C12-treated wt MEFs varied by ,50% for\nundetermined reasons. As such, control experiments were always\n\nperformed and are presented, such that control data and\n\nexperimental maneuvers can be directly compared. Normalized\n\ncaspase activation data is presented as mean 6 S.D. for an\n\nindividual experiment (comprised of 6–12 individual measure-\n\nments), and is representative of at least duplicate experiments. To\n\ncharacterize cell density, cells were labelled with calcein-AM and\n\nimaged using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000U inverted microscope\n\n(described above) equipped with a Nikon Plan Fluor 106/NA 0.3\nobjective. Relative cell number was calculated from background-\n\ncorrected, integrated fluorescence areas and cell density was\n\nderived by comparison of relative cell number before and after an\n\nexperimental maneuver. Data is presented as mean 6 S.E. and\n\nwas derived from 3–5 independent experiments in which 3–6 cell\n\nareas were imaged per experiment.\n\nPlasmids, molecular biology and luciferase-based\nreporter assays\n\nPlasmids containing FLAG-tagged murine XBP1u and XBP1s\n\ncDNA were obtained from Addgene (plasmids 21832 and 21833;\n\n[63]). For experiments, the coding regions for XBP1u and XBP1s\n\nwere excised as HindIII/XbaI fragments, subcloned into\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro, and an oligo duplex was used to regenerate\n\nthe FLAG-tag (amino acid sequence MDYKDDDDL). Carboxy-\n\nterminal FLAG-XBP1s truncations (Figure 4B) were generated by\n\npcr as HindIII/XbaI-tagged amplicons that were subcloned into\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro containing an in-frame FLAG-tag. The amino-\n\nterminal FLAG-XBP1s truncation (Figure 4B) was generated by\n\npcr as a BglII/EcoRI-tagged amplicon that was subcloned into the\n\nBamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3.1; for experiments, FLAG-tagged\n\nXBP1 amino terminus was subsequently subcloned into\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro as an NheI/XbaI fragment. Domain boundaries\n\nfor truncations were based on those previously reported for human\n\nXBP1s [36]. For FLAG-XBP1s, the polybasic, leucine zipper\n\n(which contains amino acids involved in transcription factor\n\ndimerization) and transcriptional activation domains start at\n\nArg76, Ala94 and Ala168, the transcriptional activation domain\n\nends at Val283 and the amino terminal domain ends at Iso197\n\n(corresponding to residues Arg68, Ala86, Ala160, Val275 and\n\nIso189 of untagged XBP1s). Sequence analysis was used to\n\nconfirm all constructs generated in this study. For experiments in\n\nMEFs that assessed the role of full length and truncated XBP1\n\nregions in caspase activation, pcDNA3.1/Hygro was used as a\n\ncontrol (empty) vector. Cell lines enriched for expression of an\n\nXBP1s deletion construct (XBP1D2, Figure 4B) were generated by\n\nrepeated culture of transfected cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin;\ncells transfected with pcDNA3.1/Hygro and selected in 300 mg/\nml hygromycin (FRTcon and Helacon) were used as a control.\n\nA luciferase-based reporter of IRE1a activity was generously\nprovided by Albert Koong (Stanford University). Briefly, this\n\nreporter (termed XBP1-luc) consists of cDNA encoding the first\n\n208 amino acids of human Xbp1, including a 26-nucleotide splice\n\nsite that is recognized by IRE1a, fused to firefly luciferase [41]. A\nplasmid-based vector was generated for the current studies by\n\nsubcloning reporter cDNA (provided in the pLPCX retroviral\n\nvector, Clontech) into pcDNA3.1/Hygro as a HindIII/NotI\n\nfragment. Assays of IRE1a splicing activity were performed in\ntransiently transfected wt MEFs or in an FRT cell population\n\nenriched for expression of the reporter construct by repeated\n\nculture of cells in 300 mg/ml hygromycin. A luciferase based\nreporter of XBP1s activity was purchased (pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/\n\nHygro] (Promega)); this reporter contains five direct repeats of the\n\nsequence 59-ATCGAGACAGGTGCTGACGTGGCATTC-39\n\nand is similar to a previously described XBP1s-responsive reporter\n\n(UPRE/56ATF6GL3) [43,44]. Assays of XBP1 transcriptional\nactivity were performed in MEFs transiently transfected with\n\nplasmids expressing full length or truncated XBP1s (or\n\npcDNA3.1/Hygro as a control) and pGL4[lu2P/ATF6-RE/\n\nHygro] at a ratio of 9:1. Luciferase-based reporter assays were\n\nperformed using the Bright-Glo Assay system as directed by the\n\nmanufacturer (Promega).\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 A.

Co-transfection of wt and Xbp1\n2/2\n\nMEFs with Xbp1u\n\ncDNA produced limited transcriptional activity, consistent with\n\nthe ability of these cells to process Xbp1u pre-mRNA and generate\n\nXBP1s via IRE1a activity (as expected, intrinsic activity of IRE1a\nis limited such that XBP1s-transcriptional activity in Xbp1u\n\ntransfected cells is lower than that in Xbp1s transfected cells). In\n\ncontrast, Ire1a\n2/2\n\nMEFs were unable to process Xbp1u cDNA\n\nsuch that no transcriptional activity was reported. No transcrip-\n\ntional activity was reported in any cell type for co-transfection with\n\nplasmids encoding XBP1N and XBPD2.
