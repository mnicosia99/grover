Recent studies indicate that P. haemolytica Lkt binds to bovine CD18, the common subunit of\nall b2 integrins. We designed experiments with the following objectives: to identify which member of the b2\nintegrins is a receptor for Lkt; to determine whether Lkt binding to the receptor is target cell (bovine\nleukocytes) specific; to define the relationships between Lkt binding to the receptor, calcium elevation, and\ncytolysis; and to determine whether a correlation exists between Lkt receptor expression and the magnitude of\ntarget cell cytolysis. We compared Lkt-induced cytolysis in neutrophils from control calves and from calves\nwith bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (BLAD), because neutrophils from BLAD-homozygous calves exhibit\nreduced b2 integrin expression. The results demonstrate for the first time that Lkt binds to bovine CD11a and\nCD18 (lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 [LFA-1]). The binding was abolished by anti-CD11a or\nanti-CD18 monoclonal antibody (MAb). Lkt-induced calcium elevation in bovine alveolar macrophages\n(BAMs) was inhibited by anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAb (65 to 94% and 37 to 98%, respectively, at 5 and 50\nLkt units per ml; P < 0.05). Lkt-induced cytolysis in neutrophils and BAMs was also inhibited by anti-CD11a\nor anti-CD18 MAb in a concentration-dependent manner. Lkt bound to porcine LFA-1 but did not induce\ncalcium elevation or cytolysis. In neutrophils from BLAD calves, Lkt-induced cytolysis was decreased by 44%\ncompared to that of neutrophils from control calves (P < 0.05). These results indicate that LFA-1 is a Lkt\nreceptor, Lkt binding to LFA-1 is not target cell specific, Lkt binding to bovine LFA-1 correlates with calcium\nelevation and cytolysis, and bovine LFA-1 expression correlates with the magnitude of Lkt-induced target cell\ncytolysis.\n\nLeukotoxin (Lkt) and lipopolysaccharide produced by Pas-\nteurella (Mannheimia) haemolytica serotype 1 are considered to\nbe the primary virulence factors contributing to lung injury in\nbovine pneumonic pasteurellosis (BPP) (33, 36, 38, 40), a dis-\nease of substantial economic importance to the beef and dairy\ncattle industries in North America (7, 28, 39). Lkt is a member\nof a family of gram-negative bacterial exotoxins termed RTX\n(for repeats in toxin) cytolysins (3). Although most RTX cyto-\nlysins interact with a variety of cell types from many different\nspecies (6), cytolysins produced by Actinobacillus actinomyce-\ntemcomitans, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (ApxIIIA), and\nP. haemolytica are known to have cell type- and species-specific\neffects. The leukotoxin (LtxA) of A. actinomycetemcomitans, a\nhuman pathogen, interacts only with cells of the lymphocytic\nand monomyelocytic lineages of humans and some nonhuman\nprimates (23); the Lkt of P. haemolytica, a ruminant pathogen,\ninteracts only with ruminant leukocytes causing activation and\ncytolysis (4, 15, 25, 33, 40). A study by Lally et al. (23) has\ndetermined that two RTX cytolysins, LtxA of A. actinomyce-\ntemcomitans and alpha-hemolysin of Escherichia coli, bind to\nhuman myelomonocytic leukemic cell line (HL60) through a\nb2 integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1)\nand cause cytolysis. Moreover, two recent studies have identi-\n\nfied CD18 as a receptor for P. haemolytica Lkt (24, 35). Since\nCD18 is the common subunit of all three bovine b2 integrins\nCD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1), and CD11c/\nCD18 (p150/95) (1, 18), it is not clear which of the three b2\nintegrins is a receptor for P. haemolytica Lkt.\n\nb2 integrins are heterodimeric cell surface glycoproteins\ncomposed of a CD11 (a) subunit and a CD18 (b) subunit and\nare expressed exclusively on leukocytes (5, 9). These leukocyte\nintegrins mediate cell adhesion to endothelial cell ligands such\nas intracellular adhesion molecules (5, 9). The importance of\nb2 integrins for host defense against microbial agents is exem-\nplified by leukocyte adhesion deficiency, a rare genetic disease\nin humans that results in reduced expression of all b2 integrins\nin leukocytes (21, 22), leading to life-threatening bacterial in-\nfections. A similar genetic disorder has been reported for Hol-\nstein cattle and termed bovine leukocyte adhesion deficiency\n(BLAD) syndrome (18, 19). Leukocytes from BLAD-homozy-\ngous calves are known to have no or reduced expression of\nthese b2 integrins (18, 19). However, the potential role of this\nreduced b2 integrin expression in the BLAD calf model in Lkt\nbinding and cytolysis has not been examined.\n\nThe objectives of the present study are to: (i) identify which\nmember of the b2 integrins is a receptor for P. haemolytica Lkt;\n(ii) determine whether Lkt binding to the receptor exhibits\ntarget cell (bovine leukocytes) specificity; (iii) define the rela-\ntionship between Lkt binding to the receptor and intracellular\n[Ca21] ([Ca21]i) elevation and cytolysis; and (iv) determine\nwhether a correlation exists between Lkt receptor expression\n\n* Corresponding author.

We\nused bovine neutrophils and bovine alveolar macrophages\n(BAMs) to study Lkt binding and functional effects, since these\ncells are implicated in the pathophysiology of BPP (2, 30).\nPorcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and HL60 cells are\nused to demonstrate whether Lkt binding is target cell specific.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPreparation of P. haemolytica Lkt. Preparation of Lkt from P. haemolytica has\nbeen described in a previous publication (25). Briefly, crude Lkt was prepared\nfrom logarithmic-phase P. haemolytica D153 grown in RPMI 1640 medium\nsupplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine. Following centrifugation, the supernatant\nwas filter sterilized, concentrated 100-fold, and dialyzed against endotoxin-free\ndistilled water in a spiral-wound membrane cartridge (model S1Y30; Amicon\nCorp., Danvers, Mass.). The retentate containing crude Lkt was lyophilized and\npurified to homogeneity by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The purified 104-kDa Lkt (monomeric, native\nform [40]) was lyophilized and stored at 220°C, and all studies were done with\nthe same batch of purified Lkt. The leukotoxic activity was quantified by a\ncolorimetric XTT (sodium,39-(1-[phenylamino-carbonyl]-3,4-tetrazolium)-bis(4-\nmethoxy-6-nitro)benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate) assay, using the bovine lymphoid\ncell line (BL3) as target cells. The concentration of bioactive Lkt was expressed\nas Lkt units (LU) per milligram (dry weight) (41). In order to exclude the effect\nof postpurification lipopolysaccharide contamination in the Lkt preparations,\npurified Lkt fractions were incubated with 10 mg of polymyxin B per ml for 30\nmin on ice prior to use. Studies of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release were\ndone with Lkt concentration of 50 LU/ml, since in preliminary studies this Lkt\nconcentration resulted in .60% LDH release over a 90-min period. In [Ca21]i\nmeasurements, 5 and 50 LU/ml were used.\n\nPreparation of leukocytes. (i) Bovine neutrophils. Peripheral blood samples\nwere obtained from six healthy age-, breed-, and sex-matched Holstein heifers,\nusing acid-citrate-dextrose as the anticoagulant. Blood samples from three Hol-\nstein calves homozygous for BLAD (1) containing the same anticoagulant were\nobtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Animal Disease\nCenter, Ames, Iowa. Neutrophils were isolated by the method described by\nOlchowy et al. (27). Purified cells were .96% polymorphonuclear leukocytes\nand .98% viable as verified by differential counts and trypan blue exclusion,\nrespectively.\n\n(ii) BAMs. BAMs were isolated from six 6- to 8-week-old healthy calves as\ndescribed previously (40). The cells were .98% pure and .98% viable, as\ndetermined by nonspecific esterase staining (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis,\nMo.) and trypan blue exclusion, respectively. For [Ca21]i measurements, BAMs\nwere plated onto round 15-mm-diameter glass coverslips at a density of 7.5 3 105\n\ncells/ml in 12-well tissue culture plates. Cells were incubated at 37°C in Dulbec-\nco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS)\nin a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The medium was changed every\nother day, and the cells were used after 4 days of incubation.\n\n(iii) PAMs and human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL60). PAMs were\nobtained from three 5- to 7-week-old healthy pigs as described previously (16).\nThe HL60 cell line obtained from M. Mellancamp (University of Minnesota, St.\nPaul) was cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 10%\nFBS.\n\nAntibodies. Table 1 shows the features and applications of the various anti-\nbodies used and in this study. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) MUC76A,\nMM12A, BAQ153A, BAT75A, and BAQ30A were purchased from VMRD, Inc.\n(Pullman, Wash.). MAbs R15.7 and R3.1 were provided by R. Rothlein (Boehr-\ninger Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, Conn.). The Lkt-neutralizing\nMAb (MAb601) was provided by S. Srikumaran (University of Nebraska, Lin-\n\ncoln). The R7928 polyclonal antibody was provided by C. Parkos (Emory Uni-\nversity, Atlanta, Ga.).\n\nFlow cytometry. The expression of b2 integrins on neutrophils, BAMs, PAMs,\nand HL60 was assessed by immunofluorescence flow cytometry as described\npreviously (34). Briefly, 106 cells were incubated with 1 mg of anti-b2 integrin\nMAbs or control MAb for 15 min on ice. After the cells were washed, they were\nincubated with 1:200 diluted phycoerythrin-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary\nantibody (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, Pa.) in fluorescence-activated\ncell sorting buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] containing 2% goat serum\nand 5 mM NaN3) for 15 min on ice. After the cells were washed, they were\nresuspended in 100 ml of fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer and fluores-\ncence was analyzed by a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Im-\nmunocytometry Systems, San Jose, Calif.) and expressed as mean fluorescence\nintensity (MFI).\n\nPreparation of cell lysates. Lysates were prepared as described by Lally et al.\n(23). Briefly, 5 3 107 cells were suspended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (pH 7.5) {200\nmM NaCl, 40 mM NaHCO3, 0.5% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-\n1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 10% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluo-\nride, 5 mg of leupeptin per ml, 5 mg of pepstatin per ml, 0.01% NaN3}, incubated\non ice, vortexed intermittently for 30 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 3 g at 4°C\nfor 1 h, and the lysates were stored at 280°C. Protein concentration of the lysates\nwas measured with the DC-protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.).\n\nSDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To demonstrate the b2 integrin expression,\n30 mg of cell lysates from leukocytes of control calves and 120 mg of lysates from\nneutrophils of BLAD calves were loaded and proteins were separated on 4 to\n15% SDS gradient gels under nonreducing conditions. Separated proteins were\ntransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Pierce Chemical Co.,\nRockford, Ill.), and the membrane was blocked with blocking buffer (PBS con-\ntaining 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and 1% milk concentrate (Kirkegaard and Perry\nLaboratories, Gaithersburg, Md.). The membrane was incubated with 0.1 mg of\nanti-CD11a (MUC76A), anti-CD11b (R7928), anti-CD11c (BAQ153A), or anti-\nCD18 (BAT75A and BAQ30A) antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Mem-\nbranes were washed 4 times with PBST followed by incubation with a 1:50,000\ndilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-\nbody for 1 h at room temperature. Both primary and secondary antibodies were\ndiluted in the blocking buffer. The blots were washed with PBST and developed\nby using the SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce\nChemical Co.).\n\nLkt affinity chromatography. Experiments were conducted by the method of\nWang et al. (35). Briefly, polystyrene beads (0.125-in. diameter) were incubated\nwith 2 ml of a solution of 20 mg of purified Lkt per ml of PBS, pH 7.5, overnight\nat 4°C with gentle rocking. The beads were washed once with PBS and incubated\nwith 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to block the remaining protein binding\nsites on the beads. Beads coated with 1% BSA served as a control. Lysates (120\nmg of protein from control neutrophils and BAMs; 480 mg of protein from\nneutrophils of BLAD calves) were diluted 1:3 with PBS containing 1 mM CaCl2\nand 1 mM MgCl2 and incubated with the Lkt- or BSA-coated beads at 4°C for\n15 h. To demonstrate that binding is attributable to Lkt, Lkt-coated beads were\nincubated with MAb601 for 1 h before adding lysates. To further demonstrate\nthe specificity of Lkt binding to the receptor, lysates from BAMs were preincu-\nbated with various anti-b2 integrin or control (MOPC21) (final concentration of\n50 mg/ml) MAbs at 37°C for 45 min before the Lkt-coated beads were added. The\nbeads were then washed once with PBS, and the bound proteins were eluted\nfrom the beads by boiling with 50 ml of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and size\nfractionated on 4 to 15% SDS gradient gels under nonreducing conditions.\nWestern blotting was performed as described earlier.\n\n[Ca21]i measurement. [Ca\n21]i level was assessed by video fluorescence mi-\n\ncroscopy as described in a previous publication (17) using fura-2-acetoxymethyl\nester (fura-2/AM)-loaded BAMs. Fura-2-labeled cells were alternately excited at\n340 and 380 nm with a rapidly rotating filter wheel, and the fluorescence emis-\nsions were collected for each wavelength using a 510-nm-wavelength barrier\n\nTABLE 1.

Images were acquired once every second using a silicon-intensified target\nvideo camera (66 Series; DAGE-MTI Inc., Michigan City, Ind.). The integrated\n[Ca21]i response, a measure of total [Ca\n\n21]i elevation during the period of\nstimulation, was calculated (17). To examine the effects of anti-b2 integrin MAbs\non Lkt-induced [Ca21]i elevation, BAMs were preincubated with anti-CD11a,\nanti-CD11b, anti-CD11c, anti-CD18, or control MAb for 45 min at room tem-\nperature prior to Lkt exposure. From each coverslip, ;30 cells were sampled and\ntwo coverslips were used for each experiment. The percent inhibition of [Ca21]i\nelevation was calculated as follows: percent inhibition of [Ca21]i elevation 5\n{(percent [Ca21]i elevation 2 percent [Ca\n\n21]i elevation in the presence of\nantibodies)/percent [Ca21]i elevation}.\n\nMeasurement of LDH release. Lkt-induced cytolysis was assessed by measur-\ning leakage of LDH activity from cells into supernatant, using a commercial kit\npurchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Indianapolis, Ind.). One hundred mi-\ncroliters of neutrophils or BAMs at a concentration of 4 3 105 cells/ml was added\nto each well in a 96-well U-bottom microtiter plate. Spontaneous LDH release\nwas measured by exposing cells to assay medium (phenol red-free RPMI 1640\nsupplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 3% FBS). Total LDH release was\nmeasured by lysing the cells with 100 ml of 2% Triton X-100 in assay medium.\nExperimental LDH release was measured by exposing cells to assay medium\ncontaining Lkt. Neutrophils or BAMs were incubated at 37°C in a humidified\natmosphere containing 5% CO2 for 90 min. After incubation, the cells were\ncentrifuged at 200 3 g for 5 min. One hundred microliters of the supernatant\nfrom each well was transferred to each well of a 96-well flat-bottom microtiter\nplate. One hundred microliters of reaction reagent (prepared according to the\nmanufacturer’s recommendations) was added to each well and incubated for 30\nmin at room temperature in the dark. LDH activity in the supernatants was\ndetermined by measuring the optical density at 490 nm with a microplate en-\nzyme-linked immunosorbant assay reader (Molecular Device Corp., Menlo Park,\nCalif.) with a reference wavelength of 620 nm. Each sample was tested in\ntriplicate, and Lkt-induced cytolysis was calculated by using the following for-\nmula: percent cytolysis 5 [(OD of C 2 OD of A)/(OD of B 2 OD of A)] 3 100,\nwhere OD is the optical density at 490 nm, A is spontaneous LDH release, B is\ntotal LDH release, and C is experimental LDH release. The effects of antibodies\nagainst the subunits of b2 integrins on Lkt-induced cytolysis were also studied.\nCells were incubated with different concentrations of antibodies for 45 min at\n37°C in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2 prior to incubation with Lkt.\nInhibition of Lkt-induced cytolysis was calculated as follows: percent inhibition\nof cytolysis 5 [(percent cytolysis 2 percent cytolysis in the presence of antibod-\nies)/percent cytolysis] 3 100.\n\nReagents.

Relative expression of LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150/95\nin neutrophils, BAMs, PAMs, and HL60 cells was determined.\nNeutrophils from control calves expressed CD11a (MFI of\n188), CD11b (MFI of 546), and CD11c (MFI of 80). The\nexpression of CD18 in neutrophils from control calves was\ndetected using three different MAbs (R15.7, BAQ30A, and\nBAT75A) with MFIs of 550, 480, and 1,800, respectively (Fig.\n1A). BAMs expressed CD11a (MFI of 41), CD11b (MFI of\n4.3), CD11c (MFI of 1.3), and CD18 (MFIs of 65, 82, and 87\nusing R15.7, BAQ30A, and BAT75A, respectively), albeit at\nlevels much lower than those observed for neutrophils (Fig.\n1B). However, in neutrophils from BLAD calves, very low level\nexpression of CD18 was detected by BAT75A (MFI of 60), but\nnot by the other two anti-CD18 MAbs. Neutrophils from\nBLAD calves also lacked expression of CD11a, CD11b, or\nCD11c (Fig. 1C). Expression of CD11a and CD18, comparable\nto levels in BAMs, was detected in PAMs and HL60 cells using\nanti-CD11a (R3.1) and anti-CD18 MAbs (BAQ30A) (data not\nshown).\n\n(ii) Western blotting. In lysates from neutrophils of control\ncalves, a 95-kDa CD18 band was detected (Fig. 2A, lane 1). In\nlysates from neutrophils of BLAD calves, two lower-molecu-\nlar-mass CD18 bands (90 and 85 kDa) were identified by using\nthe BAT75A MAb (Fig. 2A, lane 3). BAMs from control calves\nalso had two CD18 bands corresponding to 90 and 95 kDa\n(Fig. 2A, lane 2). A 180-kDa CD11a band was detected in both\n\nFIG. 1.

In lysates from neutrophils and\nBAMs, Western blot analysis also showed two bands, one cor-\nresponding to CD11b (170 kDa) (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2) and\nanother band corresponding to CD11c (160 kDa) (Fig. 3B,\nlanes 1 and 2). However, no CD11b (Fig. 3A, lane 3) or CD11c\n\n(Fig. 3B, lane 3) bands were detected in lysates from neutro-\nphils of BLAD calves. Lysates from PAMs had only a 95-kDa\nCD18 band (Fig. 4A, lane 1). In HL60 cell lysates, three dif-\nferent CD18 bands (95, 100, and 105 kDa) were detected (Fig.\n4A, lane 2). A 180-kDa CD11a band was detected in lysates\nfrom PAMs and HL60 cells (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 2). Table 2\nsummarizes the molecular masses of the various b2 integrin\nsubunits expressed in the various cell types studied.\n\nDetection of Lkt binding to b2 integrins. Polystyrene beads\ncoated with Lkt or BSA were incubated with lysates from the\ndifferent cells. Bound proteins eluted from the beads were\nseparated by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions, trans-\nferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed\nwith MAbs against CD11a (MUC76A), CD11b (MM12A),\nCD11c (BAQ153A), and CD18 (BAQ30A and BAT75A).\nBound proteins in eluants from beads coated with Lkt and\nincubated with lysates from neutrophils or BAMs from control\ncalves contained a 95-kDa CD18 band (Fig. 2A, lanes 4 and 5).\nIn contrast, bound proteins eluted from beads coated with Lkt\nand incubated with lysates from neutrophils from BLAD calves\ncontained a 85-kDa CD18 band (Fig. 2A, lane 6). In addition,\nin the eluants from beads coated with Lkt and incubated with\nlysates from neutrophils of control or BLAD calves or BAMs,\na 180-kDa CD11a band was detected (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 to 6).\nAlthough the eluant from Lkt-coated beads incubated with\nlysates from PAMs showed the 95-kDa CD18 (Fig. 4A, lane 3)\nand 180-kDa CD11a bands (Fig. 4B, lane 3), no such bands\nwere detected in the eluant from beads incubated with lysates\nfrom HL60 cells (Fig. 4A and 4B, lanes 4). Table 2 summarizes\nLkt binding to the various b2 integrin subunits in the different\ncell types used in this study.\n\nSeveral controls were included in this study to ascertain the\nspecificity of Lkt binding to LFA-1 in bovine leukocytes and\nPAMs. (i) The binding was abolished by preincubating Lkt-\ncoated beads with a neutralizing anti-Lkt MAb (MAb601)\n(Fig. 2A and B, lanes 7 to 9 and Fig. 4A and B, lanes 5 and 6).\n(ii) No evidence of binding was observed in BSA-coated beads\n(Fig. 2A and B, lanes 10 to 12 and Fig. 4A and B, lanes 7 and\n8).

In panel A, cell lysates from neutrophils show a 95-kDa CD18 band (lane\n1), lysates from BAMs show 95- and 90-kDa CD18 bands (lane 2), and neutrophil\nlysates from BLAD calves show 90- and 85-kDa CD18 bands (lane 3). The lysates\nfrom these cells show only one 180-kDa CD11a band (panel B, lanes 1 to 3).\nDirect binding of P. haemolytica Lkt to bovine LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) was also\nexamined. Western blot analysis of eluants from Lkt-coated beads reacted with\nneutrophils or BAM lysates from control calves contain 95-kDa CD18 and\n180-kDa CD11a bands (panels A and B, lanes 4 and 5). The eluant from\nLkt-coated beads reacted with neutrophil lysates from BLAD calves contain\n85-kDa CD18 and 180-kDa CD11a bands (panels A and B, lanes 6). In eluants\nfrom Lkt-coated beads preincubated with anti-Lkt MAb or from BSA-coated\nbeads, no CD18 (panel A, lanes 7 to 12) or CD11a (panel B, lanes 7 to 12) bands\nare seen.

Note that in lysates from neutrophils of\nBLAD calves, there are no detectable CD11b or CD11c bands (panels A and B,\nlanes 3). Direct binding of P. haemolytica Lkt to bovine CD11b or CD11c was\nalso examined. No Lkt binding to CD11b or CD11c is observed in eluants from\nLkt-coated beads reacted with lysates of neutrophils or BAMs (panels A and B,\nlanes 4 to 6).

MAbs against CD11 or CD18 subunits of b2\nintegrins were used to examine the correlation between Lkt\nbinding to the receptor and [Ca21]i elevation in BAMs. Cells\nwere preincubated with the MAbs (25 mg/ml for 90 min at\n37°C) prior to addition of Lkt (5 and 50 LU/ml). Anti-CD11a\nand anti-CD18 MAbs significantly (P , 0.05) inhibited Lkt-\ninduced [Ca21]i elevation in BAMs (65 to 94% inhibition in\ncells stimulated with 5 LU/ml and 37 to 98% inhibition in cells\nstimulated with 50 LU/ml [Fig. 6]). Anti-CD11b, anti-CD11c,\nor the control MAb (MOPC21) had no significant effects on\nLkt-induced [Ca21]i elevation (Fig. 6). Lkt did not induce\n\n[Ca21]i elevation in PAMs, a finding consistent with our pre-\nvious study (16) (data not shown).\n\nEffects of anti-b2 integrin antibodies on Lkt-induced cytol-\nysis. To examine the correlation between Lkt binding to the\nreceptor and cytolysis, neutrophils or BAMs were preincu-\nbated with anti-b2 integrin MAbs (1 to 100 mg/ml for 90 min at\n37°C) prior to addition of Lkt (50 LU/ml). Anti-CD11a and\nanti-CD18 MAbs inhibited Lkt-induced cytolysis in neutrophils\nand BAMs in a concentration-dependent manner (43% inhi-\nbition of cytolysis in neutrophils and 64% inhibition of cytolysis\nat 100 mg/ml in BAMs [P , 0.05] [Fig. 7]). Anti-CD11b, anti-\nCD11c MAbs, or the control MAb had no significant effects on\nLkt-induced cytolysis (Fig. 7). Inhibition of Lkt-induced cytol-\nysis by anti-b2 integrin MAbs was not studied in PAMs and\nHL60 cells, since Lkt did not induce cytolysis even at a con-\ncentration of 500 LU/ml (data not shown).\n\nComparison of Lkt-induced cytolysis in neutrophils from\ncontrol and BLAD calves.

Lkt-induced cytolysis was abolished by the Lkt-neutralizing\nMAb (Fig. 8). The isotype-matched control MAb had no effect\non Lkt-induced cytolysis (Fig. 8).\n\nDISCUSSION\nIn the present study, we sought to determine whether a\n\nmember of the b2 integrins is a receptor for P. haemolytica Lkt,\nwhether Lkt binding is target (bovine leukocytes) cell specific,\nwhether Lkt binding to the receptor is required for [Ca21]i\nelevation and cytolysis, and whether a correlation exists be-\ntween Lkt receptor expression and magnitude of Lkt-induced\ncytolysis. The results indicate the following. (i) LFA-1 (CD11a/\nCD18) is a receptor for P. haemolytica Lkt. (ii) The Lkt binding\nto LFA-1 is not target cell specific, since Lkt binding is ob-\nserved in PAMs. (iii) Lkt binding to bovine LFA-1 correlates\nwith [Ca21]i elevation and cytolysis, since anti-CD11a and anti-\nCD18 MAbs, but not anti-CD11b and anti-CD11c MAbs, in-\nhibit these responses. (iv) A reduced LFA-1 expression in the\n\nneutrophils from BLAD calves correlates with reduced mag-\nnitude of Lkt-induced cytolysis. However, the presence of any\nadditional Lkt receptor in bovine leukocytes cannot be ruled\nout by our studies.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that b2 integrins are receptors\nfor a variety of microbial virulence determinants such as fim-\nbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis (32), cryptococcal polysac-\ncharide (10), and endotoxin (11). A study by Lally et al. (23)\nhas shown that LFA-1 is a cell surface receptor for Lkt of A.\nactinomycetemcomitans and alpha-hemolysin of E. coli on hu-\nman (HL60) target cells. Since P. haemolytica Lkt exhibits cell\ntype- and species-specific functional effects on ruminant leu-\nkocytes (4, 13, 16, 40), it has been hypothesized that specific\nreceptors are present on ruminant leukocytes (3, 37). In this\ncontext, two recent studies have indicated that CD18 is the\nreceptor for P. haemolytica Lkt (24, 35). The evidence has been\nbased on the fact that MAbs detected a CD18 band in BL3 cell\nlysates reacted with Lkt. In addition, both studies showed that\nanti-CD18 MAbs inhibited Lkt-induced apoptosis or cytolysis\nin BL3 cells. However, a specific b2 integrin was not identified\nas the Lkt receptor by these studies. Therefore, we have ex-\ntended these observations and show that LFA-1, a specific\nmember of the b2 integrins, is a receptor for P. haemolytica\nLkt.\n\nThe Lkt affinity chromatography results of the present study\nwith neutrophils and BAMs and of other investigators (24, 35)\nwith BL3 cells demonstrate an interaction of Lkt with CD18. In\naddition, we provide evidence that Lkt interacts with CD11a,\nbut not with CD11b or CD11c. Therefore, we propose that the\nCD18 band identified in the Western blots is the b subunit of\nLFA-1 but not of Mac-1 or p150/95. In this regard, a previous\nstudy by Lally et al. (23) showed that Lkt of A. actinomycetem-\ncomitans binds to the LFA-1 heterodimer in HL60 cell lysates.\nResults from our laboratory (S. L. Hsuan, S. Jeyaseelan, M. S.\nKannan, and S. K. Maheswaran, unpublished data) using im-\nmunoprecipitation of lysates from bovine leukocytes show the\nexistence of LFA-1 as a heterodimer, rather than as dissociated\nCD11a and CD18 subunits. This finding, along with the finding\nthat Lkt does not bind to CD11b or CD11c subunits, suggests\n\nFIG. 7. Effects of anti-b2 integrin antibodies on Lkt-induced cytolysis. Pre-\nincubation of neutrophils or BAMs with anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs inhibits\nLkt-induced cytolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion. Anti-CD11b, anti-\nCD11c, or control MAb at 25 or 100 mg/ml do not inhibit Lkt-induced cytolysis.\nThe results are from six independent experiments and expressed as means 6\nSEMs. Values that are significantly different from the control value (P , 0.05)\nare indicated by asterisks.\n\nFIG. 8. Comparison of Lkt-induced cytolysis in neutrophils from control and\nBLAD calves. Significantly lower levels of Lkt-induced cytolysis are observed for\nneutrophils from BLAD calves than for those from control calves (P , 0.05). In\ncells exposed to neutralized Lkt, there is no Lkt-induced cytolysis. In cells\nexposed to Lkt treated with an isotype-matched control MAb (MOPC21), there\nis no inhibition of Lkt-induced cytolysis. The results are means 6 SEMs from\nfour independent experiments. Values that are significantly (P , 0.05) reduced\nfrom Lkt-induced cytolysis values are indicated by asterisks.\n\nVOL. 68, 2000 LFA-1 IS A LEUKOTOXIN RECEPTOR 77\n\n\n\nthat the binding site for Lkt is the CD11a, but not CD18,\nsubunit of the Lkt receptor LFA-1.\n\nWe have demonstrated that Lkt binding to LFA-1 in target\ncells (bovine leukocytes) is associated with [Ca21]i elevation\nand cytolysis. However, Lkt binding by itself is not sufficient for\nthe functional effects, since a nontarget cell (PAMs) used in\nthis study exhibits Lkt binding with no evidence of [Ca21]i\nelevation or cytolysis and shows NF-kB activation (shown in a\nprevious study [16]). Thus, the cell type- and species-specific\neffects of Lkt must entail both binding to LFA-1 and activation\nof LFA-1-associated intracellular pathways, which are present\nonly in bovine leukocytes. Studies are in progress to further\nelucidate this phenomenon.\n\nPrevious investigations have provided evidence by flow cy-\ntometric analysis that neutrophils from BLAD calves have no\nor weak expression of all b2 integrins (18). Our studies using\nflow cytometry and Western blot analysis confirm these find-\nings. Consistent with the diminished expression of LFA-1,\nthere is reduced Lkt binding. It is of interest to note that the\nCD18 bands in neutrophils from BLAD calves had molecular\nweights lower than those from control calves. In leukocytes\nfrom human leukocyte adhesion deficiency patients, the differ-\nent size of the CD18 protein is reported to result from aberrant\nsplicing (22). It is likely that the low-molecular-weight CD18\nproteins in neutrophils from BLAD calves may also be the\nresult of aberrant splicing. In addition, we have established a\ncorrelation between LFA-1 expression and the magnitude of\nLkt-induced cytolysis, supporting the hypothesis that LFA-1\nactivation is required for cytolysis.\n\nOn the basis of our findings, we speculate that Lkt of P.\nhaemolytica utilizes the cell adhesion molecule LFA-1 to cause\nactivation and cytolysis, particularly in the neutrophils and\nmacrophages in the alveolar spaces, leading to production and\naccumulation of a myriad of proinflammatory mediators and\ncontinuous colonization of P. haemolytica in the alveolar space.\nThese events result in an uncontrollable inflammatory re-\nsponse leading to lung injury that is characteristic of BPP.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was supported in part by grants from the Minnesota\nAgricultural Experimental Station (to M.S.K. and S.K.M.), NIH-\nHL057498 (to M.S.K.), NIDCR-DE09517 (to E.T.L.) and Mayo Foun-\ndation (to G.C.S.).\n\nWe thank Trevor Ames for helpful discussions, Christie Malaz-\ndrewich for help in collecting alveolar macrophages and critically read-\ning the manuscript, and Shelia Alexander for help in flow cytometry\nexperiments. We thank Charles Parkos of Emory University for pro-\nviding R7928 polyclonal antibody and Gary Averbeck for assistance\nwith graphics.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. Ackermann, M. R., K. A. Brogden, A. F.
