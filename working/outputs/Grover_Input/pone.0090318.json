China\n\nAbstract\n\nBaicalein, one of the major flavonids in Scutellaria baicalensis, has historically been used in anti-inflammatory and anti-\ncancer therapies. However, the anti-metastatic effect and related mechanism(s) in glioma are still unclear. In this study, we\nthus utilized glioma cell lines U87MG and U251MG to explore the effect of baicalein. We found that administration of\nbaicalein significantly inhibited migration and invasion of glioma cells. In addition, after treating with baicalein for 24 h,\nthere was a decrease in the levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 expression as well as proteinase\nactivity in glioma cells. Conversely, the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) and TIMP-2 was\nincreased in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, baicalein treatment significantly decreased the phosphorylated level of\np38, but not ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and PI3K/Akt. Combined treatment with a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) and baicalein resulted in\nthe synergistic reduction of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and then increase of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression; and the\ninvasive capabilities of U87MG cells were also inhibited. However, p38 chemical activator (anisomycin) could block these\neffects produced by baicalein, suggesting baicalein directly downregulate the p38 signaling pathway. In conclusion,\nbaicalein inhibits glioma cells invasion and metastasis by reducing cell motility and migration via suppression of p38\nsignaling pathway, suggesting that baicalein is a potential therapeutic agent for glioma.\n\nCitation: Zhang Z, Lv J, Lei X, Li S, Zhang Y, et al.

The most common\n\nand aggressive subtype is, classified grade IV astrocytic tumor, the\n\nglioblastoma (GBM) [3]. It is characterized by a high proliferation\n\nrate and invasiveness, which make it refractory to treatment of\n\nlocal irradiation, surgical extirpation, as well as conventional\n\nchemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) [4,5]. According to\n\nrecent statistics, the average lifespan expectancy of patients with\n\nGBM is still less than 14 months, despite several advances\n\nachieved currently in multimodal treatments [6].\n\nThe extracellular matrix (ECM) affects the biological behavior\n\nof both normal and neoplastic cells in several ways, including the\n\nregulation of cell attachments, and the motility and invasion of\n\nepithelial cells during embryogenesis, organogenesis, tumor\n\ndevelopment, and metastasis [7]. The breakdown of the ECM is\n\nmediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), particularly\n\nMMP-2 and MMP-9, which play important roles in degrading\n\nbasement membranes and cancer invasion and metastasis [8,9].\n\nTIMPs are the endogenous inhibitors of the zinc-dependent\n\nendopeptidases of the matrix metalloproteinase families\n\n[10,11,12]. Thus, the degree of ECM breakdown is controlled\n\nby the temporal release of MMPs and their inhibition by TIMPs.\n\nMAPKs are serine/threonine protein kinases that participate in\n\nintracellular signaling during proliferation, differentiation, cellular\n\nstress responses, and apoptosis [13]. The MAPK signaling plays a\n\ncritical role in the outcome and the sensitivity to anticancer\n\ntherapies. It has been reported that invasion and metastasis of\n\nglioma cells required specific intracellular signaling cascade\n\nactivations, among which the p38 signaling pathway is considered\n\ncrucial [14,15,16,17].\n\nBaicalein (5, 6, 7-trihydroxy-2-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)\n\nis one of the major flavonids with a defined chemical structure\n\n(Figure 1) in Scutellaria baicalensis that has long been widely used\nfor thousands of years in oriental medicine. Several biological\n\neffects of baicalein such as anti-viral, anti-hepatotoxicity, anti-\n\ninflammation, and anti-tumor properties have been reported\n\n[18,19,20]. However, the anti-metastatic effect and related\n\nmechanism(s) in glioma cells have not previously been determined.\n\nIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that administration of\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 2 | e90318\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\nbaicalein may inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of\n\nhuman glioma U87 cells via p38 signaling pathway in vitro.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nReagents\nFetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin and streptomycin were\n\nordered from Gibco. Baicalein, SB203580 and anisomycin were\n\nordered from Sigma. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium\n\n(DMEM) was purchased from Invitrogen. Anti-p38, anti-Phos-\n\npho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), anti-MMP-2, anti-MMP-9, anti-\n\nTIMP-1 and anti-TIMP-2 antibodies were purchased from Cell\n\nSignaling. Anti-b-actin was purchased from Santa Cruz.\n\nCell culture\nThe human glioma cell line U87MG and U251MG (obtained\n\nfrom a cell bank at the Fourth Military Medical University, China)\n\nwere cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml\n\npenicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. All cells were incubated at\n37uC with 5% CO2.\n\nCell viability assays\nCell survival was assessed using standard 3-(4, 5-dimethylthia-\n\nzol-2-yl)-2, 5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in\n\naccordance with previously described protocols [21]. Briefly, cells\n\nwere seeded in 96-well culture plates (26104 cells per well). The\ncells were treated with serially diluted concentrations of baicalein.\n\nControl wells received culture medium. After 24 h incubation, the\n\ncells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with 5 mg/ml\n\nMTT (Sigma) for 4 h. The solution was discarded after 2 h (37uC)\nand 100 ml DMSO was added to each well. The optical density\nwas measured in a microplate reader at 562 nm formazane\n\nabsorbance.\n\nIn vitro invasion and migration assays\nThe in vitro invasion and migration activity was measured\n\naccording to the methods described previously [22,23]. Cells were\n\npretreated with 0, 10, 20 and 40 mM baicalein or SB203580\n(20 mM) or anisomycin (5 mM/L) for 24 h, surviving cells were\nharvested and seeded to Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin\n\nJohn, MD, USA) at 10\n4\n\ncells/well in serum free medium and then\n\nincubated for 24 h at 37uC. For invasion assay, 20 ml Matrigel\n(25 mg/50 ml; BD Biosciences, MA, USA) was applied to 8 mm\npore size polycarbonate membrane filters and the bottom chamber\n\ncontained standard medium. Filters were then air-dried for 5 h in\n\na laminar flow hood. At the endpoint, the cells on the upper side of\n\ninserts were completely removed by swabbing, while the cells on\n\nthe bottom side of the filter were fixed, stained and counted. The\n\nmigration assay was carried out as described in the invasion assay\n\nwith no coating of Matrigel [24,25].\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR\nTotal RNAs were prepared by using the RNeasy Mini kit\n\n(Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript III Reverse\n\nTranscriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time quantitative PCR was\n\nperformed using SYBR Green II in accordance with the Prime-\n\nScript RT-PCR Kit protocol (TaKaRa). Gene-specific primer\n\npairs used for amplification were as follows: for b-actin, CCA-\nTCGTCCACCGCAAAT (forward) and CATGCCAATCTCA-\n\nTCTTGTTT (reverse); for MMP-2, CTCATCGCAGATGC-\n\nCTGGAA (forward) and TTCAGGTAATAGGCACCCTT-\n\nGAAGA (reverse); for MMP-9, GTCCACCCTTGTGCTC-\n\nTTCC (forward) and GCCACCCGAGTGTAACCAT (reverse).\n\nb-actin was used as an endogenous control. The analysis of the\nrelative gene copy number data for MMP-2 and MMP-9 was\n\nperformed using the comparative 2\n2DDCt\n\nmethod and were\n\nnormalized by b-actin in each sample.\n\nGelatin zymography\nThe cells were treated with different concentrations of baicalein\n\nor SB203580 at 37uC for 24 h, and samples of conditioned media\nwere collected. Briefly, the conditioned medium was adjusted to\n\nthe same quantity of total protein (5 mg per load), then treated\n\nwith SDS-PAGE non-reducing sample buffer without boiling.\n\nSamples were separated by 0.1% gelatin-8% SDS-PAGE electro-\n\nphoresis. Afterwards, the gels were soaked twice in 2.5% Triton X-\n\n100 for 30 min for three times at room temperature, and\n\nincubated in reaction buffer (10 mM CaCl2, 40 mM Tris-HCl\n\nand 0.01% NaN3, pH 8.0) at 37uC for 12 h. Gels were rinsed with\ndistilled water, stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250. The\n\ngelatinolytic activities were densitometrically quantified and\n\nanalyzed by an image analysis system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,\n\nRichmond, CA).\n\nWestern blotting analysis\nCells were suspended in lysis buffer (40 mmol/l Tris-HCl,\n\n1 mmol/l EDTA, 150 mmol/l KCl, 100 mmol/l NaVO3, 1%\n\nTriton X-100, 1 mmol/l PMSF, pH 7.5), after treatment with\n\ndifferent concentrations of baicalein,SB203580 or anisomycin,\n\nrespectively. The proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacryl-\n\namide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto PVDF membranes.\n\nThe membranes were subsequently blocked in defatted milk (5%\n\nin Tris-buffered saline with TWEEN-20 (TBST) buffer) at room\n\nFigure 1.

The membranes were then incubated with a HRP\ngoat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG antibody for 1 h at room\n\ntemperature. The bands were detected with an enhanced\n\nchemiluminescence kit (Amersham, ECL Plus, Freiburg, Ger-\n\nmany) and exposed by autoradiography. The densitometric\n\nanalysis was performed using Image J software (GEhealthcare,\n\nBuckinghamshire, UK), and the results were expressed as arbitrary\n\nunits (a.u.).\n\nStatistical analysis\nExperiments were repeated three times, and the results of the\n\nstudies were expressed as the means 6 standard deviation (SD).\n\nStatistical differences were analyzed by one-way or two-way\n\nANOVA and further by posthoc tests using the statistical software\n\nof GraphPad Prism 5. All statistical tests and corresponding\n\np-values were two sided. p,0.05 was regarded as significant. We\n\nperformed correlation analysis by the Z-test.\n\nResults\n\nBaicalein inhibits the proliferation of glioblastoma cells\nThe anti-proliferation effects of baicalein at various concentra-\n\ntions (0 to 60 mM) on U87MG cells are shown in Figure 2. At\n50 mM, baicalein obviously inhibited the proliferation of U87MG\ncells, while, at concentrations below 50 mM,the inhibition was not\nso significant; hence we chose a concentration range of baicalein\n\nlower than this for all subsequent experiments.\n\nBaicalein inhibits the migration and invasion of\nglioblastoma cells\n\nFigures 3 shows the effect of baicalein on cell migration and\ninvasion in U87MG cells that were treated with 0, 10, 20 and\n\nFigure 3.

Using a cell migration and invasion assay\n\nwith a Boyden chamber, we showed that baicalein reduced the\n\ninvasion and migration of U87MG cells substantially in a\n\nconcentration-dependent manner. Quantification analysis indicat-\n\ned that the inhibition rate of migration and invasion were\n\napproximately 25.7%, 58.3%, 76.7% and 41.1%, 65.0%, 80.4%,\n\nrespectively. Similar anti-metastatic effect of baicalein was\n\nobserved in U251MG glioblastoma cells (dates shown in Figure\nS1).\n\nInhibition effect of baicalein on the transcriptional levels\nof MMP-2 and MMP-9\n\nWe used real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) to investigate\n\nthe inhibitory effect of baicalein on MMP-2 and MMP-9 in\n\nU87MG cells. U87MG cells were treated with 0, 10, 20 and\n\n40 mM baicalein for 24 h and then subjected to RT-PCR. We\nfound that baicalein could significantly reduce the transcriptional\n\nlevels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in a concentration-dependent\n\nmanner (Figure 4A). The inhibition rate of MMP-2 was\napproximately 32.9%, 67.5% and 81.6% after 24 h of treatment\n\nwith 10, 20 and 40 mM baicalein, while, the MMP-9 was\napproximately 24.58%, 61.50% and 88.83%, respectively.\n\nBaicalein suppresses the expression and activity of\nMMP-2 and MMP-9\n\nThe expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in U87MG\n\ncells that were exposed to different concentrations of baicalein\n\nwere examined, because both MMPs are crucial to cell invasion.\n\nCells were treated with 0, 10, 20 and 40 mM baicalein for 24 h\nand then subjected to Western blotting. Figure 4B and 4C show\nthat baicalein significantly reduces the protein levels of MMP-2\n\nand MMP-9 in a concentration-dependent manner compared with\n\nthe control group. Gelatin zymography was performed to assess\n\nthe activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in cells treated with various\n\nconcentrations of baicalein. As shown by gelatinolytic activity\n\ndata, baicalein inhibited the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in a\n\nconcentration-dependent manner (Figure 4D). Quantification\nanalysis indicated that MMP-2 activity was reduced by 51.6%,\n\n88.6% and 98.5%, and MMP-9 activity by 22.0%, 57.9% and\n\n91.4% in cells that were treated with 10, 20, and 40 mM of\nbaicalein, respectively (Figure 4E).\n\nBaicalein promotes the expression of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2\nin U87MG cells\n\nImbalances between MMPs and TIMPs play important roles in\n\nglioma progression and metastasis [26,27]; thus, the protein level\n\nof TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in U87MG cells was assessed. U87MG\n\ncells were treated with 0, 10, 20 and 40 mM baicalein for 24 h and\nthen subjected to Western blotting. Figure 4F and 4G showed\nthat baicalein significantly up-regulated the protein levels of\n\nTIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\nThe p38 signaling pathway is involved in the\nanti-metastatic mechanism of baicalein\n\nIn human glioma cells, activation of p38 signaling pathway is\n\nrequired for the invasion process [28]. Moreover, the mechanism\n\nis correlated with proteinases and their inhibitors [29,30]; thus, the\n\neffect of baicalein on the p38 signaling pathway in U87MG cells\n\nwas investigated. We found that baicalein could reduce the\n\nphosphorylation of p38 in a concentration-dependent manner\n\n(Figure 5A and 5B), but not ERK1/2, JNK1/2 and PI3K/Akt\n(Figure S2).\n\nIn order to research whether the inhibitory effect of baicalein on\n\ncell invasion and MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression was correlated\n\nwith inhibition of the p38 signaling pathway, U87MG cells were\n\npretreated with a p38 inhibitor (SB203580, 20 mM) for 30 min\nand then incubated in the presence or absence of baicalein\n\n(10 mM) for 24 h. The results show that treatment with SB203580\nand baicalein significantly inhibited cell invasion (Figure 6A and\n6B) and reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression\n(Figure 6C and 6D). Meanwhile, the expression of TIMP-1\n\nFigure 4. Baicalein suppresses the expression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and promotes the expression of TIMP-1 and\nTIMP-2 in U87MG cells.

Furthermore,\nchemical anisomycin, a p38 activator, were used to confirm the\n\nrole of p38 signaling pathway. As shown in Figure S3,\nanisomycin activated p38 MAPK and could block these effects\n\nproduced by baicalein, suggesting baicalein directly downregulate\n\nthe p38 signaling pathway. These results reveal that the inhibition\n\nof both cell invasion and MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression by\n\nbaicalein occurs through the suppression of p38 signaling pathway.\n\nDiscussion\n\nGlioma, especially GBM with high morbidity and mortality, is\n\nstill a serious public health problem around the world [29], and as\n\na administration of the anti-tumor natural products baicalein has\n\nbeen confirmed in many cancers [31,32,33,34]. Up to now, the\n\nanti-metastatic effect of baicalein and related mechanism(s) in\n\nglioma cells are not clear. In the present study, we investigated\n\nFigure 6.

Degradation of the ECM of blood or\n\nlymph vessels is critical to metastasis, because loss of the ECM\n\nallows cancer cells to invade the blood or lymphatic system and\n\nspread to other tissues and organs. MMPs, especially MMP-2 and\n\nMMP-9, play critical roles in the degradation of type IV collagen,\n\na major constituent of the ECM, and are closely related to the\n\ninvasion and metastasis of various cancer cells [22,35,36,37].\n\nAdditionally, baicalein has been reported to cause down-regula-\n\ntion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in HCC metastasis [38].\n\nMMP activities can be restrained by TIMPs to prevent extensive\n\nECM degradation. Wang et al. showed that chrysanthemum\n\nindicum ethanolic extract (CIE) substantially suppressed the\n\nproliferation and invasiveness of a HCC cell line (MHCC97H),\n\nwith a notable decrease in MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and a\n\nsimultaneous increase in TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression [34]. In\n\nthe present study, we found that baicalein suppressed the\n\nexpression and activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and simultaneously\n\npromoted TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression in glioma cells; thus,\n\nthe MMP/TIMP balance was restored. These results indicated\n\nthat the anti-metastatic effect of baicalein on glioblastoma cells was\n\ncorrelated with modulation of MMPs and their inhibitors (TIMPs).\n\nThe synthesis of proteinases and their inhibitors are regulated\n\nby multiple signaling cascades, including the p38 signaling\n\npathway as well as ERK1/2, FAK, IKK, NF-kappaB-mediated\n\npathways [25,34,39]. p38 signaling pathway is widely expressed in\n\nvarious tissues and has much broader functions physiologically\n\n[29]. The role of p38 in cancer is disputable, and appears to be\n\ninfluenced by several factors, such as cell type, the extent of\n\nactivation, etc [40]. The p38 signaling pathway can induce the\n\nexpression of MMPs and thereby promotes the degradation of\n\nECM proteins, which leads to cell invasion [41]. To further\n\nexplore the possible mechanism(s) of baicalein in the inhibition of\n\nglioma invasion, we have detected the levels of phosphorylation of\n\np38 in U87MG cells. The results demonstrated that the\n\nphosphorylation of p38 in cells treated with baicalein was\n\nsignificantly reduced relative to that in control cells, whereas\n\nthere were no significant changes in the activity of ERK1/2,\n\nJNK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Baicalein combined\n\nwith a p38 inhibitor (SB203580) significantly reduced glioblastoma\n\ncell invasion and was accompanied by downregulation of MMP-2\n\nand MMP-9 and upregulation of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2. However,\n\np38 chemical activator (anisomycin) could block these effects\n\nproduced by baicalein, suggesting baicalein directly downregulate\n\nthe p38 signaling pathway.\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of\n\nbaicalein on the invasive and metastatic capability of glioblastoma\n\ncells. Furthermore, the downregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9\n\ninduced by baicalein is attributed to suppression of the p38\n\nsignaling pathway, which in turn leads to invasion and metastasis\n\nof glioblastoma cells by baicalein. These findings reveal a new\n\npotential therapeutic application of baicalein in anti-metastatic\n\ntherapy for glioma.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Effect of baicalein on the migration and\ninvasion of U251MG cells.
