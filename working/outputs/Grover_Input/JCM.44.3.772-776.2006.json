Piliated hemolytic Moraxella bovis is recognized as the etiologic agent of IBK.\nAccording to data from the Nebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, however, Moraxella (Branha-\nmella) ovis has been isolated with increasing frequency from cattle affected with IBK. The objective of this study\nwas, therefore, to examine M. ovis field isolates for the presence of the putative virulence factors of M. bovis.\nCulture filtrates from selected M. ovis field isolates demonstrated hemolytic activity on bovine erythrocytes and\ncytotoxic activity on bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells and corneal epithelial cells. The hemolytic\nactivity of the culture filtrates was attenuated after heat treatment. Polyclonal antibodies raised against the M.\nbovis hemolysin-cytotoxin also recognized a protein of approximately 98 kDa in a Western blot assay. These\ndata indicate that the M. ovis field isolates examined produce one or more heat-labile exotoxins and may\nsuggest that M. ovis plays a role in the pathogenesis of IBK.\n\nInfectious bovine keratoconjunctivitis (IBK) is a highly con-\ntagious disease that affects cattle of all ages and that occurs\nworldwide (27, 28, 31). The adverse economic impact of IBK\ndue to decreased weight gain and costs of therapeutic treat-\nment is estimated to be $150 million annually (27). Piliated\nhemolytic strains of Moraxella bovis are recognized as the eti-\nologic agents of IBK (5, 10, 11, 23, 35, 36, 37). Moraxella bovis,\nhowever, cannot always be recovered from clinical cases; and\nother organisms, such as Moraxella (Branhamella) ovis, Myco-\nplasma bovoculi, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, and\nadenovirus, have been suggested to play a role in the patho-\ngenesis of IBK (17, 19, 31, 37).\n\nAccording to data of the University of Nebraska Veterinary\nDiagnostic Laboratory System, M. ovis is isolated with increas-\ning frequency from cases of IBK. From 1999 to 2002, M. ovis\nwas isolated three times more often from field cases than M.\nbovis. Isolation of M. ovis from cases of keratoconjunctivitis has\npreviously been reported in sheep, goats, deer, and moose (3,\n14, 16, 17, 30, 33, 40, 41). In cattle, M. ovis has been isolated\nfrom IBK cases (17, 31); but the significance of its isolation is\ncurrently unclear because, in one study, experimental inocula-\ntion of calves with M. ovis isolated did not cause keratocon-\njunctivitis (17). These findings suggest that M. ovis is not a\npathogen or that additional factors may be required for viru-\nlence (9, 17, 32, 43).\n\nIsolates of M. ovis recovered from cattle with IBK have not\nbeen examined for potential virulence factors (6, 21, 26, 34,\n\n39). In an attempt to elucidate whether M. ovis plays a role in\nthe etiology and pathogenesis of IBK, the objective of this\nstudy was to investigate M. ovis field isolates for the presence\nof factors known to be virulence factors in M. bovis by exam-\nining the effects of M. ovis culture filtrates on different types of\ncells of bovine origin.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial isolates. Moraxella ovis isolates recovered from cattle with IBK were\npassed twice on Trypticase soy agar containing 5% sheep blood (blood agar;\nRemel, Lenexa, KS) and were stored at �80°C in 15% glycerol. A known virulent\nisolate of M. bovis, designated Epp63 (20, 35, 36), and a reference isolate of M.\novis (ATCC 19575) recovered from a sheep with conjunctivitis were used in each\nassay for comparison. Field isolates of M. ovis were identified by phenotypic and\nbiochemical criteria. Briefly, M. ovis colonies were 1 to 3 mm in diameter after\n24 h of incubation, firm, and hemolytic on blood agar; and they tended to slide\nacross the agar surface when they were touched with a Nichrome wire loop.\nMicroscopically, the M. ovis isolates were gram-negative cocci (0.6 to 1.0 �m)\narranged in pairs. All M. ovis isolates were aerobic and oxidase and catalase\npositive, and they reduced nitrate but did not ferment carbohydrates or liquefy\ngelatin (8, 13, 22, 30).\n\nPreparation of culture supernatants. Aliquots of each isolate from frozen\nstock cultures were streaked onto blood agar and incubated at 37°C for 24 h.\nCulture for hemolysin production during early-logarithmic-phase growth was\nperformed as described previously (20) but with modification. Briefly, three\ncolonies of each isolate from the blood agar plate were transferred into 3 ml of\nbrain heart infusion (BHI) broth (Remel) supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2/ml\n(Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO), and the cultures were incubated for\n18 h at 37°C. The cultures were then transferred to Erlenmeyer flasks containing\n50 ml of BHI broth supplemented with 5 mM CaCl2/ml and were incubated with\nshaking (200 rpm) for 4.5 h at 37°C. The bacterial cells were removed by\ncentrifugation (12,000 � g) for 10 min at 4°C, and the culture supernatants were\ntransferred to sterile centrifuge tubes. Each supernatant was filtered through a\n0.22-�l polysulfone syringe filter (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI), and\nthe cell-free supernatants (CFSs) were either used immediately or frozen at\n�80°C until use. An aliquot of each CFS was plated on blood agar to verify\nsterility.\n\nHemolytic activity assay. Bovine erythrocytes were washed three times with\nsterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and a 10% erythrocyte suspension was\n\n* Corresponding author.

The\nhemolytic activity of each CFS was analyzed in 96-well microtiter plates as\ndescribed previously (20) but with modification. Briefly, twofold dilutions (1:2 to\n1:2,048) of each sample were run in duplicate in 100 �l of a 0.15 M sodium\nchloride (Sigma) solution containing 10 mM Tris-Cl buffer (Sigma) and 10 mM\nCaCl2 (Sigma) buffer (NTC buffer). Wells with distilled water served as positive\ncontrol wells, and wells with NTC buffer served as negative control wells. One\nhundred microliters of 2% washed bovine erythrocytes in PBS was added to each\nwell, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Intact erythrocytes were\npelleted by centrifugation (1,500 � g) for 5 min, and 100 �l of each supernatant\nwas then transferred to a new plate. The absorbance (optical density [OD] at 410\nnm) was determined for each well by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent\nassay reader (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA). The mean ab-\nsorbance was calculated for each set of wells, and the titers were determined by\nusing the reciprocals of the last dilution with absorbance values above 5% of the\nmean of the positive control wells.\n\nTo determine whether the hemolytic activity of M. ovis CFS was heat labile, 1\nml of each CFS was incubated in a water bath for 30 min at 56°C and was then\nallowed to cool to room temperature. The hemolytic activity of each CFS was\nthen analyzed in 96-well microtiter plates as described above. In addition, each\nCFS was stored at 4°C for 24 h and the hemolytic activity was determined as\ndescribed above.\n\nPreparation of bovine PBMCs. Bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n(PBMCs) were prepared as described previously (20). Briefly, freshly collected\nblood in EDTA was centrifuged (700 � g) for 30 min at 4°C. The buffy coats were\nremoved and diluted with PBS, and the mixture was layered onto Ficoll-Paque\n(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and then centrifuged (700 � g)\nfor 40 min at 4°C. The PBMCs were then collected from the interface, washed three\ntimes in PBS containing 5 mM EDTA, and counted in a hemocytometer.\n\nCytotoxic activity assay. The density of the PBMCs was adjusted to a concen-\ntration of 5 � 106 cells/ml for the dimethylthiazol diphenyltetrazolium bromide\n(MTT) reduction cytotoxicity assay, and the cytoxic activity of each CFS was\ndetermined in 96-well microtiter plates as described previously (20). Briefly,\ntwofold serial dilutions of each sample were run in duplicate in 100 �l of 1�\nRPMI 1640 medium (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal\ncalf serum. One hundred microliters of the PBMC suspension was added to each\nwell, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. Following incubation, the\nplates were centrifuged (700 � g) for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded.\nOne hundred microliters of clear 1� RPMI 1640 medium and 20 �l of MTT\n(Sigma) dye solution (5 mg MTT in 1 ml distilled H2O) were then added to each\nwell, and plates were again incubated until a colored reaction product was visible\n(2 to 4 h). The plates were then centrifuged (700 � g) for 5 min, the supernatant\nwas discarded, and 100 �l of acid isopropanol was added to each well. Gentle\nagitation was used to dissolve the formazan precipitate. The absorbance of each\nwell was determined on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader by using\na test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. The percent\ncytotoxicity for each well was determined as follows: [1 � (OD of toxin-treated\nmononuclear cells/OD of untreated PBMCs)] � 100. The untreated PBMCs\nwere used as cell viability controls.\n\nThe cytotoxic activity titer in each well was determined by using the reciprocal\nof the highest dilution that caused the cytolysis of 50% or more of the target cells\n\ncompared to the level of cytolysis of the cells control wells. One hundred micro-\nliters of the PBMC suspension and 100 �l of RPMI 1640 medium were used to\nassess cell viability, and 100 �l of medium and 100 �l of undiluted CFS were used\nto assess nonspecific dye reduction.\n\nCorneal epithelial cell culture. Corneas were collected from three clinically\nhealthy calves immediately following euthanasia. After removal of the globes and\nthe attached conjunctival sacs, the ocular tissues were briefly rinsed with 70%\nethyl alcohol and were then rinsed twice with sterile 0.85% saline solution. A\nsterile scalpel blade was used to remove the cornea at the limbus, and the corneal\nepithelium was dissected away from the underlying stroma. The corneal epithe-\nlium was then rinsed three times in sterile 1� RPMI 1640 medium containing\n0.003% gentamicin sulfate (Sigma). The corneal epithelium was minced with a\nsterile scalpel blade in a sterile glass petri dish and then transferred to culture\nflasks containing RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum\nand 0.003% gentamicin sulfate (c-RPMI). The flasks were incubated at 37°C in\n7% CO2 for 72 h. After incubation, the medium was decanted and the flasks were\nwashed once with warm (37°C) sterile PBS. Fresh c-RPMI medium was then\nadded to each flask, and the flasks were again incubated at 37°C in 7% CO2.\nFresh c-RPMI medium was added to each flask at 72-h intervals or until 100%\nconfluent cell monolayers had formed. The confluent cells were detached with\n2.5% trypsin (Sigma), resuspended in c-RPMI, transferred to 96-well culture\nplates, and incubated at 37°C in 7% CO2 for approximately 72 h or until 90%\nconfluent cell monolayers had formed in the wells.\n\nCorneal epithelial cell cytotoxicity assay. Medium from each corneal epithelial\ncell monolayer plate was discarded, and 10 �l of fresh c-RPMI medium was\nadded to each well. Fifty microliters of a CFS was then added to each well, while\n50 �l of BHI broth was added to each control well. The plates were incubated at\n37°C in 7% CO2 for 2 h. Medium from each plate was then discarded, and 200\n�l of fresh clear c-RPMI medium was added to each well. Each plate was then\nexamined at �400 magnification with an inverted microscope. The assay was\nperformed three times in duplicate.\n\nWestern blot analyses of M. bovis Epp63 and M. ovis CFS. CFS proteins from\ntwo M. ovis field isolates, M. ovis ATCC 19575, and M. bovis Epp63 were\nseparated by standard 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-\nphoresis (SDS-PAGE), as described previously (38), and then transferred to a\nnitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). A kaleidoscope\nprestained standard (Bio-Rad) was used to assess transfer efficiency. The non-\nspecific binding sites on the membrane were blocked with 1% fish gelatin\n(Sigma) and 0.5% skim milk (Carnation) in PBS overnight at 4°C. The primary\nantibody, a polyclonal rabbit serum raised against a partially purified extract of\nhemolytic M. bovis strain T� (2) (kindly provided by L. George, University of\nCalifornia—Davis), was used at a 1:250 dilution in PBS. After 1 h of incubation\nin primary antibody at ambient temperature, the membrane was washed (PBS\ncontaining 500 �l/liter Tween 20 [Bio-Rad]) and then incubated for 1 h in a\n1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-\nlabeled conjugate (Promega, Madison, WI). Detection of bound secondary an-\ntibody was by chemiluminescence (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and autoradiography.\nNormal rabbit serum was substituted for anti-M. bovis antibodies as a negative\ncontrol in the protocol.\n\nFIG. 1.

The\nCFSs from all isolates demonstrated hemolytic activities in the\nassay, with titers ranging from 256 to 2,048 for the five M. ovis\nfield isolates and from 4,096 to 8,192 for the M. bovis Epp63\nisolate (Fig. 1A). Heat treatment of the CFSs before the he-\nmolysin assay was conducted attenuated the hemolytic activity,\nas the titers of the M. ovis CFSs observed after heat treatment\nranged only from 2 to 4 (Fig. 1B). This effect was also evident\nwhen heat-treated and non-heat-treated CFSs were run side by\nside for direct comparison (Fig. 2). In this series of assays,\nnon-heat-treated M. ovis CFSs had hemolytic activity titers of\n1,024 to 2,048 that were reduced to titers of 2 to 4 after heat\ntreatment. Non-heat-treated M. bovis CFS titers were 4,096 to\n8,192, and the titers after heat treatment were 8 to 32. When\nthe CFSs were stored at 4°C for 24 h prior to the assay,\nhemolytic activity was reduced by three- to fourfold dilutions in\nthe M. ovis CFSs (titer range, 32 to 256) and one- to three fold\ndilutions in the M. bovis Epp63 CFSs (titer range, 1,024 to\n2,048) (data not shown). Because of the consistent hemolytic\nactivities of their CFSs, field isolates 3 and 5 were selected for\nuse in the cytotoxicity assays and in Western blot analyses.\n\nCytotoxic activities of CFSs on bovine PBMCs. The CFSs of\nM. ovis field isolates 3 and 5, M. ovis ATCC 19575, and M. bovis\nEpp63 demonstrated cytotoxic activities on bovine PBMCs,\nwith geometric mean titers ranging from 64 to 16 (data not\nshown).\n\nEffects of CFSs on bovine corneal epithelial cells. Exposure\nof corneal cell monolayers to CFSs from M. ovis field isolates\n3 and 5 and M. bovis Epp63 resulted in cell detachment and\ncomplete loss of the cell monolayers within 2 h. The CFS from\nM. ovis ATCC 19575, however, did not cause any noticeable\nmonolayer disruption or the loss of cells (Fig. 3).\n\nSDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis of CFSs. The poly-\nclonal primary antibody recognizes a cluster of repeats in toxin\n(RTX) A proteins of M. bovis strain T� (2). These antibodies\n\nalso recognized several proteins in the M. bovis Epp63 CFS\n(Fig. 4, lane M. bovis Epp63). A cluster of strong bands mi-\ngrated at about 90 to 100 kDa, and another cluster migrated at\nabout 80 to 88 kDa. Several proteins were also detected in the\nM. ovis CFS (Fig. 4). The distribution of bands in all M. ovis\nlanes, however, was such that the more prominent bands mi-\ngrated at lower molecular masses. A single band of about 98\nkDa recognized in the M. bovis CFS was also recognized in all\nM. ovis CFSs. When preimmunization rabbit serum was used\nas the primary antibody, no bands were seen (data not shown),\nindicating that the bands detected by the anti-M. bovis serum\nare due to a specific antigen-antibody reaction and are not due\nto nonspecific binding of the antibody.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results of this study indicate that M. ovis isolates recov-\nered from cattle with IBK produce one or more heat-labile\nexotoxins that demonstrate hemolytic activity on bovine eryth-\nrocytes and cytotoxic activity on bovine PBMCs and corneal\nepithelial cells. The data indicate that, like the known virulent\nisolate M. bovis Epp63 (12, 20, 21, 25, 27), the M. ovis isolates\ntested also possess hemolytic and cytotoxic activities. The he-\nmolytic and cytotoxic activities of M. bovis are mediated by a\nhemolysin, a calcium-dependent, pore-forming RTX (2, 5, 7,\n12, 20).

Bars indicate the geometric mean titers of the hemolytic activities\nof the CFSs from M. bovis Epp63 and two of the five M. ovis field\nisolates (isolates 3 and 5), as in Fig. 1. Error bars represent the 95%\nconfidence intervals of the means. The results shown represent data\nfrom three independent replications.\n\nFIG. 3.

Monolayers of corneal epithelial cells were either not exposed to\nany CFS (negative control) (A) or exposed to M. ovis ATCC 19575\nCFS (B), exposed to M. ovis field isolates 3 (C) or 5 (D), or exposed to\nM. bovis Epp63 CFS (positive control) (E). Note the complete disrup-\ntion of the monolayers exposed to CFSs produced by field isolates 3\nand 5 and M. bovis Epp63.

Substantial\nattenuation of the hemolytic activity of the M. ovis CFS after\nheat treatment also suggests that the presumptive M. ovis exo-\ntoxin is proteinaceous, like the M. bovis RTX. Based on the\nobservation that the titers of the M. bovis CFSs were slightly\nhigher in this assay, it may be speculated that the M. ovis\nexotoxin is more readily inactivated. A similar tendency was\nevident when CFSs were incubated at 4°C for 24 h before the\nhemolysin assay was conducted. This difference could be due to\nstructural or conformational differences in the proteins or to\nthe activity of proteolytic enzymes released by M. ovis during\nlogarithmic growth (4, 18). The objective of this study, how-\never, was to examine selected M. ovis field isolates for the\npresence of potential virulence factors, and no attempt was\nmade to quantify the hemolytic or the cytotoxic activity.\n\nThe primary antibody used in the Western blot assay spe-\ncifically recognized the M. bovis toxin, but it also recognized\nseveral proteins in the M. ovis CFSs. A cluster of bands of\napproximately 95 to 100 kDa may be significant because this\nmolecular mass is consistent with those of recognized RTXs\n(18, 42), including M. bovis RTX A (1, 2). A single band in all\nM. ovis CFSs migrated at this particular molecular mass, sug-\ngesting some structural similarity. The identities of the several\nlower-molecular-mass bands present in the M. ovis lanes are\nunknown at this time. Other investigators have shown that\nfull-length RTXs degrade after only a few hours in culture, and\nspecific antibodies recognize several smaller degradation prod-\nucts (2, 18). If it is assumed that a toxin is present in the M. ovis\nCFS, it is possible that those lower-molecular-mass bands rep-\nresent the degradation products of a full-length toxin.\n\nThe M. ovis isolates examined in this study differed in their\nhemolytic and cytotoxic activities. This may suggest that the\nisolates are different strains, but no testing was done to deter-\nmine if these isolates were indeed different strains. The num-\nber of animal passages of each of the M. ovis field isolates\nreceived prior to laboratory isolation is unknown, and the\nnumber of animal and laboratory passages of M. ovis ATCC\n19575 is also unknown. Interestingly, M. ovis ATCC 19575 did\nnot exhibit any cytotoxicity to bovine corneal epithelial cells,\nalthough toxicity to erythrocytes and peripheral blood mono-\nnuclear cells was observed. Intraspecies variation (e.g., strain\ndifferences), as suggested above, does not likely account for\nthese results. It has been shown for M. bovis that only piliated\nisolates can adhere to bovine corneal epithelial cells (24, 29);\nand it is possible, therefore, that isolate ATCC 19575 was not\npiliated and could not adhere to the corneal cells to exert a\ntoxic effect. Some RTXs have been shown to specifically rec-\nognize and bind to a host cell receptor (15, 41), and it is also\npossible that the presumptive hemolysin of the ATCC 19575\nstrain lacked this ability. It is also noteworthy that the ATCC\n19575 isolate is of sheep origin, and a toxin produced during\npassages in sheep may act on the cornea in a strictly species-\nspecific manner but may act more promiscuously on erythro-\ncytes and PBMCs. The M. ovis isolates were not examined for\npiliation, and the reasons for differences in activity between the\ntwo M. ovis field isolates and the ATCC 19575 isolate remain\nspeculative.\n\nCurrently, piliated and hemolytic M. bovis isolates are\nrecognized as the etiologic agents of IBK. Data from the\nNebraska Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, how-\never, indicate that M. ovis is isolated from the majority of\ncattle with IBK. From January 1999 through December\n2002, samples from a total of 109 cases of IBK were received\nat the Veterinary Diagnostic Center. In 79 cases (72.5%), M.\novis was the only agent isolated, whereas in 18 cases\n(16.5%), M. bovis was the only pathogen isolated. In 12\ncases (11%), both M. ovis and M. bovis isolates were recov-\nered. Other investigators have isolated M. ovis from cattle\nwith IBK (17, 31), but experimental inoculation of calves\nwith M. ovis isolates did not cause keratoconjunctivitis in\none study (17). Although the M. ovis isolates in another\nstudy exhibited hemolytic activity on blood agar (31), they\nwere not examined for cytotoxic activity or piliation. These\nfindings might suggest that M. ovis, if it is pathogenic, may\nrequire initial corneal damage or other predisposing factors\nto cause disease in cattle. Moraxella bovis isolates differ in\ntheir virulence; some isolates readily cause disease experi-\nmentally, while others require corneal damage to cause dis-\nease (11, 19, 34). Differences in virulence may also be a\ncommon to M. ovis isolates. Since only piliated, hemolytic\nisolates of M. bovis are pathogenic for cattle (35), pili may\nalso be necessary for M. ovis to attach to and colonize bovine\ncornea and conjunctiva. This hypothesis should be further\naddressed by using M. ovis field isolates from cattle. Al-\nthough the results of this study indicate that M. ovis field\nisolates from cattle produce one or more exotoxins, further\ncharacterization of this suspected M. ovis toxin and studies\nthat examine the piliation of field isolates and adherence of\nM. ovis to the bovine cornea are necessary to substantiate\nthe potential role of M. ovis in the pathogenesis of IBK.\n\nFIG. 4. Detection of M. ovis CFS proteins by Western blot analysis.\nCFS proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a standard 10% poly-\nacrylamide gel and then subjected to Western blot analysis. The pri-\nmary antibody was anti-M. bovis rabbit serum. Molecular masses (in\nkDa) are indicated on the left; the arrow denotes bands of about 98\nkDa, the molecular mass recognized for different RTXs. The picture\nshown is representative of three independent assays.\n\nVOL. 44, 2006 POTENTIAL VIRULENCE FACTORS OF MORAXELLA OVIS 775\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/j\n\ncm\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment\nStation project NEB14-059.\n\nWe extend special thanks to L.
