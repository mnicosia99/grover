Knockdown of REST and USP37 prevented p27\nstabilization and blocked the diminution in proliferative potential that normally accompanied\nREST loss. Unexpectedly, wild type USP37 expression also induced the expression of REST-\ntarget neuronal differentiation genes even though REST levels were unaffected. In contrast, a\nmutant of USP37 carrying a site-directed change in a conserved cysteine failed to rescue REST-\nmediated p27 destabilization, maintenance of cell proliferation and blockade to neuronal\ndifferentiation. Consistent with these findings, a significant correlation between USP37 and p27\nwas observed in patient tumors. Collectively, these findings provide a novel connection between\nREST and the proteasomal machinery in the control of p27 and cell proliferation in\nmedulloblastoma cells.\n\nKeywords\nREST; proliferation; p27; USP37; deubiquitylase\n\nIntroduction\nThe RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST) is an important regulator of neuronal\ndifferentiation (1–10). It is expressed in neural progenitors, but downregulated in most\ndifferentiated neurons (1–11). REST binds a 21–23 bp sequence called the RE1 element\nfound in the regulatory regions of target genes through a centrally located DNA binding\ndomain. REST has two independent repressor domains located at the amino (N) and carboxy\n(C) termini of the protein (3–9). The N-terminal repression domain is associated with\nmSin3a and HDAC1/2, whereas the C-terminal repression domain complexes with co-\nREST, the chromatin remodeling protein Brg1, G9a histone methyltransferase, LSD1 lysine\ndemethylase, and HDAC1/2 (3–10). Acting through these complexes, REST represses target\ngene expression in neural progenitors. A number of these genes are involved in\nneurogenesis. The decline in REST expression at onset of neuronal specification derepresses\nthese target genes and allows terminal neuronal differentiation (1–10).\n\nConsistent with a role for REST in neuronal differentiation, our previous studies showed\nthat its expression is aberrantly maintained in the undifferentiated neural tumor of childhood\ncalled medulloblastoma (12–14). V-Myc immortalized murine cerebellar progenitor cells\n(NSC-M) that were engineered to constitutively express human REST transgene (NSC-MR)\nwere blocked in neuronal differentiation and formed tumors when injected into the\ncerebellum of mice (13). In contrast, the parental v-Myc immortalized progenitors (NSC-M)\nunderwent neuronal differentiation in vitro and failed to form tumors in vivo (13).\nImportantly, constitutive REST expression provided a proliferation advantage to NSC-MR\ncells in vitro (13). In the study described here, we evaluated if REST played a direct role in\nthe control of cell proliferation and also investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nSeveral studies have demonstrated the importance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor\n(CDKI) p27/Kip1 in the control of proliferation and cell exit in cerebellar progenitor cells\n(CPCs), the cells of origin of a subset of medulloblastoma (15–17). Mice that are\nheterozygous or nullizygous for p27 exhibit cerebellar enlargement stemming from\nhyperproliferation of CPCs (15–17). Cytoplasmic mis-localization of p27 is also associated\nwith uncontrolled CPC proliferation (18). These aberrations in p27 biology contribute to\nmedulloblastoma formation in the background of constitutive sonic hedgehog (Shh)\nsignaling (18–21). In the present study, we provide evidence that REST-dependent effects\non cell proliferation involve repression of a gene encoding a deubiquitylase (DUB), USP37\n(22–24). The absence of USP37 transcript in REST-expressing medulloblastoma cells was\nassociated with low p27 protein levels. Conversely, REST knockdown upregulated USP37\n\nDas et al. Page 2\n\nOncogene.

A significant correlation\nbetween p27, REST and USP37 was also seen in human tumor samples. Ectopically\nexpressed USP37 formed a complex with p27, promoted its stabilization, blocked cell\nproliferation and induced the expression of REST-target neuronal differentiation genes. In\ncontrast, ectopic expression of a USP37 transgene carrying a mutation in a conserved\ncysteine residue failed to rescue REST-dependent effects on p27, cell proliferation and\nneuronal differentiation. Since concomitant loss of REST and USP37 expression attenuated\np27 stabilization and differentiation and rescued cell proliferation, our data strongly suggest\nthat repression of USP37 and consequent p27 degradation, are important for REST-\ndependent maintenance of cell proliferation.\n\nResults\nREST controls cell proliferation\n\nREST has been mostly studied in the context of its function as a regulator of neuronal\ndifferentiation genes. Our previous studies showed that elevated REST expression in v-Myc\nimmortalized NSC-MR cells provided proliferation advantage to these cells (13). To\ndetermine if REST had a direct role in maintaining cell proliferation, we knocked down\nendogenous REST gene expression in DAOY and D283 medulloblastoma cell lines through\ntransient transfection of pooled REST-specific siRNA or control scrambled (scr) siRNA.\nREST knockdown was confirmed by Q-RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses (Figs. 1D\nand 1E). A decline in REST expression promoted a 50–60% decline in total cell numbers\nrelative to control scr-siRNA-transfected cell numbers (Fig. 1A). To determine if this\ndecrease in cell numbers upon REST loss was mediated by an effect on cell proliferation,\nDAOY and D283 cells with or without REST expression were co-stained for REST and\nKi-67 using specific antibodies and analyzed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Percent\ndecrease in Ki-67 staining in cells lacking REST relative to control REST-expressing cells\nwas between 50% and 70% (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometric analysis was also used to assess\nchanges in the cell cycle distribution of DAOY cells in the presence or absence of REST\nexpression. Loss of REST expression promoted an increase in the number of cells in the G1\nphase of the cell cycle from 53% to 63%, which was associated with a corresponding\ndecrease in the number of cells in S phase (17% to 7%) (Fig.1C). A significant change in the\nnumber of cells with a sub-G1 or G2/M DNA content was not detected, indicating that\napoptosis was not a major consequence of REST loss in our assays (Fig. 1C). REST loss and\nthe consequent increase in expression of its target gene Syn1, was also confirmed by Q-RT-\nPCR analyses (Fig. 1D). Western blotting also revealed REST loss to cause a decrease in the\nlevels of the pro-proliferative marker N-Myc and an increase the levels of the inhibitor of\ncell proliferation, p27, in DAOY and D283 cells (Fig. 1E) (17, 19–21, 25, 26). Levels of the\nCDKI p21 were elevated in DAOY cells but not in D283 cells following REST loss.\nInterestingly, REST expression was associated with the presence of slower migrating forms\nof p27 in both DAOY and D283 cells. Conversely, the increase in p27 levels following\nREST knockdown was accompanied by the emergence of a ladder of faster migrating forms\nof the protein. Nuclear localization of p27, which is important for its function as a CDKI\nwas also observed upon REST knockdown (data not shown). These data implicate REST in\nthe control of cell proliferation and potentially through regulation of p27 protein levels.\n\nREST and p27 are reciprocally expressed in human medulloblastoma samples\nThe relationship between REST and p27 observed in medulloblastoma cell lines was also\nvalidated in human tumor samples. Following Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approval,\nde-identified patient samples were co-stained for REST and p27 proteins using specific\nantibodies and studied by IFA. Staining in representative tumors and control normal\ncerebellum is shown in Fig. 2A (top panel). The corresponding hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)\n\nDas et al. Page 3\n\nOncogene.

REST was expressed in all\ntumor samples in a focally elevated pattern, but not in the control normal cerebellum. In\ncontrast, p27 was expressed in the normal cerebellum and either absent or present at low\nlevels in tumors. Specifically, a total of 45 human tumors were analyzed for REST and p27\nexpression and scored on a scale from no (−) to high (++++) expression. Approximately, 27\nof the 45 samples (60%) showing focal REST expression (+/++/+++/++++) had no\ndetectable p27 protein. A majority (16/27) of these p27-negative tumors exhibited very high\nREST expression (++++) and 12/27 of p27-negative tumors exhibit lower REST staining (+/\n++/+++). An additional 18 of the 45 samples (40%) with REST expression also expressed\np27 (+/++/+++) at levels lower or comparable to normal cerebellum (+++). The distribution\nof p27 protein as a function of REST levels is shown in Figures 2B and 2C. Overall, there\nwas a statistically significant difference in level of REST protein between tumors with p27-\nnegative and p27-positive tumors (p=0.0008, Wilcoxon rank-sum test; p=0.0006, T test).\n\nREST represses the expression of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 37 (USP37)\nThe laddering appearance of p27 protein in REST-expressing cells in Fig. 1E was suggestive\nof post-translational regulation and modification by high molecular weight adducts. A\nnumber of studies have shown p27 levels to be post-translationally regulated by\nubiquitination, which targets its for proteasomal degradation (27–37). To assess if p27 levels\nwere post-translationally controlled in medulloblastoma cells and required the proteasome,\ntranslation of new protein synthesis was blocked by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment (0–120\nminutes) in DAOY, D283 and UW228 medulloblastoma cells and p27 levels were measured\nby immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 3A, there was a substantial reduction in p27 levels\nfollowing CHX treatment, which could be prevented by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132.\nTo further evaluate whether the slower migrating forms of p27 seen in REST-expressing\ncells were ubiquitinated and whether p27 ubiquitination changed in a REST-dependent\nmanner, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) assays using extracts prepared from DAOY\ncells transiently transfected with REST siRNA or scr siRNA. IP with anti-ubiquitin (anti-\nUb) antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-p27 antibody revealed an increase in\nfaster migrating forms of p27 in immunoprecipitates from cell extracts lacking REST\ncompared to that from cells expressing REST. Reactions with control non-immune sera\n(IgG) were included as controls (Fig. 3B). Input lanes have been shown separately to\nhighlight differences in the slower migrating forms of p27 in cells that expressed and lacked\nREST. These results suggest that REST loss increased p27 levels by potentially affecting its\nubiquitination.\n\nSkp2, FBXW7 and KPC1/KPC2 are a few E3 ligases known to be important for p27\nubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (27–37). However, REST knockdown did not\ncause a change in the levels of these enzymes. Therefore, we asked if REST regulated the\nprocess of deubiquitylation catalyzed by a family of proteases called deubiquitylases\n(DUBs). A function of these enzymes is to remove ubiquitin moieties from proteins and\nprevent their proteasomal degradation (22–24, 38, 39). Since REST-target DUBs with\nactivity towards p27 have not been reported in neural cells, we searched for candidates in\nthe RE1-database that lists putative target genes based on the presence of the REST-binding\nRE1 element in the gene regulatory regions (40). This search identified a distal RE1 site\ndownstream of the gene encoding the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 37 (USP37) (40). To\ndetermine whether USP37 was a REST target gene, we first assessed if USP37 expression\nchanged in a REST-dependent manner. To this end, DAOY and D283 cells were transiently\ntransfected with REST siRNA or scr siRNA and analyzed 24 h later for the efficiency of\nREST knockdown and change in USP37 expression by Q-RT-PCR analysis using 18s RNA\nas an internal control and for normalization. As shown in Figure 3C, both DAOY and D283\ncells showed a significant increase in USP37 expression (4.5-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively)\n\nDas et al. Page 4\n\nOncogene.

Q-RT-PCR analyses also confirmed a substantial diminution\nof USP37 expression in REST-positive established cell-lines (Daoy, D283) and patient-\nderived primary cultures (UW-228, UW-426, MB-0110, MB-020 and MB-030) compared to\nnormal cerebella (Fig. 3D). REST binding to the RE1 motif in the USP37 regulatory region\nand in the positive control Syn1 in DAOY cells was confirmed by chromatin\nimmunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses (Fig. 3E). The signal obtained with control IgG pull-\ndown was subtracted from that obtained with the specific REST-antibody and plotted as\nrelative binding. Together these data indicate that REST controlled USP37 gene expression.\n\nThe relationship between USP37 and p27 was also evaluated by IFA in human\nmedulloblastoma tumor samples. Both p27 and USP37 were expressed in the normal\ncerebellum whereas their expression was not detected at all or to very low levels in human\ntumors (Fig. 4A, top and middle panels). The corresponding H&E-stained sections are\nshown in the bottom panel (Fig. 4A). Of the 42 human tumor samples studied and scored, 19\n(45%) showed staining for p27, while 23 (55%) did not. Of the p27-negative tumors, 18 did\nnot express USP37, 4 expressed low levels (+) of USP37, and 1 expressed modest levels of\nUSP37 (+++). Conversely, normal cerebellum expressed both USP37 and p27. Statistical\nanalyses revealed that USP37 protein expression levels were significantly higher in p27-\npositive than in p27-negative tumors (r=0.80, p<0.0001, Spearman correlation) (Figs. 4B\nand 4C).\n\nThe expression of these proteins was also studied in the normal cerebellum of postnatal day\n7 mice by IFA. USP37 expression was first seen in cells of the inner external granule layer\n(EGL) and was maintained in the inner granule layer (IGL) (Fig. 4D). p27 expression\noverlapped strongly with that of USP37 in these cells. Neither protein was detected in the\nouter EGL cells (Fig. 4D). These data provide strong evidence for a correlation between\nUSP37 and p27 levels in human tumors and in the normal murine cerebellum.\n\nConstitutive USP37 expression promotes p27 deubiquitination\nTo further evaluate the involvement of USP37 in the control of p27 ubiquitination, we\nstudied the interaction between the two proteins using transiently expressed, epitope tagged\nUSP37 (24). DAOY cells were transiently transfected with pDEST26 plasmid expressing\nFLAG-HA-tagged USP37 or vector alone. Transgene expression was measured by Q-RT-\nPCR analyses and Western blotting at various times following transfection (Figs. 5A and\n5C). Interaction between USP37 and p27 was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation\nexperiments using anti-p27 antibodies or control IgG followed by Western blot analysis\nusing anti-Ub antibodies. Although slower migrating forms of p27 that are presumably\nubiquitinated, were seen in the presence and absence of ectopic USP37, an increase in the\nlower molecular weight forms of p27 was observed in USP37 (USP37WT) expressing cells\n(Fig. 5B). A substantial increase in p27 protein levels accompanied by a gradual decrease in\nthe slower migrating p27 bands over time was also apparent In USP37 transgene-expressing\ncells (Fig. 5C). In contrast, a mutant of USP37 carrying a cysteine to serine change at amino\nacid 350 (USP37C350-S), failed to stabilize p27 (Fig. 5D). Transient transfection of Myc-\ntagged USP1 was also ineffective in stabilizing p27 (Fig. 5E). To confirm that USP37\nubiquitinated p27, we performed in vitro DUB assays using purified epitope tagged proteins\nfrom transiently transfected 293T cells. Addition of USP37 to a reaction mix containing\nHA-ubiquitin and Myc-p27 caused a substantial increase in the 27kD form of p27 and a\ncorresponding decrease in the slower migrating forms of the protein relative to reactions\ncontaining USP37 and a protease inhibitor N-ethyl maleimide (NEM) or USP37C350-S or\nUSP1 (Fig. 6F). Collectively, these data indicate that p27 ubiquitination and stability in\nmedulloblastoma cells is controlled by USP37.\n\nDas et al. Page 5\n\nOncogene.

Cells were stained with anti-Ki67\nantibodies and studied by IFA. Percent change in the number of Ki-67 positive cells in\nUSP37WT or USP37C350-S-expressing cells was measured and plotted relative to vector-\ntransfected controls (set to 100%) (Fig. 6A). Only 10% of cells expressing USP37WT were\nKi-67 positive in contrast to 70% Ki-67 positivity in USP37C350-S-expressing cells (Fig.\n6A). Unexpectedly, Q-RT-PCR analyses showed that WT USP37 expression promoted a\n2.7–8 fold increase in expression of the REST target genes Syn1, BDNF and SCG10\nrespectively, relative to vector transfected cells. A 1.2–2 fold upregulation of these genes\nwas seen in cells expressing USP37C350-S (Fig. 6B). These findings indicate that ectopic\nUSP37 not only blocked REST-dependent cell proliferation, but also countered the blockade\nto neuronal differentiation even in the presence of REST.\n\nTo examine if REST-induced p27 stabilization and maintenance of cell proliferation\nrequired USP37, we transiently knocked down REST gene expression alone or REST and\nUSP37 gene expression together in DAOY cells and the effect on p27 stabilization and cell\nnumbers was measured. Cells transfected with USP37 siRNA or scrambled siRNA were\nincluded as controls. Knockdown efficiency was measured by Q-RT-PCR analyses (Fig.\n6C). As seen in Figures 6D and 6E, REST loss promoted p27 protein stabilization whereas\nthe concomitant loss of USP37 countered this effect. This also countered the decrease in cell\nnumbers that was observed in cells lacking REST gene expression. Thus, our data suggest\nthat REST-mediated destabilization of p27 and deregulation of proliferation are mediated by\nUSP37.\n\nDiscussion\nREST is expressed in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), non-neural cells, and neural progenitors,\nwhere it prevents neuronal differentiation (1–10). However, recent work from a number of\ngroups, including our work described here, has implicated REST in the control of non-\nneurogenic processes (10, 41–45). We had previously shown that the aberrant maintenance\nof REST expression in medulloblastomas and the ectopic expression of REST in v-Myc-\nimmortalized neural progenitors (NSC-MR) blocked neuronal differentiation (13). Elevated\nREST expression was also associated with sustained proliferative potential in these cells\n(13). A role for REST in the control of proliferation seen in our studies is consistent with its\nexpression in the cerebellar EGL, where proliferating progenitors are housed, and its\nabsence from post-mitotic cells in the inner EGL and IGL (46). Our findings linking REST\nto the control of cell proliferation are also supported by a recent report wherein elevated\nREST expression was shown to promote proliferation in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells\nby causing a decrease in tuberous sclerosis 2 (TSC-2) and an increase in nuclear beta-\ncatenin levels (47).\n\nIn the current study, we suggest that the decline in cell proliferation in the absence of REST\nmay be a consequence of p27 stabilization. The inhibitory effect of p27 on the activity of the\ncyclinD-CDK4 and/or cyclinE-CDK2 complex is important for cell cycle progression in\nboth G1 and S phase (30, 48–54). Its importance in the control of proliferation of CPCs in\nvitro and for terminal cell cycle exit during neuronal differentiation in the murine\ncerebellum is well known (15–17). A decline in p27 levels or its subcellular mis-localization\nhas also been implicated in medulloblastoma development (18–21). While these findings\nclearly indicate the need for tight control over p27 gene expression, protein levels and its\n\nDas et al. Page 6\n\nOncogene.

In\nproliferating cells, p27 is ubiquitinated by E3-ligases such as Skp2, KPC1/KPC2 and\nFBXW7 and targeted for proteasomal degradation (29–32, 37, 52, 56). In our studies\nreported here we show that the decrease in p27 levels in REST-expressing cells stemmed\nfrom the absence of the DUB, USP37. Although the levels of known p27-specific E3-ligases\n(Skp2, KPC1/KPC2) were unaltered in our assays, we cannot rule out a change in the\nactivity of these enzymes at this time. Additionally, it is important to note that the\nintroduction of a conserved cysteine residue in USP37 may have caused a change in protein\nfolding and promoted its inactivation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a DUB\ninvolved in p27 regulation in neural cells (22). The involvement of USP37 in cell\nproliferation suggested by our data is supported by a previous report in the literature by\nHuang and colleagues (57). This excellent study showed USP37 to be important for\ndeubiquitylation of cyclin A and in S phase progression in 293T cells (57). However, we\nobserved an USP37-dependent decrease in cell proliferation in neural cells. Additionally,\nwhereas USP37 expression was found to be controlled by E2F and also subject to an auto-\nregulatory loop in the study by Huang et al., we showed it to be controlled by REST in\nneural cells (57). Whether these opposing effects on cell proliferation and cell cycle\nprogression is a reflection of fundamental differences in the regulation and function of\nUSP37 and or its target specificity in neural and non-neural cells is not clear at this time. In\nthis context, it is important to note that REST has tumor suppressive and oncogenic\nfunctions in non-neural and neural cells respectively (12–14, 43, 58–61). A future line of\ninvestigation would be to assess the role of REST, if any, in the control of USP37\nexpression in non-neural cells. If so, it would be important to also examine its connection to\nE2F-dependent regulation of USP37.\n\nIn conclusion, our study has uncovered a novel role for REST and USP37 in the regulation\nof p27 protein and cell proliferation, although a transcriptional regulation of p27 by REST\ncannot be ruled out. These findings add to a growing body of literature implicating DUBs in\ncell cycle control (62–69). Our data suggest that REST could potentially function as a\nmolecular switch that temporally coordinates cell proliferation with blockade of\nneurogenesis. This possibility needs to be evaluated in mouse models. The contribution of\nREST-USP37-p27 pathway to the development of neural tumors such as medulloblastoma is\nunclear and is a subject of ongoing investigation in our laboratory.\n\nMaterials and methods\nCell Culture\n\nHuman medulloblastoma cell lines DAOY and D283 were obtained from the American\nType Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained as previously described (70).\nPrimary cultures MB-003, MB-020, MB-0110, UW426, and UW228 were a kind gift of Drs.\nJames Olson, Laurence Cooper and John Silber.\n\nTransient Transfection\nDAOY and D283 cells were transiently transfected with On-Target plus Smart pool duplex\nsiRNA against human and mouse REST, human USP37 or On-Target plus si-control non-\ntargeting siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO) using DharmaFect transfection reagent.\nBriefly, cells were grown overnight in antibiotic-free serum containing medium and\ntransfected with 100 nM REST-specific siRNA, USP37-specific siRNA, or both siRNAs,\n\nDas et al.

Model to describe the novel role for REST and USP37 in the control of p27 levels and\ncell proliferation\n(A) REST is a known regulator of neuronal differentiation genes in neural progenitors and\nmedulloblastoma cells. Here, we show that REST also promotes cell proliferation by\nrepressing USP37 expression and causing p27 degradation. (B) USP37 promotes p27\ndeubiquitylation and prevents its proteasomal degradation, a process that is negatively\nregulated by REST.\n\nDas et al. Page 28\n\nOncogene.
