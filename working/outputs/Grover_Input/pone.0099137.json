infiltration within marrow cavity is one of multitudinous features of estrogen deficiency, which leads to a decline in bone\nformation functionality. The origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it is derived from osteoblasts, which\ntransdifferentiate into adipocytes that produce bone marrow fat. We examined the dose-dependent effect of 17b-estradiol\non the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC)-derived osteoblasts to\nundergo osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. We found that 17b-estradiol significantly increased alkaline phosphatase\nactivity (P,0.05); calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocn expression levels dose-dependently. By contrast, 17b-\nestradiol significantly decreased the number and size of lipid droplets, and Fabp4 and PPARc expression levels during osteo-\nadipogenic transdifferentiation (P,0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of brown adipocyte markers (Myf5, Elovl3, and\nCidea) and undifferentiated adipocyte markers (Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b) were also affected by 17b-estradiol during osteo-\nadipogenic transdifferentiation. Western blotting and immunostaining further showed that canonical Wnt signaling can be\nactivated by estrogen to exert its inhibitory effect of osteo-adipogenesis. This is the first study to demonstrate the dose-\ndependent effect of 17b-estradiol on the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs likely via\ncanonical Wnt signaling. In summary, our results indicate that osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation modulated by canonical\nWnt signaling pathway in bone metabolism may be a new explanation for the gradually increased bone marrow fat in\nestrogen-inefficient condition.\n\nCitation: Gao B, Huang Q, Lin Y-S, Wei B-Y, Guo Y-S, et al.

There exists an inverse relationship\n\nbetween bone marrow fat production and bone formation during\n\nosteoporosis, namely, adipogenesis is inhibited in patients with a\n\nhigh bone mass [2,3]. However, the origin of bone marrow fat, the\n\nphysiological role of adipocytes in bone marrow, and the reasons\n\nfor the increase in adipogenesis during osteoporosis and the\n\nabnormal adipogenic differentiation of BMMSCs are unclear.\n\nIn recent years, a correlation has been established between the\n\nosteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of bone marrow cells and\n\nnumerous bone metabolism diseases. Tuan et al. [4] have shown\n\nthat hBMMSC-derived osteoblasts, adipocytes, and chondrocytes\n\nhad the potential to transdifferentiate to each lineage, and these\n\nfindings provided new insights on the pathogenesis of skeletal\n\ndiseases such as osteoporosis. Nevertheless, If and to what extent\n\nestablished key factors or signaling pathways of normal osteogen-\n\nesis and adipogenesis play a role in the transdifferentiation process\n\nremains unknown.\n\nEstrogen can regulate several signaling molecules such as Notch,\n\nErk, and Ephrin, which function in bone metabolism [5,6,7,8].\n\nEndogenous estrogens also play an important role in the\n\ndevelopment of bone marrow fat. Not only does uncoupling of\n\nthe bone remodeling units caused by a decrease in estrogen levels\n\nespecially after the menopause, there is also a notable increase in\n\nadipogenic switch in bone marrow accompanied by a decline in\n\nbone mass [9,10]. Several studies have shown that estrogen is a\n\nnegative regulator of adipogenesis [11,12] and essential for\n\nosteogenic commitment [13]. For example, estrogen simulta-\n\nneously induces osteogenesis and inhibits adipogenesis both in vivo\n\nand in vitro, which led us to hypothesize that estrogen regulates\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99137\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0099137&domain=pdf\n\n\nosteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation and increases fat deposition\n\nin the osteoporotic marrow.\n\nThe wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling\n\npathway plays a fundamental role during embryogenesis and\n\nnormal cell development. Recent studies in humans have shown\n\nmutations in Wnt signaling molecules to result in different diseases\n\n[11,12,13]. Importantly, Wnt signaling also regulates bone\n\ndevelopment, adipogenic differentiation, and gene expression in\n\nwhole process of bone metabolism [14,15]. Specifically, canonical\n\nWnt/b-catenin signaling is highly animate in mesenchymal\nprecursor cells and in directing pluripotent cells, especially toward\n\nthe osteoblast lineage while inhibiting adipogenic differentiation.\n\nCanonical Wnt signaling is also involved in the suppression of\n\nadipogenesis. For example, canonical Wnt signaling stabilizes and\n\npromotes cellular and nuclear b-catenin levels, which inhibit\nadipogenesis [16], and the suppression of Wnt signaling is\n\nindispensible for PPARc induction and preadipocyte differentiation\n[17].\n\nAlthough estrogen can modulate Wnt signaling directly or\n\nindirectly and affect bone metabolism [18,19,20], it is not known if\n\nestrogen and Wnt signaling are involved in osteo-adipogenic\n\ntransdifferentiation. Therefore, we used estrogen-deficient murine\n\nin vitro and in vivo models to investigate the effects of estrogen and\n\ncanonical Wnt signaling on osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation,\n\nas well as to define the underlying mechanism.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nMaterials\na-Modified minimal essential medium (a-MEM) and Dulbec-\n\nco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) were purchased from\n\nThermo Scientific (Beijing, China).

In addition, 17b-estradiol increased (Fig. 1E) and\ndecreased (Fig. 2C) the levels of osteogenic and adipogenic\n\nmarkers, whereas there were no changes in cells simultaneously\n\ntreated with 17b-estradiol and ICI. To confirm the delicate\nchanges in osteo-adipogenic transdiffentiation, we examined the\n\nexpression levels of pre-adipogenic markers, namely, Dlk1, Gata2,\n\nand Wnt10b in MC3T3-E1 cells. Figure 2C showed that\n\ndedifferentiation preceded the process of transdifferentiation and\n\nwith the induction of adipogensis getting longer, fully-differenti-\n\nated osteoblasts regained their ability to multi-differentiate into the\n\nadipogenic lineage, whereas fully-differentiated adipocytes dedif-\n\nferentiated in the presence of 17b-estradiol. Figure 2D also showed\nthat 17b-Estradiol downregulated the expression levels of brown\nadipocyte markers, namely, Myf5, Elovl3, and Cidea, during\n\ntransdifferentiation, indicating that activation of brown adipogenic\n\ngenes may be occurring, but at a much later stage in the\n\ntransdifferentiation process.\n\nEstrogen Dose-dependently Regulates the Osteo-\nadipogenesis Transdifferentiation of Primary BMMSCs\nTo expand the role of 17b-estradiol in transdifferentiation, we\n\nused an ovariectomized C57BL/6 mouse model to investigate the\n\nability of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts to transdifferentiate under\n\nosteoporotic conditions.

ALP activity assay, and alizarin red and oil red\n\nstaining (Fig. 3A, B, and Fig. 4A) also showed differences in osteo-\n\nadipogenic transdifferentiation between groups. Specifically, the\n\nmineralized matrix area of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the\n\nOVX group was smaller than that of cells from the control. The\n\nmorphology of fully-differentiated osteoblasts from the OVX\n\ngroup was also different compared to that of control cells, with a\n\nmarked increase in the number and size of lipid droplets.\n\nTo determine the optimal concentration of 17b-estradiol for the\ninduction of transdifferentiation, BMMSCs derived osteoblasts\n\nwere treated with increasing concentrations of the hormone. Our\n\nresults showed transdifferentiation of BMMSCs derived osteoblasts\n\nfrom the OVX group to decrease with increasing concentration of\n\n17b-estradiol. This was accompanied by an increase in the\nmineralized matrix area and a decrease in the number and size of\n\nlipid droplets as shown by an ALP activity assay, and alizarin red\n\nand oil red staining (Fig. 3A, B, and Fig. 4A). However, there was\n\nno difference in the ability of cells treated with 17b-estradiol at\n161027 M and 561027 M to transdifferentiate by RT-PCR and\nmorphological analysis. These findings were supported by results\n\nfrom the calcium deposition, and the quantification of lipid\n\nnumber and size (Fig. 3C, D and Fig. 4B). To inhibit\n\ntransdifferentiation, 17b-estradiol was used at 161026 and\n161025 M; however, there were no changes compared to\n161027 M. Thus, the potential for osteo-adpogenic transdiffer-\nentiation was greater in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the\n\nOVX group than that of control cells, and with the intervention of\n\noptimum concentrations of 17beta-estradiol, the potential got\n\nweaker, which further proved the dose-dependent effect of\n\nestrogen on the transdifferentiation process.\n\nEstrogen Suppresses Osteo-adipogenic\nTransdifferentiation via Canonical Wnt Signaling\nTo understand the role of canonical Wnt signaling in osteo-\n\nadipogenic transdifferentiation, we used recombinant WNT-3a\n\nand DKK-1 proteins to activate and inhibit this pathway,\n\nrespectively. We found significant increases in ALP staining and\n\nactivity; calcium deposition; and Alp, Col1a1, Runx2, and Ocn\n\nexpression levels in cells treated with WNT-3a, 17b-estradiol, and\nICI (P,0.05) (Fig. 5G). However, there was a decrease in the\n\nexpression levels of bone formation markers when cells were\n\ntreated with 17b-estradiol and DKK-1 (Fig. 5A, B, D, and E). The\nco-incubation of cells with 17b-estradiol and DKK-1 also\nincreased the number and size of lipid droplets (Fig. 5C, F) and\n\nreduced Fabp4, PPARc, Dlk1, Gata2, and Wnt10b expression levels\n(Fig. 5H). By contrast, the incubation of cells with 17b-estradiol,\nWNT-3a, and ICI decreased the expression levels of adipogenic\n\nmarkers. Furthermore, western blotting and immunocytochemis-\n\ntry showed canonical Wnt signaling to affect osteo-adipogeic\n\ntransdifferentiation in the presence of estrogen and ICI. Specif-\n\nically, Western blot showed that Wnt-3a accompanied with\n\n10\n27\n\nM of 17beta-estradiol and ICI increased b-catenin expres-\nsion level, while reduced the expression of GSK-3b level.

Moreover, immunostaining showed that WNT-\n\n3a, 17b-estradiol, and ICI increased the levels of total and the\nrelative nuclear b-catenin while decreased the level of total Gsk-\n3b, whereas DKK-1 inhibited the effect induced by 10\n\n27\nM of\n\n17b-estradiol (Fig. 6B, C).\nFrom the data presented above, we firmly believed that dose-\n\ndependent estrogen can inhibit the osteo-adipogenic transdiffer-\n\nention effect of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine BMMSCs derived\n\nosteoblasts via partially or maybe dependently controlling\n\ncanonical Wnt signaling pathway.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study showed for the first time the dose-responsive effect of\n\n17b-estradiol on the ability of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine\nBMMSC-derived osteoblasts to transdifferentiate into adipocytes\n\nlikely via the canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Transdifferentia-\n\ntion is the irreversible switching of differentiated cells that\n\nsometimes occurs during disease [29]. It occurs when partially\n\ndifferentiated cells (e.g., pre-osteoblasts) switch to another lineage\n\n(e.g., adipocytes) [30]. This phenomenon can occur between\n\ncommitted or differentiated osteoblasts and adipocytes, and it has\n\neven been reported to occur at the single cell level [31,32,33,34].\n\nThe adipogenic transdifferentiation potential of MC3T3-E1\n\ncells has been previously shown by the ectopic expression of\n\nadipogenic transcription factors, namely, PPARc, C/EBPa, or both\n[35]. Moreover, several factors can regulate osteo-adipogenic\n\ntransdifferentiation, which is consistent with our finding that 17b-\nestradiol can inhibit the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation of\n\nMC3T3-E1 cells. In this study, we used time-dependent in vitro\n\ntransdifferentiation models and reported that MC3T3-E1 cells\n\nunderwent osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation under proper\n\nconditions. With increasing time after osteogenic induction, the\n\nosteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation potential decreased. Specifi-\n\ncally, the transdifferentiation potential of 3- and 7-day-old\n\nosteogenic MC3T3-E1 cells was higher than that of 14- and 21-\n\nday-old cells (Fig. S1). However, 3- and 7- day-old osteogenic\n\nMC3T3-E1 cells did not fully differentiate into mature osteoblasts.\n\nTherefore, the osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation effect of them\n\ncan hardly win applause. Moreover, the osteo-adipogenic\n\ntransdifferentiation potential of 21-day-old osteogenic MC3T3-\n\nE1 cells was hardly observed both by RT-PCR and morphological\n\nanalysis. Therefore, transdifferentiation was studied in 14-day-old\n\nosteogenic adipocytes.\n\nEstrogen can regulate the differentiation potential of BMMSCs\n\ninto the osteoblast or adipocyte lineage. Recent studies have\n\nshown a correlation between a decreased estrogen level after\n\nmenopause and a marked increase in bone marrow adipogenesis\n\n[9,10]. In light of these findings, we used an ovariectomized mouse\n\nmodel to investigate the effects of 17b-estradiol on transdiffer-\nentiation. We found the transdifferentiation potential to be higher\n\nin BMMSCs derived osteoblasts from the OVX group than that of\n\ncontrol cells. In addition, increasing concentrations of 17b-\nestradiol could partially or completely reverse osteo-adipogenic\n\ntransdifferentiation in BMMSCs derived osteoblasts, illustrating\n\nthe dose-dependent effects of estrogen. Although estrogen has\n\nbeen shown to inhibit and promote adipogenesis and osteogenesis\n\nboth in vivo and in vitro, respectively [9,36,37], this is the first study\n\nto demonstrate the dose-dependent effect of estrogen on the osteo-\n\nadipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells and murine\n\nBMMSCs derived osteoblasts and further efforts should be made\n\nurgently to clarify the detailed mechanism among the magic\n\ntransdifferentiation process.\n\nSantanam et al. showed that an in vitro E2 concentration of\n\n10\n29\n\nto 10\n28\n\nM is generally regarded as a physiologic concen-\n\ntration. Although men have lower estrogen level compared to\n\nwomen, the level may be still higher than the physiologic level\n\nwhich is enough to maintain bone mass in vivo [38]. Moreover,\n\nthe mechanism of osteoporosis is very complex and estrogen only\n\nfunctions as one part of the metabolism process. There are still\n\nmany other factors which control the bone mass such as androgens\n\n[39], PTH [40], mechanical stress [41], diet [42] and metabolism\n\nof calcium and phosphorous [43]. And these factors might\n\ncompensate the role of low-level estrogen on bone metabolism of\n\nmen.\n\nHaving established that MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSC-derived\n\nosteoblasts transdifferentiated into adipocytes, the expression levels\n\nof several brown fat-specific markers were examined to determine\n\nwhether the cells being formed were white or brown adipocytes.\n\nRecent findings from lineage tracing studies have shown that\n\nbrown adipocytes develop in vivo from a myf5-positive progenitor\n\ncell [44], suggesting that myf5-expressing MC3T3-E1 cells and\n\nBMMSCs might develop into brown adipocytes. In this study, myf5\n\nexpression in MC3T3-E1 cells and BMMSCs was upregulated\n\nwhen cells were cultured in adipogenic medium. Other brown\n\nadipocyte-specific markers such as Elovl3 and Cidea were also\n\nactivated in cells cultured in adipogenic medium, but not until day\n\n7 of adipogenic differentiation, and their expression was more\n\nvariable. These results demonstrate that activation of brown\n\nadipogenic genes may be occurring, but at a later stage in the\n\ntransdifferentiation process, for which further investigation is\n\nrequired. Although 17b-estradiol failed to upregulate brown fat\ngenes, our results indicate that the dose-dependent changes in lipid\n\naccumulation correlate with white rather than brown adipogen-\n\nesis.\n\nWe also found that osteo-adipogenic transdifferention upregu-\n\nlated adipogenic markers such as PPARc and Fabp4, but\ndownregulated osteogenic markers such as Alp, Runx2, Col1a1,\n\nand Ocn. Moreover, the expression levels of Dlk1, Gata2, and\n\nWnt10b, which are highly expressed in undifferentiated preadipo-\n\ncytes, were induced. These results indicate that transdifferentiation\n\nprocess combines the effect of transdifferentiation, dedifferentia-\n\ntion, proliferation and differentiation together. Specifically, the\n\ndedifferentiation effect was indeed happened prior to the\n\ntransdifferentiation, and with the induction of adipogenesis getting\n\nlonger, fully-differentiated osteoblasts regained the multi-differen-\n\ntiation potential and then differentiated to adipogenic lineage.\n\nWhat’s more, under the intervention of 17b-estradiol, fully-\ndifferentiated mature adipocyte could be dedifferentiating again.\n\nGustafson et al. [45] have shown that Wnt signaling in mature\n\nadipocytes increases the b-catenin level, resulting in the dediffer-\nentiation of 3T3L1 pre-adipocyte cells, which may have been\n\nmodulated by canonical Wnt signaling [46,47,48]. Activation of\n\ncanonical Wnt signaling has been reported to inhibit adipogenesis\n\n[16], and inhibition of Wnt signaling, especially WNT-3a, is\n\nessential for PPARc upregulation and preadipocyte differentiation\n[17]. These findings are in line with previous studies that show the\n\ninvolvement of estrogen and canonical Wnt signaling in bone\n\nmetabolism [18,19,20]. Luis et al. have also demonstrated that the\n\ntransdifferentiation of human osteoblasts into adipocytes increased\n\nafter treatment with fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor blocker.\n\nThey also suspected the transdifferentiation process might be\n\nrelated to down-regulation of b-catenin [49]. These inspired us\nabout the mechanism of Wnt signaling on the transdifferentiation\n\nEstrogen Suppresses Transdifferentiation via Wnt Signaling Pathway\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 9 June 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 6 | e99137\n\n\n\nof MC3T3-E1 cells and primary murine BMMSCs derived\n\nosteoblasts under estrogen control.\n\nWe used MC3T3-E1 cells to investigate the roles of estrogen\n\nand canonical Wnt signaling in osteo-adipogenic transdifferentia-\n\ntion. 17b-estradiol dose-dependently inhibited the transdifferentia-\ntion of MC3T3-E1 cells via canonical Wnt signaling partially or\n\ndependently. RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunocytochem-\n\nistry results showed that WNT-3a activated canonical Wnt\n\nsignaling and inhibited osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation inde-\n\npendent of 17b-estradiol and ICI. DKK-1 also blocked canonical\nWnt signaling to relieve the inhibition of the osteo-adipogenic\n\ntransdifferentiation from the presence of 17b-estradiol. These data\nindicate that canonical Wnt signaling might act downstream of\n\nestrogen to regulate osteo-adipogenic transdifferentiation. These\n\nresults also support the plasticity of MC3T3-E1 cells and\n\nBMMSC-derived osteoblasts, and they suggest that these cells\n\ncan be used for cell engineering. In light of the findings that\n\ncanonical Wnt signaling induces the dedifferentiation of fully-\n\ndifferentiated adipocytes and inhibits the transdifferentiation of\n\nosteoblasts, it is possible that perturbations in this signaling cascade\n\nmay result in bone metabolism diseases such as osteoporosis.\n\nGiven the widespread prevalence of estrogen deficiency,\n\nespecially in post-menopausal women, it is important to under-\n\nstand the role of this hormone in osteo-adipogenic transdiffer-\n\nentiation. Moreover, the involvement of canonical Wnt signaling\n\nin this cellular process is likely to provide further insights on the\n\npathogenesis of osteoporosis.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Effect of different time-point of the osteo-\nadipogenic transdifferentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells.\nMC3T3-E1 cells were divided with two groups.
