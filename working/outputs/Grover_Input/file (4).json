Our results showed that jacaric acid exhibited no significant cytotoxicity\n\non the thioglycollate-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages as revealed by the neutral red\n\nuptake assay, but markedly increased their cytostatic activity on the T-cell lymphoma MBL-\n\n2 cells as measured by the fluorometric CyQuant1 NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. Flow\n\ncytometric analysis indicated that jacaric acid could enhance the endocytic activity of mac-\n\nrophages and elevated their intracellular production of superoxide anion. Moreover, jacaric\n\nacid-treated macrophages showed an increase in the production of nitric oxide which was\n\naccompanied by an increase in the expression level of inducible nitric oxide synthase pro-\n\ntein. In addition, the secretion of several pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interferon-γ,\n\ninterleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α, was up-regulated. Collectively, our results indi-\n\ncated that the naturally-occurring CLNA isomer, jacaric acid, could exhibit immunomodulat-\n\ning activity on the murine peritoneal macrophages in vitro, suggesting that this CLNA\nisomer may act as an immunopotentiator which can be exploited for the treatment of some\n\nimmunological disorders with minimal toxicity and fewer side effects.\n\nIntroduction\nConjugated fatty acids (CFA) are a mixture of the positional and geometric isomers of polyun-\nsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) with conjugated double bonds, in which two carbon-carbon dou-\nble bonds are separated solely by one carbon-carbon single bond [1]. The most common and\nnaturally-occurring CFA include conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) and conjugated linolenic\nacids (CLNA). Previous reports indicated that CLA can be found in meat and dairy products of\nruminant animals [2] while CLNA occur in different plant seed oils [3]. CLA have been studied\nmost extensively in view of their diverse metabolic and physiological effects [4,5] while CLNA\nhave received increasing attention in recent years due to their relative abundance (up to 30–\n70% of total lipids) in some plant seed oils [3,6]. Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have\nshown that CLNA exhibit pleiotropic physiological and pharmacological activities, including\n\nPLOSONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0143684 December 2, 2015 1 / 16\n\nOPEN ACCESS\n\nCitation: Liu WN, Leung KN (2015) The\nImmunomodulatory Activity of Jacaric Acid, a\nConjugated Linolenic Acid Isomer, on Murine\nPeritoneal Macrophages.

An\nearlier report showed that consumption of punicic acid (9Z, 11E, 13Z-CLNA isomer) that is\npresent in pomegranate seed oil could enhance the function of B-cells, which play a central role\nin humoral immune response [9]. It was found that the splenocytes isolated from C57BL/6N\nmice fed with 0.12% or 1.2% pomegranate seed oil produced larger amounts of IgG and IgM,\nthe major immunoglobulins involved in the antigenic response mediated by the B-cells. In\naddition, Ike et al. (2005) reported that α-eleostearic acid (9Z, 11E, 13E-CLNA isomer) found\nin bitter gourd could induce IFN-γ production in mice treated with heat-inactivated Propioni-\nbacterium acnes, suggesting that T-helper 1 (Th1) cellular immunity, which is essential for pre-\nventing intracellular parasitic infection, could be activated by α-eleostearic acid [10]. A review\nof the current literature has shown that different CLA isomers (9Z, 11E-CLA isomer and 10E,\n12Z-CLA isomers) are capable of modulating the functional properties of monocytes and mac-\nrophages [11]. For instance, McClelland et al. (2010) demonstrated that CLA isomers can\ninhibit the migration of human monocytic THP-1 cells and primary blood monocytes, and\nreduce the inflammatory output of the LPS-activated THP-1 macrophages [12]. In a recent\nstudy, Gaetano et al. (2015) showed that the 9Z, 11E-CLA isomer can inhibit the production of\npro-inflammatory cytokines in human macrophages, and primed human monocytes towards\nan anti-inflammatory MF2 phenotype [13]. These studies started to shed some lights on the\nimmunomodulatory activities of CLA on macrophages, nevertheless, the modulatory effects of\nCLNA on murine primary macrophages remain poorly understood.\n\nIn the present study, we found that jacaric acid (8Z, 10E, 12Z-CLNA isomer) could activate\nmurine peritoneal macrophages by enhancing their cytostatic and endocytic activities, produc-\ntion of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and the secretion of various pro-inflammatory\ncytokines, while exhibiting minimal cytotoxicity to these cells.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nChemicals and reagents\nJacaric acid (8Z, 10E, 12Z-CLNA isomer; Fig 1) used in the study, with an estimated purity\n>97%, was purchased from Larodan Fine Chemicals AB, Sweden. The stock solution (0.2 M)\nwas prepared by dissolving the powder in cell culture-tested ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich Co.,\nUSA). The endotoxin concentrations in the stock solution and the working solution of jacaric\nacid were estimated by ToxinSensorTM Chromogenic LAL Endotoxin Assay Kit (GenScript\nInc., USA) to be 0.175 ± 0.007 ng/ml and 0.104 ± 0.001 ng/ml, respectively, using the proce-\ndures according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All other chemicals, unless otherwise\nstated, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\nFig 1.

The cells were\nmaintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS; Gibco) and 1% antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate and\n0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B in 0.85% saline from Gibco) in a humidified incubator containing\n5% CO2 at 37°C.\n\nMice\nInbred female BALB/c (H-2d) mice aged 6 to 8 weeks old were obtained from the Laboratory\nAnimal Services Centre of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and were kept in a specific\npathogen-free condition. The animal experiments were conducted with the licence under Ani-\nmals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance (Cap.340) issued by the Department of Health of\nthe Hong Kong Government, and according to the guidelines of the Animal Experimentation\nEthics Committee, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. The Animal Experimentation Ethics\nCommittee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong had specifically approved this study on\nMay 13, 2013 with the approval Ref. No. 13/040/GRF.\n\nPreparation of murine peritoneal macrophages and assay for cell\nviability\nThioglycollate (TG)-elicited peritoneal macrophages were isolated from BALB/c mice as previ-\nously described with slight modifications [15]. Briefly, BALB/c mice were each injected intra-\nperitoneally with 2.5 ml of sterile 3% TG broth solution (Difco Laboratories Inc., USA) to elicit\nan inflammatory response and to recruit the peritoneal macrophages. Three days later, mice\nwere sacrificed by cervical dislocation and peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) were harvested and\nresuspended in ammonium chloride potassium (ACK) lysis buffer for erythrocyte lysis. Subse-\nquently, the PEC were centrifuged at 400 xg for 5 min, washed with PBS three times and main-\ntained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics in a\nhumidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.\n\nIn our experiments, the PEC (2.5 x 106 /ml) were seeded in a flat-bottomed 96-well microti-\nter plate at 37°C for 3 h to allow the adherence of macrophages to the bottom of the wells.\nAfter incubation, non-adherent cells were removed and washed with warm RPMI medium\nthree times. The adhering macrophages were incubated with different concentrations of jacaric\nacid (0 to 100 μM) at 37°C for 72 h. The cell viability was measured by the standard neutral red\nuptake assay as described previously [16].\n\nAssay of macrophage-mediated cytostatic activity\nThis was carried out as described previously by Leung et al. [17]. Briefly, the peritoneal macro-\nphages seeded in a 96-well plate were pre-treated with different concentrations of jacaric acid\n(either 50 or 100 μM) in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (60 ng/ml) at\n37°C for 72 h for activation [18]. Cells treated with 0.1% ethanol acted as the control.\n\nFor the measurement of macrophage-mediated cytostatic activity towards tumor cells, jaca-\nric acid and LPS were removed by three washes with warm RPMI medium, and 104 MBL-2\ncells were added to each well in a final volume of 200 μl. After incubation at 37°C for 48 h,\nthe cytostatic activity of the jacaric acid-treated macrophages was measured by using the\nCyQuant1 NF Cell Proliferative Assay Kit (Molecular Probes; Invitrogen Corp., USA) and\nrecorded using a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan Polarion, USA) as described previously [19].\n\nImmunomodulatory Activity of Jacaric Acid on Macrophages\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0143684 December 2, 2015 3 / 16\n\n\n\nThe percentage growth inhibition of MBL-2 cells induced by jacaric acid-treated macrophages\nwas calculated as follows:\n\n% inhibition ¼ 1� Fluorescence intensity of jacaric acid� treated macrophages\nFluorescence intensity of ethanol� treated macrophages\n\n� �� �\n� 100\n\nTo determine whether the jacaric acid-treated macrophages could also elicit the growth-\ninhibitory effect without direct contact with the MBL-2 cells, jacaric acid and LPS were first\nremoved by three washes with warm RPMI medium, and complete RPMI medium (without\nMBL-2 cells) was then added to each well in a final volume of 200 μl. After incubation at 37°C\nfor 48 h, the cell-free supernatant was transferred to another 96-well plate seeded with 104\n\nMBL-2 cells. The anti-proliferative effect of the supernatant was measured by the cell prolifer-\native assay kit after 48 h incubation at 37°C as described above.\n\nAssay for endocytic activity of macrophages\nThe procedures used for the assay of the endocytic activity of macrophages were described pre-\nviously [20]. In brief, the peritoneal macrophages seeded in a flat-bottomed 6-well microtiter\nplate were incubated with different concentrations of jacaric acid (either 50 or 100 μM), in the\npresence of LPS (60 ng/ml) at 37°C for 72 h. Afterwards, the medium was removed and the\ncells were washed with warm RPMI medium three times. The FITC-conjugated albumin (1\nmg/ml) in 1 ml fresh RPMI medium was then added to the cells and further incubated at 37°C\nfor 6 h in dark. Subsequently, the cells were gently removed from the plate by using a sterile\ncell scraper, centrifuged at 400 xg for 5 min, and resuspended in 1 ml PBS containing 1% (w/v)\nparaformaldehyde. The endocytic activity of the macrophages was analyzed for FITC fluores-\ncence with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 525 nm using\nthe FACSCantoTM flow cytometer (BD BioSciences, USA).\n\nDetermination of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by\nmacrophages\nThe peritoneal macrophages seeded in a 6-well plate were incubated with different concentra-\ntions of jacaric acid (either 50 or 100 μM), in the presence of LPS (60 ng/ml) at 37°C for 72 h.\nAfter incubation, the cells were gently removed from the plate, and the cell pellet was stained\nby 10 μM dihydroethidium (DHE) in 0.5 ml PBS and further incubated at 37°C for 30 min in\ndark with gentle shaking. Afterwards, the macrophages were analyzed for red fluorescence (FL-\n3) with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 660 nm using the\nFACSCantoTM flow cytometer.\n\nMeasurement of nitric oxide (NO) production by macrophages\nThe peritoneal macrophages seeded in a 96-well plate were incubated with different concentra-\ntions of jacaric acid (either 50 or 100 μM) in the presence of LPS (60 ng/ml) at 37°C for 72 h.\nAfter incubation, 100 μl cell-free supernatant from each well was transferred into another\n96-well plate, followed by the addition of 100 μl freshly prepared Griess reagent. The plate was\nincubated at room temperature for 10 min with gentle shaking, and the absorbance at 540 nm\nwas recorded by a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). The nitrite con-\ncentrations of the samples were quantified with reference to the standard sodium nitrite solu-\ntions with concentrations ranging from 0 to 64 μM.\n\nImmunomodulatory Activity of Jacaric Acid on Macrophages\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0143684 December 2, 2015 4 / 16\n\n\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein expression level was determined by Western blotting technique with the aid of a panel\nof specific antibodies. Briefly, the peritoneal macrophages seeded in a 6-well plate were incu-\nbated with different concentrations of jacaric acid (either 50 or 100 μM) in the presence of LPS\n(60 ng/ml) at 37°C for 72 h. Cells treated with 0.1% ethanol acted as the control. After incuba-\ntion, the cell pellet was collected and total protein was extracted by the cell lysis buffer. Protein\nconcentration was measured by Bradford reagent and the protein samples (30 μg/well) were\nresolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane\nwas first incubated with the rabbit anti-iNOS antibody (diluted 1:250) (Cell Signaling Technol-\nogy Inc., USA) or mouse anti-β-actin antibody (diluted 1:2,000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),\nfollowed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody\n(GE Healthcare Limited, UK) and finally developed with the enhanced chemiluminescence\nreagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\n\nAssessment of cytokine secretion by ELISA\nTo determine the secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor\n(TNF)-α, the corresponding ELISA kit was used (ExCell Biology, Inc., China). Briefly, the peri-\ntoneal macrophages seeded in a 96-well plate were incubated with different concentrations of\njacaric acid (either 50 or 100 μM), in the presence of LPS (60 ng/ml) at 37°C for 72 h. The cell-\nfree supernatant was then transferred to another 96-well plate provided in the ELISA kit. Sub-\nsequently, the absorbance at 405 nm was measured by the Benchmark microplate reader.\n\nStatistical analysis\nEach experiment was repeated three times and only the results of the most representative\nexperiments were shown. The data were expressed as the arithmetic mean ± standard error\n(SE). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test\nwas used for statistical analysis and the differences were considered as statistically significant at\np<0.05.\n\nResults\n\nJacaric acid induced the cytostatic activity of murine peritoneal\nmacrophages\nTo demonstrate the immunomodulatory effects of jacaric acid on macrophages, the cytostatic\nactivity of TG-induced murine peritoneal macrophages against MBL-2 tumor cells was evalu-\nated by the CyQuant1NF Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. As shown in Fig 2A, after pre-treatment\nwith jacaric acid alone in the absence of LPS, the macrophages exhibited cell-to-cell contact-\ndependent cytostatic effect and inhibited the growth of the MBL-2 cells up to 30–40%. The\ncytostatic effect was found to be more pronounced in the presence of LPS and it was found that\nthe percentage of inhibition of MBL-2 cell proliferation reached 80% when the macrophages\nwere pre-treated with 100 μM jacaric acid in the presence of LPS (Fig 2B). Apart from the\ndirect cytostatic effect of jacaric acid-treated macrophages on the MBL-2 cells, Fig 3 shows that\nthe cell-free supernatant from the jacaric acid and LPS-treated macrophages also inhibited the\ngrowth of the MBL-2 cells in a concentration-dependent manner, but to a lesser extent (around\n40%). Remarkably, jacaric acid exhibited little, if any, direct cytotoxicity on the murine perito-\nneal macrophages, as the percentage of viability of the macrophages remained>90% when the\ncells were incubated with 100 μM jacaric acid for 72 h (S1 Fig).\n\nImmunomodulatory Activity of Jacaric Acid on Macrophages\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0143684 December 2, 2015 5 / 16\n\n\n\nFig 2.

These mediators\ninclude TNF-α and NO, which can be up-regulated by various immunological stimuli, one of\nwhich is LPS [25,26]. Earlier studies by Wallace et al.

Ever since\nthen, there are different reports examining the immunomodulatory effects of PUFA such as\nCLA on the macrophages, and the findings are often inconsistent, depending on both the iso-\nmer of CLA and the species of the macrophage cell line used for investigation [11,24]. On one\nhand, some reports suggested that the 9Z, 11E-CLA and 10E, 12Z-CLA could enhance phago-\ncytosis, upregulate the expression level of TNF-α and increase intracellular ROS synthesis and\noxygenation of macrophages [27,28]. In contrast, other studies demonstrated the reduction of\nNO and TNF-α secretion after treatment with these CLA [29,30]. Moreover, it was found that\nα-linolenic acid, the non-conjugated counterpart of CLNA, might reduce the generation of\nROS in elaidic acid-treated rat peritoneal macrophages [31], Others have shown that 9Z,\n11E-CLA might inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human macrophages,\n\nFig 8.

The concentrations of IFN-γ (A), IL-1β (B) and TNF-α (C) were quantified by ELISA kit according to manufacturers’ instructions, and the results were\nexpressed as mean ± SE. * p< 0.05; *** p< 0.001.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0143684.g008\n\nImmunomodulatory Activity of Jacaric Acid on Macrophages\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0143684 December 2, 2015 12 / 16\n\n\n\nand primed human monocytes towards an anti-inflammatory MF2 phenotype [13]. In spite of\nthese earlier studies, the modulatory effects of CLNA on macrophages as well as their underly-\ning action mechanisms have not yet been investigated.\n\nIn the present study, we found that pre-treatment of murine peritoneal macrophages with\njacaric acid, the 8Z, 10E, 12Z-CLNA isomer that is present in jacaranda seed oil, at concentra-\ntions higher than 50 μM, in the absence or presence of LPS, could enhance their cytostatic\nactivity on the T-cell lymphoma MBL-2 cells, and the growth-inhibitory effect was found to be\nmore pronounced when there was direct cell-to-cell contact between the LPS- and jacaric acid-\ntreated macrophages, and the tumor target MBL-2 cells. Interestingly, it was found that jacaric\nacid only exerted slight (<10%) direct cytotoxicity on the macrophages even at higher concen-\ntrations up to 100 μM (S1 Fig). Further studies of the macrophage-activating properties of jaca-\nric acid showed that jacaric acid could enhance the endocytic activity of peritoneal\nmacrophages. Similarly, using FITC-conjugated Escherichia coli, we found that jacaric acid\ncould also enhance the phagocytic ability of macrophages (S2 Fig). Previous findings from\nother groups have demonstrated the capability of CLA to enhance phagocytosis through mod-\nulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathway or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\n(PPAR)γ-dependent pathway [27,32]. Nevertheless, whether the COX-2 pathway and PPARγ\npathway are involved in the modulatory effect of jacaric acid on the endocytic and phagocytic\nactivities of macrophages require further investigation.\n\nApart from endocytosis, there might be an increase in the generation of ROS and NO, as\nthese free radicals are reported to play an important role in the lysis of tumor cells [33,34].\nWithin mammalian cells, a family of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) enzymes has been shown to\nbe involved in NO generation, and three isoforms of the NOS family have been identified,\nnamely endothelial NOS, neuronal NOS and inducible NOS (iNOS) [21,35]. In our present\nstudy, it could be seen that there was an increase in the generation of ROS after pre-treatment\nof the peritoneal macrophages with jacaric acid and LPS. Moreover, the production of NO in\nthe macrophages was elevated, which was accompanied by an increase in the protein expres-\nsion level of iNOS. Similar results were observed when different CLA isomers were incubated\nwith the human monocytic cell line THP-1 [36], while some reports showed different outcomes\n[29,30]. The discrepancy in the results might due to a number of reasons, including but not\nlimiting to the origin of the macrophages, the concentrations and the types of CFA used for\ninvestigation. Earlier studies have demonstrated the differential effects of dietary fats on the\nmacrophage-mediated cytotoxicity towards tumor cells [24]. Yang et al. (2009) suggested that\nthe oxidative stabilities of various CLA and CLNA isomers were different, depending on the\npositional and geometric configurations of the isomers, as well as the number of conjugated\ndouble bonds in the isomers [37]. This might also account for the discrepancy that different\nCFA isomers modulated the generation of ROS and NO in macrophages in different ways. In\naddition, our results showed that jacaric acid-treated peritoneal macrophages significantly\nstimulated the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-γ, IL-1β and TNF-α. It\nwas reported that NO could be generated in macrophages by iNOS following the exposure to\nthese cytokines in the presence of LPS [25]. These results are in line with some in vitro and in\nvivo studies [27,38], whereas some reports suggested that CLA did not alter the production of\nthe pro-inflammatory cytokines in human subjects [39,40].\n\nCollectively, our results suggest that jacaric acid is capable of modulating the immune activi-\nties of murine macrophages, such as inducing their cytostatic activity on MBL-2 tumor cells,\nenhancing their endocytic ability, and increasing their production of intracellular ROS and\ncytokines. The underlying mechanisms for the observed differential immunomodulatory\neffects of jacaric acid as compared to other CFA such as CLA as shown in earlier studies remain\nobscure and this is an intriguing aspect that awaits further investigations.
