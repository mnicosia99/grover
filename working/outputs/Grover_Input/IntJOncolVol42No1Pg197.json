JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  197-201,  2013\n\nAbstract. The metastasis-associated gene C4.4A encodes a \nglycolipid-anchored membrane protein expressed in several \nhuman malignancies. The present study aimed to perform a \ndetailed assessment of C4.4A expression in colorectal cancer \ntissues, in terms of intra-cellular localization, intra-tumoral \nlocation and difference in molecular weight. To advance this \ngoal, we developed three new antibodies against the C4.4A \nprotein (two polyclonal Abs: C4.4A-119 and C4.4A-277 and \none monoclonal Ab: C4.4A GPI-M) to use in addition to the \ntwo previously produced polyclonal Abs (C4.4A-81, C4.4A \nGPI-P). Antibody specificities were confirmed by absorption \ntests. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry showed \nthat the C4.4A-119 and C4.4-277 Abs detected 70-kDa C4.4A, \nmainly in the cytoplasm, irrespective of intra-tumoral location. \nThe C4.4A GPI-P and C4.4A GPI-M Abs reacted with the \nmembranous ~40-kDa C4.4A, exclusively at the tumor invasive \nfront, and each detected an identical tumor cell population. The \ntested antibodies showed varied C4.4A detection rates in 33 \nCRC tissues. The C4.4A-277 Ab yielded the highest positive \nrate in 29 of 33 CRC tissues (87.9%), while the C4.4A GPI-P \nand C4.4A GPI-M Abs each only showed 33.3% positivity. The \npresent findings suggest that the GPI anchor signaling sequence \nmay be essential for detecting membranous C4.4A at the inva-\nsive front of CRC tissues. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe C4.4A protein was first identified in a highly metastatic \nrat pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line (1,2). The human \nhomologue of rat C4.4A is located on chromosome 19q13.1-\n\nq13.2 and was cloned in 2001 (3). Studies of the molecular \nstructure indicate that C4.4A is a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol \n(GPI)-anchored membrane protein with 30% homology to the \nurokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (4,5). In normal \nhuman tissues, C4.4A mRNA is present in placental tissue, skin, \nesophagus, and leukocytes (3); but the physiological function \nof the C4.4A protein is largely unknown. C4.4A expression is \nupregulated in some types of human malignancies, and human \nC4.4A mRNA has been detected in cancer cell lines, including \nmelanoma, breast, bladder, and renal cell carcinoma, as well as \nin tumor tissue samples from malignant melanoma, colorectal \ncancer (CRC), breast cancer, lung carcinoma, and urothelial \ntumors (5-10). \n\nWe previously detected C4.4A protein expression on the \nplasma membranes of tumor cells at the invasive front in 25.6% \nof 132 CRCs (11). In that study, we used a polyclonal antibody \nthat recognizes the C4.4A C-terminus containing the GPI \nanchor signaling sequence. In contrast, Paret et al (9) reported \nthat 85.4% of CRC tissues showed distinct C4.4A expression \nby immunohistochemistry, and they did not mention an inva-\nsive front-specific expression pattern. We also observed that \nanother C4.4A polyclonal antibody that was raised against \namino acids near the N-terminus did not react with the C4.4A \nprotein in CRC tissue samples, while it did recognize C4.4A \nin the esophageal squamous epithelium (11). These findings \nsuggest that distinct antibodies detect different species of the \nC4.4A protein. \n\nIn the present study, we further investigated C4.4A \nexpression in CRC tissue samples. We developed three novel \nantibodies (two polyclonal antibodies: C4.4A-119 and C4.4A-\n277, and one monoclonal antibody: C4.4A GPI-M) and tested \nthem in addition to the two previously produced antibodies \n(C4.4A-81, and C4.4A GPI-P) (11). Using these antibodies for \nimmunohistochemistry, we performed a detailed assessment of \nthe C4.4A protein with regard to expression rates in CRC cases, \nintra-cellular localization in tumor cells (cytoplasm or plasma \nmembrane), and intra-tumoral localization (invasive front, or \nintermediate portion to superficial portion of the cancer body). \nWestern blot analysis was also performed to determine the \nmolecular weight of the C4.4A protein bound by each antibody. \nOur results show that GPI anchor signaling sequence may be \nessential for detecting membranous C4.4A at the invasive front \nof CRC, which is of clinical significance. \n\nDistinct expression of C4.4A in colorectal cancer  \ndetected by different antibodies\n\nHIROFUMI YAMAMOTO,  RYOTA OSHIRO,  MASAHISA OHTSUKA,  MAMORU UEMURA,  \nNAOTSUGU HARAGUCHI,  JUNICHI NISHIMURA,  ICHIRO TAKEMASA, \n\nTSUNEKAZU MIZUSHIMA,  YUICHIRO DOKI  and  MASAKI MORI \n\nDepartment of Surgery, Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan\n\nReceived July 20, 2012;  Accepted September 3, 2012\n\nDOI: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1714\n\nCorrespondence to: Dr Hirofumi Yamamoto, Department of \nSurgery, Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medicine, \nOsaka University, 2-2 Yamada-oka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan\nE-mail: hyamamoto@gesurg.med.osaka-u.ac.jp\n\nAbbreviations: Ab, antibody; CRC, colorectal cancer; GPI, glycosyl- \nphosphatidyl-inositol\n\nKey words: C4.4A, colorectal cancer, GPI anchor, localization\n\n\n\nYAMAMOTO et al:  C4.4A EXPRESSION IN CRC198\n\nMaterials and methods \n\nTissue samples and cell lines. All colorectal tissue samples \n(n=33) were collected during surgery at the Department of \nSurgery, Osaka University (Osaka, Japan). Samples were fixed \nin buffered formalin at 4˚C overnight, processed through graded \nethanol solutions, and embedded in paraffin. The specimens were \nappropriately used, with the approval of the Ethics Committee \nat the Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University. The \nhuman colon cancer cell line HCT116 was obtained from the \nAmerican Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Cells \nwere grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine \nserum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin, \nat 37˚C in a humidified incubator, under 5% CO2 in air.\n\nAntibodies. To generate rabbit polyclonal antibodies, rabbits \nwere immunized with the target peptides bound to thyro-\nglobulin. The C4.4A-specific IgG was purified by passage \nof the antisera over a peptide column in which the peptide \nhad been coupled to the beads. To generate the anti-human \nC4.4A monoclonal antibody, mice (BALB/c or BDF1, Charles \nRiver, Japan) were immunized weekly with thyroglobulin-\nconjugated C4.4A peptides (50 µg/mouse). We used partial \nhuman C4.4A peptide consisting of amino acid residues \n301-316 (AGHQDRSNSGQYPAKG) as an immunogen for \nthe C-terminus containing a portion of the GPI anchor. The \ncysteine residue was combined in the immunogen beforehand \nfor binding to the carrier protein, bovine thyroglobulin. After \nfour immunizations, the spleen was isolated and fused with \nX63Ag8 myeloma cells. Through limited dilution and the \nscreening process, the 11A1 clone was selected. The rabbit \nanti-human actin antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich \n(St. Louis, MO, USA).\n\nImmunohistochemistry. Tissue sections (4-µm thick) were \nprepared from paraffin-embedded blocks. After antigen \nretrieval treatment in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 95˚C for \n40 min, immunostaining was carried out using the Vectastain \nABC peroxidase kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, \nUSA) as we have described previously (12,13). The slides \nwere incubated overnight at 4˚C with appropriate antibodies \ndiluted as follows: C4.4A-119, 1:20; C4.4A-278, 1:20; C4.4A \nGPI-P, 1:200; and C4.4A GPI-M, 1:50. Non-immunized rabbit \n\nIgG or mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) was substituted for \nthe primary antibody as a negative control to exclude possible \nfalse-positive responses from the secondary antibody or from \nnon-specific binding of IgG. \n\nWestern blot analysis. Western blot analysis was performed \nas described previously (14,15). Briefly, 20-µg protein samples \nwere separated by 12.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis \nfollowed by electroblotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride \nmembrane (PVDF). The membrane was incubated for 1 h with \nthe primary antibodies at the following concentrations: C4.4A-\n119, 1:50; C4.4A-278, 1:50; C4.4A GPI-P, 1:500; C4.4A GPI-M, \n1:50; and actin, 1:1000. The protein bands were detected \nusing the Amersham Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) \nDetection System (Amersham Biosciences Corp., NJ, USA). \n\nAbsorption test. For absorption testing, an excess amount of \nimmunogen peptide was added to the antibody (20 mol:1 mol), \nthe mixture was incubated overnight at 4˚C and was used \ninstead of the primary antibody. \n\nResults\n\nGeneration of C4.4A antibodies. In this study, we generated two \nnovel rabbit anti-human C4.4A polyclonal antibodies, C4.4A-\n119 and C4.4A-277, and a mouse anti-human C4.4A monoclonal \nantibody, C4.4A GPI-M. The immunogens used for C4.4A-119 \nand C4.4A-277 were 119LTSRALDPAGNE SAYPPNGVEC and \n277SQTP RQGVEHEASR DEEPRLT, respectively (Fig. 1). The \nanti-human C4.4A monoclonal antibody C4.4A GPI-M was \nraised against 301AGHQDRSNSGQYPAKG at the C-terminus \ncontaining a portion of the GPI anchor signaling sequence \n(Fig. 1). The 301AGHQDRSNSGQYPAKG immunogen was \nused in our previous study to generate a GPI-related polyclonal \nantibody, anti-human C4.4A antibody-2 antibody, which we \nalso used in the present study for comparison (designated as \nC4.4A GPI-P in this study for simplicity). \n\nWestern blot analysis. The C4.4A-119 and C4.4A-277 anti-\nbodies in HCT116 each produced a band at around 70 kDa, and \nthe absorbed antibodies eliminated these bands (Fig. 2A and \nB). On the other hand, the C4.4A GPI-P antibody in HCT116 \nproduced doublet bands at 40 and 52 kDa (Fig. 2C), and the \n\nFigure 1. Amino acid sequences of the C4.4A protein with the epitopes employed as immunogens in bold. C4.4A-81 starts at AA 81, C4.4A-119 at AA 119, \nC4.4A-277 at AA 277, and C4.4A GPI-P and C4.4A GPI-M start at AA 301. The boxed area indicates the GPI anchor signaling sequence. 309SGQYPAKG is \ndestined to be cut off when the C4.4A molecule is anchored onto the plasma membrane.\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  197-201,  2013 199\n\nabsorbed antibody abolished a band at 40 kDa, which can be \nvisualized on the tissue sections; similar results were observed \nwith the C4.4A GPI-M antibody (Fig. 2D).\n\nImmunohistochemistry. The C4.4A antibodies yielded positive \nstaining for the C4.4A protein on tumor cells in CRC tissue \nspecimens, and the pre-absorbed antibodies abolished this \nstaining (Fig. 3).\n\nLocalization of C4.4A and positive staining rate in CRC tissues \nwith each antibody. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the \n\nC4.4A protein was differently detected by each antibody in \nterms of intra-cellular and intra-tumoral locations, and positive \nstaining rate. Using the C4.4A-119 antibody, positive staining \nwas noted in 17 of 33 CRC cases (51.5%); relatively weak cyto-\nplasmic staining was observed in the tumor cells, irrespective \nof location in the tumor body, i.e., superficial to intermediate \narea or invasive front (Fig. 4A). With the C4.4A-277 antibody, \n29 of 33 CRC samples (87.9%) were positive for cytoplasmic \nC4.4A, and staining was observed at both the invasive front \nand superficial to intermediate portions (Fig. 4A); membranous \nstaining was generally not evident, but weak positive staining \n\nFigure 3.

The arrows indicate the band corresponding to the C4.4A protein. \n\n\n\nYAMAMOTO et al:  C4.4A EXPRESSION IN CRC200\n\nwas occasionally observed in only a portion of the cancer body. \nOn the other hand, the C4.4A GPI-P antibody produced intense \nmembranous staining at the invasive front in 11 of 33 CRC \ncases (33.3%), but this staining was usually not found at the \nsuperficial to intermediate portions (Fig. 4B). \n\nThe C4.4A GPI-M antibody showed a staining pattern \nsimilar to that produced by the C4.4A GPI-P antibody (Fig. 5). \n\nStaining by both GPI-related antibodies in serial sections \nrevealed identical heterogeneous C4.4A expression patterns at \nthe intermediate portion of the cancer body. The C4.4A GPI-M \nantibody also provided intense membranous staining in the \ntumor cells, only at the invasive front.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study, we used four specific antibodies against the C4.4A \nprotein, three of which were newly produced. Antibody speci-\nficities were verified by absorption tests, and efficacies by both \nwestern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The use of \nthese distinct antibodies revealed several isoforms of the C4.4A \nprotein, which differed in terms of molecular weight, intra-\ntumoral location, and intra-cellular localization. Western blot \nanalysis revealed the existence of at least two isoforms: a long \nform of ~70 kDa, and a short form of ~40 kDa. This finding is \nconsistent with the report by Paret et al that the recombinant \nC4.4A protein is digested by trypsin treatment from a long \nform of over 70 kDa to a proteolytic fragment of 40 kDa (9). \nHansen et al also observed that both a long form (67 kDa) and \nshort form (40 kDa) were present in the normal esophageal \nepithelium and at the superficial portion of the cancer body \nof the esophagus, whereas the short form of ~40 kDa was \npredominant in the invasive front of the cancer body (16). \n\nIn the present study, we found that the C4.4A-119 and C4.4A-\n277 antibodies reacted with the long form of C4.4A (70 kDa) \nand exhibited mainly cytoplasmic intra-cellular localization, \nirrespective of intra-tumoral location. In the tested CRC cases, \n\nFigure 4. Immunohistochemistry of C4.4A at either a superficial to intermediate portion of the cancer body or at the invasive front of CRC tissue.

Paret \net al (9) previously used an antibody created with immunogens \nfrom two different portions of C4.4A (amino acids 278-302 \nand 119-138), and showed C4.4A expression in more than 80% \nof CRC tissue samples. Another study on C4.4A expression in \nesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) showed a 100% \ndetection rate (14 of 14 ESCC cases) using an antibody that \nrecognizes the Domain III portion of the C4.4A molecule \n(5,16). These findings suggest that C4.4A could be a sensitive \nmarker for CRC and ESCC when using the specific antibodies \nwith high C4.4A detection rates.\n\nOn the other hand, we found that the C4.4A GPI-P antibody \ndetected mainly membranous C4.4A at the invasive front of \nCRC tissues, at a lower rate of 33.3%. These findings suggest \nthat, although cytoplasmic C4.4A is commonly detected in CRC \ntissues, only certain CRCs expressed membranous C4.4A. We \nhypothesize that the membranous type of C4.4A is function-\nally important and of clinical significance; it is possible that \nC4.4A on the plasma membrane could play a crucial role in \ninvasion and metastasis. We previously reported that membra-\nnous C4.4A was linked to venous invasion, and associated with \npoor prognosis (especially hematogenous metastasis) in CRC \n(11). Moreover, we recently found that membranous C4.4A \nwas tightly linked to EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition) \nchange, and associated with tumor budding (17), a putative \nhallmark of cell invasion of CRC (18,19). \n\nTo explore whether the GPI anchor sequence was essential \nfor detecting membranous C4.4A at the invasive front, we \ndeveloped the novel monoclonal antibody C4.4A GPI-M. The \nantibody detected a membranous C4.4A expression pattern at \nthe invasive front, similar to that shown by the C4.4A GPI-P \nantibody. Both C4.4A GPI-P and C4.4A GPI-M antibodies \nproduced a band at around 40 kDa. These findings suggest that \nthe C4.4A protein may exist as a proteolytic fragment on the \nplasma membrane in a subset of CRC. Based on these results, \nwe concluded that the GPI anchor signaling sequence is essen-\ntial for detecting membranous C4.4A at the invasive front. The \npresent findings also suggest that C4.4A might be digested into \nthe short form at the invasive front of CRC when it links to the \nplasma membrane via the GPI anchor.\n\nIn conclusion, as summarized in Table I, we found that the \nmajority of CRC tissues expressed cytoplasmic C4.4A, and a \nsubset of CRCs displayed C4.4A on the plasma membrane. \nBoth the C4.4A GPI-M antibody and the C4.4A GPI-P antibody \nexhibited membranous expression patterns, suggesting that \nthe GPI anchor signaling sequence is essential for detecting \nmembranous C4.4A at the invasive front.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Cancer \nResearch from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and \nCulture Technology, Japan, to H.Y.\n\nReferences\n\n  1.
