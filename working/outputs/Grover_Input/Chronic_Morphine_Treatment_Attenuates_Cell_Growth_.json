It is currently thought\nthat these effects are mediated by transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-controlled ERK1/2 and Akt signalling.\nThe growth of many breast cancer cells is dependent on hyperactive ErbB receptor networks and one of the most successful\napproaches in antineoplastic therapy during the last decade was the development of ErbB-targeted therapies. However, the\nresponse rates of single therapies are often poor and resistance mechanisms evolve rapidly. To date there is no information\nabout the ability of opioid analgesics to interfere with the growth of ErbB-driven cancers.\n\nMethods and Principal Findings: Here we demonstrate that ErbB2 overexpressing BT474 human breast cancer cells carry\nfully functional endogenous m-opioid receptors. Most interestingly, the acute opioid effects on basal and Heregulin-\nstimulated ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation changed considerably during chronic Morphine treatment. Investigation of the\nunderlying mechanism by the use of protein kinase inhibitors and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that chronic\nMorphine treatment results in rearrangement of the ErbB signalling network leading to dissociation of ERK1/2 from Akt\nsignalling and a switch from ErbB1/ErbB3 to ErbB1/ErbB2-dependent cell growth. In chronically Morphine-treated cells\nHeregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling is redirected via a newly established PI3K- and metalloproteinase-dependent\nfeedback loop. Together, these alterations result in apoptosis of BT474 cells. A similar switch in Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2\nsignalling from an ErbB2-independent to an ErbB2-, PI3K- and metalloproteinase-dependent mechanism was also observed\nin k-opioid receptor expressing SKBR3 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells.\n\nConclusions and Significance: The present data demonstrate that the ErbB receptor network of human breast cancer cells\nrepresents a target for chronic Morphine treatment. Rearrangement of ErbB signalling by chronic Morphine may provide a\npromising strategy to enhance the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to ErbB-directed therapies and to prevent the\ndevelopment of escape mechanisms.\n\nCitation: Weingaertner IR, Koutnik S, Ammer H (2013) Chronic Morphine Treatment Attenuates Cell Growth of Human BT474 Breast Cancer Cells by\nRearrangement of the ErbB Signalling Network.

They mediate\n\ntheir action via specific binding sites (d, k, m) that belong to the\nfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Opioid receptors are\n\npredominantly expressed in neuronal tissues and inhibit neuronal\n\nexcitability by regulating their ‘‘classical’’ effector systems adenylyl\n\ncyclase, potassium channels and voltage-dependent calcium\n\ncurrents [1]. Beside this, opioid receptors may also regulate the\n\nactivity of a variety of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases,\n\nincluding Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/\n\n2), c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK), p38, Signal Transducer and\n\nActivator of Transcription 5 (STAT5) and Protein Kinase B\n\n(PKB/Akt) [2,3]. Activation of these ‘‘non classical’’ opioid\n\neffector systems is mediated via transactivation of receptor tyrosine\n\nkinase (RTK)-associated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling pathways\n\n[4,5]. Due to the ability of opioid receptors to regulate the\n\ndominant RTK system in a given cellular context [6], chronic\n\nopioid treatment might provide a means to selectively interfere\n\nwith tumour cell growth. Because the opioid effects on tumour cell\n\nproliferation and apoptosis reported so far are rather discrepant\n\nand role of opioid receptors in these studies was not always clear\n\n[7,8], the aim of the present study was to investigate chronic\n\nMorphine regulation of RTK-dependent cell growth in a defined\n\ntumour cell model carrying endogenous m-opioid receptors.\nThe human Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Receptor family\n\n(ErbB, also termed HER) consists of four members (ErbB1-4) and\n\nbelongs to subclass I of the superfamily of RTKs. They are\n\nactivated by more than 10 different growth factor ligands with\n\npartly overlapping (EGF, HB-EGF, TGF-a, and Betacellulin) or\nmore discrete (Neuregulins) receptor specificities [9]. ErbB\n\nreceptors are transmembrane receptors consisting of an extracel-\n\nlular ligand binding domain, an intracellular kinase domain and\n\nan intracellular C-terminal tail. Ligand binding favours receptor\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510\n\n\n\ndimerization, which in turn leads to activation of the intracellular\n\nkinase domain and autophosphorylation of distinct tyrosine\n\nresidues in the C-terminal tail. These provide docking sites for\n\nbinding of the Shc/Grb2/SOS complex linking ErbB receptors to\n\nactivation of the mitogenic Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 signalling module\n\n[10]. Although structurally highly homologous, individual ErbB\n\nreceptors differ with respect to ligand binding and kinase activity.\n\nMost importantly, there is currently no endogenous ligand known\n\nfor ErbB2 [11], whereas ErbB3 lacks catalytic tyrosine kinase\n\nactivity [12]. Thus, both receptors must undergo heterodimeriza-\n\ntion for signalling. While ErbB2 is considered a signal amplifier,\n\nactivated ErbB3 signal through their dimerization partner. In\n\nErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, ligand activation of ErbB3 results in\n\nErbB1-mediated stimulation of the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 pathway.\n\nWhile all ErbB family members are able to cross-regulate the anti-\n\napoptotic Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway in a\n\nRas-dependent manner, ErbB3 may also directly activate all 3\n\nregulatory subunits of PI3K in the presence of ligand activated\n\nbinding partners [13]. Due to the ability of ErbB receptors to form\n\nmultiple homo- and heterodimers that considerably differ in their\n\nsignalling capacity, alterations in receptor abundance and\n\ndimerization will have dramatic consequences on mitogenic and\n\nanti-apoptotic signalling [9].\n\nHuman BT474 breast cancer cells were originally isolated from\n\na solid, invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast from a 60 years old\n\nwoman [14]. These cells are characterized by a dysregulated ErbB\n\nreceptor system, because they overexpress the ErbB2 receptor\n\n[11]. ErbB2 is present in about 25–30% of breast cancer patients\n\n[15] and is associated with poor prognosis and high relapse rate\n\n[11]. BT474 cells also carry physiologic levels of ErbB1 and ErbB3\n\nand low levels of ErbB4 [16], providing them a suitable model\n\nsystem for investigating the impact of ErbB signalling on tumour\n\ncell growth and ErbB2-targeted anti-tumour strategies [17]. In the\n\npresent study we demonstrate that BT474 cells carry endogenous\n\nm-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine treatment attenu-\nates Heregulin-induced cell growth and migration. The underlying\n\nmechanism involves dissociation of Heregulin-induced ERK1/2\n\nand Akt signalling from a common ErbB1/ErbB3 to separate\n\nErbB1/ErbB2 and ErbB1/ErbB3 mechanisms resulting in PI3K-\n\ndependent cell growth. Similar chronic Morphine effects on ErbB\n\nsignalling were also observed in ErbB2 overexpressing SKBR3\n\nhuman mammary adenocarcinoma cells that carry endogenous k-\nopioid receptors. These results demonstrate that chronic Mor-\n\nphine treatment is able to interfere with the growth characteristics\n\nof opioid receptor expressing tumour cells by rearrangement of the\n\nErbB receptor system. Such a mechanism might provide a\n\npromising strategy to enhance the sensitivity of ErbB-directed\n\nantineoplastic strategies and to prevent escape mechanisms.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nMaterials\nFoetal calf serum and cell culture reagents were from Pan\n\nBiotech. Forskolin, human recombinant insulin, 3-isobutyl-1-\n\nmethylxanthin (IBMX), (-)-Naloxone-HCl, and all standard\n\nlaboratory reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. (-)-Morphine-HCl\n\nwas from Merck, Heregulin (C-terminal fragment of Heregulin b1)\nfrom R&D Systems, recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF)\n\nfrom Bachem and [\n3\nH]DAMGO (30–60 Ci/mmol) from Perki-\n\nnElmer.

Anti-G protein antibodies\n\nhave been produced in our laboratory (Gia2, Gia3, Gsa, Gb) or\n\nwere obtained from Gramsch Laboratories (Gq/11a, G12a, G13a,\nG14a). Primary antibodies recognizing ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/\n2 [Thr202/Tyr204], Akt, phospho-Akt [Ser473], ErbB1, ErbB2,\n\nErbB3, ErbB4, b-tubulin as well as cleaved PARP [Asp214] were\nfrom Cell Signalling Technology. Secondary horseradish perox-\n\nidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG were from\n\nPromega and Cell Signalling.\n\nCell Culture, Chronic Opioid Treatment and Membrane\nPreparation\n\nBT474 cells were purchased from Cell Lines Service Inc. and\n\ngrown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-\n\ninactivated foetal calf serum (FCS), 100 IU/ml Penicillin, 0.1 mg/\n\nml Streptomycin, 0.2% Enrofloxacin and 0.02 mg/ml Insulin at\n\n37uC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. SKBR3 cells\nwere obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)\n\nand grown in McCoy’s 5A modified medium plus supplements as\n\nabove. For experimentation, BT474 cells were seeded onto 96-,\n\n24-, 12- and 6 well dishes as indicated at a density of 0.256104–\n56105 cells per well, left to adhere overnight and then subjected to\nchronic opioid treatment by the addition of Morphine (10 mM) to\nthe culture medium for 5 d with medium changes and drug\n\nrenewal every other day.\n\nFor evaluation of membrane proteins (m-opioid and ErbB\nreceptors, G proteins) and radioligand binding studies, cells were\n\ngrown in 75 or 150 cm2 culture flasks and plasma membranes\n\nwere prepared as described [18]. In brief, cells were washed 3\n\ntimes with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH7.4),\n\nscraped into 20 ml of TED buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM\n\nEDTA, and 1 mM DTT; pH 7.4) and then homogenized for\n\n10 sec using an Ultra Turrax. After removal of unbroken cells\n\n(3006g; 10 min), membranes were recovered from the superna-\ntant fraction by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,0006g. The\nmembrane pellet was washed once as above, resuspended in TM\n\nbuffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 5 mM MgCl2; pH 7.4) and stored in\n\naliquots at 280uC until use.\n\nRT-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated using Trifast\n\nTM\nreagent (Peqlab) and\n\ntranscribed into cDNA using the Fist Strand cDNA Synthesis KitH\n(Fermentas) according to manufacturers protocols. Integrity of\n\ncDNA was controlled by determination of GAPDH. Opioid\n\nreceptors (OR) and adenylyl cyclase isoforms (AC) were amplified\n\nusing specific primer pairs given in Table 1. All PCR reactions\n\n(50 ml) contained 10 pmol of each primer, 10 ng of cDNA,\n0.2 mM dNTPs, 1.25 U Pfu DNA polymerase and 20 mM\n\nMgSO4. Amplified fragments (20 ml) were resolved on a 1.5%\nagarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under\n\nUV light.\n\nRadioligand Binding\nEquilibrium binding studies were performed in triplicate\n\ndetermination for 2 h at RT in a total volume of 0.2 ml using\n\nthe high-affinity m-opioid receptor agonist [3H]DAMGO as the\nradioligand (2 nM) and 200–300 mg of membrane protein in TM\nbuffer as described [19]. Non-specific binding was determined in\n\nthe presence of 1 mM DAMGO. Reactions were stopped by rapid\nfiltration over WhatmanH GF/B glass fibre filters and radioactivity\nincorporated was determined by liquid scintillation in a Beckman\n\nLS6500 counter (Beckman Coulter). Maximum binding capacity\n\nwas calculated according to the method of DeBlasi [20] using a Kd\nof 1.4 nM for the human m-opioid receptor [21].\n\nMorphine Regulation of ErbB Signalling\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510\n\n\n\ncAMP Accumulation\nCells grown in 24 well dishes were washed 3 times with DMEM\n\ncontaining 25 mM HEPES (DMEH) and 0.1 mM IBMX and\n\nthen incubated for 30 min at 37uC. Cells were chilled on ice and\nmedia were replaced by DMEH containing the following\n\nstimulators and inhibitors of adenylyl cyclase: Forskolin (1 mM),\nMorphine (10 mM) and Naloxone (100 mM). Reactions were\nconducted for 15 min at 37uC and stopped by the addition of\n0.75 ml 50 mM HCL per well. The amount of cAMP produced\n\nwas measured by ELISA after acetylation of the samples.\n\nCell Growth\nCells were cultured in 24 well plates for 5 (BT474) or 3\n\n(SKBR3) days in insulin-free growth medium in the absence or\n\npresence of Morphine (10 mM), Naloxone (100 mM) and Here-\ngulin (40 ng/ml) as described [22]. Cells were then washed twice\n\nwith 0.5 ml PBS and fixed for 30 min at RT with 0.25 ml 20%\n\nmethanol in PBS containing 0.1% crystal violet. The dye solution\n\nwas aspirated, cells were washed extensively with PBS and finally\n\nsolubilised for 2 h in 0.25 ml 0.1 M citric acid per well. Colour\n\nintensity was determined after 10 fold dilution at l= 492 nm in a\nTecanH Spectra Multiplate Reader. Background staining obtained\nfrom cells on the same plates fixed on day 0 was subtracted.\n\nScratch Assay\nCell migration was evaluated using the in vitro scratch assay as\n\ndescribed [23]. BT474 cells (46105/well) were seeded onto 6 well\nculture dishes containing poly-l-lysine-coated cover slips to yield\n\n90% sub confluent monolayers after 5 d of culture in the absence\n\n(control) or presence of Heregulin (40 ng/ml), Morphine (10 mM)\nand Naloxone (100 mM) as indicated. Then, a scratch was made\nthrough the center of the well using a 200 ml pipette tip. Detached\ncells were removed and cells were cultured for another 24 h in\n\ncomplete medium containing the above ligands. Cells were then\n\nwashed and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, before cell\n\nmigration into the open area was assessed using an Olympus\n\nBH2 microscope.\n\nCell Proliferation\nDNA synthesis was determined for 2 h in 96 well plates using\n\nthe BrdU Cell Proliferation ELISA (Roche Diagnostics) according\n\nto the manufacturers instruction.

Reactions were stopped; cells\nwere fixed and incubated with 0.1 ml anti-BrdU antibody coupled\n\nto horseradish peroxidase. After the addition of substrate, colour\n\nreaction was measurement at l= 405 nm. All experiments were\ndone in triplicate determination.\n\nERK1/2 and Akt Phosphorylation\nCells grown in 12 well plates were washed and equilibrated for\n\n30 min at 37uC in DMEH containing 0.1% BSA before cells were\nstimulated for 5 min with Heregulin-b1 (40 ng/ml), EGF\n(100 ng/ml), Morphine (10 mM) and Naloxone (100 mM) as\nindicated. Reactions were stopped on ice and cells were solubilized\n\nin 0.5 ml Laemmli sample buffer. In some experiments, the\n\nfollowing protein kinase inhibitors were added during the\n\nequilibration period at the concentrations given: ErbB1 inhibitor\n\nAG1478 (5 mM), ErbB2 inhibitor AG825 (50 mM), PI3K inhibitor\nWortmannin (1 mM) and the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor\nEGCG (10 mM). The activation state of ERK1/2 and Akt was\ndetermined by Western blot using phospho-specific antibodies as\n\ndescribed below.\n\nApoptosis Assays\nStress-induced apoptosis was evaluated in 12 well dishes by\n\nculturing the cells for 6 h in serum-reduced growth medium (0.5%\n\nFCS) in the absence or presence of Morphine (10 mM), Naloxone\n(100 mM) and Heregulin (40 ng/ml). Reactions were stopped by\nremoval of the medium and solubilisation of the cells in 0.5 ml\n\nLaemmli sample buffer. Apoptosis was determined by Western\n\nblot using an antibody recognizing cleaved PARP.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nSamples were cleared by centrifugation (10,0006g; 5 min) and\n\nproteins were resolved by electrophoresis over 8% (ErbB receptors)\n\nor 10% (Akt, ERK1/2, G proteins, PARP) polyacrylamide gels as\n\nTable 1.

Cells were then fixed for\n\n30 min at RT with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS before\n\nspecimens were mounted using VectaMount\nTM\n\nAQ Aqueous\n\nMounting Medium (Vector Laboratories) and cells were examined\n\nby confocal microscopy (Carl Zeiss) using an 636/1.4 oil\nimmersion objective.\n\nStatistics\nAll data are expressed as the mean 6 S.E. of the number or\n\nexperiments given in the text. Statistical differences between two\n\ngroups were analyzed by Student̀s t test for unpaired data.\n\nMultiple comparisons were done by ANOVA followed by the\n\nTukey post-hoc test.\n\nResults\n\nCharacterization of Opioid Receptors in BT474 Cells\nTo evaluate the specificity of acute and chronic opioid effects on\n\nhuman BT474 breast cancer cells, the presence of opioid receptors\n\nwas determined first. RT-PCR experiments revealed the exclusive\n\nexpression of m-opioid receptors in this cell line (Fig. 1a). Receptor\ndensity was determined by equilibrium binding studies using the m-\nopioid receptor selective peptide agonist [\n\n3\nH]DAMGO as the\n\nradioligand. The results show that BT474 cells contain about\n\n7.362 fmol of m-opioid receptors per mg of membrane protein\n(n = 5) and that chronic Morphine treatment does not affect\n\nreceptor abundance (7.462 fmol per mg of membrane protein;\n\nn = 3). The ability of m-opioid receptors to mediate cellular effects\ndepends on the presence of adequate G proteins and effector\n\nsystems. As shown in Fig. 1b, BT474 cell membranes carry diverse\n\nmembers of the family of inhibitory (Gia2, Gia3), stimulatory\n(Gsa), Gq (Gq/11a) and G12 (G12a, G13a, G14a) G proteins,\nallowing m-opioid receptors to regulate multiple intracellular\nsignalling pathways. Because they also express several adenylyl\n\ncyclase isoforms (AC 1–5, 9; Fig. 1c), the functional activity of m-\nopioid receptors was assessed by their ability to regulate\n\nintracellular cAMP production. Indeed, acute m-opioid receptor\nactivation by Morphine (10 mM) significantly inhibits intracellular\ncAMP generation by about 53%, an effect almost completely\n\nblocked by Naloxone (100 mM). In chronically Morphine (10 mM,\n5d)-treated cells an acute Morphine challenge is still able to inhibit\n\ncAMP production by about 48% (Fig. 1d). These results\n\ndemonstrate that BT474 cells carry fully functional endogenous\n\nm-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine treatment does not\ndesensitize m-opioid receptor function providing an essential\nprerequisite to induce regulatory changes on post-receptor levels.\n\nInhibition of Cell Growth and Migration by Morphine\nThe growth of human BT474 breast cancer cells is driven by\n\noverexpressed ErbB2 receptor [11]. Due to the potential capacity\n\nof m-opioid receptors to cross-regulate RTK signalling pathways\n[25], the ability of Morphine to interfere with BT474 cell growth\n\nwas determined. Chronic exposure of the cells to Morphine\n\nslightly attenuates basal cell growth by about 11% as determined\n\nby crystal violet staining. However, the inhibitory opioid effect is\n\nmuch more pronounced when cells were cultured in the presence\n\nof the ErbB3 receptor agonist Heregulin. Chronic Heregulin\n\ntreatment produces mitogenic effects and increases cell number by\n\nabout 47%. Co-incubation of the cells with Morphine now\n\nsignificantly attenuates ErbB3-driven cell growth by about 49%.\n\nInhibition of both basal and Heregulin-stimulated cell growth by\n\nMorphine is completely blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist\n\nNaloxone (Fig. 2a). In addition, treatment of BT474 cells with the\n\ninactive stereoselective enantiomer (+)-Morphine failed to affect\ncell growth (not shown), excluding a receptor-independent effect\n\non mitochondrial pH due to the alkaloid structure of Morphine.\n\nOpioids have been shown to regulate a number of different\n\naspects of cell growth in tumour cell lines [26]. To gain a first\n\nindication as to whether Morphine might also interfere with\n\nHeregulin-stimulated BT474 cell migration, cell scratch assays\n\nwere performed on cells growing on poly-l-lysine coated cover\n\nslips. As shown in Fig. 2b, Heregulin (40 ng/ml) treatment for 5 d\n\nproduces morphological changes and induces cell migration into\n\nthe gap 24 h after scratching. Co-incubation of the cells with\n\nMorphine (10 mM, 5d) prevents cell differentiation and migration\ninto the open field, an effect that was partially blocked in the\n\npresence of Naloxone (100 mM). These results indicate that\nchronic Morphine treatment interferes with cell migration by\n\npreventing cell-matrix or cell-cell interactions.\n\nRegulation of Cell Proliferation by Morphine\nInhibition of BT474 cell growth by chronic Morphine treatment\n\nmay be due to attenuation of cell proliferation and/or inhibition of\n\ncell survival. To discriminate between these two possibilities, the\n\neffect of acute and chronic Morphine treatment on ERK1/2\n\nstimulation was determined. Most interestingly, acute m-opioid\nreceptor activation produces discrepant effects on ERK1/2\n\nMorphine Regulation of ErbB Signalling\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510\n\n\n\nphosphorylation, depending on whether basal or Heregulin-\n\nstimulated activities were measured in control or chronically\n\nMorphine exposed cells. In control cells, acute m-opioid receptor\nactivation using a maximum effective concentration of Morphine\n\n(10 mM; determined in preliminary experiments) results in\nelevation of basal ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but significantly\n\nattenuates Heregulin (ErbB3)-induced ERK1/2 activation by\n\nabout 17%. Chronic Morphine treatment (10 mM, 5d) results in\nelevation of basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphor-\n\nylation. Under these conditions, acute m-opioid receptor activation\nnow significantly enhances ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 activity by\n\nabout 14% (Fig. 3a). The increase in basal and Heregulin-\n\nstimulated ERK1/2 activity by chronic Morphine treatment is\n\nalso given in Fig. 3b.\n\nSimilar results were observed when cell proliferation was\n\nexamined by determination of DNA synthesis for 2 h using the\n\nBrdU assay. Again, acute m-opioid receptor activation in control\ncells significantly stimulates basal and inhibits Heregulin-stimulat-\n\ned cell proliferation by about 16% and 10%, respectively. Chronic\n\nMorphine treatment completely abolishes the ability of acute m-\nopioid receptor activation to stimulate basal cell proliferation and\n\nattenuates the overall effect of Heregulin by about 16%. In these\n\ncells, acute m-opioid receptor activation now significantly enhances\n\nErbB3-stimulated cell proliferation by nearly 10% (Fig. 3c). These\n\nresults demonstrate that Morphine is able to regulate mitogenic\n\nsignalling in human BT474 breast cancer cells and that the kind of\n\nacute m-opioid receptor effect produced largely depends on the\nactivation state of the cell. In addition, they also indicate that\n\nchronic Morphine treatment alters the ErbB receptor system\n\ncontrolling the growth of BT474 cells.\n\nMorphine Regulation of Akt Signalling\nThe finding that chronic Morphine treatment attenuates basal\n\nand Heregulin-stimulated cell growth in the presence of an\n\nenhanced mitogenic m-opioid receptor activity suggests that\nadditional mechanisms must exist that shortens the lifespan of\n\nthe cells. Therefore, we investigated whether chronic Morphine\n\ntreatment would possibly attenuate cell survival by inhibition of\n\nAkt phosphorylation. As shown in !Fig. 4a, BT474 cells display\n\nbasal levels of Akt phosphorylation, which are stimulated after\n\nactivation of ErbB3 receptors by Heregulin. Chronic morphine\n\ntreatment results in elevation of both basal and Heregulin-\n\nstimulated Akt activities. Acute m-opioid receptor activation fails to\naffect basal and Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling in both\n\ncontrol and chronically Morphine-treated cells.

These\n\nresults demonstrate that chronic Morphine treatment increases\n\nbasal and Heregulin-stimulated cell survival despite the overall\n\nattenuation of cell growth.\n\nInduction of Apoptosis by Chronic Morphine\nTo explain this apparent discrepancy, we examined the\n\ninduction of apoptosis by chronic Morphine treatment by two\n\ndifferent experimental approaches. We first compared the effect of\n\nMorphine on stress-induced apoptosis in control and chronically\n\nmorphine treated BT474 cells by means of PARP cleavage. In\n\ncontrol cells, serum starvation for 6 h failed to induce PARP\n\ncleavage. Apoptosis was induced only in the presence of Heregulin\n\nduring the starvation period. Co-incubation of the cells together\n\nwith Morphine had no further effect on PARP cleavage.\n\nCompletely different results were obtained in chronically Mor-\n\nphine-treated cells. Here, serum starvation alone was already\n\nsufficient to induce PARP cleavage. The induction of apoptosis\n\nwas further enhanced by the addition of Heregulin and Morphine,\n\nwith their individual effects being additive (Fig. 4c). Similar results\n\nwere obtained when apoptosis was determined by Annexin V/\n\npropidium iodide staining of the cells. Cultivation of BT474 cells\n\non cover slips for 5 d in complete growth medium resulted in\n\nadherent patches that are negative for Annexin V-FITC staining.\n\nAddition of Morphine (10 mM) during the incubation period\nresulted in cell rounding, strong Annexin V binding and nuclear\n\npropidium iodide incorporation, which is indicative for the\n\ninduction of apoptosis. As observed in the cell migration assay,\n\nchronic Heregulin treatment (40 ng/ml) produced morphological\n\nchanges towards a more differentiated cell shape and induced of\n\nearly steps of apoptosis as demonstrated by acquiring a polygonal\n\ncell shape and bright Annexin V-FITC staining. Concomitant\n\ntreatment with Morphine prevented cell differentiation and\n\ninduced apoptosis as indicated by cell rounding and nuclear\n\npropidium iodide incorporation. This chronic Morphine effect\n\nagain is completely blocked by Naloxone (Fig. 4d). Together, these\n\nresults demonstrate that chronic Morphine treatment of BT474\n\ncells induces apoptosis and enhances Heregulin-stimulated cell\n\nfate.\n\nFigure 2.

To obtain a first indication for\n\nwhether changes in the ErbB receptor network would account for\n\nthe differences observed in mitogenic m-opioid receptor signalling\nafter chronic Morphine treatment, several components of receptor\n\ntyrosine kinase-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling pathways\n\nwere analysed by the use of established protein kinase inhibitors.\n\nErbB2-overexpressing BT474 cells contain physiologic levels of\n\nErbB3 receptors that are essential for ErbB2-driven cell growth\n\n[27].

In contrast,\n\nAG825 exclusively attenuated Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2\n\nactivation in chronically Morphine-treated cells. Because AG825\n\nalso fails to affect Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling, the ErbB1/\n\nErbB2 heterodimer appears to mediate ErbB3-stimulated ERK1/\n\n2 signalling in Morphine-treated cells. Pre-incubation of the cells\n\nwith the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin completely blocks Akt\n\nphosphorylation under all conditions. In control cells, Wortman-\n\nnin has no effect on basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2\n\nphosphorylation. However, it largely attenuates ErbB3-stimulated\n\nERK1/2 activation in chronic Morphine-treated cells. This result\n\nimplies that chronic Morphine treatment of BT474 cells switches\n\nHeregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling from a PI3K-indepen-\n\ndent to a PI3K-dependent mechanism. The contribution of\n\nmetalloproteinases on chronic Morphine-induced mitogenic sig-\n\nnalling was finally evaluated by pre-incubation of the cells with\n\nEGCG. To our surprise, blockade of ectodomain shedding by\n\nEGCG selectively attenuates basal and Heregulin-induced ERK1/\n\n2 phosphorylation in chronically Morphine-treated, but not in\n\ncontrol cells. In addition, overall levels of Akt phosphorylation\n\nappear to be reduced as compared to controls. This finding\n\nindicates that activation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers in\n\nchronically Morphine-treated cells appears to require the release\n\nof an autocrine factor (Fig. 5a). Further studies revealed that the\n\nIGF-1 receptor fails to contribute to chronic Morphine-induced\n\nchanges in ERK1/2 and Akt signalling (not shown).\n\nTo verify whether ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers contribute to\n\nmitogenic signalling in chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells,\n\nthese were pre-treated with AG825 and subsequently stimulated\n\nwith EGF. In both control and chronically Morphine-treated cells,\n\nactivation of ErbB1 by EGF leads to stimulation of ERK1/2 and\n\nAkt activities, as previously observed for Heregulin. Again,\n\nfunctional inactivation of ErbB2 by AG825 selectively attenuates\n\nEGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in Morphine-treated\n\ncells (Fig. 5b). Thus, EGF appears to induce the formation of\n\nErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers only after chronic Morphine treat-\n\nment of the cells.\n\nOne major mechanism by which the formation of ErbB\n\nreceptor dimers may be modulated is by regulation of receptor\n\nquantity. As shown in Fig. 5c, chronic Morphine treatment\n\ndifferentially regulates the relative abundance of ErbB receptor\n\ntypes present. By means of Western blot analysis of BT474 plasma\n\nmembranes, strong immunoreactive bands were obtained for\n\nErbB1, ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors. The ErbB4 receptor signal\n\nwas only barely detectable. Chronic Morphine treatment produces\n\ncomplex changes in ErbB receptor levels. It increases the relative\n\nabundance of ErbB1 and ErbB3 and strongly down-regulates the\n\namount of ErbB2. The levels of ErbB4 remained unchanged.\n\nConcomitant treatment of the cells with Naloxone at least partly\n\nprevented these changes. These results suggest that chronic\n\nMorphine treatment could possibly alter the formation of\n\nindividual ErbB homo- and heterodimers by regulating ErbB\n\nreceptor abundance.\n\nTo test whether chronic Morphine indeed leads to the\n\nrearrangement of ErbB receptor dimers, co-precipitation studies\n\nusing an anti-ErbB1 antibody were performed. In membranes\n\nfrom control cells, ErbB1 appears to exclusively form heterodimers\n\nwith ErbB3. Short-term stimulation of the cells with Heregulin\n\ndoes not affect ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, but leads to co-\n\nprecipitation of traces of ErbB2. Besides ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodi-\n\nmers, chronic Morphine treatment also results in the formation of\n\nErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers. Again, short-term stimulation of the\n\ncells with Heregulin did not affect dimer formation (Fig. 5d).\n\nTogether, these results demonstrate that chronic Morphine\n\ntreatment alters ERK1/2 and Akt signalling in BT474 cells by\n\nthe establishment of newly formed ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers.\n\nTo investigate whether similar alterations are also induced in\n\nother ErbB-driven breast tumour cells, the effect on chronic\n\nMorphine treatment on mitogenic signalling was examined in\n\nSKBR3 human mammary carcinoma cells. These cells carry high\n\nlevels of ErbB2 and physiologic levels of ErbB1 and ErbB3 [16].\n\nRT-PCR experiments verified the expression of k-type opioid\nreceptors in this cells system (Fig. 6a), providing the basis for the\n\ndevelopment of chronic Morphine-induced adaptations at the\n\nlevel of the ErbB network. Although chronic Morphine (10 mM,\n3d) treatment produced a subtle increase in the abundance of\n\nErbB1 in plasma membranes (Fig. 6b), no major effect on cell\n\ngrowth was found as assessed by crystal violet staining (100 vs.\n\n103.866%, mean 6 SE, n = 5). Nonetheless, the use of protein\n\nkinase inhibitors revealed the induction of profound alterations in\n\nErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling by chronic Morphine\n\ntreatment. As shown in Fig. 6c, EGF (100 ng/ml) and Heregulin\n\n(40 ng/ml) both stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation to about the\n\nsame extent in control and chronically Morphine (10 mM, 3d)-\ntreated cells. In both cells, pre-treatment with the ErbB1 inhibitor\n\nAG1478 not only attenuates ErbB1-, but also ErbB3-stimulated\n\nERK1/2 activation. This indicates that Heregulin-stimulated\n\nERK1/2 signalling requires ErbB1 in both control and chronically\n\nMorphine-treated SKBR3 cells. In contrast, pre-incubation of the\n\ncells with AG825, Wortmannin and EGCG specifically attenuated\n\nErbB3-stimulated ERK1/2 activation in chronically Morphine-\n\ntreated, but not in control cells. Thus, chronic Morphine\n\ntreatment of SKBR3 cells switches Heregulin-mediated ERK1/2\n\nsignalling to a PI3K-, matrix metalloproteinase- and ErbB2-\n\ndependent mechanism comparable to that observed in BT474\n\ncells. These results demonstrate that in tumour cells the\n\ndysregulated ErbB receptor system represents a target for chronic\n\nopioid treatment.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere is increasing evidence that opioid analgesics interfere\n\nwith several aspects of tumour growth [3]. Here we describe that\n\nhuman BT474 breast cancer cells endogenously express function-\n\nally active m-opioid receptors and that chronic Morphine\ntreatment produces fundamental changes in the ErbB receptor\n\nnetwork resulting in attenuation of Heregulin-stimulated cell\n\ngrowth. These data add a new dimension on the mechanism of\n\nopioid-stimulated mitogenic signalling, as they demonstrate that\n\nopioid receptors not only transactivate RTK-associated signalling\n\npathways but also may alter the growth characteristics of tumour\n\ncells by rearrangement of the ErbB receptor system.\n\nThe ErbB receptor family integrates a number of auto- and\n\nparacrine signals to regulate normal cell growth, differentiation\n\n(100 mM) as indicated.

In many cancers, the ErbB receptor\n\nnetwork is hyperactive and leads to clonal expansion of tumour\n\ncells [29]. Among the best studied examples are human breast\n\ncancers that overexpress the ErbB2 receptor. Because the level of\n\nErbB2 gene amplification in ErbB2 positive cancers is much\n\nhigher than in normal tissue, targeted inactivation of the ErbB2\n\nprotein evolved as one to the most promising and successful\n\nantineoplastic strategies in these cancers. The outcome of anti-\n\nErbB2 treatments, however, is often limited by the induction of\n\ncompensatory resistance mechanisms due to the high plasticity of\n\nthe ErbB network [17]. In this context, the present study\n\nperformed on human BT474 and SKBR3 breast cancer cells\n\nopens a new perspective in order to enhance the sensitivity of\n\nErbB2-directed treatments and to avoid escape mechanisms. This\n\nidea bases on the finding that chronic Morphine treatment induces\n\napoptosis in BT474 cells by affecting the specificity of Heregulin-\n\nstimulated ErbB signalling. These effects are mediated by the\n\nformation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers in chronically Morphine\n\ntreated cells that switch tumour cell growth from an ErbB3- to and\n\nErbB2-dependent mechanism. Opposite changes in ErbB receptor\n\nplasticity have been previously reported for BT474 and SKBR3\n\nmamma carcinoma cells chronically treated with specific anti-\n\nErbB1 and ErbB2 inhibitors. In these studies, inactivation ErbB1\n\nand ErbB2 receptors restored cell growth by reactivation of ErbB3\n\nand ErbB4 receptor signalling [30] and redirected tumour cell\n\ngrowth from an ERK1/2 to an Akt-dependent mechanism [24].\n\nThe changes in ErbB receptor network by chronic Morphine\n\ntreatment were detected by the use of protein kinase inhibitors to\n\nblock acute m-opioid receptor-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt\nactivity. Although the single use of protein kinase inhibitors may\n\nbe endowed with several drawbacks, like non-specific effects, it was\n\nnot possible to verify the present results by genetic approaches\n\nbecause siRNA-mediated knock-down or protein overexpression\n\nper se may alter ErbB signalling and mask possible chronic\n\nMorphine effects. Nevertheless, the use of validated and generally\n\naccepted protein kinase inhibitors in this study provided novel\n\ninsight into the composition of ErbB receptor dimers in BT474\n\nand SKBR3 cells. Our experiments suggest that ErbB1 appears to\n\nrepresent the obligatory binding partner in ErbB receptor dimers,\n\nbecause pre-treatment of the cells with AG1478 blocked all aspects\n\nof basal and Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt activities. To\n\nour surprise, ERK1/2 signalling was exclusively affected by\n\nAG825 in chronically Morphine treated, but not in control cells.\n\nThis suggests that chronic Morphine treatment induces the\n\nformation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, which was verified by\n\nour co-immunoprecipitation studies in BT474 cells. Co-immuno-\n\nprecipitation also revealed the existence of ErbB1/ErbB3 hetero-\n\ndimers in both naı̈ve and chronically Morphine-treated cells,\n\nsubstantiating the notion that the growth of BT474 cells is\n\ndependent on ErB3 signalling despite overexpression of ErbB2\n\n[27].\n\nTo investigate the role of chronic Morphine treatment on\n\nErbB3 signalling, Heregulin stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signal-\n\nling was investigated in BT474 and SKBR3 cells. In control cells,\n\nHeregulin appears to mediate ERK1/2 and Akt signalling via\n\nactivation of single ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers. Activation of\n\nErbB3 in ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers has been shown to mediate\n\nsignal transduction by transactivation of ErbB1, which in turn\n\nstimulates the Ras/Raf/ERK1/2 cascade by binding the adapter\n\nproteins Shc and Grb2 [31]. Because ErbB3 is deficient of kinase\n\nactivity, Heregulin-stimulated Akt signalling must be accomplished\n\nby Grb2/Gab1 mediated cross-regulation of PI3K [32]. After the\n\nintroduction of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers, Heregulin-stimulated\n\nERK1/2, but not Akt signalling became dependent on ErbB2\n\nreceptors in BT474 cells. This finding suggests that Akt signalling\n\nis further accomplished by ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers, whereas\n\nwere stimulated for 5 min with or without Heregulin (40 ng/ml) to form receptor dimers. Proteins were cross-linked and ErbB1 containing dimers\nwere immunoprecipitated using an anti-ErbB1 antibody. Individual ErbB receptors were determined in whole cell solubilisates (S) and\nimmunoprecipitates (IP) by Western blot using type-specific antibodies. Equal protein load was verified by determination of IgG heavy chains (Fc).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g005\n\nFigure 6. Regulation of ErbB signalling by chronic Morphine in\nSKBR3 cells.

In our experiments, blockade of metallopro-\n\nteinase activity by EGCG largely attenuated Heregulin- and EGF-\n\nstimulated ERK1/2 activation, indicating that Heregulin indeed\n\ninduces the release of an EGF-like ligand. Reactivation of a\n\ncomparable autocrine loop maintaining ErbB2 activity has been\n\npreviously described for breast cancer cells chronically treated with\n\nan anti-ErbB2 directed antibody [!33]. In chronically Morphine\n\ntreated cells, Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling also\n\nbecame dependent on PI3K, whereas pre-treatment with\n\nWortmannin is ineffective in control cells. To date, cross-activation\n\nof ERK1/2 signalling by PI3K has been observed only under\n\ndistinct conditions, however the underlying cellular mechanism\n\nremain unclear. It has been suggested that PI3K-dependent Ras/\n\nRaf/ERK1/2 signalling is that ErbB1 recruits GAP/SH2\n\ncomplexes to cell membranes by PIP3 in the presence of low\n\ndoses of EGF-like ligands [34]. Although we cannot exclude such a\n\nmechanism, our results suggest that PI3K contributes to the\n\nHeregulin-induced cleavage of EGF-like ligands by metalloprotei-\n\nnase. This would be in line with the finding that PI3K is able to\n\nblock a negative feedback loop in ErbB3-driven tumour cells,\n\nresulting in a compensatory activation of the ERK signalling\n\npathway [35]. The question remains how Heregulin brings about\n\nAkt phosphorylation in chronically Morphine treated BT474 cells.\n\nDespite the lack of catalytic activity, ErbB3 is able to directly\n\nactivate PI3K by binding all three regulatory subunits through\n\ntheir SH-domains [13]. However, phosphorylation of the 6\n\nconsensus phosphorylation sites in the C-terminus of ErbB3 is\n\nonly induced after ligand-induced activation of an ErbB binding\n\npartner. In this respect, an EGF-like ligand released by Heregulin\n\nmight activate accomplish direct Akt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3\n\nheterodimers in chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells. Such a\n\nmechanism appears plausible because blockade of metalloprotei-\n\nnase activity in chronically Morphine-treated cells substantially\n\nattenuates the levels of Akt phosphorylation. A model of chronic\n\nMorphine-induced changes in Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and\n\nAkt signalling is shown in !Fig. 7.\n\nIn BT474 cells, the functional consequence of the chronic\n\nMorphine-induced alterations in ErbB signalling is the enhance-\n\nment of Heregulin-induced apoptosis. Morphine is known to\n\npossess pro-apoptotic effects in a number or cell models. Pathways\n\nproposed to be involved in Morphine-induced apoptosis include\n\nan increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bim, decreased expres-\n\nsion of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 [36] and stabilization of p53 [37]. On\n\nthe other hand opioids have also been shown to display strong\n\nanti-apoptotic properties in a number of cell models, which are\n\nmediated by activation of the Akt pathway [5]. On the first view,\n\nthe induction of apoptosis in BT474 cells is somewhat surprising,\n\nsince chronic Morphine treatment consistently increased basal\n\nlevels of Akt phosphorylation. One possible explanation for this\n\napparent discrepancy is that the switch from an ErbB3- to an\n\nErbB2-dependent signalling attenuates cell survival by masking\n\nErbB3 driven Akt signalling. An opposite mechanism has been\n\ndescribed in cancer cells with dominant PI3K signalling in which a\n\nnegative feedback loop dampens compensatory Ras/Raf/ERK1/\n\n2 activity, maintaining anti-apoptotic signalling [35]. In this\n\nrespect, chronic Morphine-induced ErbB2 signalling may be\n\nviewed as an escape mechanism that blocks Akt signalling.\n\nThe mechanism by which chronic Morphine regulates the\n\nrearrangement of ErbB receptor dimers remains to be determined.\n\nOne possible explanation would be that Morphine, which acts as a\n\npartial agonist at the m-opioid receptor, produces persistent\n\ninhibitory opioid signalling due to its failure to desensitize the\n\nreceptor [38]. Indeed, although present at relatively low levels in\n\nBT474, chronic Morphine treatment had no effect on m-opioid\nreceptor abundance and signalling, providing an absolute\n\nrequirement for the induction of adaptational changes on post-\n\nreceptor level. In neuronal cells, such changes are proposed to\n\ncontribute to the development of opioid tolerance and dependence\n\n[1]. In non-neuronal cells, chronic Morphine treatment has been\n\nshown to facilitate persistent ERK1/2 signalling by down-\n\nregulation of c-Cbl and blockade of ErbB1 receptor degradation\n\n[18]. Inhibition of protein degradation could explain our finding\n\nthat chronic Morphine treatment elevates the abundance of ErbB1\n\nand ErbB3 in BT474 cells. An opposite down-regulation of ErbB2\n\nafter chronic Morphine treatment might be the result of\n\nactivation-induced cleavage of the receptor, which is typical for\n\nErbB2-overexpressing cells [39]. Because regulation of ErbB\n\nabundance is a critical determinant for the signalling activity in a\n\nFigure 7. Model of chronic Morphine-induced changes in ErbB\nsignalling. The scheme depicts the differences in Heregulin-stimulated\nErbB signalling in control and chronically Morphine-treated BT474 cells.\nIn control cells, stimulation with Heregulin leads to activation of ERK1/2\nand Akt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3 heterodimers. While AG1478 blocks\nboth Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 and Akt signalling, inhibition of PI3K\nby Wortmannin specifically prevents Akt signalling. Because ErbB3\nphosphorylation and PI3K activation is dependent on the presence of a\ndimerized ErbB member with catalytic activity, these results indicate\nthat Heregulin-stimulated ERK1/2 signalling is predominantly mediated\nthrough ErbB1. The failure of Wortmannin to affect ERK1/2 activation in\ncontrol cells further implicates that Heregulin stimulates Akt signalling\nvia ErbB3. Chronic Morphine treatment alters mitogenic signalling by\nrearrangement of ErbB heterodimers. Whereas Heregulin still stimulates\nAkt signalling via ErbB1/ErbB3, ERK1/2 signalling is now accomplished\nby ErbB1/2 heterodimers. These are activated indirectly by an EGF-like\nligand liberated from Heregulin in a PI3K (Wortmannin)- and\nmetalloproteinase (EGCG)-dependent manner.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053510.g007\n\nMorphine Regulation of ErbB Signalling\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53510\n\n\n\ngiven cell system [28], quantitative changes in ErbB receptors\n\nrepresent a potential mechanism by which chronic Morphine\n\ntreatment influences the composition of individual ErbB dimers.\n\nConclusions\nThe present study demonstrates that chronic Morphine\n\ntreatment produces fundamental changes in the ErbB receptor\n\nnetwork of human breast cancer cells that are characterized by\n\nquantitative alterations in the abundance of individual ErbB\n\nreceptors, alterations in ErbB dimer formation and the introduc-\n\ntion of an autocrine loop that redirects Heregulin-stimulated\n\nERK1/2 activation from ErbB1/ErbB3 to ErbB1/2-heterodi-\n\nmers. Although these changes produce no major effect on\n\nMorphine stimulated cell growth and mitogenic signalling, they\n\nbecome evident when Heregulin-stimulated effects on cell growth\n\nwere examined. Direct modulation of ErbB signalling mechanisms\n\ncould explain the many discrepant opioid effects on cell growth\n\nand apoptosis observed so far in individual cell systems and may\n\nprovide a novel strategy to stabilize certain ErbB dimers in order\n\nto enhance the sensitivity of ErbB-directed anti-tumour therapies\n\nand to avoid the development of drug resistance by preventing\n\nescape mechanisms.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe like to thank Andreas Blaschke for help with confocal microscopy.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: IRW HA.
