Marie-Agnès Dillies2,\nFlorence Goulhen-Chollet1, Florence Hommais3, Didier Lièvremont1, Florence Arsène-Ploetze1, Jean-Yves Coppée2,\nPhilippe N Bertin1*\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Both the speciation and toxicity of arsenic are affected by bacterial transformations, i.e. oxidation,\nreduction or methylation. These transformations have a major impact on environmental contamination and more\nparticularly on arsenic contamination of drinking water. Herminiimonas arsenicoxydans has been isolated from an\narsenic- contaminated environment and has developed various mechanisms for coping with arsenic, including the\noxidation of As(III) to As(V) as a detoxification mechanism.\n\nResults: In the present study, a differential transcriptome analysis was used to identify genes, including arsenite\noxidase encoding genes, involved in the response of H. arsenicoxydans to As(III). To get insight into the molecular\nmechanisms of this enzyme activity, a Tn5 transposon mutagenesis was performed. Transposon insertions resulting\nin a lack of arsenite oxidase activity disrupted aoxR and aoxS genes, showing that the aox operon transcription is\nregulated by the AoxRS two-component system. Remarkably, transposon insertions were also identified in rpoN\ncoding for the alternative N sigma factor (s54) of RNA polymerase and in dnaJ coding for the Hsp70 co-chaperone.\nWestern blotting with anti-AoxB antibodies and quantitative RT-PCR experiments allowed us to demonstrate that\nthe rpoN and dnaJ gene products are involved in the control of arsenite oxidase gene expression. Finally, the\ntranscriptional start site of the aoxAB operon was determined using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and a\nputative -12/-24 s54-dependent promoter motif was identified upstream of aoxAB coding sequences.\nConclusion: These results reveal the existence of novel molecular regulatory processes governing arsenite oxidase\nexpression in H. arsenicoxydans. These data are summarized in a model that functionally integrates arsenite\noxidation in the adaptive response to As(III) in this microorganism.\n\nBackground\nArsenic is present in various environments, released\nfrom either anthropogenic or natural sources. This ele-\nment is toxic for living organisms and known to be a\nhuman carcinogen [1]. Its toxicological effects depend,\nat least in part, on its oxidation state and its chemical\nforms, inorganic species being considered as more toxic\n[2]. The contamination of drinking water by the two\ninorganic forms, arsenite As(III) and arsenate As(V), has\nbeen reported in different parts of the world [3] and\nconstitutes a major threat of public health. Microorgan-\nisms are known to take part in the transformation, i.e\n\noxidation, reduction or methylation of the metalloid,\nhaving a deep impact on arsenic contamination in\nenvironment.\nSeveral bacteria and prokaryotes have developed adap-\n\ntation, resistance and colonization mechanisms, which\nallow them to live in hostile arsenic contaminated envir-\nonments. H. arsenicoxydans is a Gram-negative b-pro-\nteobacterium isolated from an industrial activated\nsludge plant and exhibiting a remarkable set of arsenic\nresistance determinants [4]. The H. arsenicoxydans\nadaptive response to arsenic is organized in a complex\nand sophisticated network. In particular, differential pro-\nteome studies have recently demonstrated the synthesis\nof several proteins encoded by the three ars resistance\noperons, e.g. arsenate reductase ArsC, flavoprotein ArsH\nand regulator ArsR [5,6] and the induction of oxidative\n\n* Correspondence: philippe.bertin@unistra.fr\n† Contributed equally\n1UMR7156 Génétique Moléculaire, Génomique et Microbiologie, CNRS\nUniversité de Strasbourg, 28 rue Goethe, 67000 Strasbourg, France\n\nKoechler et al.

The two genes coding for\nthis heterodimeric enzyme are organized in an operonic\nstructure, and have been named aoxA and aoxB for the\nsmall and the large subunit, respectively [6,8,9]. Homo-\nlogous genes have been since identified in various\nmicroorganisms [6,10-13]. In Agrobacterium tumefa-\nciens, a complex transcriptional regulation has been\nrecently suggested, involving As(III) sensing, two-com-\nponent signal transduction by an AoxS sensor kinase\nand an AoxR regulator, and quorum sensing [14].\nNevertheless, the molecular mechanisms involved in the\ncontrol of arsenite oxidase expression remain largely\nunknown.\nTo extend our view of arsenic response [7], in particu-\n\nlar with respect to the arsenic oxidation process, we\nconducted a comprehensive transcriptomic, genetic and\nmolecular analysis of H. arsenicoxydans following expo-\nsure to As(III). These approaches allowed us to identify\nmajor determinants involved in the control of arsenite\noxidation.\n\nResults\nGene expression profiling in response to arsenic\nThe response to As(III) was analyzed in exponentially\ngrowing cells using microarrays. The data from three\nbiological replicates were combined after normalization\nand statistical analysis carried out using the R software\nand packages http://www.r-project.org. The set of genes\nwas further refined to include only those genes that\nshowed a valid p-value and whose expression was\naltered by a factor of 2 or more when compared to the\nlevel measured in the absence of arsenic.\nThis experiment led to the identification of 293 genes\n\nshowing an arsenic-induced expression change (> 2 fold\n(log2 = 1)). Among these genes, 133 (45%) were up-\nregulated and the remaining part, i.e. 160 genes, was\ndown-regulated. The relative changes in gene expression\nranged from a 11-fold down-regulation (rpsN gene\nencoding a ribosomal protein) to a 126-fold up-regula-\ntion (putative gene involved in phosphate transport). A\nlist of those genes is shown in Additional file 1, Table\nS1. The corresponding HEAR gene numbers are avail-\nable in the Arsenoscope relational database http://www.\ngenoscope.cns.fr/agc/mage/arsenoscopevia the MaGe\nweb interface [15].\nThe 293 genes differentially expressed were clustered\n\naccording to the function of the corresponding encoded\nproteins. Among the 133 genes that were induced by at\n\nleast a 2-fold factor, about 11% are involved in metabo-\nlism, 26% in transport and binding protein, 26% in cel-\nlular processes and 31% have no assigned function. The\nhigh percentage of genes with unknown function is in\naccordance with the proportion of unknown function\nproteins identified in the genome of H. arsenicoxydans\n[6,7]. In agreement with our previous results, genes\ninvolved in arsenic resistance, phosphate transport and\nflagellar biosynthesis were induced in the presence of As\n(III) (see Additional file 1, Table S1), further supporting\nthe relationship between these physiological processes\n[6,7]. Interestingly, only one methyl-accepting chemo-\ntaxis protein (MCP) gene was induced in our microarray\ndata, suggesting a role for this protein in the sensing of\narsenic. This mechanism is currently under investiga-\ntion. Genes encoding the putative nitroreductase AoxC\nand the cytochrome c552 precursor AoxD as well as the\nresponse regulator AoxRS were found to be induced by\nAs(III) (see Additional file 1, Table S1). AoxR has been\nproposed to act as a positive regulator of the aox operon\nupon phosphorylation by AoxS in A. tumefaciens [14].\nOur transcriptomic data suggest that the regulation\nmachinery is, at least in part, similar in H. arsenicoxy-\ndans. Futhermore, genes coding for the arsenite oxidase\nAoxAB subunits were found to be among the most\ninduced genes in the presence of As(III). However, even\nthough these results extended our knowledge of the\narsenic response in H. arsenicoxydans, they did not led\nto a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms\ninvolved in the control of arsenite oxidation. This\nprompted us to perform a transposon mutagenesis\nexperiment.\n\nIdentification of arsenite oxidase accessory genes by\nscreening an Aox activity deficient mutant library\nTo identify genes possibly involved in the control of\narsenite oxidation in H. arsenicoxydans, a library of\n10,000 kanamycin resistant mutants was constructed by\ntransposon mutagenesis, as previously described [9].\nThese clones were tested by silver nitrate staining [16]\nfor arsenate production on As(III)-supplemented CDM\nagar plates. As compared to the wild-type strain, whose\narsenite oxidase activity was revealed by a brownish pre-\ncipitate, 10 mutants with a lack of As(III) oxidase activ-\nity were obtained. These strains showed no precipitate\n(Figure 1A), as observed for the M1 and M2 strains\nused as negative controls. Indeed, these strains carry a\nmutation in aoxA or aoxB genes coding for the small\nand the large subunit of arsenite oxidase, respectively\n[9]. Genes disrupted by transposon insertions were iden-\ntified in these 10 new mutants. As expected, four of the\n10 mutants showed insertions in the aoxAB operon\n(Figure 2A). More interestingly, six mutants carried a\ntransposon insertion outside the aoxAB operon. Two\n\nKoechler et al.

These\nresults further support our transcriptomic data suggest-\ning that these two genes play a role in arsenic response.\nTwo transposon insertions were shown to disrupt genes\nof the modEABC operon coding for a molybdenum\nhigh-affinity transport system [17], i.e. modC encoding\nan ATP-binding cassette transport protein (mutant\nHa3437) and modB encoding a molybdenum transport\nsystem permease (mutant Ha3438) (Figure 2B). Remark-\nably, transposon insertions were also located in dnaJ\nencoding a heat shock protein (Hsp40), (mutant\nHa2646) (Figure 2C) and in rpoN encoding the alterna-\ntive nitrogen sigma factor (sigma 54) of RNA polymer-\nase (mutant Ha3109) (Figure 2D).\nTwo additional experiments were performed to com-\n\nplete the physiological characterization of these mutants\nwith respect to arsenite oxidation. First, arsenic species\nwere quantified by HPLC-ICP-AES on filtered culture\nsupernatants. H. arsenicoxydans was grown in liquid\nmedium supplemented with 1.33 mM arsenite and\nshowed 100% transformation of As(III) into As(V) after\n48 h, whereas M1 (aoxA) and M2 (aoxB) mutants used\nas controls were not able to transform As(III) into As\n(V). The same loss of arsenite oxidase activity was mea-\nsured in Ha482 (aoxS), Ha483 (aoxR), Ha2646 (dnaJ)\nand Ha3109 (rpoN) mutants. In contrast to the results\nobtained on agar plates, Ha3437 (modC) and Ha3438\n(modB) strains showed 100% transformation of arsenite\n(Table 1, Figure 1A). Previous studies have demon-\nstrated that the bioavailability of metals or trace ele-\nments considerably varies according to the type of\nmatrix used for microbial growth [18]. We therefore\nassumed that Mo might be partly sequestred on CDM\nagar medium, resulting in a lack of arsenite oxidase\n\nactivity on plate. To test this hypothesis, As(III) oxidase\ntests were performed on CDM agar plates supplemented\nwith 50 μM Mo. The addition of Mo to the solid med-\nium restored As(III) oxidase activity in both Ha3437\n(modC) and Ha3438 (modB) mutants while it had no\neffect on other mutant strains (Figure 1B).\nSecond, we have previously demonstrated that the\n\npolar flagellum-dependent motility of H. arsenicoxydans\nis increased in the presence of As(III), suggesting that\narsenite oxidation may result in a gain of energy [6].\nThe motility of mutant strains was therefore tested on\nplates containing different concentrations of As(III), i. e.\n0.66 mM, 1.33 mM and 2 mM. The diameter of the\nswarming rings was measured after 72 h. As shown in\nFigure 3, the disruption of aoxA, aoxB, aoxR, aoxS or\nrpoN genes abolished the improvement of swarming\nperformances in the presence of As(III). Unlike those\nmutants, a disruption in dnaJ completely abolished the\nmotility of H. arsenicoxydans in the presence or the\nabsence of As(III). DnaJ is known to be essential for\nthe expression of the flhDC flagellar master operon in\nEscherichia coli [19]. The lack of motility observed in\nthe dnaJ mutant suggests the existence of a similar\nflhDC-dependent regulation of flagellar genes in H.\narsenicoxydans. More importantly, the dnaJ mutant was\naffected in both the motility and arsenite oxidation,\nsuggesting that these two mechanisms are co-regulated.\n\nEffect of AoxR, AoxS, RpoN and DnaJ on arsenite oxidase\nsynthesis\nTo get further insight into the involvement of AoxR,\nAoxS, RpoN and DnaJ in arsenite oxidase activity, Wes-\ntern immunoblotting experiments were performed using\nantibodies raised against AoxB. The abundance of this\nprotein was evaluated from total protein extracts of H.\narsenicoxydans wild-type and mutant strains grown in\nthe presence or not of As(III). AoxB was detected as a\nsingle band corresponding to a molecular mass of 92\nkDa in As(III)-challenged H. arsenicoxydans strain\n(Figure 4). This single band was not observed in the\nvarious mutant strains. Furthermore, arsenite oxidase\nactivity on native gel was only detected in As(III)-chal-\nlenged wild type total extract (data not shown). Taken\ntogether these results suggest that the lack of activity in\nthe mutant strains is due to the absence of AoxB\nprotein, which may result from an effect of AoxR, AoxS,\nRpoN and DnaJ on aoxAB expression.\n\nEffect of AoxR, AoxS, RpoN and DnaJ on the control of\narsenite oxidase operon expression\nTo determine the involvement of aoxR, aoxS, dnaJ and\nrpoN on aoxAB transcription, we performed quantitative\nRT-PCR experiments. For each strain, changes in aoxB\ntranscript abundance were compared to two internal\n\nTable 1 Determination of arsenic speciation in H.\narsenicoxydans wild-type and mutant strains.\n\nStrain Mutated gene Arsenic species identifieda\n\nAs(III) As(V)\n\nULPAs1 / - +\n\nM1b aoxA + -\n\nM2b aoxB + -\n\nHa482 aoxS + -\n\nHa483 aoxR + -\n\nHa2646 dnaJ + -\n\nHa3109 rpoN + -\n\nHa3437 modC - +\n\nHa3438 modB - +\na Determined by HPLC-ICP-AES after 48 h growth in CDM medium containing\n100 mg.liter of arsenite.\nb [9]\n\nKoechler et al.

AoxR con-\ntains three conserved domains shared by most Enhancer\nBinding Proteins (EBP), namely a N-terminal response\nregulator receiver domain (amino acids 18-130), a cen-\ntral s54 interaction domain (amino acids 147-368) com-\nmon to all s54 dependent EBPs (Pfam E-value 10-116;\nhttp://www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/Pfam/getacc?PF00158)\nand a C-terminal DNA binding helix-turn-helix (HTF)\ndomain (amino acids 421-463) enable to bind to specific\nupstream activation sequences [20].

Taken\ntogether, these observations strongly suggest that AoxR\ninteracts directly with RpoN to initiate the transcription\nof aoxAB operon in H. arsenicoxydans.\n\nDiscussion\nDespite many works devoted to arsenic metabolism in\nmicroorganisms, little is known about the regulation of\narsenite oxidase activity. In the present study, the com-\nbination of transcriptomic, genetic and molecular data\nprovided a comprehensive view of the role of various\nproteins in the control of arsenite oxidation in H.\narsenicoxydans (Figure 7). We showed that some pro-\nteins play an indirect role in this process, as their pre-\nsence is not essential for AoxAB synthesis. In this\nrespect, the AoxB large subunit contains a Mo site\nrequired in arsenite oxidase enzymatic activity [22].\n\nHa3437 (modC) and Ha3438 (modB) mutations were\nlocated in the molybdenum high-affinity transport sys-\ntem operon, which further support the key role of this\nelement in enzyme activity. In addition, the recovery of\nAs(III) oxidase activity in these two mutants in the pre-\nsence of an excess molybdenum suggests that Mo may\nalso be transported through an alternative uptake system\nin mod mutants, e.g. a low-affinity uptake system invol-\nving non specific permeases such as HEAR0069,\nHEAR0154, HEAR1749 or HEAR2391 or a sulfate trans-\nport system, as described in E. coli mod mutants [23].\nMore importantly, our results suggest that AoxR and\n\nRpoN constitute a transcriptional complex that play a\nmajor role in the initiation of aoxAB operon transcrip-\ntion. Three mutants, i.e. Ha482 (aoxS), Ha483 (aoxR)\nand Ha3109 (rpoN), were affected in this process. The\namino acids sequence analysis of H. arsenicoxydans\nAoxR and AoxS revealed the existence in these proteins\n\nFigure 6 Amino acids conservation between s54 Enhancer Binding Proteins (EBP) and AoxR. Sequence alignment was performed with\nClustalW. The conserved amino acids are presented with a blue background and the blue intensity reflects sequence similarities. Only the\ncentral binding domain is indicated. Region CI has remarkable similarity to the consensus glycine-rich flexible loop motif (Walker A - consensus\nmotif GxxGxGK), and also contains hydrophobic residues. Region CII is hydrophobic. The region CIII is predicted to fold into two alpha helices\nseparated by a turn. This region is involved in a specific interaction between the EBP and the Es54 required for open promoter complex\nformation via the GAFTGA motif. Region CIV is rich in glycine, negatively charged and contains a consensus sequence of 4 aliphatic residues\nfollowed by 2 negatively charged residues (Walker B - consensus motif TVFLDE); in contrast, CVI is positively charged and is rich in aromatic\nresidues and proline. Region CV is found about 80 amino acids away from region CI, and has a consensus sequence QakLLRVLqe. Finally, region\nCVII has a core of eight highly conserved amino acids. Sequence informations of other genes were obtained from Colibri database (Institut\nPasteur, Paris).\n\nKoechler et al.

More-\nover, the comparison of AoxS and AoxR protein\nsequences with those of A. tumefaciens revealed similari-\nties. Indeed, the AoxS protein sequence contains short\nblocks of conserved motifs that are consistent with a\nrole of sensor histidine kinase, e.g. the “H” (amino acids\n279 to 287: LAHEVNNPL), the “G2” (amino acids 435\nto 441: GRIGLGL) and the “N” (amino acids 380 to 391:\nVRQIVLNLVLNA) domains. In addition, four highly\ninvariant residues playing a central role in phosphoryla-\ntion correspond to Asp9, Asp10, Asp57 and Lys107 in\nthe H. arsenicoxydans AoxR protein. The three aspara-\ngine residues are known to interact together to form an\n“acid pocket”, characteristic of orthodox receivers, into\nwhich the side chain of Lys109 protrudes [24]. Finally, a\ntransmembrane region and a 17 amino acids residue\ncluster possibly exposed to the periplasm are present in\n\nAoxS and could serve as a signal receptor in the pre-\nsence of As(III) in the medium. The detection of As(III)\nwould then lead to AoxS autophosphorylation at a histi-\ndine residue via ATP hydrolysis and phosphotransfer to\nan aspartate residue in the response regulator AoxR, as\nrecently proposed in A. tumefaciens [14].\nRemarkably, our results demonstrated for the first\n\ntime that the alternative N sigma factor (s54) is essential\nfor the initiation of arsenite oxidase transcription.\nIndeed, a mutation in the corresponding gene led to a\ncomplete loss of As(III) oxidation and aoxB transcrip-\ntion in Ha3109 (rpoN). s54 is one of the alternative\nsigma subunits of RNA polymerase responsible for spe-\ncific binding to DNA. The core RNA polymerase com-\nplexed with s54 is usually associated with nitrogen\nassimilation and fixation, but is also known to play a\nrole in various physiological processes, e.g. flagellar\nsynthesis, carbon source utilization or bacterial virulence\n[25]. To date, only one report has shown that s54\n\nFigure 7 Conceptual representation of the complex arsenite oxidation process in H. arsenicoxydans. Several major control mechanisms\nare involved: A. a transcriptional regulation: AoxS acts as a sensor of As(III) environmental signal and then phosphorylates AoxR. The\nphosphorylated AoxR binds to RpoN, which interacts with RNA polymerase. The RpoN-RNA polymerase complex with its AoxR co-activator\ninitiates the aox operon transcription. DnaJ may regulate aox mRNA stability or act on the folding of AoxR or s54; B. Then, arsenite oxidase is\nsynthesized and exported by the TAT secretion system; C. consequently, arsenite oxidase exerts a key role in arsenic detoxification, by the\ntransformation of the more toxic form As(III) into a less toxic form As(V). This process is known to affect motility, which may involve a MCP\nchemotaxis protein and requires the DnaJ co-chaperone. IM= Inner Membrane, OM= Outer membrane.\n\nKoechler et al.

RNA polymerase\ntogether with s54 binds to a specific promoter site,\nwith the consensus DNA sequence YTGGCACGNNNN\nTTGCWNNw [27], forming a transcriptionally in-\nactive closed complex. Such a characteristic -12/-24\ns54-dependent promoter motif, i.e. TGGCACG-\nCAGTTTGC, was identified 26 pb upstream of the tran-\nscriptional initiation codon of aoxAB with respect to the\n+1 transcriptional start site (Figure 5), which confirmed\nthe need for RpoN in the initiation of aoxAB transcrip-\ntion. Changes in the conformation of s54-RNA polymer-\nase are nucleotide dependent. Indeed, the DNA melting\nstep absolutely requires the interaction with a transcrip-\ntional activator protein. Most of these s54-dependent\nactivators share three domains found in AoxR, i.e. a C-\nterminal DNA binding domain that binds to upstream\nactivation sequences, a conserved central domain\nbelonging to the AAA+ (ATPases associated with var-\nious cellular activities) protein family to proceed with\ninitiation of transcription and a N-terminal receiver\ndomain that regulates its own AAA+ domain [20,28,29].\nA multiple alignment of the central domain revealed a\nconservation of a common architecture between AoxR\nand s54 EBPs. Indeed, seven highly conserved sequence\nmotifs corresponding to a s54 interaction domain of\nAoxR further support the direct interaction of AoxR\nwith RpoN to stimulate the transcription of aoxAB\noperon in H. arsenicoxydans (Figure 6). This central s54\n\ninteraction domain has been already used to identify\nnew s54 EBPs [30-37]. It contains the highly conserved\nsignature sequence GAFTGA loop (conserved region\nCIII, Figure 6) proved to be required for direct interac-\ntion with s54 [21,38,39], the Walker A (conserved region\nI, Figure 6) and B (conserved region CIV, Figure 6)\nATPase motifs necessary for the open complex\nformation.\nBoth multiple sequences alignment and genetic envir-\n\nonment analysis of aox promoters suggest the existence\nof a wide diversity in the transcriptional control of the\naox operon. Indeed, as in H. arsenicoxydans, a s54-\ndependent promoter signature was identified in bacteria\npossessing a two-component transduction system\nAoxRS operon downstream of the aoxAB operon, e.g. A.\ntumefaciens and O. tritici (Figure 5A). In contrast, no\ns54-dependent promoter motif and no aoxR homolo-\ngous gene were found in other bacteria, e.g. C. aurantia-\ncus or C. aggregans (Figure 5B). These observations\nsuggest that the transcription of the aox operon in these\nbacteria may involve other regulatory proteins and that\nAoxR may represent a specific co-activator of RpoN in\nthe initiation of the aox operon transcription. Finally,\n\nour results provide evidence that the DnaJ co-chaperone\nis required for As(III) oxidation. DnaJ is part of the\nDnaK-DnaJ-GrpE Hsp70 machinery. Hsp70 chaperones\nrepresent one of the most potent defence cellular\nmechanism against environmental insults as DnaK-\nDnaJ-GrpE are known to assist protein folding [40,41]\nor to be involved in mRNA stability [42]. In the present\nstudy we showed that there is no induction of aoxAB\ntranscription in the dnaJ mutant, resulting in a loss of\nAoxAB synthesis.\nSeveral possible mechanisms involving DnaJ in the\n\nregulation of arsenite oxidase can be hypothesized. DnaJ\nmay be required for the proper folding or activity of the\nAoxR regulator. Such a function has been demonstrated\nfor the positive regulator CRP in a dnaJ deletion mutant\nin E. coli [43]. Similarly, a post-transcriptional regulation\nof the arsenite oxidase itself can not be excluded. More-\nover, a Tat (Twin-Arginine Translocation) signal has\nbeen detected in the AoxA sequence of H. arsenicoxy-\ndans [6]. Proteins secreted to the periplasm via a Tat\nprotein export pathway are known to require a folding\nby Hsp70 chaperones before their secretion. DnaJ could\nbe one of these chaperones [44,45]. Another possible\ntarget of DnaJ may be the RpoN sigma factor, as this\nchaperone has been demonstrated to play a role in the\nregulation of sS in various species [46]. Alternatively,\nseveral mechanisms are known to be involved in the\nstability of messenger RNA. For example, in E. coli, a\nlong 5’ untranslated region (UTR) has been observed\nupstream of the transcriptional start site of the flhDC\nflagellum master operon. This region plays a crucial role\nin the stability of the mRNA controlled by CsrA [19]. In\nthe present report, the aoxAB transcriptional start site\nwas located 26 bp upstream of the translational start\ncodon, providing evidence that such a long 5’UTR does\nnot exist upstream of the aox operon. However, this\ndoes not rule out a role of DnaJ on the stability of\naoxAB mRNA, as HSP proteins are known to function\nas mRNA stabilizers and to protect them against nucle-\nase degradation [42]. Further experiments will therefore\nbe required to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms\nof arsenite oxidase regulation in H. arsenicoxydans.\n\nConclusion\nTaken together, our observations provide evidence that\nmultiple proteins play a role in the control of arsenite\noxidation in H. arsenicoxydans. The following regulatory\nmodel is proposed: AoxS responds to the presence of\nAs(III) in the environment and autophosphorylates. The\nphosphate is then transferred to AoxR, which acts as a\npositive regulator of the aox operon and activates the\ninitiation of the transcription in association with RpoN.\nIn addition, DnaJ acts on the expression or the stability\nof both arsenite oxidation and motility genes,\n\nKoechler et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:53\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/53\n\nPage 9 of 13\n\n\n\ndemonstrating that these two functions are strongly\nlinked. Our results include the role of RpoN and DnaJ\nin arsenite oxidase synthesis, which provide further\ninsight into the molecular mechanisms used by H.\narsenicoxydans to cope with the most toxic form of\narsenic in its environment.\n\nMethods\nBacterial strains and growth media\nBacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 3. H.\narsenicoxydans ULPAs1 was grown in a chemically defined\nmedium (CDM), supplemented by 2% agar when required\n[4]. Escherichia coli S17-1 strain [47] was cultivated in LB\nmedium (MP Biochemicals). Matings were performed on\nCDM to which 10% (wt/vol) LB medium was added, as\npreviously described [9]. Tryptone swarm plates containing\nCDM supplemented with 1% Bacto-Tryptone and 0.25%\nagar were used to assess bacterial motility.\n\nTransposon mutagenesis\nThe mini-Tn5::lacZ2 transposon [47] was delivered by\nmobilization of the suicide vector pUT/mini-Tn5::lacZ2\nfrom E. coli S17-1 (l-pyr) to H. arsenicoxydans. Conju-\ngation was performed and transformants were selected\nas previously described [9].\n\nSelection of arsenite oxidase mutants\nMutants were screened for arsenite oxidase activity as\npreviously described [9]. Agar plates were flooded with\na 0.1 M AgNO3 solution to visualize arsenite oxidation\n[16]. Mutants affected in molybdenum metabolism were\nalso tested on CDM agar plates supplemented with 50\nμM Na2MoO4, 2H2O and 1.33 mM As(III).\n\nDNA manipulation and insertion mapping\nDNA manipulations were carried out according to stan-\ndard protocols, as described by Sambrook et al. [48].\n\nTotal DNA was isolated from mutant strains with the\nWizard Genomic DNA purification kit (Promega).\nTransposon insertion sites were mapped as previously\ndescribed [9]. Briefly, total DNA was digested and self-\nligated. This ligation mixture was used as a template for\nPCR amplification using mini-transposon specific pri-\nmers. The PCR products obtained were purified with a\nPCR purification kit (Qiagen) and sequenced on an\nApplied Biosystems ABI prism 3130×l capillary sequen-\ncer. The resulting sequences were compared to the H.\narsenicoxydans genome sequence [6] to identify dis-\nrupted CDS. Finally, insertion sites and transposon\norientations were precisely mapped by sequencing PCR\nproducts obtained with two primers hybridizing\nupstream and downstream, respectively, of the insertion\nsite of each disrupted gene (see Additional file 2,\nTable S2).\n\nArsenic speciation determination\nH. arsenicoxydans wild type and mutants were grown\nfor 48 hours in CDM medium supplemented with 1.33\nmM As(III). Culture supernatants were filtered through\nsterile 0,22 μm pore size filters (VWR). Arsenic species\nwere separated by high-performance liquid chromato-\ngraphy (HPLC) and quantified by inductively coupled\nplasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), as\npreviously described [9].\n\nRNA extraction\nStrains were grown at 25°C for 24 h (OD = 0,15) and\ncultures were induced by addition of 0.66 mM or 1.33\nmM As(III) for 8 hours before extraction. Samples were\nharvested and stored at -80°C. RNA was extracted as\npreviously described [7]. After extraction procedure,\nRNA integrity was checked by electrophoregram analysis\non a BioAnalyser (Agilent) and total RNA concentration\nwas determined spectrophotometrically with a\nNanodrop.\n\nMicroarrays and data analysis\nMicroarrays containing 60-mer oligonucleotides for all\npredicted H. arsenicoxydans genes http://www.geno-\nscope.cns.fr/agc/mage/arsenoscope were used, as pre-\nviously described [7]. Briefly, total RNA (5 μg) was\nreverse transcribed and indirectly labelled according to\nmanufacturer’s instructions with some modifications [7].\nThe quality and concentration determination as well as\nhybridization and scanning were performed as pre-\nviously described [7] Three distinct biological RNA sam-\nples were prepared from in each growth condition (with\nand without As(III) induction) and labelled either by\nCy3 or Cy5 in a dye-swap design. Microarray data were\ndeposited in ArrayExpress (accession E-MEXP-2199 and\nA-MEXP-1594).

The experiment design included\nthree biological replicates. For each of them, induced\nand non-induced cells were compared in dye swap\nexperiments. The resulting arrays were analyzed using\nthe R software http://www.r-project.org. A slide by slide\nLoess normalization was performed using the limma\npackage [49]. Valid log2 expression ratios from repli-\ncated spots were averaged on each array so as to get sta-\ntistically independent ratios for each oligonucleotide\nincluded in the array design. For the same reason, dye\nswap arrays were also averaged. Oligos that had no valid\nexpression ratios on the ten arrays were excluded from\nthe data set for further analysis, which was carried out\nusing the varmixt package and the VM option [50]. The\nresulting raw p-values were adjusted according to a Ben-\njamini and Yekutieli procedure [51]. Genes showing a\nvalid p-value and a more than two-fold decreased or\nincreased expression were considered as differentially\nexpressed between the two conditions and were retained\nfor further study.\n\nQuantitative real time PCR\nQuantitative PCR experiments were performed with\nRNA prepared as described for microarrays. RNA ali-\nquots were purified with the RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qia-\ngen) to ensure the elimination of genomic DNA. Total\nRNA concentration was determined spectrophotometri-\ncally using a Nanodrop and RNA integrity was electro-\nphoretically verified. Total RNA (1,9 μg) was reverse\ntranscribed with SuperScript III first-strand synthesis\nsystem for RT-PCR (Invitrogen) using random hexam-\ners. Real time quantitative PCR was carried out with a\nMyiQ single-color Real-time PCR detection system. The\nreaction mixture contained 12,5 μl of MESA Blue qPCR\nMasterMix Plus for SYBR Assay with fluorescein (Euro-\ngentec), 5 μl of cDNA and 300 nM of each primer in a\ntotal volume of 25 μl. Thermocycling conditions were\nas follow: 5 min at 95°c and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C,\n15 s at 61°c and 1 min at 72°C. The PCR efficiency of\nthe genes of interest and internal control genes were\noptimized to be similar enough by adjusting the primer\nconcentrations to 300 nM each (data not shown). For\neach quantitative PCR run, non-template controls were\nperformed to identify false positives and negative con-\ntrols without reverse transcriptase were performed for\neach cDNA synthesis reaction and verified in real time\nPCR to determine the presence of contaminating geno-\nmic DNA. Two biological replicates (independent cul-\ntures) and two quantitative PCR replicates were\nperformed for each experience. Amplification products\nwere designed to be less than 175 bp in size. The pairs\nof primers used are listed in Additional file 2, Table S2.\n\nTwo housekeeping genes, i.e. HEAR2922 coding for a\nputative RNA methyltransferase and HEAR0118 coding\nfor a peptide deformylase, were used as standards to\nobtain normalized aoxB (HEAR0478) gene ratio [52] in\nthe As(III) induced sample compared to the non-\ninduced sample. These two housekeeping genes showed\na stable expression between the two analyzed conditions\n(without As(III) and after an 8 hours As(III) exposure)\nwhen observing the microarrays data. The data were\nanalyzed with the Relative Expression Software Tool\n[53]. Statistical significance was defined as a p-value of\n≤ 0.05.\n\n5’RACE experiment\nThe transcriptional start site of aoxAB operon was\ndetermined using the 5’RACE system for rapid amplifi-\ncation of cDNA ends (Invitrogen). Total RNA was\nobtained as described before. Reverse transcriptase reac-\ntions were performed using 5 μg total RNA and a gene\nspecific reverse primer (5’-CATGGGCACTT-\nGAATGTCTTG-3’). Reactions were heated at 70°C for\n10 min and immediately prewarmed at 50°C before\naddition of Super-Script II reverse transcriptase. Reverse\ntranscription was conducted at 50°C for 50 min and\nstopped at 70°c for 15 min. Purification and tailing of\ncDNA were performed according to manufacturer’s\ninstructions. The resulting cDNA was amplified by PCR\nusing the provided Abridged Anchor Primer and a gene\nspecific primer (5’-ATGCTGTGCGCGACGATATCG-\n3’) located upstream of the original cDNA primer.\n\nPreparation of protein extracts, SDS-PAGE and PAGE\nseparation\nWestern immunoblotting were performed from late\nexponential phase wild-type and mutant strains grown\nin 1 liter CDM (with and without the presence of 100\nmg/liter As(III)). The cultures were harvested by centri-\nfugation for 10 min at 9,000 × g. Cell pellets were resus-\npended in distilled water and sonicated at 100 A (15\ntimes 1 min with 1 min interval on ice, 80% duty cycle).\nCell debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min at\n13,000 × g). The supernatant was collected (total\nextract) and stored at -20°C. The protein concentration\nof each sample was measured with a Bio-Rad protein\nassay kit. First, fifty micrograms of each protein extract\nwas loaded onto an 11% polyacrylamide-SDS gel.\nSecond, fifty micrograms of each protein extract were\nloaded onto a polyacrylamide gel (native gel). The assay\nof arsenite oxidase activity followed the transfer of\nreducing equivalents from arsenite to 2,4-dichlorophe-\nnolindophenol (DCIP) as described by Anderson et al.\n[54]. Briefly, the reduction of DCIP (60 μM) was moni-\ntored in the presence of 200 μM sodium arsenite in 50\nμM MES, pH 6.0, at 25°C.\n\nKoechler et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:53\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/53\n\nPage 11 of 13\n\nhttp://www.r-project.org\n\n\nPreparation of antibodies and Western blot analysis\nMonoclonal antibodies raised against an AoxB peptide\nwere obtained from Proteogenix. Briefly, a hexadecapep-\ntide with the SKNRDRVALPPVNAQK sequence was\nsynthesized. This peptide corresponds to the N-terminal\n16 amino acids of the arsenite oxidase large subunit of\nH. arsenicoxydans. The peptide was then coupled to\nkeyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH). Two rabbits were\ninjected at multiple subcutaneaous sites with peptide-\nKLH at 14 days intervals. Animals were prebled at day\n0, bled at day 49 (from an ear vein) and totally bled at\nday 90. Antibodies were partially purified on an affinity\ncolumn substituted with the peptide.\nAfter SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the proteins were\n\nelectrotransfered to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schlei-\ncher and Schuell, BA-85) using a Trans-Blot system\n(Bio-Rad) at 100 V, 4°C for 1 h. The membranes were\nwashed twice in Tris buffered saline (TBS: 10 mM Tris-\nHCl pH7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and blocked in TBS with\n0,3% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The membrane was\nthen washed three times in Tris-buffered saline with\nTritonX100 and Tween 20 (TBS-T: 20 mM TrisHCl\npH7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 0,2% Triton X-100, 0,05%\nTween20), and incubated for 1 h with the AoxB antisera\n(1:800 dilution) in TBS-T with 0,3% BSA. Excess antibo-\ndies were removed by repeated washing with TBS-T.\nAfter 30 min incubation in TBS-T containing the sec-\nondary antibody (1:800 dilution of goat IgG against rab-\nbit IgG, Sigma) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase,\nthe membrane was washed twice with TBS-T and\nrevealed by NBT/BCIP color reagent using standard\nprocedures.\n\nAdditional file 1: Supplemental table S1.
