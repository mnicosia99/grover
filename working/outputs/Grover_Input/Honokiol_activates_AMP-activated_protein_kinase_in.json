ARTICLE Open Access\n\nHonokiol activates AMP-activated protein kinase\nin breast cancer cells via an LKB1-dependent\npathway and inhibits breast carcinogenesis\nArumugam Nagalingam1, Jack L Arbiser2, Michael Y Bonner2, Neeraj K Saxena3 and Dipali Sharma1*\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: Honokiol, a small-molecule polyphenol isolated from magnolia species, is widely known for its\ntherapeutic potential as an antiinflammatory, antithrombosis, and antioxidant agent, and more recently, for its\nprotective function in the pathogenesis of carcinogenesis. In the present study, we sought to examine the\neffectiveness of honokiol in inhibiting migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and to elucidate the underlying\nmolecular mechanisms.\n\nMethods: Clonogenicity and three-dimensional colony-formation assays were used to examine breast cancer cell\ngrowth with honokiol treatment. The effect of honokiol on invasion and migration of breast cancer cells was\nevaluated by using Matrigel invasion, scratch-migration, spheroid-migration, and electric cell-substrate impedance\nsensing (ECIS)-based migration assays. Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis were used to examine\nactivation of the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Isogenic LKB1-knockdown breast\ncancer cell line pairs were developed. Functional importance of AMPK activation and LKB1 overexpression in the\nbiologic effects of honokiol was examined by using AMPK-null and AMPK-wild type (WT) immortalized mouse\nembryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and isogenic LKB1-knockdown cell line pairs. Finally, mouse xenografts,\nimmunohistochemical and Western blot analysis of tumors were used.\n\nResults: Analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms revealed that honokiol treatment increases AMP-\nactivated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and activity, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of the\ndownstream target of AMPK, acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and inhibition of phosphorylation of\np70S6kinase (pS6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1). By using AMPK-null and\nAMPK-WT (MEFs), we found that AMPK is required for honokiol-mediated modulation of pACC-pS6K. Intriguingly,\nwe discovered that honokiol treatment increased the expression and cytoplasmic translocation of tumor-suppressor\nLKB1 in breast cancer cells. LKB1 knockdown inhibited honokiol-mediated activation of AMPK and, more important,\ninhibition of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of\nbreast tumorigenesis in vivo. Analysis of tumors showed significant increases in the levels of cytoplasmic LKB1 and\nphospho-AMPK in honokiol-treated tumors.\n\nConclusions: Taken together, these data provide the first in vitro and in vivo evidence of the integral role of the\nLKB1-AMPK axis in honokiol-mediated inhibition of the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. In conclusion,\nhonokiol treatment could potentially be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma.\n\n* Correspondence: dsharma7@jhmi.edu\n1Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and\nthe Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins,\nBaltimore MD 21231\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nNagalingam et al.

About 226,870 new cases of invasive breast cancer\nand about 63,300 new cases of carcinoma in situ will be\ndiagnosed in 2012, according to the latest estimates for\nbreast cancer in the United States by American Cancer\nSociety. Despite major advances in screening programs\nand development of various targeted therapeutic\napproaches, mortality related to breast cancer still remains\nat a staggering high level, with approximately 1 in 35\nwomen dying of breast cancer. Available therapies, includ-\ning radiation, endocrine, and conventional chemotherapy,\nare often limited by high toxicity, lower efficacy, therapeu-\ntic resistance, and therapy-related morbidity. Therefore,\nmore-effective therapeutic strategies are clearly needed to\ncombat breast cancer and to reduce morbidity and\nmortality.\nThe importance of active constitutive agents in natural\n\nproducts has become increasingly apparent, owing to their\npotential cancer preventive as well as therapeutic proper-\nties [1,2]. In traditional Asian medicine, root and stem\nbark of Magnolia species have been used for centuries to\ntreat anxiety, nervous disorders, fever, gastrointestinal\nsymptoms, and stroke [3]. Therapeutic benefits of Magno-\nlia species have been attributed to honokiol, a natural phe-\nnolic compound isolated from an extract of seed cones\nfrom Magnolia grandiflora [3,4]. Honokiol has shown\nantithrombocytic, antibacterial, antiinflammatory, antioxi-\ndant, and anxiolytic effects, and it may prove beneficial\nagainst hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, thrombosis, and\nangiopathy [3]. Two pioneering studies showing the\nremarkable inhibitory effects of honokiol on mouse skin-\ntumor promotion and demonstrating efficacy of honokiol\nagainst established tumors in mice [5,6] ascertained the\nanticancer potential of honokiol. Subsequent studies\nshowed the anticancer activities of honokiol in many can-\ncer cell lines and tumor models [7-11].\nHonokiol has been found to alter many cellular pro-\n\ncesses and to modulate molecular targets that are known\nto affect apoptosis, growth, and survival of tumor cells. A\nreview of previous studies suggests that the mechanism\nby which honokiol causes growth arrest and cell death\nmay be cell-line/tumor-type specific and involve many\nsignaling pathways. For instance, Bax upregulation has\nbeen observed in some but not in other cellular systems\n[7,12]. Honokiol decreases phosphorylation of ERK, Akt,\nand c-Src to induce apoptosis effectively in SVR angiosar-\ncoma cells [3], inhibits the ERK signaling pathway to\nexert antiangiogenesis activity [13], but activates ERK in\ncortical neurons to induce neurite outgrowth [14,15]. In\nchronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), honokiol causes\napoptosis through activation of caspase 8, followed by\n\ncaspase 9 and 3 activation [7]. Honokiol-mediated\nincreased cleavage of Mcl-1 and downregulation of XIAP\nas well as BAD upregulation is observed in multiple mye-\nloma, whereas Bid, p-Bad, Bak, Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL\nremain unchanged [12]. Honokiol also inhibits the NF-\n�B signaling pathway, thus affecting expression of many\ndownstream genes in endothelial cells, human mono-\ncytes, lymphoma, embryonic kidney cells, promyelocytic\nleukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer, cervical can-\ncer, and head and neck cancer [16-19]. Thus, honokiol\nelicits several cellular responses and modulates multiple\nfacets of signal transduction.\nIn the present study, we specifically investigated the\n\neffect of honokiol on the malignant properties of breast\ncancer cells, including migration and invasion, and also\nexamined the underlying molecular mechanisms. Intri-\nguingly, we discovered that honokiol increases the\nexpression of tumor-suppressor LKB1 to modulate the\nsignaling pathway involving the AMPK-pS6K axis. We\ndirectly tested the requirement of AMPK and LKB1 in\nhonokiol-mediated inhibition of malignant properties of\nbreast cancer cells. Our results showed that LKB1 and\nAMPK are integral molecules required for honokiol-\nmediated modulation of 4EBP1-pS6K and inhibition of\nmigration and invasion of breast cancer cells.\n\nMaterials and methods\nCell culture and reagents\nThe human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-\nMB-231, were obtained from the American Type Culture\nCollection and maintained in DMEM supplemented with\n10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bioproducts,\nWoodland, CA, USA) and 2 μM L-glutamine (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA, USA). Cell-line authentication was done\nby analysis of known genetic markers or response (for\nexample, expression of estrogen receptor and p53 and\nestrogen responsiveness) [20]. AMPK-null and AMPK-\nWT immortalized MEFs were kindly provided by Dr.\nKeith R. Laderoute (SRI International, Menlo Park, CA,\nUSA) [21]. Honokiol is a natural product extracted from\nseed cone of Magnolia grandiflora, as previously\ndescribed [6]. Antibodies for p-AMPK (phospho-AMPK),\nAMPK, ACC, p-ACC (phospho-ACC), pS6K, p-pS6K\n(phospho-S6K), 4EBP1, p-4EBP1 (phospho-4EBP1),\np-Akt (phospho-Akt), Akt, and LKB1 (3047) were pur-\nchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA,\nUSA).\n\nLKB1 stable knockdown using lentiviral short-hairpin RNA\nFive pre-made lentiviral LKB1 short-hairpin RNA\n(shRNA) constructs and a negative control construct\ncreated in the same vector system (pLKO.1) were pur-\nchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL, USA).\n\nNagalingam et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R35\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/1/R35\n\nPage 2 of 16\n\n\n\nPaired LKB1 stable knockdown cells (MCF7 and MDA-\nMB-231) were generated by following our previously\npublished protocol [22].\n\nCell-viability assay\nCell-viability assay was performed by estimating the\nreduction of XTT (2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-\nphenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide), by using a\ncommercially available kit (Roche) [23]. Breast cancer\ncells were treated with honokiol as indicated.\n\nClonogenicity assay\nFor colony-formation assay [24], MCF7 and MDA-MB-\n231 cells were treated with honokiol as indicated for\n10 days; colonies containing > 50 normal-appearing cells\nwere counted.\n\nAnchorage-independent soft-agar growth assay\nAnchorage-independent growth of MCF7 and MDA-\nMB-231 cells in the presence of honokiol treatment was\ndetermined by colony formation on soft agar [25]. Colo-\nnies were counted in five randomly selected fields at\n×10 magnification by using Olympus IX50 inverted\nmicroscope.\n\nScratch-migration assay\nMigration assay was performed according to our pub-\nlished protocol [26]. Cells were treated with honokiol as\nindicated. Plates were photographed after 24 and\n48 hours at the identical location of the initial image.\n\nElectric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) wound-\nhealing assay\nWound-healing assay was performed by using the ECIS\n(Applied BioPhysics, Troy, NY, USA) technology and\nfollowing our previously established protocol [27].\n\nSpheroid migration assay\nMDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells (1.5 × 104) were seeded in\n0.5% agar-coated plates and cultured on an orbital shaker\n(100 rpm) for 48 hours in a humidified atmosphere con-\ntaining 5% CO2 at 37°C. Intact tumor spheroids were\nselected and transferred to six-well plates. The spheroids\nwere treated with honokiol, as indicated. After 48 hours\nof incubation, spheroids were fixed with 10% buffered\nformalin in PBS and stained with crystal violet. The\nmigration of cells from spheroids was observed under a\nlight microscope.\n\nInvasion assay\nFor an in vitro model system of metastasis, Matrigel inva-\nsion assay [28] was performed by using a Matrigel invasion\nchamber from BD Biocoat Cellware (San Jose, CA, USA).\n\nThe slides were coded to prevent counting bias, and the\nnumber of invaded cells on representative sections of each\nmembrane were counted under light microscope. The\nnumber of invaded cells for each experimental sample\nrepresents the average of triplicate wells.\n\nWestern blotting\nWhole cell lysate [23] was prepared by scraping MCF7\nand MDA-MB-231 cells in 250 μl of ice-cold modified\nRIPA buffer. An equal amount of protein was resolved\non sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel, transferred\nto nitrocellulose membrane, and Western blot analysis\nwas performed. Immunodetection was performed by\nusing enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL system; Amer-\nsham Pharmacia Biotech, Arlington Heights, IL, USA)\naccording to manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nImmunoprecipitation assay\nImmunoprecipitation of LKB1 was performed by follow-\ning the previously published protocol [23] by using anti-\nLKB1 antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-\nSTRAD antibody.\n\nImmunofluorescence and confocal imaging\nBreast cancer cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in\nfour-well chamber slides (Nunc, Rochester, NY, USA)\nfollowed by treatment with honokiol and subjected to\nimmunofluorescence analysis as described [22]. Fixed\nand immunofluorescently stained cells were imaged by\nusing a Zeiss LSM510 Meta (Zeiss) laser scanning con-\nfocal system configured to a Zeiss Axioplan 2 upright\nmicroscope with a 63XO (NA 1.4) plan-apochromat\nobjective. All experiments were performed multiple\ntimes by using independent biologic replicates.\n\nBreast tumorigenesis assay\nMDA-MB-231 (5 × 106) cells in 0.1 ml of HBSS were\ninjected subcutaneously into the right gluteal region of\n4- to 6-week-old female athymic nude mice. Two weeks\nafter initial implantation, the animals were placed into\ntwo experimental groups. Mice were treated with intra-\nperitoneal injections of (a) control (saline and Intralipi-\ndor (b) honokiol, at 3 mg/mouse/day in 20% Intralipid\n(Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA), 3 times per\nweek for the duration of the experiment. Tumors were\nmeasured by using vernier calipers, with tumor volume\ncalculated by using the formula (V = a/2 × b2), where V\nis the tumor volume in cubic millimeters, and a and b\nare the largest and smallest diameters in millimeters,\nrespectively. All animals were killed after 4 weeks of\ntreatment. Tumors were collected; weighed, fixed in\n10% neutral-buffered formalin; and subjected to further\nanalysis with immunohistochemistry.\n\nNagalingam et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R35\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/1/R35\n\nPage 3 of 16\n\n\n\nImmunohistochemical analysis\nWe used tumor sections to determine the effect of hono-\nkiol on expression of p-AMPK, LKB1, and Ki-67 by immu-\nnohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed\nessentially as described by us previously for other proteins\n[25,26]. At least four nonoverlapping representative\nimages from each tumor section from five mice of each\ngroup were captured by using ImagePro software for\nquantitation of p-AMPK, LKB1, and Ki-67 expression.\nTotal cell lysates were prepared from tumor samples and\nsubjected to immunoblot analysis. All animal studies were\nconducted in accordance with the guidelines of University\nACUC.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll experiments were performed thrice in triplicates. Sta-\ntistical analysis was performed by using Microsoft Excel\nsoftware. Significant differences were analyzed by using\nthe Student t test and two-tailed distribution. Data were\nconsidered to be statistically significant if P < 0.05. Data\nwere expressed as mean ± SEM between triplicate experi-\nments performed thrice.\n\nResults\nHonokiol treatment inhibits clonogenicity, migration, and\ninvasion of breast cancer cells\nGrowth-inhibition and apoptosis-induction properties of\nhonokiol have been reported in several cancer cell lines\n[3,9-12,18]. In the current study, two breast cancer cell\nlines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, were treated with various\nconcentrations ranging from 1 μM to 25 μM honokiol and\nsubjected to clonogenicity (Figure 1a) and anchorage-inde-\npendent growth assay (Figure 1b). Dose-dependent and\nstatistically significant inhibition of clonogenicity and soft-\nagar colony formation was observed in the presence of\nhonokiol. Treatment with 5 μM honokiol resulted in\n~50% to 60% inhibition in clonogenicity and soft-agar col-\nony formation, whereas higher concentrations (10 and 25\nμM) were more inhibitory (Figure 1a, b). We further\nexamined the effect of honokiol on the growth of\nHCC1806 breast cancer cells, which harbor an LKB1\nhomozygous mutation, by using clonogenicity and soft-\nagar colony formation assay. Our studies show that hono-\nkiol does not inhibit the growth of HCC-1806 cells (Addi-\ntional file 1). These results indicate that LKB1 might be an\nintegral molecule for honokiol-mediated growth\ninhibition.\nCancer progression is a multistep process that involves\n\ninvasion of basement membrane by tumor cells and\nmigration to points far from a given primary tumor mass,\nleading to metastasis [29]. We examined the effect of\nhonokiol on breast cancer cell migration and invasion by\nusing scratch migration, electric-cell-substrate impedance\nsensing (ECIS)-based migration, spheroid migration, and\n\nMatrigel invasion assays. Honokiol treatment resulted in\ninhibition of migration of breast cancer cells (Figure 2a)\nin comparison with untreated cells. For quantitative\ndetermination of alteration in the migration potential of\nbreast cancer cells on treatment with honokiol, we per-\nformed a quantitative real-time impedance assay by using\nan ECIS-based technique. As expected, confluent cells\nshowed high resistance values. Confluent cells were sub-\njected to a high-voltage pulse that resulted in decrease in\nresistance, indicating death and detachment of cells pre-\nsent on the small active electrode. Cells were left\nuntreated or treated with honokiol, and changes in resis-\ntance were recorded for 24 hours. Control untreated cells\nshowed an increase in resistance, showing increased\nmigration of cells surrounding the small active electrode\nthat were not submitted to the elevated voltage pulse to\nreach the resistance values of the nonwounded cells at\nthe start of the experiment. Honokiol-treated cells\nshowed a decrease in resistance, indicating decreased\nmigration. Notably, honokiol-treated cells never reached\nthe values of nonwounded cells, showing significant inhi-\nbition of migration potential (Additional file 2). We\nexamined the effect of honokiol treatment on the migra-\ntory capacity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells spher-\noids. Significant migration of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231\ncells from the spheroids was seen under untreated condi-\ntions. Honokiol treatment resulted in inhibition of migra-\ntion of cells from spheroids (Figure 2b). Next, we\nperformed Matrigel invasion assay to examine the effect\nof honokiol on the invasion potential of breast carcinoma\ncells. As evident from Figure 2c, honokiol treatment\ndecreased invasion of breast cancer cells through Matri-\ngel in comparison with untreated cells. Activation of\nFAK has been shown to regulate cancer cell migration\nand invasion through distinct pathways by promoting the\ndynamic regulation of focal adhesion and peripheral actin\nstructures [30-32] and matrix metalloproteinases\n(MMPs)-mediated matrix degradation [33]. We exam-\nined whether honokiol treatment affects FAK activation\nto inhibit migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.\nHonokiol treatment inhibited FAK phosphorylation in\nbreast cancer cells, indicating the involvement of FAK\nactivation in honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration\nand invasion potential of breast cancer cells (Figure 2d).\nCollectively, these results show that honokiol treatment\ncan effectively inhibit clonogenicity, anchorage-indepen-\ndent colony formation, migration, and invasion of breast\ncarcinoma cells.\n\nHonokiol-induced AMPK activation plays an integral role\nin honokiol-mediated inhibition of mTOR activity and\nmigration potential of cells\nHonokiol modulates multiple pathways (nuclear factor\n(NF)-�B, ERK, Akt, and JNK) in a cellular process and\n\nNagalingam et al.

AMP-acti-\nvated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine pro-\ntein kinase that acts as a master sensor of cellular energy\nbalance in mammalian cells by regulating glucose and\nlipid metabolism [34]. Recent studies have implicated\nAMPK as an important factor in cancer cell growth and\n\nmigration [35,36]. Thus, we sought to determine the\neffect of honokiol on AMPK phosphorylation and activa-\ntion. Honokiol treatment stimulated phosphorylation of\nAMPK at Thr-172 in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells.\nHonokiol had no effect on total AMPK protein expres-\nsion levels (Figure 3a).

Once activated, AMPK directly phosphorylates and\ninactivates a number of ATP-consuming metabolic\nenzymes including acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC)\n[38]. We examined the phosphorylation of ACC to evalu-\nate AMPK activity with honokiol treatment. Increased\nphosphorylation of ACC in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231\ncells was observed in response to honokiol treatment as\ncompared with untreated cells, whereas total ACC pro-\ntein levels remain unchanged (Figure 3a). Activation of\nAMPK leads to suppression of mammalian target of\nrapamycin (mTOR) signaling, and the molecular\nmechanisms involve phosphorylation of tuberous sclero-\nsis complex protein TSC2 at Thr-1227 and Ser-1345 that\nincreases the activity of the TSC1-TSC2 complex to inhi-\nbit mTOR [37,39]. Two very well characterized and\nwidely studied downstream effectors of mTOR are the\np70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1 or\npS6K) and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E\n(elF4E)-binding protein (4EBP1) [40]. Phosphorylation of\npS6K and 4EBP1 has been widely used to assess changes\nin mTOR activity in response to various growth-factor\npathways. We next examined the effect of honokiol on\nmTOR activity in breast cancer cells. Honokiol decreased\nphosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1 in both MCF7 and\nMDA-MB-231 cells while not affecting the total protein\nlevels of pS6K and 4EBP1 (Figure 3b). Recent studies\nhave shown that pS6K regulates the actin cytoskeleton by\nacting as an actin filament cross-linking protein and as a\nRho family GTPase-activating protein [41]. It has been\nshown that reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is cri-\ntical for cell migration, as motile cancer cells must\nassemble and disassemble the actin filaments at their\nleading edges [42]. Depletion or inhibition of the activity\nof pS6K results in inhibition of actin cytoskeleton reorga-\nnization and inhibition of migration [41]. Owing to the\nintegral role of pS6K in cancer cell migration, it is possi-\nble that honokiol-mediated inhibition of migration is\nmediated through pS6K inhibition.\nmTOR, a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation,\n\nexists in two structurally and functionally distinct multi-\nprotein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is\nknown to activate protein synthesis and cell growth\nthrough regulating pS6K and 4E-BP1 activity, whereas\nmTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on Ser-473, activating cell\ngrowth, proliferation, and survival [43,44]. We found that\nhonokiol increases AMPK activation and inhibits\nmTORC1 function, as evidenced by inhibition of pS6K\nand 4E-BP1 phosphorylation.\nWe next determined whether honokiol treatment mod-\n\nulates mTORC2 function. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt\non Ser-473. Therefore, to determine whether mTORC2 is\nalso inhibited by honokiol under similar conditions,\nbreast cancer cells were treated with honokiol, and the\n\nphosphorylation of Akt was determined. Honokiol did\nnot alter Akt phosphorylation on Ser-473 in breast can-\ncer cells (Additional file 3). These results provide evi-\ndence that honokiol only inhibits mTORC1 in breast\ncancer cells. Contrasting findings have been reported\npreviously, showing reduction in Akt phosphorylation in\nresponse to honokiol treatment. Of note, MDA-MB-231\ncells were treated with much higher concentrations of\nhonokiol (60, 80, and 100 μM) in this study [45]. Hence,\nthe observed decrease in Akt phosphorylation may\nbe due to the treatment with higher concentrations of\nhonokiol. Honokiol inhibits breast cancer growth in a\nconcentration-dependent manner, with higher concentra-\ntions much more inhibitory than lower concentrations\n(Figure 1).\nAlthough our findings clearly showed the involvement\n\nof AMPK activation in the honokiol signaling network,\nwe raised the question whether honokiol-induced inhibi-\ntion of mTOR and cell migration requires AMPK pro-\ntein. We used MEFs derived from AMPK-WT (WT)\nand AMPK knockout (AMPK-null) mice to test the\npotential requirement of this protein in honokiol-\nmediated inhibition of migration. Immunoblotting con-\nfirmed the absence of the AMPK protein in AMPK-null\nMEFs (Figure 4a). In agreement with the absence of\nAMPK protein, the AMPK-null MEFs did not show any\nphosphorylation of ACC, even in the presence of hono-\nkiol. AMPK-WT MEFs, conversely, exhibited honokiol-\nstimulated phosphorylation of ACC, indicating activa-\ntion of AMPK (Figure 4b). Exposure of MEFs derived\nfrom AMPK-WT mice to honokiol resulted in inhibition\nof phosphorylation of pS6K, whereas the MEFs derived\nfrom the AMPK-null mice were significantly resistant to\nthe honokiol-mediated inhibition of pS6K phosphoryla-\ntion (Figure 4d).\nWe next asked whether AMPK is directly involved in\n\nhonokiol-mediated inhibition of migration. AMPK-WT\nMEFs exhibited inhibition of migration in response to\nhonokiol treatment in scratch migration as well as\nECIS-based migration assay. Interestingly, honokiol\ntreatment could not inhibit migration of AMPK-null\nMEFs (Figure 4c; Additional file 4). AMPK knockdown\nalso inhibited the antiproliferative effect of honokiol\n(Figure 4e). These results showed that AMPK is an inte-\ngral molecule in mediating the negative effects of hono-\nkiol on the mTOR axis and migration potential of cells.\n\nInhibition of LKB1 abrogates honokiol-mediated\nmodulation of AMPK and inhibition of migration and\ninvasion of breast cancer cells\nThe tumor suppressor LKB1 (also known as Stk11) is an\nevolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase\nthat has a broad range of cellular functions, including\ntumor suppression, cell polarity, cell-cycle regulation,\n\nNagalingam et al.

LKB1 has recently\nbeen identified as a critical upstream kinase for AMPK,\nregulating its activity. Intriguingly, we found that hono-\nkiol increases expression of tumor suppressor LKB1 in\nMCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, with a significant\nincrease at 1 hour of treatment with maximal expression\nat 24 hours in MCF7 cells and at 4 hours in MDA-MB-\n231 cells (Figure 5a). Variable expression of LKB1 in\nMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells has been reported\n[48,49]. We recently procured MDA-MB-231 cells from\nvarious established breast cancer research laboratories\nand analyzed the expression and functional status of\nLKB1. Our data unequivocally showed the presence of\nfunctional LKB1 in MDA-MB-231 cells [22]. Human\nLKB1 is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, but a mutant of\nLKB1 lacking the nuclear localization signal still retains\nthe ability to suppress cell growth, suggesting that the\ncytosolic pool of LKB1 plays an important role in med-\niating its tumor-suppressor properties [50,51]. STRAD\n(Ste20-related adaptor) protein has been shown to form\na complex in which STRAD activates LKB1, resulting in\ncytoplasmic translocation of LKB1 [47]. We investigated\nthe effect of honokiol on the formation of the LKB1-\nSTRAD complex in breast cancer cells. To address this\nquestion, breast cancer cells were treated with honokiol\nfollowed by immunoprecipitation with LKB1 antibodies.\nImmunoprecipitated protein complexes were analyzed\nfor the presence of STRAD by using Western blot ana-\nlysis. Higher levels of STRAD immunoprecipitated with\nLKB1 in the presence of honokiol indicated increased\nformation of the LKB1-STRAD complex (Figure 5b).\nImmunostaining of honokiol-treated MCF7 and MDA-\nMB-231 cells revealed that honokiol treatment increases\ncytoplasmic accumulation of LKB1. LKB1 was localized\npredominantly in the nucleus in untreated breast cancer\ncells, although cytoplasmic LKB1 expression was also\ndetected (Figure 5c). Control experiments with second-\nary antibody (results not shown) gave an extremely faint\nbackground staining that was distributed uniformly\nthroughout the cells, irrespective of the treatment. Stu-\ndies on the subcellular localization of LKB1 have indi-\ncated a wide variety of localization patterns. Mouse\nLKB1 was found to be predominantly nuclear, whereas\nCaenorhabditis elegans PAR-4 and Xenopus XEEK1\nwere detected exclusively in the cytoplasm [52-54].\nHuman LKB1 has been detected to be both nuclear and\ncytoplasmic in several cell types [55,56]. Although LKB1\nexpression is exclusively cytoplasmic in lung and pan-\ncreatic cancer [57,58], gastrointestinal hamartomatous\npolyps from Peutz-Jeghers syndrome patients, head and\nneck squamous cell carcinoma, invasive lobular breast\ncarcinoma, and solid papillary ductal carcinoma in situ\nbreast cancer show both cytoplasmic and nuclear LKB1\nexpression [59-61]. Studies in adult rat primary\n\ncardiomyocytes and C2C12 myoblasts showed that\nLKB1 was located predominantly in nucleus and under-\ngoes cytoplasmic localization in various stimulations\n[62-64]. In vitro studies suggest that nuclear LKB1 regu-\nlates cell-cycle progression and acts as a transcription\nfactor [65,66], whereas cytoplasmic LKB1 participates in\ncontrolling energy metabolism and cell polarity [67]. It\nis not completely understood how subcellular localiza-\ntion of LKB1 affects its tumor-suppressor function and\nactivation of other signaling pathways in vivo.\nWe raised the question whether LKB1 plays an impor-\n\ntant regulatory role in honokiol- mediated modulation of\nAMPK and inhibition of migration and invasion of breast\ncancer cells. To address these questions, we used\nLKB1shRNA lentivirus and puromycin to select for stable\npools of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with LKB1 deple-\ntion. We analyzed pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA stable MCF7\nand MDA-MB-231 cell pools for LKB1 protein expression\nwith immunoblot analysis and found that LKB1 protein\nexpression was significantly reduced in LKB1shRNA cells\n(shRNA1 and shRNA2) as compared with pLKO.1 control\ncells (Figure 5d). pLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA cells were trea-\nted with honokiol, and phosphorylation of AMPK was\ndetermined by using Western blot analysis. We found that\nhonokiol increased phosphorylation of AMPK in pLKO.1\ncells. Intriguingly, displaying a crucial role of LKB1, hono-\nkiol treatment did not change the phosphorylation levels\nof AMPK in LKB1shRNA cells (Figure 5e). Invasion and\nmigration are the key biologic features of malignant beha-\nvior of carcinoma cells [29]. In addition to examining the\neffect of LKB1 depletion on honokiol-induced modulation\nof AMPK, we also examined the requirement of LKB1 in\nhonokiol-mediated inhibition of metastatic properties of\nbreast cancer cells. As evident from Figure 5f, honokiol\ntreatment efficiently inhibited migration of pLKO.1 cells,\nwhereas untreated pLKO.1 cells showed increased migra-\ntion. Our results showed that LKB1shRNA cells exhibited\nincreased migration in the absence of honokiol treatment.\nInterestingly, honokiol treatment did not inhibit the\nmigration of LKB1shRNA cells (Figure 5f). We next exam-\nined the effect of honokiol on invasion potential of\npLKO.1 and LKB1shRNA cells and found that honokiol\ninhibited invasion of pLKO.1 cells, whereas LKB1shRNA\n\ncells were not affected by honokiol treatment (Figure 5g).\nThese results collectively show that honokiol-induced\nLKB1 overexpression is indeed a crucial component of the\nsignaling machinery used by honokiol in modulating the\nAMPK-S6K axis and inhibiting the metastatic properties\nof breast cancer cells.\n\nHonokiol treatment inhibits breast-tumor progression in\nathymic nude mice\nWe investigated the physiological relevance of our in\nvitro findings by evaluating whether honokiol has any\n\nNagalingam et al.

In the experimental group treated\nwith honokiol, the rate of tumor growth was signifi-\ncantly inhibited, and the tumor size and weight were\nsignificantly reduced compared with control group\n(Figure 6a, b). The immunohistochemical assessment of\ntumor proliferation showed higher Ki-67 in the control\ngroup as compared with the honokiol-treated group\n(Figure 6c). In our in vitro analyses, we discovered the\ninvolvement and requirement of the LKB1-AMPK axis\nin biologic functions of honokiol. We examined the\nexpression of LKB1 and p-AMPK in tumors treated\nwith honokiol. Tumors treated with honokiol displayed\nhigher levels of phosphorylated AMPK and LKB1 (Fig-\nure 6c). In addition, we examined the expression levels\nof phosphorylated and unphosphorylated AMPK, ACC\nas well as S6K, in honokiol-treated and vehicle-treated\nmice. We found higher levels of phosphorylated AMPK\nand ACC in honokiol-treated tumors as compared with\nvehicle-treated controls. Honokiol-treated tumors\nshowed lower levels of phosphorylated S6K, whereas\nvehicle-treated controls exhibited high levels of phos-\nphorylated S6K (Figure 6d). These data presented direct\nin vivo evidence of the involvement of LKB1-AMPK\nactivation and the subsequent inhibition of pS6K in\nhonokiol function (Figure 6e).\n\nDiscussion\nThe antitumor activity of honokiol, a natural product\nderived from magnolia plant and used in traditional\nAsian medicine, has been reported in various preclinical\nmodels [3]. In the current study, we investigated the\npotential of honokiol in the inhibition of migration and\ninvasion of breast cancer cells and the underlying mole-\ncular mechanisms. The following novel findings are\nreported in this study: (i) honokiol treatment inhibits\nmalignant properties such as invasion and migration of\nbreast cancer cells; (ii) honokiol stimulates AMPK phos-\nphorylation and activity while reducing mTOR activity,\nas evidenced by reduced phosphorylation of pS6K and\n4EBP1; (iii) AMPK protein is required for honokiol-\nmediated inhibition of pS6K and 4EBP1; (iv) honokiol\nincreases the expression and cytosolic localization of\ntumor suppressor LKB1, which is an essential effector\nmolecule to mediate the honokiol effect on the AMPK-\npS6K axis and inhibition of invasion and migration of\nbreast cancer cells; and (v) honokiol inhibits breast\ntumor growth and modulates the LKB1-AMPK-pS6K\naxis in vivo. Our results show that honokiol treatment\nsignificantly inhibits malignant properties of breast can-\ncer cells through modulation of the LKB1-AMPK-pS6K\naxis; thus using honokiol may be a suitable therapeutic\nstrategy for metastatic breast cancer.\n\nMany bioactive molecules and their synthetic analo-\ngues have been reported to demonstrate activity against\nbreast cancer [68-71]. Although the lower toxicity asso-\nciated with bioactive molecules is a much desired qual-\nity, their limited bioavailability hinders further\ndevelopment. Honokiol exhibits a desirable spectrum of\nbioavailability, in contrast with many other natural pro-\nducts [3]. The development of other polyphenolic agents\nhas been obstructed by poor absorption and rapid excre-\ntion [72]. Honokiol does not have this disability, as sig-\nnificant systemic levels of honokiol can be obtained in\npreclinical models, and it can cross the blood-brain bar-\nrier [73]. These qualities of honokiol make it a promis-\ning small-molecular-weight natural anticancer agent.\nIndeed, honokiol has been found to alter many molecu-\nlar targets in various cancer models to inhibit tumor cell\ngrowth and survival [3,6,9,10,12,19]. One of the major\nfindings of this study is that the LKB1-AMPK pathway\nplays a major role in mediating the effect of honokiol\neffect on migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.\nAMPK, a master sensor of cellular energy balance in\n\nmammalian cells, regulates glucose and lipid metabolism\n[34]. Biochemical regulation of serine/threonine protein\nkinase AMPK activation occurs through multiple mechan-\nisms [37]. AMPK undergoes a conformational change in\nresponse to direct binding of AMP to its nucleotide-bind-\ning domain, exposing the activation loop of the catalytic\nkinase subunit. LKB1 phosphorylates a critical threonine\nin this activation loop to activate AMPK. Dephosphoryla-\ntion by protein phosphatases also plays an important role\nin regulating AMPK activity [47]. Genetic depletion of\nLKB1 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) results in a\nloss of AMPK activation after energy stresses that increase\nAMP [37], showing the requirement of LKB1 in AMPK\nactivation. We found that honokiol increases AMPK acti-\nvation, which can be efficiently inhibited by the silencing\nof LKB1. AMPK represents a pivotal point in the mTOR\npathway regulating a vast range of cellular activities,\nincluding transcription, translation, cell size, mRNA turn-\nover, protein stability, ribosomal biogenesis, and cytoskele-\ntal organization [37]. Besides being directly activated by\ntumor-suppressor LKB1, AMPK itself regulates the activa-\ntion of two other tumor suppressors, TSC1 and TSC2,\nwhich are critical regulators of Rheb and mTOR [37]. We\nfound that AMPK knockdown inhibits honokiol-mediated\nmTOR inhibition. Honokiol-mediated inhibition of mTOR\nalso suggests that honokiol and its derivatives may prove\nexcellent candidates as targeted therapies for carcinomas\ncharacterized by hyperactive mTOR signaling.\nLKB1 kinase is a tumor suppressor and a key determi-\n\nnant in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an inherited sus-\nceptibility to gastrointestinal, lung, pancreatic, and\nbreast cancer [47,74]. Inactivation of the LKB1 gene has\nbeen shown in a subset of sporadic lung and pancreatic\n\nNagalingam et al.

MDA-MB-231 cells-derived tumors were developed in nude\nmice and treated with vehicle or honokiol (HNK). (a) Tumor growth was monitored by measuring the tumor volume for 4 weeks (eight mice\nper group). (b) At the end of 6 weeks, tumors were collected, measured, weighed, and photographed. Honokiol treatment inhibited tumor size\nas compare with vehicle treatment. Average tumor weight and representative tumor images are shown here. (c) Tumor samples were subjected\nto immunohistochemical analysis by using LKB1, p-AMPK, and Ki67 antibodies. Honokiol (HNK) treatment decreased the expression of Ki-67,\nincreased expression of LKB1 and pAMPK, as compared with vehicle treatment. Bar diagrams show quantitation of protein expression in tumors\nfrom vehicle- and honokiol-treated mice. Columns, mean (n = 8); bar, SD. *Significantly different (P < 0.005) compared with control. (d) Tumor\nlysates (from two different tumors from each set) were subjected to immunoblot analysis by using phospho-AMPK (p-AMPK), AMPK, phospho-\nACC (p-ACC), ACC, phospho-pS6K, pS6K antibodies. Actin antibody was used as control. (e) A model of honokiol (HNK)-stimulated AMPK\nactivation in breast cancer cells. Honokiol stimulation induces LKB1 translocation from the nucleus into cytosol and phosphorylates AMPK,\nleading to increased phosphorylation of ACC and decreased phosphorylation of pS6K and 4EBP1.\n\nNagalingam et al.

Although the loss of LKB1 expression is not\ncommonly observed in human breast carcinoma, it cer-\ntainly correlates with high-grade DCIS and high-grade\ninvasive ductal carcinoma [61]. It is important to note\nthat LKB1 expression was not abrogated in pure DCIS\ncases but only in the DCIS associated with invasion,\nindicating that loss of LKB1 could potentially promote\ninvasion. Supporting this notion, low LKB1 protein\nlevels have been reported to correlate with poor prog-\nnosis in breast carcinoma [48]. Our studies show that\nhonokiol treatment increases the expression and cytoso-\nlic localization of LKB1 in breast xenograft tumors and\ninhibits tumor growth. LKB1 is localized predominantly\nin the nucleus, translocating to the cytosol, either by\nforming a heterotrimeric complex with STRAD (ste20-\nrelated adaptor protein) and MO25 (mouse protein 25)\nor by associating with LIP1 (LKB1-interacting protein),\nto exert its biologic functions [50,52,55,75,76]. The cyto-\nplasmic pool of LKB1 plays an important role in mediat-\ning its tumor-suppressor properties. Wild-type LKB1,\nwhen co-expressed with STRAD and MO25, exhibits\nincreased cytoplasmic localization, whereas mutant\nLKB1, unable to interact with STRAD and MO25,\nremains in the nucleus [75,77]. Promotion of cytosolic\ntranslocation of LKB1 is a common mechanism to acti-\nvate downstream LKB1 functions, as AMPK activation\nby metformin, peroxynitrile, or adiponectin also involves\nLKB1 cytosolic translocation [22,64,78-80]. Honokiol\ntreatment increases LKB1-STRAD complex formation in\naddition to overexpression of LKB1, thus increasing the\nfunctional pool of LKB1. Our study shows for the first\ntime that honokiol stimulates the cytosolic translocation\nof LKB1 in breast cancer cells.\n\nConclusions\nWe uncovered a novel mechanism by which honokiol\ninhibits invasion and migration of breast cancer cells,\nwhich involves enhanced expression and cytosolic locali-\nzation of LKB1 and AMPK activation. We also demon-\nstrated the requirement of LKB1 and AMPK in\nhonokiol-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion\nof breast cancer cells. Our results thus provide new\ninsight into the mechanisms by which honokiol, a pro-\nmising anticancer agent, inhibits breast carcinogenesis.\n\nConflicting interests\nAN, MYB, NKS, and DS declare no conflict of interest.\nJLA is listed as an inventor on patents filed by Emory\nUniversity.
