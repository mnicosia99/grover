extensively, little\nis known about direct pathogenic effects of HBV surface proteins. Here, we have investigated pathological cellular effects of\nHBV surface protein expression in the liver of transgenic mice with different genetic background.\n\nMethods: The impact of HBV surface protein expression on the liver was studied in two mouse strains, BALB/c and C57BL/6.\nHistology and hydroxyproline assays were performed to investigate liver morphology and fibrosis. Gene expression and\nsignaling were analyzed by microarray, qPCR and Western blotting.\n\nResults: Expression of HBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice induced activation of protein kinase-like\nendoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of eIF2a\nresulted in activation of the ER stress markers glucose regulated protein (GRP) 78 and pro-apoptotic C/EBP homologous\nprotein (CHOP) in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic background leading to stronger liver injury and fibrosis in comparison\nwith transgenic mice on C57BL/6 background. Hepatic stellate cells represented the main collagen-producing liver cells in\nHBV transgenic mice. The key regulators of hepatocyte proliferation, transcription factors c-Jun and STAT3 were activated in\nHBV transgenic mice. Tumour incidence in transgenic mice was strain- and sex-dependent.\n\nConclusions: Extent of liver injury, fibrosis, and tumour development induced by hepatic HBV surface protein expression\nconsiderably depends on host genetic background.\n\nCitation: Churin Y, Roderfeld M, Stiefel J, Würger T, Schröder D, et al.

Although\n\nmuch is known about HBV structure and replicative cycle [2] the\n\npathogenic mechanisms responsible for liver injury, cirrhosis\n\ndevelopment and malignant transformation during chronic HBV\n\ninfection are not well understood. It is believed that these events\n\noriginate from persistent immune pathogenesis [3], but observa-\n\ntions in transgenic mouse models of HBV infection suggest that in\n\nabsence of an adaptive immune responses cellular mechanisms\n\ninduced by HBV proteins may also lead to the development of\n\nthese liver diseases [4,5].\n\nThe HBV transgenic mice used in the current study contain a\n\nsub-genomic HBV DNA fragment (genotype D, subtype ayw)\n\nencoding the three co-carboxyterminal HBV surface (HBs)\n\nproteins under the control of the liver-specific murine albumin\n\npromoter [6]. Although these transgenic mice have been shown to\n\ndevelop chronic liver injury, regenerative hyperplasia, as well as\n\nadenomas and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) [7,8] the\n\nmechanisms of HBs proteins pathogenicity are poorly understood.\n\nThe HBs protein expression pattern in this mouse model mimics\n\nthe situation in the liver of patients with enhanced intracellular\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\nexpression and retention of Hepatitis B virus surface proteins, e. g.\n\npatients with Hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver disease treated\n\nby transplantation. The liver damage in these patients was\n\nattributable to a direct hepatocytotoxic effect of HBV, since they\n\nwere on a similar immunosuppresion regime [9,10].\n\nAccumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER activates the\n\nunfolded protein response (UPR) that is sensed by the binding\n\nimmunoglobulin protein (BiP)/glucose-regulated protein 78\n\n(GRP78) [11–13]. Distinct branches of UPR are mediated by\n\nthree different classes of ER-membrane transducers: inositol-\n\nrequiring protein-1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor-6\n\n(ATF6) or protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase\n\n(PERK). PERK activation causes the phosphorylation of the\n\nalpha subunit of eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2 (eIF2a)\n[11]. Phosphorylation of eIF2a leads to a reduction in the\ninitiation of mRNA translation thus reducing the load of new\n\nproteins that require folding in the ER. However, the expression of\n\nsome proteins is enhanced. One of them is the C/EBP\n\nhomologous protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest and\n\nDNA damage-inducible gene (GADD) 153 that mediates pro-\n\napoptotic pathways emanating from the stressed ER [11,14].\n\nPreviously it was shown that GRP78 expression was increased in a\n\nhuman hepatoma cell line that overproduced HBs proteins [15]\n\nand in the liver of transgenic mice that expressed deletion mutant\n\nof large HBs [16].\n\nHepatic fibrosis constitutes the wound healing response to liver\n\ninjury. During fibrosis, hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation\n\nrepresents a critical event, because these cells become the primary\n\nsource of extracellular matrix in the liver upon damage [17].\n\nDevelopment of hepatic fibrosis after chemical liver injury is\n\nenhanced in BALB/c mice exhibiting a Th2 response compared to\n\nC57BL/6 mice, which demonstrated a primary Th1 response\n\n[18]. Transgenic mice on fibrosis-resistant C57BL/6 genetic\n\nbackground, which over-produce HBs proteins, develop modest\n\nspontaneous liver fibrosis [19,20].\n\nTranscription factor c-Jun and signal transducer and activator\n\nof transcription (STAT) 3 are implicated in several cellular\n\nprocesses including proliferation, survival, and cell transformation\n\n[21,22]. They are activated in chemically induced murine liver\n\ntumours and in HCCs of humans [23,24], suggesting an important\n\nfunction for these proteins in the development of liver tumours.\n\nHere we report that the production of HBV surface proteins\n\nstimulates the expression of CHOP in hepatocytes and could cause\n\nstronger liver damage in transgenic mice on BALB/c genetic\n\nbackground compared to C57BL/6. Furthermore, HBV trans-\n\ngenic mice develop hepatic fibrosis and the level of fibrosis\n\ndepends on the genetic background. Although c-Jun transcription\n\nfactor up-regulation and activation of STAT3 and PERK in the\n\nliver of transgenic mice might contribute to tumour development,\n\nCHOP expression might reduce tumorigenesis in transgenic mice\n\non BALB/c genetic background.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimal Model\nTransgenic mice were maintained at the Central Animal\n\nLaboratory of the Justus-Liebig-University Giessen under specified\n\npathogen-free conditions. This study was carried out in strict\n\naccordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care\n\nand Use of Laboratory Animals of the German law of animal\n\nwelfare. The mice received humane care, and all experiments\n\nwere approved by the Committee on the ethics of Animal\n\nExperiments of the Regierungspraesidium Giessen, Giessen,\n\nGermany (permit number: V54-19c 20 15 h 01 GI20/10 Nr.\n\n52/2011 and Nr. A5/2012).\n\nGeneration and characteristics of transgenic lineages Tg(Alb-\n\n1HBV), internal designation (HBVTg/6) have been described\n\npreviously [8]. The HBVTg/6 strain had an inbred C57BL/6\n\ngenetic background and was propagated by crossing hemizygous\n\ntransgenic males to C57BL/6 females. These mice were\n\nbackcrossed to fibrosis susceptible BALB/c genetic background\n\n[18] for at least 6 generations. The obtained transgenic mouse line\n\nwas internally designed HBVTg/c. At age of 12, 26, and 52 weeks\n\nmice were killed by CO2-inhalation. Liver samples were collected\n\nand preserved for analyses in accordance with application. Serum\n\nsamples were stored at 280uC until analysis of alanine amino-\ntransferase (ALT) by routine clinical chemistry on a Reflotron Plus\n\nAnalyzer (Roche, Mannheim, Germany).\n\nHistology and Hydroxyproline Assay\nImmediately after necropsy, liver samples for histology were\n\nfixed in 4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde at 4uC for 16\nhours and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections (5 mm) were\nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or 0.1% Sirius Red\n\nF3B in saturated picric acid (Chroma, Münster, Germany) for the\n\ndetection of collagen fibers [25]. The entire content of collagen\n\nwas determined by hydroxyproline (HYP) quantification [26].\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using ImmPRESS\n\nPeroxidase Detection Reagents (Vector Laboratories) and anti-\n\nbodies specific for HBsAg (20-HR20), GADD153 (F-168, Santa\n\nCruz), Desmin and GFAP (Lab Vision), c-Jun (60A8, Cell\n\nSignaling), BiP (C50B12, Cell Signaling). Colour reaction was\n\ndeveloped with VECTOR VIP Peroxidase Substrate Kit or DAB\n\nPeroxidase Substrate Kit, (Vector Laboratories). The percentage\n\nof BiP, Desmin, and GFAP-positive area was determined using\n\nImageJ image analysis system (National Institutes of Health,\n\nBethesda, MD, USA).\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nTotal liver lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using\n\nantibodies against HBsAg (20-HR20, Fitzgerald), GADD153 (F-\n\n168, Santa Cruz), phospho-PERK (16F8, Cell Signaling), PERK\n\n(H-300, Santa Cruz), phospho-eIF2a (119A11, Cell Signaling),\neIF2a (L57A5, Cell Signaling), b-actin (13E5, Cell Signaling),\nJNK2 (N-18, Santa Cruz), c-Jun (60A8, Cell Signaling), phospho-\n\nc-Jun (D47G9, Cell Signaling), phospho-SAPK/JNK (81E11, Cell\n\nSignaling), STAT3 (79D7, Cell Signaling), phospho-STAT3\n\n(D3A7, Cell Signaling).\n\nAssay for HBV-specific proteins\nHBsAg was measured in serum and in liver lysates by an in-\n\nhouse sandwich ELISA as described [27]. HBsAg amount per\n\nhepatocyte was calculated based on the hepatocellularity number\n\nfor mouse 135 million cells per gram of liver [28].\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)\nRNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, qPCR and quality control of all\n\nsteps were performed as described previously [29]. Primers were\n\npurchased from QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany). qPCR data were\n\nanalysed using DDCt method [30].\n\nMicroarray analysis\nMicroarray experiments were performed with total RNA from\n\nthe liver of 12-week-old mice as described previously [31]. The\n\nPathological Impact of HBV Surface Proteins\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608\n\n\n\ndata presented here have been deposited in NCBI’s Gene\n\nExpression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)\n\nand are accessible through GEO Series accession number\n\nGSE40826.\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was performed with SPSS V.17.0 software\n\n(SPSS Inc.). For non-normally distributed parameters, Mann-\n\nWhitney U test and Spearman rank test were applied. The results\n\nare presented as mean6SEM. A two-sided p,0.05 was considered\n\nsignificant (shown as * in the figures].\n\nResults\n\nLiver damage induced by HBs proteins expression\ndepends on host genetic background\n\nTransgenic mice were sacrificed at week 12, 26, and 52. To\n\nestimate the level of liver cell damage we have measured alanine\n\ntransaminase (ALT) in serum. Activities of serum ALT were\n\nmarkedly increased already in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice\n\ncompared to the wild-type and remained at that level during the\n\nobservation period. In HBVTg/6 mice the ALT elevation was\n\nmoderate at week 12 but increased later to levels almost as high as\n\nin HBVTg/c mice (Figure 1A). Histological analysis revealed no\n\nsignificant lymphocyte infiltration of the liver from 12-week-old\n\ntransgenic mice (Figure S1A). Furthermore, amounts of HBsAg\n\nper hepatocyte in 12-week-old mice were similar: 0.42 pg/cell\n\n(range, 0.18–0.71 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and 0.31 pg/cell\n\n(range, 0.15–0.64 pg/cell; n = 5) for HBVTg/6. Immunohisto-\n\nchemical and Western blot analyses of livers from transgenic mice\n\nalso showed that distributions and expression levels of HBs\n\nproteins were similar in mice on both C57BL/6 and BALB/c\n\ngenetic backgrounds (Figure S1B and S2). Moreover, amounts of\n\nHBsAg in serum of transgenic mice did not differ significantly:\n\n2.02 ng/ml (range, 0.68–3.19 ng/ml; n = 5) for HBVTg/c and\n\n1.34 ng/ml (range, 0.68–2.55 ng/ml; n = 4) for HBVTg/6. Thus,\n\nthe elevated serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice could be a\n\nconsequence of a specific host response to the presence of HBs\n\nproteins.\n\nTo identify the pathways which are activated in the HBs-\n\nexpressing liver tissue we carried out transcriptional profiling using\n\nmicroarray analysis. As illustrated in Table 1 a set of genes that is\n\nknown to be induced by UPR is up-regulated in the liver of 12-\n\nweek-old transgenic mice. Interestingly, the expression of gene\n\nddit3 that encodes CHOP protein is stronger up-regulated in the\n\nliver of HBVTg/c mice compared to HBVTg/6. To confirm this\n\nfinding we studied the expression of CHOP by qRT-PCR and\n\nWestern blot analysis. Transcription of the ddit3 gene was strongly\n\nactivated in 12-week-old HBVTg/c mice and declined thereafter\n\nwith age, whereas in HBVTg/6 mice ddit3 transcription was rather\n\nweakly enhanced in 12-week-old mice and increased with age\n\n(Figure S3). Western blot analysis of liver proteins revealed that\n\nCHOP was up-regulated much stronger in HBVTg/c mice\n\ncompared to HBVTg/6 (Fig. 1B). Selective CHOP translation\n\ndepends on eIF2a phosphorylation by PERK after induction of\nUPR [11]. However, we detected similar level of PERK activation\n\nand eIF2a phosphorylation in the liver from both mouse strains\nirrespective of gender and age (Fig. 1C and D). Interestingly, other\n\nUPR sensors ATF6 and IRE1 as well as eIF2a kinases PKR\n(protein kinase R) and GCN2 (general control non-derepressible-2)\n\n[32] were not activated in the liver of transgenic mice (data not\n\nshown). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of\n\ntransgenic mice leads to the specific activation of the PERK\n\nbranch of UPR in hepatocytes from both mouse strains, but\n\nexpression of CHOP was much stronger in HBVTg/c mice.\n\nEnhanced translation of CHOP results in liver damage and could\n\nexplain higher serum ALT levels in HBVTg/c mice.\n\nTo examine the location of CHOP expressing hepatocytes\n\nimmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. According to our\n\nprevious finding a significant part of hepatocytes from 12-week-old\n\nHBVTg/c mice accumulated CHOP in the nucleus and the\n\namount of CHOP-positive hepatocytes declined with age, whereas\n\nwe could detect only a few hepatocytes in HBVTg/6 liver\n\npositively stained for CHOP independent of age (Figure 2A).\n\nInteresting, CHOP-positive hepatocytes were located in centri-\n\nlobular areas which surround a hepatic central vein (Figure 2A).\n\nFurthermore, induction of UPR leads to activation of the major\n\nsensor of unfolded protein accumulation BiP/GRP78 [12]. IHC\n\ndemonstrated strong expression of BiP in selected hepatocytes in\n\ncentrilobular areas (Figure 2B and Figure S4), although Western\n\nblot analysis did not reveal any differences between wild-type and\n\ntransgenic mice in expression of BiP/GRP78 (data not shown).\n\nThus, expression of HBs proteins activated the UPR downstream\n\npathway (CHOP and BiP) much stronger in the liver of transgenic\n\nmice on BALB/c genetic background compared to C57BL/6.\n\nThis activation is located in centrilobular zones of the liver.\n\nLiver fibrosis\nMeasurement of liver hydroxyproline content demonstrated the\n\ndevelopment of hepatic fibrosis in transgenic mice (Figure 3A).\n\nEnhanced hepatic fibrosis was confirmed by Sirius red staining as\n\nwell. We observed minimal fibrosis in the liver of 12-week-old\n\nmice. But fibrosis constantly increased with age. However,\n\nHBVTg/c mice accumulated more collagen (Figure S5). Hepatic\n\nstellate cells (HSC) are the primary effector cells responsible for the\n\ndeposition of ECM in normal and fibrotic liver [33]. Therefore,\n\nwe tested the expression of HSC activation markers. We detected\n\nincreased amounts of GFAP- and desmin- positive cells in the liver\n\nof transgenic mice, thus demonstrating HSC proliferation in the\n\nliver of transgenic mice (Figure 3B and Figure S6). Moreover,\n\ndouble staining of desmin with specific antibodies and collagen\n\nwith Sirius red has shown co-localization of HSCs with collagen\n\nfibres (Figure S7). Taken together, expression of HBs proteins in\n\nmouse liver induces development of hepatic fibrosis, which\n\ncorrelated with liver injury. HSCs might be the main collagen-\n\nproducing cells in this mouse model.\n\nHBs protein-induced tumour development depends on\nhost genetic background\n\nMicroarray analysis showed an up-regulation of c-jun gene\n\nexpression in transgenic mice independent of genetic background\n\n(Table 1). These results were confirmed using qPCR. Maximal\n\nexpression was detected in the liver of 52-week-old mice (Figure\n\nS8). Expression of c-Jun protein was increased in the liver of 12-,\n\n26-, and 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4A). Major parts of\n\nhepatocytes of 52-week-old mice accumulated c-Jun in the nucleus\n\n(Figure S9). Phosphorylation of c-Jun by c-Jun N-terminal kinase\n\n(JNK) stimulates its ability to activate transcription [34,35].\n\nWestern blot analyses demonstrated that JNKs were activated\n\n(Figure 4B) and the level of c-Jun phosphorylation was indeed\n\nincreased in the liver of 52-week-old transgenic mice (Figure 4C).\n\nThus, expression of HBs proteins in the liver of transgenic mice\n\nleads to activation of c-Jun expression.\n\nSTAT3 activation was observed in mouse models of liver injury\n\nand in human liver diseases in the context of inflammation and\n\ncancer [22]. Therefore, we examined the status of STAT3\n\nactivation in the liver of HBV transgenic mice. Western blot\n\nanalysis of liver protein extracts revealed STAT3 activation in the\n\nPathological Impact of HBV Surface Proteins\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e90608\n\n\n\nliver of male but not female mice (Figure 4D). Thus, expression of\n\nHBV surface proteins in the liver of transgenic mice results in\n\nSTAT3 activation in a gender-dependent manner.\n\nUp-regulation of c-Jun expression and STAT3 activation could\n\npromote hepatic tumour growth [21,22]. We checked transgenic\n\nmice for occurrence of liver tumour. In young mice (12- and 26-\n\nweek-old) mice we could detect no tumours. However, they were\n\ndetected in 100% (6/6) of 52-week-old male and 20% (1/5) of\n\nfemale HBVTg/6 mice, whereas only 58% (7/12; X\n2\n\n= 3.46;\n\np = 0.06) of 52-week-old male and 0% (0/6) of female HBVTg/c\n\nmice develop tumours. Hence, development of tumours in HBV\n\ntransgenic mice was age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study we investigated the effects of HBVs proteins\n\nexpression in the liver of transgenic mice BALB/c and C57BL/6\n\ngenetic background. Since we observed only weak strain-\n\nindependent immune cell infiltration of transgenic mice liver\n\n(Figure S1) this model could be considered as one with impaired\n\nimmune reaction. One important negative impact of immune\n\ndeficiency on chronic HBV infection in human is related to the\n\ndirect cytotoxicity of high levels of HBs and other HBV proteins\n\n[9,10,36]. Low serum HBsAG titers were associated with strong\n\nintracellular accumulation of HBs in HBV transgenic mice on\n\nboth genetic backgrounds. This condition was also seen in some\n\npatients with late phases of chronic HBV infection [37,38]. Thus,\n\ntransgenic mice expressing HBs proteins reflect the situation in the\n\nliver of HBV-infected patients demonstrated strong retention of\n\nHBsAg in hepatocytes.\n\nHigher serum ALT activities in HBVTg/c mice suggest\n\nstronger liver injury compared to HBVTg/6 (Figure 1A). Since\n\nthe level of cellular infiltration was low in the liver of transgenic\n\nmice on both genetic backgrounds we searched for other reasons\n\nof hepatocyte death. Increased CHOP expression as a result of\n\nprolonged ER stress promotes cell death, whereas CHOP deletion\n\nprotects against the death of ER-stressed cells [14]. Strongly\n\nincreased transcription and protein accumulation of CHOP in\n\nHBVTg/c mice (Figure 1B and 2A; Figure S3) inducing\n\nhepatocyte death could explain increased serum ALT level in\n\nthese mice. Expression of CHOP is mediated by phosphorylation\n\nof eIF2a [32] that in turn is phosphorylated by PERK [11].\nInterestingly, levels of PERK activation and eIF2a phosphoryla-\ntion were similar in the liver of both HBV transgenic mouse strains\n\n(Figure 1C and 1D). Two other branches of UPR IRE1a and\nATF6 were not activated in the liver of HBV transgenic mice (data\n\nnot shown). PERK branch activation is largely sustained with\n\nunmitigated ER stress, whereas persistent ER stress attenuates\n\nIRE1a and ATF6 signaling [39]. Therefore, permanent expres-\nsion of HBs proteins leads to the activation of persistent ER stress\n\nin hepatocytes that induces PERK and impairs another branches\n\nFigure 1.

It is possible that this situation is common for chronic\n\nliver disease comprising ER stress induction.\n\nIt was previously shown that despite PERK activation and\n\neIF2a phosphorylation in the liver of patients with nonalcoholic\nfatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\n\n(NASH), downstream effectors such as CHOP remain inactive\n\n[40]. A similar situation was observed in the liver of HBV\n\ntransgenic mice on C57BL/6 genetic background. However,\n\nstimulation of CHOP and BiP expression in HBVTg/c mice\n\ndemonstrated that the outcome of UPR induction depends on the\n\ngenetic background of subjects. Furthermore, several studies have\n\ndemonstrated that PERK function is critical for maintaining\n\ncellular redox homeostasis, promotes cancer cell proliferation and\n\ntumour growth [41]. Thus, sustained activation of PERK could\n\nalso promote cancer development in the liver of HBV transgenic\n\nmice.\n\nGlobal reduction of translation initiation due to PERK-\n\nmediated eIF2a phosphorylation [32] should also affect the\nexpression of HBs proteins in the liver. This suggests the following\n\nfeed-back mechanism: PERK activation results in the reduction of\n\nHBs translation and that leads to a balance between PERK\n\nactivation and HBs protein synthesis in hepatocytes.\n\nDevelopment of tumours in HBV transgenic mice as it was\n\nshown by us and others [8] is age-, gender-, and strain-dependent.\n\nIn this study we observed a strong up-regulation of c-Jun hepatic\n\nexpression and an activation of STAT3, whose role in tumori-\n\ngenesis is well established [22,23,42]. Jun controls liver cancer\n\ninitiation and is required for development of chemically induced\n\nHCC [23]. Interestingly, transgenic mice comprising the whole or\n\npartial HBV genome are also more susceptible to chemically\n\ninduced hepatocarcinogenesis [43,44]. Likewise, hepatitis C virus\n\ncore protein potentiates chemically induced HCC through c-Jun\n\nand STAT3 activation [45]. Thus, stimulation of c-Jun expression\n\nand STAT3 activation by HBs proteins could promote the\n\ndevelopment of liver cancer induced by different causes, such as\n\nsustained inflammation, activation of oncogenes etc. Furthermore,\n\nthe finding that STAT3 was activated in male mice only correlated\n\nwith our observation that tumour development in HBV transgenic\n\nmice is gender-dependent. There is accumulating evidence that\n\ntumour-specific ER stress can be exploited for cancer therapy by\n\ntreatment with ER stress-aggravating compounds [46]. Moderate,\n\ntransient ER stress response represents an adaptive mechanism to\n\nsupport cellular survival. However, severe and excessive stress\n\nconditions could turn this response system to its pro-apoptotic\n\nmode. Stimulation of CHOP expression in HBVTg/c mice\n\nindicated an activation of pro-apoptotic cellular stress responses in\n\nthe liver and resulted in reduced tumour incidence in 52-week-old\n\nHBVTg/c mice.\n\nTaken together, the outcome of HBV surface proteins\n\nexpression in the liver of transgenic mice depends on the host\n\ngenetic background. Liver injury and fibrosis were increased in\n\ntransgenic mice on BALB/c background compared to C57BL/6\n\ncorrelating with strong expression of PERK downstream pro-\n\napoptotic effector CHOP. More interesting finding is genetic\n\nbackground-independent stimulation of c-Jun expression together\n\nwith STAT3 and PERK activation promoting cancer cell\n\nproliferation and tumour growth. However, activation of pro-\n\napoptotic cellular stress response could result in reduced tumour\n\nincidence in the liver.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Representative liver histology and distribu-\ntion of HBs proteins in hepatocytes of transgenic mice.\n(A) H&E staining of liver sections from 12-, 26-, and 52-week-old\n\nmice HBVTg/c and HBVTg/6 mice.
