Enzyme responsible for this process is DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) that maintains an altered\nmethylation pattern by copying it from parent to daughter DNA strands after replication. Aberrant methylation of the\npromoter regions of genes critical for normal cellular functions is potentially reversible. Therefore, inactivation of DNMT1\nseems to be a valuable target for the development of cancer therapies. Currently, the most popular DNMT inhibitors\n(DNMTi) are cytidine analogues like 5-azacytidine, 5-aza-29-deoxycytidine (decitabine) and pyrimidin-2-one ribonucleoside\n(zebularine). In colorectal cancer, epigenetic modifications play an essential role at each step of carcinogenesis. Therefore,\nwe have addressed the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors may potentiate inhibitory effects of classical\nchemotherapeutic agents, such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), commonly used in colorectal cancer therapy. Here,\nour report shows that DNMTi can have positive interactions with standard chemotherapeutics in colorectal cancer\ntreatment. Using pharmacological models for the drug-drug interaction analysis, we have revealed that the combination of\ndecitabine with 5-FU or oxaliplatin shows the most attractive interaction (synergism), whereas the effect of zebularine in\ncombinations with chemotherapeutics is moderate and may be depended on genetic/epigenetic background of a cell line\nor secondary drug used in combination. Our results suggest that DNMTi administered in combination with standard\nchemotherapeutics might improve the treatment of patients with colorectal cancers.\n\nCitation: Flis S, Gnyszka A, Flis K (2014) DNA Methyltransferase Inhibitors Improve the Effect of Chemotherapeutic Agents in SW48 and HT-29 Colorectal Cancer\nCells.

It is estimated that over\n\n600000 people die from it globally each year [1]. It means that\n\ncolorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer related deaths.\n\nUnfortunately, CRC develops for a long time without any\n\nsymptoms; therefore the disease is recognized at advanced stages.\n\nGenerally, the risk of CRC increases with age and is caused not\n\nonly by genetic alterations involving oncogenes and tumor\n\nsuppressor genes, but is also driven by epigenetic alterations\n\ninvolving changes in gene expression patterns, which are not\n\ndependent on changes in the DNA sequence. One of the\n\nepigenetic events is caused by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs),\n\nwhich catalyze the covalent addition of the methyl group to the 59\n\nposition of cytosine in the CpG dinucleotide from the donor S-\n\nadenosylmethionine. Cytosine methylation occurs in genomic\n\nregions called CpG islands and it is known to alter the chromatin\n\nstructure leading to gene silencing. During colorectal cancer\n\nprogression, a global genome demethylation coupled with selective\n\nhypermethylation of tumor suppressors, cell cycle regulators and\n\nproapoptotic genes is observed [2]. Because epigenetic modifica-\n\ntions are potentially reversible, they constitute an interesting\n\ntherapeutic strategy with use of DNMT inhibitors (DNMTi).\n\nDecitabine and zebularine are DNMT inhibitors, which may\n\npotentially reverse epigenetic alterations resulting in reactivation of\n\nsilenced genes, blocking cancer cell proliferation and/or inducing\n\napoptosis [3,4]. Both agents seem to be very interesting and\n\nvaluable for therapy of solid tumors. Decitabine, a cytidine analog,\n\nhas been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n\n(FDA) for the treatment of hematological malignancies [5],\n\nwhereas zebularine in comparison to other cytidine analogs is\n\nmore stable, less toxic and can be orally administered [6].\n\nIt appears to be reasonable to use demethylating agents in\n\ncombination with chemotherapeutic agents. Interestingly, encour-\n\naging results were obtained with combination of decitabine and\n\ncarboplatin in patients with solid tumors [7]. The authors\n\nconcluded that decitabine combines safely with carboplatin and\n\nthat the regimen causes epigenetic changes. In another phase I\n\nstudy, a combination of cisplatin with decitabine resulted in one\n\npartial response in patient with cervical cancer and two minor\n\nresponses: one in patient with non-small-cell lung cancer and the\n\nother in patient with cervical cancer [8]. However, despite lines of\n\nevidence indicating that demethylating agents might improve\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\nanticancer activity of classic chemotherapeutic agents, the\n\nknowledge for using them for solid tumors is still insufficient and\n\nneeds to be further evaluated.\n\nTherefore, to test this hypothesis, the CRC cell line survival\n\nmodel was chosen to study these interactions. With the help of this\n\nmodel and pharmacological analysis we have designed the study to\n\nfind out the outcome of the interaction between DNMT inhibitors,\n\ndecitabine or zebularine, and classic anticancer chemotherapeutics\n\nused in the treatment of CRC such as oxaliplatin, an inter- and\n\nintra-DNA cross-linking agent, and 5-fluorouracil, a thymidylate\n\nsynthase inhibitor. The studies of interactions between chemo-\n\ntherapeutic agents and DNMTi agents seem to be reasonable,\n\nbecause all these compounds have been tested for their cytotoxic\n\nproperties against normal cells [5,9,10] and all of them except\n\nzebularine are approved by the U.S. FDA for medical use.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell culture and drug treatment\nAs a model of colon cancer cells, the HT-29 and SW48 human\n\ncolorectal cancer cell lines, obtained from American Type Culture\n\nCollection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), were used. The cells\n\nwere cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco, Paisley, UK)\n\nsupplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum\n\n(FBS, Gibco), 2 mM glutamax (Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin,\n\n100 mg/ml streptomycin and 250 ng/ml amphoterycin (Gibco) at\n37uC in a humidified atmosphere including 5% CO2. Cells were\nincubated with the drugs for 24, 48 and 72 h, but only results\n\nobserved following the 72 h treatment are presented as their\n\npositive become more pronounced.\n\nDrugs\nThe following drugs were studied: 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),\n\noxaliplatin, zebularine and decitabine (Sigma, St. Louis, MI,\n\nUSA). The concentrations of the drugs were in the range up to\n\n100 mM. All agents were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide Hybri-\nMax (DMSO, Sigma) and then diluted in the media for\n\nexperiments. The final concentration of DMSO, without affecting\n\ncell survival, was maintained at 0.2%. In all experiments, control\n\ncells were incubated with DMSO.\n\nMTT assay\nThe assay relies on the ability of viable cells to metabolically\n\nreduce a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan product.\n\nThis reaction requires active mitochondrial reductase enzymes.\n\nCells were grown in 96-well plates (16104 cells/200 ml/well).\nAfter incubation with the reagents, the medium was removed and\n\nthe cells were treated with 50 ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-\n2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (MTT, Sigma) for 4 h\n\nat 37uC. Next, 150 ml of solubilization solution (10% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate, SDS) was added and the mixture was incubated at\n\n37uC overnight. The solubilized formazan product was spectro-\nphotometrically quantified using a microtiter plate reader, Power\n\nWave XS (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT, USA), at 570 nm wavelength.\n\nAnalysis of drug interactions\nCells of SW48 and HT-29 cell lines were simultaneously\n\nincubated for 72 h with chemotherapeutic agents and DNMT\n\ninhibitors or with each agent alone. The nature of the interactions\n\nbetween drugs studied was analyzed with the help of izobologram\n\n[11] and combination-index (CI) methods, derived from the\n\nmedian-effect principle of Chou and Talalay [12,13]. The data\n\nobtained from the cytotoxicity experiments were used for\n\nmathematical and quantitative evaluation of drug-drug interac-\n\ntions.\n\nIsoboles were defined by effects of the paired drugs studied. The\n\neffects obtained by the half maximal inhibitory concentration\n\n(IC50) of either drug within the pair formed the basis for the\n\nadditivity line; synergism or antagonism was present, when the\n\nsame effect was obtained by the combination of drugs in lower or\n\nhigher doses, respectively.\n\nA commercial software package, CalcuSyn ver. 2.0 (Biosoft,\n\nCambridge, United Kingdom), was used for median-effect\n\nanalysis. We calculated the CI values based on the formula: CI\n\n= (D)1/(Dx)1 + (D)2/(Dx)2 for mutually exclusive drugs. In the\ndenominator, (Dx) is for D1 ââaloneââ that inhibits a system x%, and\n\n(Dx)2 is for D2 ââaloneââ that inhibits a system x%. In the\n\nnumerators, (D)1 + (D)2 ââin combinationââ also inhibit x%. CI\nvalues were generated at different effect levels (Fa, the fraction\n\naffected by D, i.e. percentage inhibition/100) from 0.05 to 0.95 (5â\n\n95% cell kill). Synergy is indicated by CI values ,1, additivity by\n\nCI values = 1 and antagonism by CI values .1.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis\nFor cell cycle analysis the cells (,16106) were suspended in\n\n4 ml of 80% ethanol (220uC) and incubated at 220uC for 24 h,\nwashed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and stained with\n\n50 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and 100 mg/ml RNase in 0.1%\nPBST solution (PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton Xâ100) for\n\n30 min in the dark at 4uC. The samples were then measured using\na BD FACSCalibure flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose,\n\nCA, USA). The DNA histograms were analyzed using ModFit\n\nsoftware (BD Biosciences).\n\nApoptosis of the cells was measured, according to the\n\nmanufacturerâs instructions, using an annexin V-FITC kit (BD\n\nBiosciences). The cells were collected after treatment, washed\n\ntwice with PBS and centrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in\n\nice-cold binding buffer. The annexin V-FITC and PI solutions\n\nwere added to the cell suspension and gently mixed. The samples\n\nwere then incubated for 15 min in the dark before flow cytometry\n\nanalysis.\n\nFor immunofluorescent staining, cells were fixed in 1.5%\n\nformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and\n\npermeabilized with cold methanol for 20 min at 4uC. After\nwashing, cells were incubated with desire primary antibody (Cell\n\nSignaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) against phospho-ATR\n\n[(P)-Ser428, Cat. No. 2853] and phospho-ATM [(P)-Ser1981,\n\nCat. No. 5883] at 1:100 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS for 1 h at RT.\n\nAfter washing with PBS, appropriate secondary antibody conju-\n\ngated with FITC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)\n\nwere added at 1:500 dilution in 0.5% BSA/PBS and incubated for\n\n30 min at RT. After washing, the cells were analyzed by flow\n\ncytometry.\n\nFor all applications 10,000 events per sample were analyzed by\n\nfluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS).\n\nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR\nThe mRNA levels of CCNE1, ATM and GAPDH were analyzed\n\nby RT-PCR using total RNA from HT-29 and SW48 cells isolated\n\nusing the GenElute\nTM\n\nMammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit\n\n(Sigma), as described by the manufacturer. One hundred ng of\n\ntotal RNA was used in the reverse transcription reaction with\n\nOmniscript Reverse Transcriptase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)\n\nand oligo (dT)18 primer (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). The PCR\n\namplifications were performed in a 50 ml total volume according\nto manufacturerâs instruction using HotStarTaq Master Mix\n\n(Qiagen), 3 ml of cDNA as a template and the following primers\n\nDNMTi Improve the Effect of Cytostatics\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305\n\n\n\npairs: CCNE1 (5â-AACTCAACGTGCAAGCCTCG-3â, 5â-CAT-\n\nCTCCTGAACAAGCTCCA-3â), ATM (5â-GCCTTGAGTCT-\n\nGTGTATTCG-3â, 5â-CCACTCAGAGACTCCACAGC-3â) and\n\nGAPDH (5â-TCACCATCTTCCAGGAGCGA-3â, 5â-TGGTCA-\n\nTGAGTCCTTCCACG-3â). The GAPDH mRNA levels were\n\nused as internal controls. The amplified fragments were separated\n\non 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and\n\nphotographed under UV light.\n\nPreparation of protein lysates and Western blotting\nThe cells were washed with cold PBS buffer and then proteins\n\nfrom five cellular compartments were isolated using the Subcel-\n\nlular Protein and Fractionation Kit for Cultured Cells (Pierce,\n\nRockford, IL, USA). Protein concentration in the samples was\n\nmeasured using BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Samples containing\n\n60 mg of protein were denatured and fractionated by 7, 12 or 15%\nSDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred\n\nonto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-human\n\nantibodies specific to: cyclin A1 and D1, PARP, caspase-3 and -8\n\n(Santa Cruz Biotechnology); p21 (Cat. No. 554228), p53 (Cat.\n\nNo. 610183), Bax (Cat. No. 610982, BD Biosciences); b-actin\n(Cat. No. A1978, Sigma); and the DNA Damage Antibody\n\nSampler Kit (phospho-Chk1 [(P)-Ser296], phospho-Chk2 [(P)-\n\nThr68], phospho-histone H2A.X [cH2A.X, (P)-Ser139], phospho-\np53 [(P)-Ser15], and phospho-BRCA1 [(P)-Ser1524]; Cat.\n\nNo. 9947; Cell Signaling Technology). All antibodies in the\n\nDNA Damage Antibody Sampler Kit recognize their targets\n\nproteins only when modified at the indicated sites. Therefore,\n\nantibodies against unmodified proteins were not used.\n\nAnti-Bax antibody recognizes human Bax-a form. An alterna-\ntive splicing of Bax pre-mRNA produces the integral membrane\n\nform Bax-a and the two cytosolic forms b and c. This antibody is\nrecommended by BD company for detection of apoptosis. Anti-\n\np53 antibody recognizes the C terminal region of the protein (the\n\n195â393 a.a. was used as an antigen) and is able to recognize both\n\nthe wild-type and R273H forms of p53. This antibody is also\n\nrecommended by BD company for detection of apoptosis.\n\nThe signal on blots was detected by a colorimetric method using\n\nthe CN/DAB Substrate Kit (Pierce) and SignalBoost Immunore-\n\naction Enhancer Kit (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\nMitochondrial membrane potential (DYm) measurement\nThe DYm was measured by flow cytometry using 10 mg/ml of\n\n5,59,6,69-tetrachloro-1,19,3,39-tetraethylbenzimidazolo- carbocya-\n\nnine iodide (JC-1 dye, Sigma), which stains mitochondria in living\n\ncells. In healthy cells, the dye accumulates in mitochondria,\n\nforming aggregates that emit red fluorescence, while in apoptotic\n\ncells the dye remains in monomeric form in cytoplasm and emits\n\ngreen fluorescence. Cells were treated with chemotherapeutics,\n\nDNMT inhibitors or their combinations for 72 h and stained as\n\ndescribed by Mahyar-Roemer et al. [14] and then examined by\n\nFACSCalibure flow cytometer. Mitochondria containing red JC-1\n\naggregates in healthy cells were detectable in FL2 channel, while\n\ngreen JC-1 monomers in apoptotic cells were detectable in FL1\n\nchannel.\n\nStatistical analysis\nData are presented as mean values 6SD. Statistical compar-\n\nisons among groups were performed by Studentâs t-test or one-way\n\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey post hoc test.\n\nSignificance was assumed at P , 0.05 (marked with asterisks on\n\ngraphs).\n\nResults\n\nGrowth studies and effects of combination treatments of\nchemotherapeutic agents with DNMTi\n\nAs the first step, we examined the effect of the agents applied\n\nalone on SW48 and HT-29 cell viability. The cells were treated\n\nwith 10 to 100 mM of the evaluated agents. The results of MTT\ncell viability assay indicated that CRC cells incubated with\n\noxaliplatin and 5-FU showed the most potent inhibition of cell\n\ngrowth following 72 h incubation time (Figure 1). The inhibitory\n\neffects of chemotherapeutics were dose-dependent and the\n\ncorrelation coefficients (estimated from the inhibitory dose-\n\nresponse curves) were above 0.9. Demethylating agents, decitabine\n\nand zebularine, have demonstrated different modes of inhibition:\n\ndecitabine was already inhibitory at starting concentration\n\n(20 mM) and zebularine showed inhibitory effect from 80 and\n40 mM for SW48 and HT-29 cells, respectively.\n\nWe tested also the treatment of chemotherapeutic agents in\n\ncombination with DNMTi on CRC cells survival (Figure 1).\n\nDecitabine potentiated the inhibitory effects of oxaliplatin at the\n\nconcentration from 20 mM up to 100 mM, whereas its impact on\n5-FU activity starts at 80 mM. Zebularine tested at concentrations\nup to 100 mM slightly potentiated the inhibitory effects of either\nchemotherapeutics (Figure 1).\n\nThe type of drug interactions of two evaluated compound\n\ngroups were analyzed with the help of isobolographic and median\n\neffect methods. The isobolograms show results for single 50%\n\neffect level and indicate that interaction of decitabine with\n\nchemotherapeutic agents results in synergistic effect, whereas\n\nadministration of zebularine with oxaliplatin or 5-FU results in\n\nsynergistic or slightly additive effects (Figure 2A).\n\nAnalysis performed by means of median effect method\n\nconfirmed that the combination of decitabine and chemothera-\n\npeutic agents in both cell lines produced synergistic effects at 50%\n\ncell kill level (Fa = 0.5), achieving CI (Combination Index) values\n\n, 0.9 (Figure 2B).\n\nCombination of zebularine and chemotherapeutics for Fa =\n\n0.5 indicated slight synergistic or additive effects.\n\nAnalysis of DNA damage\nTo elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis, we analyzed the\n\nphosphorylation status of proteins being of major signaling\n\ncheckpoints in response to DNA damage.\n\nUpon sensing the DNA damage, series of cellular signaling\n\nevents designed to maintain the integrity and proper function of\n\ncells and biological pathways are involved. The proteins chosen for\n\ntesting by Western blotting initiate cascades of events that block\n\ncell cycle progression either to allow time to repair damaged DNA\n\nor activate cell death pathways if too much damage has been\n\nincurred. Phosphorylated histone H2A.X localizes to the sites of\n\nthe DNA damage and activates the ATM/ATR kinases, the\n\ncentral mediators of the DNA damage response. In turn, ATM/\n\nATR kinases initiate cascades, which inhibit progression into\n\nmitosis through the activation of the Chk kinases (Chk1 for ATR\n\nand Chk2 for ATM) or tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to\n\neither cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or apoptosis through\n\nregulation of p53 downstream effectors. BRCA1, as the guardian\n\nof genomic stability, is also phosphorylated by ATM, ATR, and\n\nChk2 in response to DNA damage and can co-localize with other\n\nproteins at DNA damage sites [15].\n\nWe observed a significant phosphorylation of histone H2A.X at\n\nSer139 in response to chemotherapeutic agents and their\n\ncombinations with DNMTi, especially in HT-29 cells. Lower\n\nlevels of cH2A.X (phospho-H2A.X) were observed in cells treated\n\nDNMTi Improve the Effect of Cytostatics\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92305\n\n\n\nwith DNMTi agents only. We also observed elevated levels of\n\nphosphorylation of proteins as ATR at Ser428, ATM at Ser1981,\n\np53 at Ser15, BRCA1 at Ser1524 as well as kinases Chk1 and\n\nChk2 at Ser345 and Thr68, respectively (Figure 3A and B).\n\nPhosphorylation status of kinases Chk1 and Chk2 was more\n\npronounced in HT-29 then in SW48 cells. In SW48 cells,\n\nphosphorylation levels of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases was higher after\n\nthe combined treatment with oxaliplain and decitabine as\n\ncompared to the treatment with both chemotherapeutics and\n\nDNMTi applied singly (Figure 3B).\n\nCombinations of chemotherapeutics with DNMTi\ninfluence the cell cycle progression and induce apoptosis\n\nIn the control culture, the percentage of cells in each phase of\n\nthe cell cycle was stable, whereas the tested compounds had\n\nvarious effects on cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Treatment\n\nwith the chemotherapeutics resulted in a consistent increase in the\n\nnumber of cells in the S phase at the expense of G1 phase.\n\nDecitabine arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M or S phase in the\n\nSW48 and HT-29 cells, respectively. Zebularine did not exert\n\nstatistically significant changes in both cell lines, as compared to\n\nthe controls.\n\nThe combination of decitabine with oxaliplatin or 5-FU\n\ninduced a cell cycle arrest at the S/G2/M phase boundary and\n\nat the S phase, respectively, in both cell lines (Figure 4). The\n\ncombination of zebularine with oxaliplatin increased percentage of\n\nthe HT-29 cells at the S/G2/M phase boundary, whereas the\n\ncombination of zebularine with 5-FU increased percentage of\n\nthese cells in S phase from 12% to 36% as compared with control.\n\nIn the case of the SW48 cells, the combinations of zebularine with\n\nchemotherapeutics caused the arrest of cells in the G2/M or S\n\nphase (Figure 4A).\n\nThe analysis of gene expression revealed that the combination\n\nof decitabine with oxaliplatin, as compared to oxaliplatin alone,\n\nincreased mRNA level of ATM in both cell lines as well as CCNE1\n\nin SW48 cell line (Figure 4B). The combinations of demethylating\n\nagents with 5-FU showed a similar tendency, but at a lower level\n\nthan the combinations with oxaliplatin. The analysis of proteins\n\nspecific for cell cycle progression revealed that the combination of\n\nDNMTi with chemotherapeutics, as compared with oxaliplatin/5-\n\nFU alone, increased the level of cyclin A1 and protein p53 and\n\ndecreased the level of cyclin D1 (but not in the SW48 cells)\n\n(Figure 4C and 5B). The combination of zebularine with\n\nchemotherapeutics increased the level of p21 in SW48 cells\n\n(Figure 4C).\n\nSince the prolonged treatment with chemotherapeutics or\n\nDNMTi might induce cell death, the early apoptotic marker was\n\nthus analyzed. For this purpose we used annexin V, which\n\nrecognizes phosphatidyl serine (PS). During induction of apoptosis,\n\nmembrane asymmetry is lost and translocation of PS from\n\nintracellular to external leaflet of the plasma membrane takes\n\nplace. As we expected, the treatment of the CRC cells with\n\noxaliplatin or 5-FU alone induced apoptosis in ,30% of the cells,\nwhile combinations of the evaluated agents generally increased the\n\nnumber of apoptotic cells from ,45% to 60% (Figure 5A) with the\nexception of the HT-29 cells incubated with demethylating agents\n\nand oxaliplatin together. In this case, the induction of apoptosis\n\nwas at a lower level than for other combinations, but still\n\nstatistically significant as compared with oxaliplatin applied alone.\n\nIn addition, the induction of apoptosis in the CRC cells by\n\ncombination of chemotherapeutics with demethylating agents was\n\nconfirmed by changes at the protein level of pro-caspase-3 and -8.\n\nThe proteolytic cleavage of the poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase\n\nFigure 1.

In this work, we explored the effect of\n\nDNMTi, chemotherapeutics or their combinations on DYm by\nstaining the cells with JC-1 dye. The analysis of cytograms showed\n\nthat the control cells emitted the red fluorescence due to high\n\nDYm, whereas the cells treated with chemotherapeutics and\nDNMTi agents exhibited increased membrane depolarization,\n\ndetected by green fluorescence, and the effect was sustained\n\n(oxaliplatin + DNMTi in HT-29 cell line) or stronger when cells\nwere co-incubated with these compounds (Figure 5C).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the 90s it has been confirmed that the CRC results not only\n\nfrom accumulation of genetic mutations but also as a consequence\n\nof epigenetic alterations of the cellular genome that transforms a\n\nnormal glandular epithelium into adenocarcinoma. It is well\n\nestablished that the most extensively characterized epigenetic\n\nalteration in CRCs is gene promoter hypermethylation, which\n\noccurs in CpG islands that are often present at the 5â region of\n\napproximately 60% of the genes. This phenomenon results from\n\nthe increased activity of the DNMT enzyme whose overexpression\n\nis a hallmark of almost all the transformed cells [16]. A growing\n\nnumber of genes that are expressed in the colon have now been\n\nshown to be hypermethylated and silenced in colorectal cancer.\n\nThese include genes involved in cell-cycle control, growth,\n\ndifferentiation, angiogenesis, adhesion, metastasis or DNA repair\n\n[17]. Since epigenetic modifications are potentially reversible, the\n\nFigure 2. Interactions of standard chemotherapeutics with DNMT inhibitors in the human colorectal cancer cell lines SW48 and HT-\n29.

Therefore developing of some new strategies for\n\nthe treatment of such tumors is a challenge to oncology [18]. That\n\nis why we have presented the results of in vitro study concerning\n\ninteractions of standard cytotoxic drugs, 5-FU and oxaliplatin\n\n[19], with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) such as\n\ndecitabine and zebularine.\n\nDNMTis have recently gained a lot of attention as agents\n\ninhibiting cancer growth including colorectal carcinoma [20].\n\nHowever, the role of their therapeutic potential may be properly\n\nevaluated only in combination with classic agents used in the CRC\n\ntreatment, because all new therapeutic agents are introduced as\n\nadd-on options. Since 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin constitute the\n\nbackbone treatment of CRC [19], we investigated the effects on\n\nCRC cells survival adding decitabine or zebularine - the DNA\n\nmethyltransferase inhibitors - to these chemotherapeutics.\n\nWe have confirmed under in vitro conditions that the studied\n\nagents given alone are able to induce the growth inhibition of the\n\ncancer cells with comparable order of potency calculated on the\n\nbasis of the percentage of cell survival (Figure 1). Moreover, we\n\nhave found an increased inhibition of CRC cells growth after\n\ntreatment with the anticancer agents applied in combination\n\n(Figure 1). The isobolograms, constructed on the basis of IC50\nvalues, indicated synergistic or additive interactions between\n\nFigure 3.

Decitabine had the most\n\nfavorable interactions (synergy) in combination with chemother-\n\napeutics in both cell lines; whereas interaction analysis for\n\nzebularine showed moderate synergistic or additive effects and\n\nthe best results were achieved for combination with oxaliplatin\n\n(Figure 2).\n\nThe interactions observed between both DNMTi agents and\n\nchemotherapeutics were dose- and cell line-dependent. The\n\nsynergy between evaluated chemotherapeutics and decitabine\n\nwas seen in the SW48 and HT-29 cell lines as well as in the Colo-\n\n205 cells, as previously reported [21]. The sensitivity of CRC cells\n\nin combination of zebularine with chemotherapeutics was different\n\nand dependent on cell line. For this combination, synergism and\n\naddition as well as previously presented antagonism were observed\n\n[21]. Moreover, reactions of the CRC cells to zebularine and its\n\ncombinations were a little weaker. It appears that the two DNA\n\nmethyltransferase inhibitors belonging to the same class of agents\n\ninfluence the inhibitory effects of chemotherapeutics on CRC cells\n\ngrowth in a qualitatively different manner. These differences may\n\nbe related to their structure that exerts a direct effect on the\n\nsurvival of CRC cells [4]. The same observation was made in\n\nleukemic cells by Flotho et al. [22], who have shown that DNMTis;\n\nsuch as azacitidine, decitabine and zebularine; produce distinct\n\npatterns of gene induction and repression and that this diversity is\n\nrelated to the differences in the structure and cellular pharmacol-\n\nogy among DNMT-inhibiting cytosine nucleoside analogues.\n\nDecitabine has nitrogen in the place of carbon at position 5 of\n\nthe pyrimidine ring, but zebularine does not. In spite of that, both\n\nagents are incorporated into DNA but before incorporation the\n\nsubstances require phosphorylation to render the respective\n\nnucleotide forms. Decitabine is converted by deoxycytidine kinase,\n\nwhereas zebularine is a substrate for uridine-cytidine kinase\n\n[22,23,24]. The inhibitory activity of zebularine is not specific for\n\nDNMTs. It is also a strong inhibitor of cytidine deaminase [25,26],\n\ntherefore most of the drug may be sequestered by the enzyme,\n\nlowering thereby the effective concentration of the drug. Another\n\nexplanation is that the inhibition of cytidine deaminase by\n\nzebularine increases cellular concentration of cytidine and\n\ndeoxycytidine resulting in competitive inhibition of zebularine\n\n[27]. In addition, the kinetics of activation/inactivation and\n\nintracellular half-life of metabolites differ among different cytosine\n\nanalogues.\n\nGenerally, decitabine and zebularine possess ability to bind\n\ncovalently with DNMT thus obstructing DNA synthesis and, in\n\nthis way, leading to the cell death. Additionally, decitabine may\n\nalso induce DNA damage through structural instability at the site\n\nof incorporation [28,29]. Our results reviled that the potential\n\ntherapeutic effect of DNMTi agents, especially decitabine, may be\n\nenhanced by 5-FU or oxaliplatin. The former, as an antimetab-\n\nolite, can impair replication fork progression by becoming\n\nincorporated into the DNA, whereas the latter induces DNA\n\nlesions by interstrand cross-links resulting in replication stress.\n\nTherefore, we decided to evaluate whether DNA damage process\n\ntook place in the cells after treatment with chemotherapeutics,\n\nDNMTi and their combinations. It was confirmed by the\n\nphosphorylation analysis of histone H2A.X, a member of a\n\nhistone H2A family. H2A.X becomes phosphorylated at Ser139\n\nby ATM/ATR kinases to form cH2A.X, the earliest indicator of\nDNA damages [30,31]. In the current study, we found that the\n\nlevel of cH2A.X was strongly increased, especially in HT-29 cells.\n\nOur results show that chemotherapeutics as well as their\n\ncombinations with DNMTi may activate ATM/ATR kinases\n\npathways (Figure 3) leading, in consequence, to perturbations in\n\nthe cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis induction. This finding\n\nwas confirmed by further studies discussed below.\n\nCombinations of DNMTi with chemotherapeutics led to CRC\n\ncell cycle arrest in the S/G2/M transition or S phase, when\n\ncompared to the control cycle and the reduction of cell number in\n\nthe G1 phase (Figure 4). This was accompanied by increased\n\nmRNA level of ATM, as well as phosphorylation level of ATM at\n\nSer1981. Furthermore, we observed the elevated level of ATR\n\nphosphorylated at Ser428. Activation of both kinases suggests that\n\nDNA double-stranded breaks (DBS) as well as single-stranded\n\nDNA (ssDNA) are formed [32]. The ssDNA is present at processed\n\nDSB ends but also at stalled replication forks. Phosphorylation of\n\nATM and ATR kinases induces activation of Chk2 and Chk1\n\nkinases, respectively, which in turn induces via phosphorylation the\n\ndegradation of Cdc25A and C and phosphorylation of p53 protein\n\n[33]. We observed elevated levels of Chk2 and Chk1 phosphor-\n\nylated at Thr68 and Ser345, respectively (Figure 3). This might\n\nindirectly confirm down regulation of Cdc25A and C, the protein\n\ntyrosine phosphtases, which are downstream targets of both\n\nkinases. Additionally, we observed a higher level of cyclin A\n\nprobably connected with down regulation of Cdc25A and elevated\n\nphosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser1524, which is essential for\n\nactivating the Chk1 kinase and finally G2/M arrest (Figure 3) [34].\n\nIt is well known, that once the cells accumulate the excess of\n\nDNA damages that overwhelm their capacity of repairing the\n\nmechanisms for selective elimination of such cells are activated.\n\nIndeed, we have observed that simultaneous administration of the\n\ntested agents increased the apoptotic response of the cells\n\n(Figure 5A). The interaction among the agent combinations led\n\nto augmentation or maintaining of the protein levels of caspase-8\n\nand p53 as well as the level of pro-caspase-3 dependently of the\n\ncell line studied (Figure 5B). Thus, the cytotoxic effect of DNMT\n\ninhibitors and chemotherapeutics may result from apoptosis\n\ninduced by internal and slightly external signals. In fact, the\n\npossible involvement of mitochondrial pathway was confirmed by\n\nthe finding that the agent combinations (with the exception of\n\noxaliplatin + zebularine in HT-29 cells) strongly induced the\ndisruption of DYm (Figure 5C). Furthermore, the activity of these\ncombinations was manifested by the cleavage of PARP protein\n\ninto 84 kDa and 25 kDa fragments, which facilitates cellular\n\ndisassembly and also serves as a marker of cells undergoing\n\napoptosis (Figure 5B).\n\nThe results obtained in the analyzed cells lines are in some cases\n\ndifferent, however the main observations and final conclusions are\n\nsimilar. In our opinion, the differences in the response of both cell\n\nlines may depend on genetic and epigenetic background of the\n\ncells. These cell lines carry a BRAF mutation (Colon Cancer Panel\n\n2, BRAF; ATCC No. TCP-1007), but the HT-29 cells also carry a\n\nmutated p53 gene (GRA mutation at codon 273 resulting in an\nArgRHis substitution, R273H) causing overproduction of a\npathogenic form of p53, while SW48 cells have a wild-type allele.\n\nSince this additional mutation may cause higher sensitivity to such\n\ndrug combinations, it may also be responsible for observed, in\n\nsome cases, more pronounced response of HT-29 cells.\n\nOn the other hand, the SW48 cell line is known to harbor more\n\nof the epigenetic changes such as hypermethylation of CpG islands\n\nin the promoter regions leading to inappropriate silencing of some\n\ngene, used as an internal control.

Moreover, both cell lines differ in global DNA\n\nmethylation levels. Mossman et al. [35] have shown that HT-29\n\ncell line displayed a lower level of global DNA methylation than\n\nSW48 cell line and that following the treatment of cells with\n\ndecitabine, a substantial decrease of genomic DNA methylation\n\nwas observed. The decrease in global methylation in SW48 cell\n\nline was greater than 50%, whilst the decrease in HT29 cell line\n\nwas not so extensive. The authors also reviled that reduction of\n\nmethylation at specific gene CpG islands was significantly less\n\neffective [35]. For this reason, we have also analyzed the\n\nmethylation status of selected genes such as p16\nINK4a\n\n, APC,\n\np14\nARF\n\n, DAPK and MLH1 using methylation-specific PCR (MSP)\n\n(data not shown) and the obtained results were comparable to\n\nthose published by Deng et al. and Lind et al. [36,37]. Among both\n\ncell lines tested, the biallelic methylation of promoter region was\n\nobserved in p16\nINK4a\n\nand MLH1 genes, whereas the biallelic\n\nmethylation of p14\nARF\n\ngene was observed only in SW48 cell line.\n\nUnfortunately, our studies did not confirm that the application of\n\nDNMTi restores the expression of the evaluated genes and that it\n\nis the way by which both agents might enhance the action of\n\nchemotherapeutics. Perhaps such results are linked to the dosage\n\nlevels of the compounds tested as well as the incubation time. Most\n\nresults presented by other authors, who observed the reactivation\n\nof silenced genes after decitabine or zebularine application, were\n\nconducted for longer time duration, i.e. up to 5â8 days, and doses\n\nof the compounds were much lower [8,38]. Nevertheless, our\n\nresults clearly show that DNMTi application can bring benefits\n\nalso in methylation-independent manner and that their action\n\nrelies on cytotoxic properties in the applied range of doses.\n\nThe mechanism of positive interactions between DNMT\n\ninhibitors and chemotherapeutic agents is related to triggering\n\nthe cascade of events leading finally to apoptosis. Such augmen-\n\ntation suggests that the cytotoxic effects of classical chemothera-\n\npeutics used in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma could be\n\nobtained at lower doses and with higher probability for inducing\n\ncancer cell death when combined with DNMT inhibitors. It is also\n\nknown that the abnormal methylation of promoter regions of\n\nregulatory genes is commonly associated with cancer development.\n\nTherefore, the methylation inhibitors such as decitabine or\n\nzebularine may reactivate the silenced tumor suppressor genes\n\n[39] responsible for controlling the cell cycle progression and\n\ninduction of apoptosis, and in this way improve the effectiveness of\n\nanticancer therapy with chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nIn summary, we have demonstrated that DNMT inhibitors, in\n\nspite of the less potent action of zebularine, may exert a positive\n\ninteraction with oxaliplatin and 5-FU, the standard chemothera-\n\npeutics used in cancer treatment, potentiating the inhibition of\n\nCRC cell survival in vitro. It seems very likely that in the case of\n\nzebularine a more favorable response could be achieved with\n\nhigher doses than those presented here, since the toxicity of this\n\nagent was shown to be minimal [27]. Even so, the obtained results\n\nprovide a rationale to continue research studies that could help\n\ndevelop more effective treatments using methylation inhibitors\n\ntogether with standard chemotherapeutics as a new hope in the\n\ncolorectal cancer therapy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors are grateful to Prof. Zenon JastrzeÌ¨bski for critical reading of\n\nthe manuscript.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: SF.
