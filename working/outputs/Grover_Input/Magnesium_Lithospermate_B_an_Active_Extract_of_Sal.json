Soluble guanylyl cyclases (sGCs) and Ras homolog gene family, member A (rhoA)/Ras homolog gene family\nkinase(rho-kinase) plays a role in vascular smoothmuscle relaxation in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). It is of interest to examine\nthe effect of MLB on rhoA/ROCK and sGC/cGMP/PKG expression.Methods. A rodent SAHmodel was employed. Tissue samples\nwere for sGCùõº1, sGCùõΩ1, PKG, rhoA, ROCK (Western blot), and cGMP (ELISA) measurement. Results. MLB morphologically\nimproved convolution of the internal elastic lamina, distortion of endothelial wall, and necrosis of the smooth muscle in the SAH\nrats. Expressed cGMP, sGCùõº1, sGCùõΩ1, and PKG in the SAH groups were reduced (ùëÉ < 0.01), and MLB precondition significantly\ninduced cGMP, sGCùõº1, sGCùõΩ1, and PKG. L-NAME reversed the vasodilation effect of MLB, reduced the bioexpression of PKG and\ncGMP (ùëÉ < 0.01), and tends to reduce sGCùõº1 level and induce rhoA, ROCK level in MLB precondition + SAH groups. Conclusion.\nThese results demonstrate that sGC/cGMP/PKG and NO/ET pathways play pivotal roles in SAH-induced vasospasm. Through\nactivating sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway and partially by inactivating rho-kinase in a NO-dependent mechanism,MLB shows promise\nto be an effective strategy for the treatment of this disease entity.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) induced cerebral vasos-\npasm becomes an important subcategory of stroke owing\nto its high mortality and morbidity, which included delayed\nneurological deficit, and cardiopulmonary abnormality [1,\n2]. Till now, the precise mechanism of this disease contour\nremains unclear. Several molecular and cellular researches\nimplicate two key hypotheses to cerebral vasospasm: one\ncenter on the roles of nitric oxide [3] and endothelins [4] and\nanother converges on the role of ATP-AMP and rhoA/ROCK\nII [5]. In the study of Carter et al., [3] NO donors were\nable to relax vascular smooth muscle in the episode of\nvasospasm. Through mediated on a large conductance Ca2+-\ndependent K+ channels, cGMP-dependent protein kinase\n(PKG) phophorylates and rhoA, NOmay attenuates vascular\n\nsmooth muscle sensitivity to calcium ions [6]. In addi-\ntion, increased evidence suggests that NO counteracts with\nendothelins as a vascular modulator in part by mediating\nthe activation of RhoA-ROCK and MLC phosphatase [3,\n4]. The study of eNOS knockout mice reticence to diabetic\nnephropathy also provides some insight into the modulation\nof soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) on NO signaling pathway\n[7].\n\nThe involvement of NO/ET-1 and rhoA/ROCK in SAH\ninduced vasomediated pathways is not completely under-\nstood. It has been shown that NO (catalyzed by eNOs,\nnNos, and iNOs), an endothelium-derived relaxing factor\n(EDRF), augments with endothelin-1 and inhibits activation\nof rhoA/ROCK in rat thoracic aorta [8]. ET-1 potentiates the\nconstriction of cerebrovascular smooth muscles induced by\noxyhemoglobin through PKC and rhoA/rho kinase pathways\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nBioMed Research International\nVolume 2014, Article ID 272101, 9 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/272101\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/272101\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\n[4, 7]. This is compatible with the findings that a PKC\ninhibitor, staurosporine, can abolish ET-1 induced contrac-\ntion in rabbit basilar artery [9]. Moreover, lines of evidence\naccumulated to present have suggested that activated PKC\nplays a role in SAH induced vasospasm [10]. For example,\nphorbol 12, 13-dibutyrate, a PKC activator, can induce a\npotent and long-lasting contraction of the rabbit basilar\nartery [11]. In a canine double-hemorrhage model, the mem-\nbrane translocation of PKCùõø from cytosol in the basilar\nartery was observed after the second injection of autologous\nblood on the 4th day when vasospasm was robust [10, 12].\nFurthermore, intrathecal injection of the PKCùõø inhibitor\nrottlerin inhibited hemorrhage induced vasospastic response\nas well as the translocation of PKCùõø [10].\n\nOn the contrary, the key event for triggering vasomotor\neffect of NO/ET-1 in SAH on the rho-kinase pathway has\nattracted less attention despite of documented involvement\nof rho-kinase in cerebral vasospasm following SAH. Rho,\na family of small G-proteins, is composed of 3 members:\nrhoA, rhoB, and rhoC, which behaves like a substantial role in\nintracellular signaling [8, 13]. Inactive rho is resided as aGDP-\nbound form in the cytosol. If the vascular smooth muscle\ncells were stimulated by vasoactive agents and subsequent\nGDP-GTP exchange, rho may become activated and then\ntranslocated to the cell membrane where it interacts with\nits downstream effectors, rho-kinase (ROCK) [13, 14]. The\nROCK family includes two isoforms, namely, ROCK-I and\nROCK-II. By phosphorylating myosin light chain phos-\nphatase (MLCP) and inhibiting the activity of phosphatase\nat the myosin-binding subunit, rho-kinase is stimulated and\npromotes smooth muscle contraction [15, 16]. In the study\nof a canine two-hemorrhage model, topical application of a\nROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, dose-dependently decreased the\nspastic response, Rho-kinase activity, and phosphorylation of\nMLCP in the basilar artery [17, 18]. Moreover, intra-arterial\nadministration of fasudil, another kind of ROCK inhibitor, is\nalso proved to be effective for the treatment of vasospasm in\nSAH patients [19].\n\nBesides ET-1, nitric oxide (NO), composed of endothe-\nlial NOs(eNOs), neuronal NOs(nNOs), and inducible NOs\n(iNOs), is believed to be an important regulator of the\ncerebral vascular tone [7, 20]. Upon synthesis, NO binding\nactivates soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), a heterodimeric\nenzyme consisting of ùõº (ùõº\n\n1\n, ùõº\n2\n, and ùõº\n\n3\n) and ùõΩ (ùõΩ\n\n1\n, ùõΩ\n2\n, and\n\nùõΩ\n3\n) subunits [21]. Activation of sGC leads to convert GTP\n\nto cGMP, which in turn activates cGMP-dependent protein\nkinase (PKG) and cGMP gated ion channel among target\ncells. In blood vessels, PKG can phosphorylate the inositol, 1,\n4, 5-triphosphate receptor and decrease Ca2+ concentration\nand ultimately result in smooth muscle relaxation [9, 22,\n23]. Under normal physiological conditions, the productions\nof ET-1 and NO yield a balanced cerebral vascular tone.\nHowever, enhanced generation of ET-1 along with impaired\nNO production (NO-dependent) or with excessively induced\nNO (NO-independent) was noted in human and animals\nwith SAH [3]. Nevertheless, the effect of NO/ET-1 production\non the sGC/cGMP signaling pathway has not been fully\ninvestigated.\n\nIn the present study, we aimed to assess the neurological\ndeficits and plasma NO/ET-1 levels, as well as the expressions\nof PKCùõø, rhoA, ROCK-II, and sGC/cGMP/PKG in the basilar\nartery of rats subject to SAH. The effect of magnesium\nlithospermate B (MLB) on the NOS/sGC/cGMP/PKG and\nrhoA/ROCK signaling pathway in SAH was investigated.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1.Materials. Anti-rabbit sGCùõº1 and sGCùõΩ1 and anti-mouse\nùõΩ-actin antibodies were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (Shang-\nhai, PRC). Anti-rabbit PKG, anti-mouse PKCùõø, anti-rabbit\nROCK-II, anti-mouse rhoA, and horseradish peroxidase-\nlabeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were obtained from\nAbcam (Cambridge, MA, USA), BD Transduction Lab (BD\nBiosciences, California, USA), Upstate Biotech (NY, USA),\nSanta Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Cal-\nifornia, USA), and Chemicon International (CA, USA),\nrespectively. CNMprotein extraction kits were fromBiochain\n(Hayward, CA, USA). ET-1 and cGMP ELISA kits were\nproducts of Assay Designs (Enzo Life Sciences Inc., NY,\nUSA) and Cayman Chemical (Michigan, USA), respectively.\nMagnesium Lithospermate B was purified by Ms. Wu SC\n(Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital, Kaohsiung, Tai-\nwan, ROC), according to the modified protocol described\nby Tanaka et al. Dried Salvia miltiorrhiza were obtained,\ninoculation with methanol for 8 hr, and then concentrated.\nMLB was extracted by the aid of a Sephadex LH-20 multiple\ncolumn chromatography for four times. (Pharmacia Fine\nChemicals, Piscataway, NJ, USA).\n\n2.2. Animal Protocols. All the experimental protocols were\napproved by the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital\nanimal research committee. Forty-five male Sprague-Dawley\nrats (BioLasco Taiwan Co., Ltd., authorized by Charles River\nLab) weighing 250‚Äì350 g were assigned into five groups (9\nanimals each): Group 1 was designated as sham-operated,\nGroup 2: rats subjected to SAH only, Group 3: SAH rats\ntreated with vehicle (0.1mol/L PBS), and Groups 4 and 5,\nSAH animals received 10mg/kg/day MLB treatment at 24 hr\n(prevention protocol) and 1 hr (reversal protocol) after SAH,\nrespectively. To induce SAH, rats were anesthetized with\na mixture of ketamine (40mg/kg) and xylazine (6mg/kg)\nintraperitoneally (i.p.), and 0.3mL fresh blood was drawn\nfrom the central tail artery and injected into the craniocervi-\ncal junction using a stereotactic technique. Further nine ani-\nmals were enrolled in the 0.1 ùúáL NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl\nester (L-NAME) intrathecal injection plus 10mg/kg/dayMLB\npreconditioning SAH rats.\n\n2.3. Hemodynamic Measurements. Heart rate, blood pres-\nsure, and rectal temperature were monitored before and after\nMLB treatment as well as at 48 hr after the induction of\nSAH by a tail-cuff method (SC1000 Single Channel System,\nHatteras Instruments, North Carolina, USA) and rectal ther-\nmometer (BIO-BRET-2-ISO, FL, USA).\n\n2.4. Neurological Assessment. Behavior assessment, adapted\na modified limb-placing tests (MLPT) [2], was performed\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\nTable 1: Modified limb-placing test (MLPT).\n\nTreatment Group\nAmbulation Placing/stepping reflex MDI\n\nNormal 0 0 0\nSAH 1.28 ¬± 0.2 1.6 ¬± 0.16 2.88 ¬± 0.32\nSAH + vehicle 1.22 ¬± 0.13 1.48 ¬± 0.22 2.7 ¬± 0.35\nSAH + 1mg/kg MLB\n\nPrevention 0.83 ¬± 0.16 0.78 ¬± 0.18‚àó 1.61 ¬± 0.34‚àó\n\nTreatment 0.82 ¬± 0.15 0.84 ¬± 0.13 1.66 ¬± 0.28‚àó\n\nL-NAME + prevention 1.32 ¬± 0.23 1.45 ¬± 0.16 2.77 ¬± 0.39\nResults are expressed as the mean ¬± SEM, ùëõ = 9; ‚àóùëÉ < 0.01 versus SAH condition by Mann-Whitney test.\n\nbefore and at 48 hr after the induction of SAH. Motor\nfunction was assessed by two individuals who are blind to the\ntreatment status set, which is composed of two limb-placing\ntasks of assessment of the sensorimotor assimilation of the\nforelimb and hindlimb as well as monitoring its response\nto tactile and proprioceptive stimuli. The summations of\nneurological examination are scored as normal performance\n(0 point), incomplete performance (1 point), and no perfor-\nmance (2 points), which were shown in Table 1.\n\n2.5. Tissue Embedding. Basilar artery was collected and the\nmiddle third of each artery was left for further analysis.\nThe arterial segment was rinsed in a 0.1mol/L PBS (pH\n7.4) repeatedly, set in 1% osmium tetroxide in PBS at room\ntemperature for 1 hr, and then cleaned with PBS. The vessel\nsegments were dehydrated and immersed in a 1 : 1 mixture of\npropylene oxide and epoxy resin overnight. The specimens\nwere embedded in 100% epoxy resin and let to polymerize\nat 60‚àòC for 48 hr the next day. The BAs were cross-sectioned\nat a thickness of 0.5 ùúám on an Ultracut E ultramicro-\ntome (Reichert-Jung Ultracut E, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany),\nlaunched on glass slides, and stained with 0.5% toluidine\nblue for morphometric analysis later. The rest of tissue was\npreserved in liquid N\n\n2\nat ‚àí70‚àòC until the measurements of\n\nprotein expression and cGMP levels.\n\n2.6. Basilar Artery Morphometric Studies. Five selected BA\ncross sections of each animal were analyzed by two inves-\ntigators blinded to the set groups. The cross-sectional area\nwas automatically measured using computer-assisted mor-\nphometry (Image-1/Metamorph Imaging System; Universal\nImaging Corp.). The average of five cross sections from a\ngiven animal was collected as a single value for this animal.\nGroup data are expressed as the means ¬± standard error of\nthe means.\n\n2.7. Determination of Endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase\n(eNOS). An isolated BA was quantified by adapting a com-\nmercial kit to check NOS (Bioxytech NOS Assay Kit, Oxis\nInternational, Inc., Portland, OR, USA). Briefly, protein\nextracted frommicrovessels was incubated with radiolabeled\nL-arginine in the presence or in the absence of 1mmol/L\nNOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME,\nSigma-Aldrich, Shanghai, PRC). The reaction was finished\n\nby the addition of 50mmol/L HEPES buffer containing\n5mmol/L EDTA. Radiolabeled L-citrulline was counted after\nremoval of excess L-arginine with an equilibrated resin and\nthen centrifuged.\n\n2.8. Western Blot to Evaluate RhoA, ROCK-II, sGCùõº1, sGCùõΩ1,\nand PKCùõø Protein Expression. Basilar arteries were homoge-\nnized for extraction of cytoplasm (buffer C), nuclear (buffer\nN), and membrane- (buffer M-) bound proteins, as indicated\nby the instructions of themanufacturer. Expressions of PKCùõø,\nrhoA, ROCK-II, sGCùõº1, sGCùõΩ1, and PKG were determined\nby Western blots using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-\nRad Lab. Shanghai Co., Ltd., Pudong, Shanghai, PRC) fol-\nlowing the manufacturer‚Äôs instruction. Sampling of equal\namount (20ùúág/lane) was seceded by a 10% polyacrylamide\ngel and conveyed to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane\n(PerkinElmer Informatics, Cambridge, MA, USA). A vague\nbinding was blocked with a TBST buffer (50mM Tris-HCl,\npH 7.6, 150mMNaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) mixed with 5% fat\nfree milk for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes\nwere incubated overnight at 4‚àòC with one of the following\nprimary antibodies: rabbit anti-ROCK (1 : 1000), rabbit anti-\nsGCùõº1 (1 : 1000), rabbit anti-sGCùõΩ1 (1 : 1000), mouse anti-\nPKC (1 : 1000), and mouse anti-ùõΩ-actin (1 : 15000). The mem-\nbranes were then washed six times per 5min with TBST\nbuffer. Appropriate dilution of secondary antibodies (1 : 1000)\nwas incubated for 1 hr. After washing with TBST for six times,\nthe protein bands were detected with the Signal Fire ECL\nreagent fromCell SignalingTechnology (CST) (Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Inc., MA, USA).\n\n2.9. ELISA for Tissue cGMP Levels. Arterial blood was col-\nlected in heparin-containing tubes prior to the perfusion.\nPlasma samples were frozen at ‚àí70‚àòC until use. The level\nof cGMP in the homogenate of BA was measured using an\nELISA kit according to the instruction of the manufacturer.\n\n2.10. Statistical Analyses. Group data are expressed as the\nmeans ¬± SEM. Comparison of the neurological deficit scores\nbetween groups was performed by the Mann-Whitney test.\nComparison of protein expression and biomarkers between\ngroups was done using one-way ANOVA followed by Dun-\nnett‚Äôs test. Differences were considered significant at a ùëÉ <\n0.01.\n\n\n\n4 BioMed Research International\n\neN\nO\n\nS \nre\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne \nto\n\n sh\nam\n\n (f\nol\n\nds\n)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\nSham SAH\n\nSAH\n\nV T P P\nMLB\n\n‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\n#\n\nL-\nN\n\nA\nM\n\nE\n\n‚àó‚àó\n‚àó\n\n#\n\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nSham SAH V T P P\nMLB\n\nC\nSF\n\n E\nT\n\n le\nve\n\nl (\npg\n\n/d\nL)\n\nSAH\n\nL-\nN\n\nA\nM\n\nE\n\n(a)\n\n0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\n\n1\n\nSham SAH V T P P\nMLB\n\nSAH\n\n‚àó\n‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó‚àó‚àó\n\n(B)(A) (C) (D) (E) (F)\n\nL-\nN\n\nA\nM\n\nE\n\nLu\nm\n\nen\n a\n\nre\na \n\nof\n b\n\nas\nila\n\nr\nar\n\nte\nry\n\n(m\nm\n\n3 )\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: Effect of magnesium lithospermate B (MLB) on endothelial NOS levels (a) and cross section of BAs (b). 10mg/kg MLB was\nadministered at 1 hr (prevention protocol, P) and 24 hr (treatment protocol, R) after animals were subjected to SAH.

No mortality and serious\nmorbidity were observed within the experimental groups.\n\nVisual inspection during removal of the brain showed that\nsubarachnoid blood clots had formed and covered the BAs in\nall animals subject to SAH.\n\n3.2. Tissue Morphometry. The internal elastic lamina in the\nbasilar artery of SAH and SAH+vehicle groups showed sub-\nstantial corrugation when compared with that obtained from\nthe controls (Figure 1(b)).

(A) the healthy controls, (B) the vehicle-treated SAH rats,\n(C) SAH rats received 10mg/kg/day MLB treatment, (D) SAH rats received 10mg/kg/day MLB preventive treatment, and SAH rats received\nboth 10mg/kg/day MLB pretreatment and 1mg/kg L-NAME as (E) (upper panel). The ratio of membrane bound to cytoplasm RhoA in the\nSAH group was set at 100% in (a), whereas the expression of ROCK-II (normalized using ùõΩ-actin) was set the same in (b). Data are mean ¬±\nSEM (ùëõ = 9/group). ‚àó,‚àó‚àó,‚àó‚àó‚àóùëÉ < 0.01, versus the vehicle +SAH, MLB and L-NAME groups, respectively.\n\nin the SAH + 10mg/kg/day MLB groups. The cross-sectional\nareas of BAs in the SAH and SAH + vehicle groups were\nsignificantly reduced when compared with the control group\n(0.48 ¬± 0.27, 0.53 ¬± 0.18, and 0.93 ¬± 0.11, resp.). Treatment\nwith MLB significantly attenuated the decrease in both the\nprecondition and reversal groups in previous study.\n\n3.3. Neurological Deficit. Using a modified limb-placing test\n(MLPT) shown previously, both the scores of ambulation to\nassess the sensorimotor incorporation of the both forelimb\nand hindlimb, and placing/stepping reflex as a reflex of\nresponse to tactile and proprioceptive stimulation in the SAH\ngroups were significantly higher than the healthy controls.\nThe sum of scores from these two tests is referred to as\nmotor deficit index (MDI). The values of MDI in the SAH\nand SAH + vehicle groups were 2.88 ¬± 0.32 and 2.70 ¬± 0.35,\nrespectively, comparedwith a score of 0 in the healthy control.\nTreatment with MLB significantly improved the MDI in the\nprevention and reversal groups (Table 1). Likewise, paraplegia\nrate (defined as the percentage of rats with MDI ‚â• 3 in\neach group) was substantially decreased in both the MLB\nprecondition and treatment groups when compared with the\nSAH animals.\n\n3.4. Expressed eNOS Levels in BAs. When compared with the\nhealthy controls, CSF ET-1 levels in the SAH groups were\nsignificantly increased in the pilot study. TreatmentwithMLB\nsignificantly decreased CSF ET-1 in both theMLB prevention\nand reversal groups to levels that were not aside from the\n\nhealthy controls. The analysis of radiolabeled L-citrulline\nshowed higher eNOS protein in the control and both MLB\nprevention and treatment groups. Groups precondition and\ntreatment with MLB tend to increase the expressed eNOS\nprotein in BAs when compared with that in SAH rats (ùëÉ <\n0.01; Figure 1(a)). Furthermore, the effect of decreased ET-1\nand increased eNOS exerted by MLB was reversed by adding\nL-NAME (Figure 1(b)).\n\n3.5. RhoA Translocation and ROCK-II Expression in the\nBAs. Activated rhoA translocated from the cytoplasm to\nmembrane was evaluated.

All groups are equal to those publicized in\nFigure 2.\n\nthe BAs of SAH rats, the level of sGCùõº1 and sGCùõΩ1 was\nsignificantly increased in the MLB pretreatment SAH group\ncompared with the SAH groups, while treatment with MLB\nfailed to reduce sGCùõº1 and sGCùõΩ1 to a significant level when\ncompared with that in the SAH rats. L-NAME decreased the\nexpressions of these two enzymes to levels similar to those of\nthe SAH groups, which was induced by MLB pretreatment\n(Figures 3(a) and 3(b)).\n\nComparative to the reduced sGCùõº1 and sGCùõΩ1 expres-\nsions, the levels of cGMP were significantly decreased in all\nSAH animals. Administration of MLB in both the prevention\nand reversal protocols significantly attenuated the reduction\nof cGMP production in the BAs of the SAH rats (Figure 5).\nThis increased production of cGMP upon MLB treatment\nalso resulted in an increased expression of PKG in the BAs\nof the SAH rats which, if untreated, showed a significant\nreduction in PKG expression when compared with the SAH\ncontrols (Figure 4). Besides, the administration of L-NAME\nshowed to be effective on the reduction of cGMP level similar\nto that of SAH groups.\n\n3.7. Translocated PKCùõø in Cytoplasm to Membrane. Contrary\nto that found with rhoA, activated PKCùõø was translocated\nfrom cytoplasm to membrane. The ratio of membrane to\ncytoplasm PKCùõø expression in the BA of the SAH rats was\nset as a standard reference. Only half of PKCùõøwasmembrane\nbound in normal animals; pretreatment with MLB at 1hr\nafter SAH induced the levels of activted PKCùõø to the normal\ncontrol. The treatment of L-NAME reduced MLB‚Äôs effect on\nthe translocation of activated PKCùõø (Figure 4).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nCerebral vasospasm following spontaneous SAH remains the\nleading factor contributing to the mortality and morbidity\nin patients after aneurysm rupture. Even numerous basic\nand clinical trials conducted, the neurological outcomes for\nSAH patients are still disappointing [5]. Lines of evidence\nindicate that both inflammatory and noninflammatory fac-\ntors are enrolled in the development and maintenance of\ncerebral vasospasm. Various components of the inflamma-\ntion have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of cerebral\nvasospasm, including adhesion molecules [15], cytokines [8],\nimmunoglobulin [8], complement [24, 25], and endothelins\n[26] at both the cellular and molecular basis. Among them,\nET-1, derived fromcerebral arteries endothelial cells, has been\nimplicated as a potent vasoconstrictor in mediating SAH-\ninduced vasospasm. Continuous effort pointed to dissect\nmodules besides SAH induced inflammatory response, NO\nbecomes a critical role to mediate vascular dilatation. In the\nstudy of Deng et al. [27], small nanomolar concentration of\nNO, catalyzed by NO synthase, is produced by endothelial\ncells, which then disperses into vascular smooth muscle\n(VSM) and acts on the NO-sensitive sGCùõº1ùõΩ1 and ùõº2ùõΩ1. The\nactivation of sGC and another enzyme phosphodiesterases\n(PDEs), existed in platelets and astrocytes, is involved in the\nproduction and maintenance of cGMP. Through activating\ncGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), cGMP is able to\nmediate the vascular muscle relaxation. The present study\nshowed that MLB significantly improved the motor function\nindex and lowered the rate of paraplegia in the SAH rats.\nIn addition, treatment with MLB significantly increased the\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 7\n\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n\n2\n\nSham SAH V T P P\n\nMLB\nSAH\n\nPKGùõø (75kD)\n\nùõΩ-Actin (43kD)\n\n‚àó‚àó\n‚àó\n\n#\n\nL-\nN\n\nA\nM\n\nE\n\n(A) (B) (C) (D) (E)\n\nPK\nG\n\n e\nxp\n\nre\nss\n\nio\nn\n\n(f\nol\n\nd \nre\n\nla\ntiv\n\ne \nto\n\n S\nA\n\nH\n g\n\nro\nup\n\n)\n\nFigure 4: Suppressed PKCùõø translocation by MLB in the BAs.\nThe bio-expression of PKCùõø from the cytoplasm to membrane was\ndetermined byWestern blot analysis.

All groups are identical to those shown in the legend of\nFigure 2.\n\nlevels of eNOs, sGCùõº1, and cGMP as well as PKG. The addi-\ntion of NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, decreased the bioexpression\nof activation of sGCùõº1, sGCùõΩ1, cGMP, and PKG. These\nresults suggest that the beneficial effects of MLB in cerebral\nvasospasm after SAH may through additive influence on the\nNO/sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway.\n\nAs described herein, another concept, stated by Brandes\net al. [7], indicated through binding to adenosine A2A\nreceptors, activated NOS was able to increase NO and\nconcomitantly disable the PKCùõø and rhoA/rho kinase-II\npathways in animals subject to SAH. PKCùõø and rhoA as well\nas the expression of rho-kinase were thought to be the main\nfactors contributing to the vascular spastic response along\nwith enhanced components in the sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway.\nTreatment withMLB induced the activatedNOS and normal-\nized the expression of the two vascular regulatory pathways\n[3]. These results consisted with the reports showing that\noxyhemoglobin is a major causative component of blood\nclot for cerebral vasospasm following SAH [26] and that ET-\n1 potentiates the oxyhemoglobin-induced cerebrovascular\nsmoothmuscle contraction via the rhoA/rho kinase and PKC\npathways [28, 29]. In our previous study, MLB can reduce\nCSF ET-1 level through a NO dependent mechanism [3]. In\nthis study, the level of sGCùõº1 and sGCùõΩ1 was reduced in the\ninduction of SAH. The administration of L-NAME reverses\nthe enhanced effect of MLB on sGCùõº1 expression.\n\nIn contrast to the activation of the two aforementioned\nvasoregulatory pathways, SAH resulted in decreased\nexpression of the NO-mediated vasodilatory pathway\n\ncG\nM\n\nP \nle\n\nve\nl (\n\npm\nol\n\n/m\ng \n\npr\not\n\nei\nn)\n\n0\n\n0.01\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.04\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\nSham SAH V T P P\nMLB\n\nSAH\n\n#\n\n‚àó\n‚àó‚àó\n\nL-\nN\n\nA\nM\n\nE\n\nFigure 5: Induced cGMP level by MLB in the BAs.

MLB is an active component\nextracted from the root of Salvia miltiorrhiza (SM).\nAdministration of extract of SM has been shown to attenuate\nvasoactive mediator and impede the production of ET-1\nin patients with congenital heart failure and pulmonary\nhypertension during cardiac surgery [1, 30]. MLB, as the\nmain component, plays a dual role of antioxidant and potent\nfibronectin antagonist to holt platelet aggregation, which is\nable to lessen ischemia associated myocardial damage. In\nthe present study, MLB is proved to be able to improve the\nendothelial function of vascular wall by suppressing the level\nof CSF ET-1 and stimulating the sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway\nvia increased production of NO through the inducible\nNO synthase as seen in the rodent streptozotocin-induced\nrenal injury [2]. In the study of human umbilical vascular\nendothelial cells (HUVECs), cryptotanshinone, a nonpolar\nactive compound similar to MLB, attenuates the level of\nET-1 in the medium as well as the level of TNF-ùõº [30].\nThis compound is able to inhibit bioactivation of TNF-ùõº-\ninduced NF-ùúÖB and is protective to homocysteine-induced\nendothelium dysfunction [1], and in the other studies, a\nhigh dosage cryptotanshinone is able to impede angiotensin\nconverting enzyme (ACE), reduce blood pressure, expand\narteries, enhance microcirculation, and albeit atherosclerotic\nplaque formation [2]. What is more, MLB was reported to\nprotect cerebrum against ischemia reperfusion injury and\nattenuate the infarct area in a focal cerebral occlusion animal\nmodel [1]. Since MLB is composed of a Mg2+ cation and a\ncaffeic acid tetramer, the Mg2+ salt bridged against MLB is\nbelieved to play an adjunct role in blocking excitotoxicity-\ninduced calcium ion influx into smooth muscle cells, which\nare overstimulated by SAH. Mg2+ cation is capable of\nmodulating the L-type calcium channel and augments the\n\n\n\n8 BioMed Research International\n\nvasodilation effect of NO related pathways in the cardiac\nsmooth muscle [22, 31].\n\nIn summary, this study shows that MLB could induce\nthe levels of eNOs, improve the motor function index,\nactivate PKCùõø, sGC/cGMP/PKG pathway, and tend to reduce\nrhoA/rho kinase-II pathway in SAH rats. It is likely that\nthis compound exerts these beneficial effects mainly via its\norganic caffeic acid tetramer component, which exerts the\ndual NO related sGC/cGMP/PKG and a G-protein ligand\nmediated PKCùõø pathways. Reduction of rhoA/ROCK II acti-\nvation through a NO dependent manner also lends evidence\nto its antivasospastic effect. However, the affinity of MLB to\nthe adenosine A2A receptor needed to be clarified later.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nBA: Basilar artery\ncGMP: Cyclic -3\U000f8020,5\U000f8020-guanosine monophosphate\nCSF: Cerebrospinal fluid\nETs: Endothelins\nGTP: Guanosine triphosphate,\nHRP: Horseradish peroxidase\nIEL: Internal elastic lamina\ni.p.: Intraperitoneally\nLCA: Leukocyte common antigen\nMLB: Magnesium Lithospermate B\nNO: Nitric oxide\nPDEs: Phosphodiesterases\nPKG: cGMP-dependent protein kinase\nPBS: Phosphate-buffered saline\nRhoA: Ras homolog gene family, member A\nROCK: RhoA/Rho-kinase\nSAH: Subarachnoid hemorrhage\nsGC-ùõº1, -ùõΩ1: Soluble guanylyl cyclase -ùõº1, -ùõΩ1\nVSM: Vascular smooth muscle.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThe authors of this paper disclose no financial conflict of\ninterests.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work was supported by The National Science Council,\nROC, under Grant NSC99-2314-B-037-060-MY2.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] G.
