However, the identity of its gene product\nhas remained undiscovered. We now show that mgr encodes the\nPrefoldin subunit counterpart of human von Hippel Lindau bind-\ning-protein 1. Depletion of Mgr from cultured cells also leads to\nformation of monopolar and abnormal spindles and centrosome\nloss. These phenotypes are associated with reductions of tubulin\nlevels in both mgr flies and mgr RNAi-treated cultured cells. More-\nover, mgr spindle defects can be phenocopied by depleting β-tu-\nbulin, suggesting Mgr function is required for tubulin stability.\nInstability of β-tubulin in the mgr larval brain is less pronounced\nthan in either mgr testes or in cultured cells. However, expression\nof transgenic β-tubulin in the larval brain leads to increased tubu-\nlin instability, indicating that Prefoldin might only be required\nwhen tubulins are synthesized at high levels. Mgr interacts with\nDrosophila von Hippel Lindau protein (Vhl). Both proteins interact\nwith unpolymerized tubulins, suggesting they cooperate in regu-\nlating tubulin functions. Accordingly, codepletion of Vhl with Mgr\ngives partial rescue of tubulin instability, monopolar spindle for-\nmation, and loss of centrosomes, leading us to propose a require-\nment for Vhl to promote degradation of incorrectly folded tubulin\nin the absence of functional Prefoldin. Thus, Vhl may play a pivotal\nrole: promoting microtubule stabilization when tubulins are cor-\nrectly folded by Prefoldin and tubulin destruction when they are not.\n\nfolding | chaperone | Gim | E3 ubiquitin ligase\n\nEukaryotes have a complex molecular machinery that promotesthe folding and assembly of the actin and tubulin subunits\nof microfilaments and microtubules (MTs). Several protein\ncomplexes and ancillary proteins are involved in assembling\nαβ-tubulin dimers: chaperonin containing tailless protein (CCT),\nthe prefoldin complex, phosducin-like CCT regulatory proteins,\nand five cofactors [reviewed by Lundin et al. (1)]. Prefoldin is\na hexameric protein complex (2) thought to bind to partially\nfolded tubulin and actin molecules from the ribosome (3–5).\nOne component of the prefoldin complex also interacts with\n\nthe tumor suppressor Von Hippel Lindau (Vhl) protein and is\nknown as Von Hippel Lindau binding protein 1 (VBP1) (6). The\nVhl protein is a multifunctional adapter protein that influences\nmultiple transcriptional pathways (for review, see refs. 7 and 8),\nas well as the functions of the collagen IV and fibronectin ex-\ntracellular matrix and MTs. Its best-characterized function is in\na complex with Cullin2 as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that\ntargets hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIF1α) for destruction (9, 10).\nVhl interacts with the CCT to mediate the formation of the Vhl-\nElonginB/C-Cullin2 complex (VBC) (11–15). Therefore, the in-\nteraction between Vhl and the prefoldin complex could be rele-\nvant for the folding of the VBC. However, Vhl also interacts with\ncytoplasmic MTs: in mitosis to influence spindle orientation (16)\nand in interphase to inhibit catastrophe and promote rescue (17,\n18). Such an effect could account for the role of Vhl in stabilizing\n\nMTs in Drosophila follicle cells to maintain the integrity of this\nepithelium (19). Vhl is also required with the GSK-3β protein\nkinase to maintain the stability of the ciliary axoneme (20–22).\nGenetic studies first identified prefoldin in yeast through\n\nmutants that could still fold tubulin but more slowly (hence the\nname GIM: genes involved in microtubule biogenesis) (23). Loss\nof prefoldin in Caenorhabditis elegans is lethal because of a high\ndemand for tubulin in mitotic cells in the embryo (24). In plants,\nprefoldin 6 has been shown to be required for normal MT\ndynamics and organization (25). Knockout of Prefoldin 1 or\nmutation in Prefoldin 5 of mice lead to a variety of defects\ncharacteristic of tubulin functions in cilia or in the CNS (26, 27).\nWe now identify merry-go-round (mgr), a Drosophila gene\n\nidentified over two decades ago, as encoding the prefoldin 3\n(Pfdn3)/VBP1/Gim2 subunit. We show that the characteristic\nmonopolar mitotic spindles of this mutant arise because of di-\nminished levels of tubulin subunits. We also show that mgr\nmutants cannot stabilize tubulin following overexpression of\na tubulin transgene. Finally, our studies show that Mgr can\nphysically interact with Vhl. Moreover, depletion of Vhl rescues\nthe destabilization of tubulin resulting from loss of Mgr. This\nfinding leads us to suggest that the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase\nproperties of Vhl may be required for the degradation of in-\ncorrectly folded tubulin, suggesting that Vhl can also contribute\nto MT dynamics through the regulation of tubulin degradation.\n\nResults\nMgr Is a Subunit of the Highly Conserved Gim Complex/Prefoldin. The\nmgr gene was originally recovered as an X-ray–induced mutant\nresulting in lethality late in development associated with circular\nmitotic figures in larval neuroblasts (28). We confirmed this\nphenotype by immunostaining the CNS to reveal MTs and cen-\ntrosomal antigens in several mutant alleles of mgr and by counting\nproportions of cells at different stages of mitosis (Fig. 1 A and B,\n\nAuthor contributions: N.

The prometaphase-like cells in such\npreparations could have bipolar spindles that may lack one or\nboth centrosomes or monopolar spindles having one or two\n\ncentrosomes at the single pole (Fig. 1A and Fig. S1 A and B).\nThese centrosomes were positive for several known Drosophila\ncentrosomal antigens (Fig. S1B). The mitotic index was elevated\nsome twofold over that in wild-type larval brains and the ratio of\nmetaphase:anaphase figures was elevated by two- to threefold\nover wild-type, depending upon the allelic combination (Fig. 1B).\nTaken together, these data are indicative of a delay in pro-\ngression through the mitotic cycle. Previous phase-contrast\nimages of spermatocytes of mgr mutants suggested the absence\nof meiotic spindles (28). To determine whether this suggestion\nwas correct, we used an antibody recognizing both the β1-tubulin\nisoform and the β2-tubulin male germ-line–specific isoform to\nimmunostain the testes of mgrl4/mgr5 transheterozygotes, a strong\nhypomorphic mutant combination that shows pharate lethality\nbut gives some sterile adults. This process revealed thatmgrl4/mgr5\n\nhad sufficient MTs to permit the premeiotic mitosis (arrowheads\nand magnification in Fig. 1C). However, mature (white dashed\noutlined cysts) but not young primary spermatocyte cysts had\nreduced MTs (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1C) such that the meiotic spin-\ndles were either absent or highly abnormal (Fig. 1D). Western\nblotting with antibodies specific for α-tubulin, β1-tubulin, and β2-\ntubulin (29) showed that the levels of all three tubulins were re-\nduced in mgrl4/mgr5 mutant testes (Fig. 1E), thus accounting for\nthe spindle defects.\nTo understand why reduction in levels of the mgr gene product\n\nmight have such an effect on tubulin levels, we set out to identify\nthe mgr gene product. Small deficiencies [Df(3R)thoR1, Df(3R)\npros235, and Df(3R)pros640] (30), which each fail to complement\nmgr, placed the mgr gene to 86E4 in a region containing 14\npredicted genes (Fig. S2 A and B). Using a combination of RNAi\nto identify mitotic phenotypes resulting from the knockdown of\neach of these genes (Fig. S2 C–F) together with the sequencing\nof candidate genes from chromosomes carrying mgr mutant\nalleles, we identified the predicted gene CG6719 as mgr. We\nconfirmed its identity by showing that lethality of mgrl4/mgr1\n\nmutant, a combination showing pharate lethality, could be res-\ncued with a CG6719 transgene. In addition to the mitotic phe-\nnotype, RNAi-mediated knockdown of mgr led to a reduction of\ncytoplasmic MTs in interphase cells (Fig. S2G).\nSequencing of the mgr mutant alleles revealed them to repre-\n\nsent a variety of deletion, frame-shift, and nonsense mutations\n(Fig. S2H and SI Materials and Methods). In this study we focused\non two mutant alleles:mgrl4, a null mutant having a deletion in the\n5′UTR; and mgr5, which because of a nonsense mutation, pro-\nduces a truncated protein (not detectable by Western blot) and\nadditionally carries a 41-bp deletion in its 3′UTR. Immunostain-\ning on wild-type cells using the anti-Mgr antibody we generated\nshowed that the protein localizes throughout the cytoplasm in\ntestis, brain, and cultured cells at all cell-cycle stages (Fig. S3).\nWestern blots on protein extracts of testes and larval CNS con-\nfirmed that the protein was not detectable in mgrl4/mgr5 mutants\n(Fig. 1F). The sequence of mgr revealed it to encode a subunit of\nthe Gim/prefoldin complex; Mgr shows 37% amino acid identity\nwith its yeast homolog PAC10 and 57% with its human homolog\nVBP1/Pfdn3/Gim2. Thus, the phenotypes of mgr mutants would\nbe consistent with the improper folding and degradation of tubulin\nin the absence of the Prefoldin complex. The greater reductions in\ntubulin levels in the testes than in the CNS would account for the\nstronger phenotype in the spermatocytes (Fig. 1F).\n\nSpindle Abnormalities Result from Tubulin Destabilization Following\nMgr Depletion. To gain further insight into how Mgr depletion\naffects spindle formation, we turned to RNAi in the DMEL-2\nDrosophila cell line (Fig. 2). Transfection with mgr dsRNA for\n6 d increased the proportion of cells with monopolar spindles\nsimilar in appearance to those seen in mgr mutant neuroblasts\nand greatly above the background level of mitotic abnormalities\ntypical of this cell line (Fig. 2 A and B).

Codepletion of BubR1 or\nMad2 and Mgr led to a decrease of abnormal spindles and a\nrestoration of a normal mitotic index compared with mgr RNAi\nalone (Fig. S4). These results suggest that cells are delayed in\nmitotic progression after Mgr depletion in response to the spindle\nassembly check point. To determine whether spindle abnormali-\nties were related to centrosome defects, we counted Dplp+ punc-\ntae in interphase cells after the same period of Mgr depletion.\nThis process revealed a progressive loss of centrosomes from\ncells lagging behind the appearance of spindle defects such that\n40% of cells had no centrosomes by day 12 (Fig. 2 C and D). This\nlag in the loss of centrosomes could be because of either or both\ndefects in centrosome duplication or segregation as a conse-\nquence of the spindle defects. To address whether Mgr depletion\naffected centriole structure, we carried out electron microscopy,\nwhich revealed abnormalities typical of centriole duplication/\nformation defects; 20% of the centrioles were incomplete and\ncomposed of singlet MTs rather than doublets or triplets, as in\ncontrol cells (Fig. 2E).\nImmunoblotting revealed that Mgr depletion led to a reduc-\n\ntion in β-tubulin levels by ∼70% (Fig. 2F), also apparent by\nimmunofluorescence (Fig. S2G). Depletion of the Pfdn4 Pre-\nfoldin subunit also led not only to a similar reduction in β-\ntubulin, but also in Mgr levels, indicating the importance of\ninteractions between subunits of the complex for its stability.\nLevels of γ-tubulin were reduced by ∼50%, whereas actin was\nunaffected (Fig. S5 A and B). To determine whether the spindle\nand centrosome defects resulting from Mgr depletion might re-\nflect the reduction in tubulin levels, we performed partial de-\npletion of β- and γ-tubulin (Fig. 2 G–K and Fig. S5 C–J). DMEL-\n2 cells were treated with varying amounts of β- or γ-tubulin\ndsRNA and assayed for spindle defects and centrosome numbers\nafter 6 d. An increase in monopolar and disorganized spindles\nand in centrosome loss mirrored the extent of β- and γ-tubulin\nknockdown. However, only the β-tubulin knockdown recapitulated\nthe small spindle size observed after mgr RNAi (Fig. S5D).\nMoreover, γ-tubulin knockdown leads to a population of bipolar\nspindles with the centrosomes at one pole only (Fig. S5E), which\nwas not observed after mgr RNAi or partial depletion of β-tu-\nbulin. Thus, the mitotic defects that follow loss of Mgr appear to\nbe largely a consequence of tubulin destabilization. To assess if\nthe structural defects observed on the centrioles after mgr RNAi\nwas a consequence of αβ- or γ-tubulin depletion, we carried out\nelectron microscopy in cells partially depleted for 6 d for β- or\nγ-tubulin. These analyses failed to reveal any centriolar structural\ndefects in either case (Fig. S5 I and J). However, the difficulties in\nassessing the level and timing of β- or γ-tubulin depletion that\nwould be equivalent to that seen following mgr RNAi, together\nwith the restricted numbers of centrioles that can be observed by\nelectron microscopy in such experiments, makes it difficult to\nreach a firm conclusion about the effects on centrioles.\n\nLevels of Free αβ-Tubulin Sensitize Mgr Activity. The above studies\nshowed that MTs of different tissues present different sensitivity\nto reduced Mgr levels (Fig. 1). Moreover, even in mgr testes,\nwhere disruption of the MT network is most pronounced, it only\noccurs once primary spermatocytes have reached a late stage in\ntheir development.

This finding\nsuggests that the onset of synthesis of the β2-tubulin testes spe-\ncific isoform in late spermatogenesis might bring a particular\nrequirement for Mgr (31, 32). If this were the case, we wondered\nwhether increased synthesis of β1-tubulin from a transgene might\ntrigger a stronger requirement for Mgr in larval neuroblasts (Fig.\n3). We found that in mgrl4/mgr5 mutant neuroblasts the level of\nendogenous β-tubulin was only slightly reduced (by 25% com-\npared with wild-type levels). The additional expression of β1-\ntubulin–GFP did not drastically affect endogenous β-tubulin\nlevels if one wild-type copy of mgr was present (mgr5/+;β1-\ntubulin–GFP, a reduction of 15% compared with wild-type).\nHowever, in mgrl4/mgr5 mutants, expression of β1-tubulin–GFP\nleads to a further decrease in levels of endogenous β-tubulin by\n60% compared with wild-type levels (Fig. 3 A and B). There was\nalso a dramatic loss ofMT staining in immunostained preparations\nof the larval CNS of such organisms (Fig. 3C). Taken together,\nthese results suggest that if tubulin levels exceed a certain thresh-\nold, this overproduced tubulin may change the complex balance of\nfolding, causing a synthetically lethal phenotype with mgr.\n\nA 5\n\nm\ngr\n\n5\nm\n\ngr\nl4\n\n;\n;\n\nCtrl\n\nβ-tub\n\nGFP\n\nW\nT m\n\ngr\nl4\n\nm\ngr\n\n5 βtu\nb-\n\nGF\nP\n\nβtu\nb-\n\nGF\nP\n\nβtu\nb-\n\nGF\nP\n\nβtu\nb \n\nGF\nP\n\nm\ngr\n\n+;\n;\n\nC\n\nβtub-GFP;\nmgr5/+\n\nβtub-GFP;\nmgr5/mgrl4\n\nmgr5/mgrl4WT\n\n%\n o\n\nf β\n-t\n\nub\nul\n\nin\n le\n\nve\nls\n\n r\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nto\n\n c\non\n\ntr\nol\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nWT βtub\n-GFP;\n\nmgr5\nmgrl4\n\nmgr5\n+\n\nβtub\n-GFP;\nmgr5\nmgrl4\n\nB\n\nβ-tubulin\n\n148\n\n50\n\nFig. 3.

Several lines of evidence in-\ndicated that Mgr was able to interact with Drosophila Vhl and\nthat both proteins could interact with tubulin monomers and\ndimers. First, beads carrying Maltose binding protein (MBP)-Mgr\nor MBP-Vhl fusion proteins synthesized in bacteria could bind\n35S-labeled Mgr or Vhl synthesized by coupled transcription-\ntranslation in vitro (Fig. 4A). This experiment also indicated that\nboth proteins could undertake self-self interactions. Second,\nboth Mgr and Vhl synthesized in bacteria were able to bind\n35S-labeled β1-tubulin synthesized by coupled transcription-\ntranslation in vitro (Fig. S6 A and B). Conversely β1-tubulin\nsynthesized in bacteria would interact with 35S-labeled Vhl or\nMgr (Fig. S6 C and D). Third, MBP-tagged Mgr or MBP-tagged\nVhl immobilized on beads directly bound αβ-tubulin dimers (Fig.\n4 B and C). Fourth, we were unable to disrupt a complex formed\nbetween bacterially expressed MBP-Vhl and 35S-labeled Mgr by\nadding dimeric αβ-tubulin (Fig. 4D). Instead the Vhl:Mgr com-\nplex also bound αβ-tubulin dimer. However, whereas Drosophila\nVhl, like mammalian Vhl, could interact with MTs (Fig. S6 E and\nF), Mgr could not. This finding suggests that Mgr can interact\nwith free, but not with polymerized, tubulin.\nTo test whether the interaction between Vhl and Mgr played\n\nany part in the control of tubulin degradation, we asked what the\nconsequences would be if Mgr and Vhl were to be codepleted.\nVhl RNAi alone had little effect on the levels of β-tubulin in\ncultured cells (Fig. 4 E and F), confirming the recent finding of\nDuchi and colleagues (19). Moreover, Vhl depletion resulted in\nonly a slight increase in the proportion of mitotic cells with\nmonopolar or disorganized spindles or lacking centrosomes (Fig.\n4 G–J). In contrast, Mgr depletion resulted in a clear decrease in\nβ-tubulin levels, formation of monopolar/disorganized spindles\nin the majority of mitotic cells, and an increase of the number of\ncells without centrosomes. We found all three of these pheno-\ntypes were significantly rescued by the codepletion of Vhl (Fig. 4\nE and J). Thus, the proteolytic destruction of tubulin, which takes\nplace when tubulin cannot be correctly folded by the Prefoldin\nchaperone, requires the function of the Vhl protein.\n\nDiscussion\nThe finding that the Drosophila merry-go-round gene encodes\na subunit of the Prefoldin complex has allowed us to account for\naberrant structure and function of spindles and centrosomes in\ncells depleted of its gene product. The inability to correctly fold\ntubulins in Prefoldin-deficient cells leads to tubulin instability\nand, hence, defects that can be phenocopied by depleting β- or\nγ-tubulin. However, whereas β-tubulin depletion phenocopied all\nof the defects observed, γ-tubulin depletion only recapitulated\nsome of them. The more dramatic phenotypes seen in Mgr-de-\nficient cells expressing high levels of tubulin (primary spermato-\ncytes and neuroblasts expressing a β-tubulin transgene) suggest\nthat the Prefoldin complex is critical to maintain tubulin levels\nabove a certain threshold of tubulin expression. This finding could\nbe a consequence of the impact of an excess of tubulin upon its\ncomplex folding pathway. Interestingly, in mammalian cells, in-\ncreased soluble tubulin, in response to a MT-destabilizing agent,\nleads to the rapid degradation of tubulin (33, 34). In Drosophila,\ntubulins in the testes are the most affected by the absence of\nMgr compared with other tissues. Indeed, it may be of particular\nimportance to regulate tubulin levels at the late stages of\n\nspermatogenesis, where the very large meiotic cells are provided\nwith proportionally large amounts of tubulin that are used in the\nmeiotic spindle but have a major additional purpose: the building\nof the sperm tail. Similarly, in the mouse, the effects of depletion\nor mutation of prefoldin subunits are largely restricted to the\nbrain, where tubulin levels are also very high (26, 27). Whether\nthis tissue specificity is a consequence of tubulin levels will be an\ninteresting question to address. Finally, our demonstration that\nVhl is required for tubulin destruction in the absence of Mgr and\nthe ability of Vhl to interact with tubulin monomers and dimers\nraises the possibility that its role as an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase\ncould come to play in regulating tubulin levels.\nThe idea that Vhl and Prefoldin can cooperate in regulating\n\nprotein stability was also raised by Mousnier et al. (35), who\nidentified the prefoldin subunit VBP1 as a binding partner of the\nHIV-1 viral integrase and suggested this mediated the interaction\nof the integrase with the Cul2-Vhl E3-Ubiquitin ligase. This\nfinding led these authors to suggest a role for prefoldin at a pivotal\npart of the pathway that would determine whether a protein was\npassed on to the CCT chaperonin for folding or to the protea-\nsome for degradation (35). Similarly, we can speculate that pre-\nfoldin as a partner of Vhl may well serve a key role in regulating\nthe equilibrium between tubulin targeted for destruction or for\nfolding and incorporation into MTs. The concentration of as-\nsembly-competent tubulin must be tightly controlled because it\naffects cytoskeletal dynamics. Vhl might contribute to this in-\nfluence by an effect on MT dynamics through interaction with\nMAPs on the MT lattice (17, 18) and by intervening in the reg-\nulation of tubulin folding. There is growing evidence for a critical\nfunction of Vhl in stabilizing cytoplasmic MTs (16, 17) and axo-\nnemal MTs in response to levels of soluble tubulin (36). Re-\nciprocally, MT stability can contribute to regulating levels of\nproteins that are targets of the Cul2-Vhl E3-Ubiquitin ligase, such\nas the HIF proteins, the levels of which fall when their mRNAs\naccumulate in cytoplasmic P-bodies for translational repression\nfollowing MT disruption (37). It will be important in future to\nconsider the roles played by the Prefoldin complex and Vhl to\nunderstand the interrelationships between the machinery regu-\nlating tubulin levels in relation toMT stability, both in normal and\ntumor cells.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nBriefly, testes from pupae and CNS from third-instar larvae were dissected in\nPBS andfixedwithmethanol before proceeding to immunostaining. Cultured\ncells were pre-extracted before fixation with paraformaldehyde and\nimmunostaining. Depletion of proteins in cultured cells was performed by\ntransfection of dsRNA with transfast reagent. Protein extracts were obtained\nafter homogeneization of cells, CNS or testes in lysis buffer. Protein inter-\nactions were tested in vitro using either recombinant commercially available\ntubulins (Cytoskeleton), proteins produced in bacteria, or proteins translated\nin reticulocyte lysate.\n\nA more detailed description of gene constructs, cell culture, immunocy-\ntochemistry, dsRNA, microscopy, protein purification, Western blot analysis,\nin vitro binding assays, fly genetics, and primers list can be found in the SI\nMaterials and Methods and Table S1.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
