The antiphagocytic PGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveil-\nlance and allows unimpeded growth of bacilli in the host. Recently, efforts have been made to include PGA as\na component of anthrax vaccine; however, the innate immune response of PGA itself has been poorly inves-\ntigated. In this study, we characterized the innate immune response elicited by PGA in the human monocytic\ncell line THP-1, which was differentiated into macrophages with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and\nhuman monocyte-derived dendritic cells (hMoDCs). PGA capsules were isolated from the culture supernatant\nof either the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401 or B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a. PGA treatment of\ndifferentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs led to the specific extracellular release of interleukin-1� (IL-1�) in a\ndose-dependent manner. Evaluation of IL-1� processing by Western blotting revealed that cleaved IL-1�\nincreased in THP-1 cells and hMoDCs after PGA treatment. Enhanced processing of IL-1� directly correlated\nwith increased activation of its upstream regulator, caspase-1, also known as IL-1�-converting enzyme (ICE).\nThe extracellular release of IL-1� in response to PGA was ICE dependent, since the administration of an ICE\ninhibitor prior to PGA treatment blocked induction of IL-1�. These results demonstrate that B. anthracis PGA\nelicits IL-1� production through activation of ICE in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs, suggesting\nthe potential for PGA as a therapeutic target for anthrax.\n\nAnthrax is a highly lethal infectious disease caused by the\nspore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis (24). After entering\nthe host, anthrax spores are rapidly exposed and phagocytosed\nby antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as macrophages and\ndendritic cells (DCs), and carried to regional lymph nodes (25,\n27). Normally, at this stage, APCs act as the first line of defense\nagainst microbial pathogens by engulfing and killing infectious\nagents. In addition to macrophages, immature DCs have then\nreported to capture anthrax spores by phagocytosis and mi-\ngrate to lymphoid organs, and the lymph nodes, where they\nliaise with and activate antigen-specific T cells (2). Macro-\nphages and immature DCs both produce numerous modula-\ntors of the inflammatory response to recruit and activate ad-\nditional cells of the immune system, which link to the adaptive\nimmune response (5). During this process, however, anthrax\nspores are able to survive, germinate into vegetative bacilli,\nmultiply, and escape the control of the innate immune system\n(25, 27). The vegetative form of B. anthracis then penetrates\ninto the circulatory system by disrupting these cells, secretes\nhigh levels of exotoxin, and spreads systemically, reaching 108\n\norganisms per ml of blood (20, 25, 27, 39). Because APCs are\n\nused to bypass the host immune system in B. anthracis infec-\ntion, it is important to define the interactions between APCs\nand spore as well as the virulence factors of B. anthracis.\n\nThe major virulence factor of B. anthracis, exotoxin, is com-\nposed of three distinct proteins—protective antigen (PA),\nedema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF)—which are secreted\nseparately as nontoxic monomers (24). The binding of LF or\nEF to PA results in the formation of active lethal toxin (LT) or\nedema toxin, respectively (24). LF is a metalloprotease that\ncleaves most isoforms of mitogen-activated protein kinase ki-\nnase (MAPKK) (15), and EF is a calmodulin-dependent ade-\nnylate cyclase that causes a prolonged increase of cytosolic\ncyclic AMP (22, 31). B. anthracis contains another virulence\nfactor, the capsule, which is composed of poly-�-D-glutamic\nacid (PGA) (24). The weakly immunogenic and antiphagocytic\nPGA capsule disguises the bacilli from immune surveillance in\na similar manner to that of the capsular polysaccharides that\nprotect pathogens such as pneumococci and meningococci (12,\n23). Like other T-cell-independent polysaccharide antigens,\nthe immunogenicity of PGA is enhanced when it is conjugated\nwith other proteins such as PA (4, 35, 38). Recently, oral\nadministration of high-molecular-weight PGA to C57BL/6\nmice revealed natural killer (NK) cell-mediated antitumor ac-\ntivity and gamma interferon (IFN-�) secretion (18), which in-\ndicates a role for PGA in the immune response. However, the\nimmunogenic effect of PGA on APCs, including downstream\neffectors such as cytokines, remains to be elucidated.\n\nIn the present study, we have characterized the innate im-\n\n* Corresponding author.

PGA capsules\nwere isolated from the culture supernatant of either the pXO1-\ncured strain of B. anthracis H9401 (37) or B. licheniformis\nATCC 9945a (35). PGA treatment of differentiated THP-1\ncells and hMoDCs induced significant amount of the proin-\nflammatory cytokine IL-1� in a dose-dependent manner\nthrough the activation of caspase-1, also known as IL-1�-con-\nverting enzyme (ICE). The production of other proinflamma-\ntory cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, and IL-18 was\nnot affected by PGA treatment. These results indicate that\nPGA, as well as exotoxin, involves the regulation of the innate\nimmune response by macrophages and DCs. The present study\nis the first to examine the immunological effects of B. anthracis\nPGA both in vitro using human macrophage cell line and ex\nvivo with hMoDCs.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nCell lines and culture conditions. THP-1, a human monocytic cell line, was\nobtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA). Cells\nwere grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) containing\n10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; HyClone, Logan, UT) and 1% penicillin-strepto-\nmycin (BioSource International, Camarillo, CA) at 37°C in a humidified incu-\nbator containing 5% CO2. Cellular differentiation into the macrophage-like\nphenotype was induced by the addition of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO)\nat a final concentration of 100 nM. After incubation for 72 h, PMA-containing\nmedium was aspirated, and adherent cells were resuspended in fresh culture\nmedium and incubated for an additional 24 h.\n\nGeneration and characterization of hMoDCs from peripheral blood mononu-\nclear cells (PBMC). According to Korea National Institute of Health Guidelines,\nPBMC were prepared by density centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque (Pharmacia,\nUppsala, Sweden) from buffy coats (Korean Red Cross Blood Service). CD14�\n\ncells from PBMC were separated by using MACS magnetic cell sorting (Miltenyi\nBiotec, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Purity of separated monocytes was �90% as de-\ntermined by flow cytometry. Monocytes were cultured for 6 days in RPMI 1640\nsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin,\n20 ng of human IL-4 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA)/ml, and 100 ng of human\ngranulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (BD Biosciences)/ml. Differ-\nentiated hMoDCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and\nstained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies on ice for 30 min to analyze the\nimmunophenotype of DCs. The anti-mouse antibodies used were as follows:\nfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-CD11c, FITC-conjugated\nanti-CD14, FITC-conjugated anti-CD40, FITC-conjugated anti-CD80, FITC-\nconjugated anti-CD83, FITC-conjugated anti-CD86, and FITC-conjugated anti-\nHLA-DR. Mouse FITC-conjugated anti-immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) was used\nas isotypic control. After three washes in PBS, the stained cells were fixed with\n1% paraformaldehyde in PBS until subjected to flow cytometric analysis using a\nFC500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Krefeld, Germany). (See also the\nsupplemental material.)\n\nPurification of PGA. B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a was obtained from the\nATCC and grown in E broth medium (35). PGA was purified from the cell\nculture supernatant as described previously (35). In brief, the highly viscous\nbacterial culture was centrifuged at 4°C (6,500 � g, 20 min) to remove bacteria.\nThe supernatant was collected and precipitated with 3 volumes of ethanol at 4°C\novernight. PGA precipitate was collected by centrifugation and dialyzed against\ndeionized water. PGA solution was acidified to pH 1.5 with 6 M HCl and\nimmediately precipitated with 3 volumes of 1-propanol at �20°C. PGA was\ncollected by centrifugation and washed twice with acetone and once with ethyl\nether. The purified PGA was then dissolved in water, dialyzed extensively, and\nlyophilized. Because of the large size of PGA from B. licheniformis (�500 kDa),\ndirect addition of isolated PGA to THP-1 cell or hMoDC cultures would result\nin an increase in viscosity, which might be undesirable for determining immune\nresponses. Therefore, PGA was degraded to molecular sizes ranging from 15 to\n30 kDa (30-kDa PGA) by using acid hydrolysis. Fragmented PGA was verified by\n1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to be 99% pure (data not shown).\n\nB. anthracis H9401 is a clinical isolate from a Korean cutaneous anthrax\n\npatient (37) and grown in brain heart infusion medium (Difco Laboratories,\nDetroit, MI). B. anthracis H9401 is fully virulent and possesses both pXO1 and\npXO2 plasmids. For the purification of PGA, pXO1 of B. anthracis H9401 was\ncured as described previously (14). The PGA from pXO1 cured strain of B.\nanthracis H9401 was purified from the cell culture supernatant by using the same\nmethod for B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a.\n\nReagents. The ICE inhibitor Z-WEHD-FMK (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,\nMN) was reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide to make a stock solution of 20 mM.\nICE inhibitor was applied 30 min prior to PGA application. Trypan blue staining\nshowed that Z-WEHD-FMK had no effect on THP cell and hMoDC viability\n(data not shown). Antibodies for ICE, IL-1�, and �-actin were obtained from\nCell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-\nrabbit IgG antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West\nGrove, PA).\n\nELISA. IL-1� cytokine levels were determined by using commercial enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems). Culture supernatants\nfrom differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs stimulated with PGA were har-\nvested, and absorbance readings were generated by using a Techan absorbance\nmicroplate reader (Phoenix Research Products, Hayward, CA). Each culture was\nassayed in triplicate and averaged. ELISA results are expressed in pg/ml.\n\nWestern blotting. To produce cell lysates, the cell pellet was resuspended in\n100 �l of 1� lysis buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitor\nmixture (Sigma-Aldrich), followed by incubation on ice for 30 min. The cell\nlysates were clarified by microcentrifugation, and 50 �g of each clarified lysate\nwas loaded on a 10% NuPage gradient gel (Invitrogen). The lysates were elec-\ntrophoretically separated and then transferred to 0.2-�m nitrocellulose mem-\nbranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, CA). Blots were blocked in TBS-T\n(100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5]; 0.9% NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% skim\nmilk for 1 h. Blots were rinsed three times in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 for\n5 min and subsequently incubated with the diluted primary antibodies according\nto the manufacturer’s instructions: rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-1 (1:1,000),\nanti-cleaved IL-1� (1:1,000), and anti-�-actin IgG (1:1,000). Horseradish perox-\nidase-conjugated polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG (1:5,000; Jackson Immunoresearch)\nwas used as the secondary antibody. After three washes with TBS-T, the blots\nwere developed with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford,\nIL) and exposed to X-ray film (Kodak XAR5; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY).\n\nRESULTS\n\nPGA induces specifically IL-1� production in differentiated\nTHP-1 cells and hMoDCs. First, we investigated the effects of\nPGA isolated from culture supernatants of either the pXO1-\ncured strain of B. anthracis or B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a on\ncytokine production in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells. Dif-\nferentiated THP-1 cells were treated for either 24 or 48 h with\nisolated PGA at the concentration of 100 �g/ml, and then\nsupernatants were collected and analyzed for production of a\npanel of proinflammatory cytokines, IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, and\nIL-1�. PGA did not increase extracellular IL-4, IL-6, and IL-18\nlevels produced by differentiated THP-1 cells (data not\nshown). The IL-1� level was, however, increased by treatment\nwith PGA from both sources. The treatment of THP-1 cells\nwith various concentrations of PGA (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100\n�g/ml) for either 24 or 48 h was tested, and this moment\nincreased production of IL-1� in a dose-dependent manner\n(Fig. 1). The extracellular IL-1� level from THP-1 cells treated\nwith PGA from B. anthracis was an average of 4.5-fold greater\nthan the baseline level at the concentration of 100 �g/ml after\n48 h treatment (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the extracellular IL-1�\nlevel from THP-1 cells treated with PGA from B. licheniformis\n9945a was an average of 4.2-fold greater than the baseline level\n(Fig. 1B).\n\nTo test ex vivo relevance of the IL-1� production by PGA\ntreatment in DCs, we studied the effect of PGA on IL-1�\nproduction in hMoDCs. Similarly, the treatment of hMoDCs\nwith various concentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 �g/ml) of\n\n388 CHO ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nPGA for either 24 or 48 h also increased the production of\nIL-1� in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2). The extracellular\nIL-1� level from hMoDCs treated with PGA from B. anthracis\nwas an average of 10.5-fold greater than the baseline level at\nthe concentration of 100 �g/ml after 48 h of treatment (Fig.\n2A). Similarly, the extracellular IL-1� level from hMoDCs\ntreated with PGA from B. licheniformis 9945a was an average\nof 12.5-fold greater than the baseline level (Fig. 2B).\n\nPGA increases the processing of IL-1� through the activa-\ntion of ICE in differentiated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs. IL-1�\nis an potent mediator of inflammation that is responsible for\nvarious effects associated with host responses to microbial in-\nvasion and tissue damage (9, 10). IL-1� is expressed as an\ninactive form (33 kDa), pro-IL-1�, which is processed by the\ncytosolic cysteine protease ICE to generate its active form (17\nkDa) (11, 13). The production of extracellular IL-1� is regu-\nlated at several levels, including posttranslational cleavage of\nits proform and extracellular release of its active form (36). To\nfurther investigate the effect of PGA on IL-1� regulation, the\neffect on IL-1� processing by PGA was studied by Western blot\nanalysis. A commercial antibody that detects the cleaved form\nof IL-1� (17 kDa) was used for Western blotting, with �-actin\nas a control. The level of cleaved IL-1� (17 kDa) started to\nincrease ca. 2 to 3 h after PGA treatment in differentiated\nTHP-1 cells (Fig. 3A and B) and hMoDCs (Fig. 4A and B).\nThese findings indicate that PGA increases the processing of\nthe IL-1� proform both in vitro and ex vivo.\n\nICE is an enzyme that proteolytically cleaves precursor\nforms of the proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1� and\nIL-18 into active mature peptides (8). The resulting cleavage\nproducts of IL-1� and IL-18 are then available for secretion in\ntheir active forms. ICE itself also exists as a proform (p45) and,\nupon activation, the proform of ICE is ultimately cleaved into\ntwo bioactive forms, p20 and p10 (3, 40). Because the amount\nof processed IL-1� increased in response to PGA, we tested\nwhether PGA treatment can also lead to activation of ICE.\nThus, lysates from PGA-treated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs\nwere analyzed by Western blotting. After treatment with PGA,\nthe level of cleaved p20 subunit started to increase rapidly\nwithin ca. 30 to 45 min and decreased to the basal level after\n\n2 h. (Fig. 3C and D and Fig. 4C and D). These results show that\nPGA leads to the activation of ICE.\n\nTo confirm that ICE was required for secretion of IL-1� in\nPGA-treated THP-1 cells and hMoDCs, we used an ICE-\nspecific inhibitor, Z-WEHD-FMK. PGA treatment alone led\nto induction of IL-1� in THP-1 cells and hMoDCs after 48 h of\ntreatment, whereas the administration of Z-WEHD-FMK\nprior to PGA treatment blocked induction of IL-1� in a dose-\ndependent manner (Fig. 3E and F and Fig. 4E and F). At a\ndose of 100 �M, Z-WEHD-FMK blocked nearly 80% of the\nIL-1� induced by 100 �g of PGA/ml. Taken together, with\nWestern blot assays, these results indicate that PGA-induced\nIL-1� secretion occurs via ICE in PMA-differentiated THP-1\ncells and hMoDCs.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA PGA capsule is produced primarily by Bacillus strains but\nis also infrequently produced by other strains, including Staph-\nylococcus epidermidis (19). In general, the biological function\nof the PGA capsule in B. anthracis has been unclear except for\nthe role of sheltering the bacteria from phagocytosis (24). In\nthe case of S. epidermidis, PGA has been reported to efficiently\nshelter the bacteria from key components of the innate host\ndefense (antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil phagocytosis)\nand from high salt concentrations, a common feature of its\nnatural environment, the human skin (19). Recently, oral ad-\nministration of high-molecular-mass PGA (2,000 kDa) isolated\nfrom B. subtilis generated NK cell-mediated anti-tumor activity\nin mice bearing major histocompatibility complex class I-defi-\ncient tumors (18). Nanoparticles made of PGA are being de-\nveloped as an adjuvant for vaccines and are capable of induc-\ning strong cellular and humoral immune responses (41). These\nresults suggest that PGA is able to induce an innate immuno-\nlogical reaction in the host, and thus it may be useful as a novel\nadjuvant for cancer immunotherapy as well as for vaccines for\ninfectious diseases.\n\nThe capsule of B. anthracis is produced as the high-molec-\nular-mass capsule (�100 kDa) which is first polymerized on\nthe bacterial cell surface in vivo and then degraded to the\n\nFIG. 2. Dose-dependent cytokine induction in hMoDCs treated\nwith PGA. hMoDCs were treated with various concentrations (0, 10,\n20, 40, 80, and 100 �g/ml) of PGA from the pXO1-cured strain of B.\nanthracis H9401 (A) or from B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a (B). Extra-\ncellular levels of IL-1� were measured in triplicate by ELISA after 24\nor 48 h of treatment. Each bar represents the average concentration\nfrom triplicate ELISAs. Bars represent the interassay standard devia-\ntions.\n\nFIG. 1. Dose-dependent cytokine induction in THP-1 cells treated\nwith PGA. Differentiated THP-1 cells were treated with various con-\ncentrations (0, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 �g/ml) of PGA from the pXO1-\ncured strain of B. anthracis H9401 (A) or from B. licheniformis ATCC\n9945a (B). Extracellular levels of IL-1� were measured in triplicate by\nELISA after 24 or 48 h of treatment. Each bar represents the average\nconcentration from triplicate ELISAs. Bars represent the interassay\nstandard deviations.\n\nVOL. 78, 2010 B. ANTHRACIS CAPSULE ACTIVATES CASPASE-1 389\n\n\n\nlower-molecular-mass capsule (�14 kDa) (25). The lower-mo-\nlecular-mass capsule is released from the bacterial cell surface\ninto the culture medium and is known to act as a decoy to\nprotect bacteria from complement (25). However, lower-mo-\nlecular-mass PGA was not detected in sera of infected mice,\nwhich might be either due to a failure of depolymerization of\nthe high-molecular-mass form in vivo or due to fast clearance\nfrom serum (20). Although the production of PGA by B. an-\nthracis at each stage of anthrax infection is not thoroughly\nstudied, a high level of serum PGA reaching up to 500 to 1,000\n�g/ml was observed in the later stage of murine infection, in\nwhich actively produced virulence factors of B. anthracis stim-\nulate cytokine production (20, 39). Similar levels of serum\nPGA were observed in rabbit and nonhuman primate models\nof pulmonary anthrax (39). In our experiment, we used PGA\nconcentration up to 100 �g/ml, which might be a five times\nlower than the physiological concentration at the later stage of\ninfection in vivo. Our experimental results strongly suggest that\nthe high concentration of PGA at a later stage of infection will\nbe sufficient to induce IL-1� production through ICE activa-\ntion, which possibly contributes to the induction of septic shock\nin vivo.\n\nLT of B. anthracis has been reported to acts as a positive\nregulator of ICE-dependent IL-1� secretion (6). However, LT\nalso elicits a negative effect on the production of proinflam-\nmatory cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1� and TNF-\t\n(1, 7, 30, 33). LT cleaves MAPKK and blocks p38 MAPK and\n\nNF-\nB activation, resulting in apoptosis of activated macro-\nphages (16, 28, 29). LT-dependent apoptosis is also associated\nwith the activation of various caspases, including ICE (6, 33).\nSelective apoptosis of activated macrophages by LT prevents\nsecretion of cytokines and chemokines that alert the remainder\nof the immune system (28). Thus, anthrax infection can pro-\nceed undetected to the terminal stage. These findings indicate\nthat LT is involved both in the induction and in the prevention\nof proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion through\nICE activation and in the apoptosis of activated macrophages\n(42). Similarly, the activation of ICE is subject to both the\nproinflammatory and the proapoptotic pathways in the anthrax\ninfection (33). The balance among these processes might be\nimportant for the progression of the anthrax infection. Our\nresults show that PGA also functions as an important virulence\nfactor for anthrax infection by activating ICE. In addition,\nPGA might also affect MAPK or other signaling pathways and\ncould thus potentially contribute to the expression of IL-1�\nand/or other cytokines. This possibility as well as the role of\nPGA in the apoptosis of APCs, including activated macro-\nphages, is currently under investigation.\n\nBecause IL-1� is one of the key host modulators of septic\nshock (6), regulation of ICE activation by both anthrax LT and\nPGA at the late stage of infection can be considered as a\npotential target for therapeutic intervention. Actually, al-\nthough anthrax spore-induced ICE-mediated IL-1� produc-\ntion at early stage of infection is required for host defense\n\nFIG. 3. Processing of IL-1�, activation of ICE, and dose-dependent inhibition of IL-1� production by an ICE inhibitor in PGA-treated THP-1\ncells. Cultures of THP-1 cells were treated with a fixed dose of PGA (100 �g/ml) from the pXO1-cured strain of B. anthracis H9401 (A and C)\nor from B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a (B and D) for increasing periods as indicated. Protein lysates generated from these cultures were analyzed\nby Western blotting (50 �g of total protein per lane) for the presence of cleaved IL-1� (17 kDa) (A and B, upper panels), the activated cleavage\nproduct of ICE, p20 (C and D, upper panels), and �-actin (A, B, C, and D, lower panels). Shown are the results of one representative experiment\nfrom three separate experiments. For the inhibitor experiments, cultures of THP-1 cells were pretreated with or without increasing concentrations\nof Z-WEHD-FMK. After 30 min of pretreatment, cultures were treated with or without 100 �g of PGA/ml from the pXO1-cured strain of B.\nanthracis H9401 (E) or from B. licheniformis ATCC 9945a (F) for 48 h. Values represent the average extracellular cytokine concentrations of IL-1�\nmeasured in triplicate by ELISA. Bars indicate the interassay standard deviations.\n\n390 CHO ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nagainst B. anthracis infection (17), LT-induced IL-1� produc-\ntion has been reported to account for lethality of B. anthracis\ninfection (32). ICE inhibitors have already been proposed as a\npotential therapeutic agent for anthrax infection (33). In ad-\ndition to IL-1�, IL-18 (which is also activated by ICE) is an-\nother potential target for therapy of an anthrax infection. In\nour study, the induction of IL-18 secretion by PGA was not,\nhowever, observed. Usually, THP-1 cells are likely to express\nlow levels of pro-IL-18 without lipopolysaccharide priming,\nsimilar to human monocytes and peripheral blood mononu-\nclear cells (21, 26, 34). In our experiment, it was difficult to\ndetect the level of IL-18 induced by PGA both in differentiated\nTHP-1 cells and in hMoDCs. The potential of an ICE inhibitor\nas a target for therapy requires confirmation in vivo using\nanimal models through the examination of the host response to\nanthrax PGA (and/or LT) and to live anthrax spore infection in\nICE�/� compared to wild-type mice.\n\nOur study is the first to show that PGA produced by B.\nanthracis infection is capable of inducing IL-1� production\nthrough activation of ICE both in vitro using THP-1 cells and\nex vivo with hMoDCs. Similarly, the treatment of human\nCD14� monocytes with PGA also increased the production of\nIL-1� with ICE activation (data not shown). A complete un-\nderstanding of how PGA of B. anthracis with or without LT\ninteracts with host against infection at each stage of infection\n\nmay lead to novel therapeutic strategies to improve the effi-\nciency of the immune response to anthrax infection.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank S.
