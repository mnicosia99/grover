In patients with IBD, the\n\nintestinal tight junction (TJ) barrier is compromised as characterized by an increase in intes-\n\ntinal permeability. MMP-9 is elevated in intestinal tissue, serum and stool of patients with\n\nIBD. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that MMP-9 causes an increase in intesti-\n\nnal epithelial TJ permeability and that the MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal permeability\n\nis an important pathogenic factor contributing to the development of intestinal inflammation\n\nin IBD. However, the intracellular mechanisms that mediate the MMP-9 modulation of intes-\n\ntinal barrier function remain unclear.\n\nAims\n\nThe main aim of this study was to further elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in\n\nMMP-9 induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability using Caco-2 monolayers as\n\nan in-vitro model system.\n\nResults\n\nMMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability was associated with activation and cyto-\n\nplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65.

It acts as a selectively permeable barrier, which allows for absorption of\n\nnutrients while preventing harmful luminal contents, such as gut microbes, from crossing the\n\nintestinal epithelium [1, 2]. Defective intestinal tight junction barrier (TJ), manifested by an\n\nincreased intestinal permeability, serves as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of inflamma-\n\ntory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), celiac dis-\n\nease, and other inflammatory conditions of the gut [3, 4]. Clinical studies in IBD patients have\n\nshown the key role of intestinal TJ barrier function in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflamma-\n\ntion and emphasized on the enhancement of intestinal barrier which correlated with sustained\n\nlong-term clinical remission [5, 6].\n\nRecently, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of\n\nintestinal inflammation in IBD [7–9]. MMPs are classified into major subgroups including col-\n\nlagenases (MMP-1, -8, -13, -18), gelatinases (MMP -2, -9), stromelysins (MMP -3, -7, -10, -11,\n\n-19), elastase (MMP -12), and membrane type (MMP -1, -5) [8, 10]. Under normal physiologic\n\nconditions, MMPs are involved in processes including angiogenesis, degradation and remodel-\n\ning of extracellular matrix (ECM), wound repair, and the activation of a wide range of inflam-\n\nmatory cytokines [11, 12]. Dysregulated MMP expression, however, can lead to an exaggerated\n\nand prolonged inflammatory response, leading to chronic inflammation [12, 13]. MMP-9 has\n\nbeen postulated to be proinflammatory and its levels are shown to be markedly elevated in intes-\n\ntinal tissue, serum, and stool of patients with IBD and closely correlate with the disease activity\n\n[14, 15]. Previous studies have shown that in animal models of colitis, MMP-9 was upregulated\n\nand played an important role in the development of intestinal inflammation [16–19]. The dex-\n\ntran sodium sulfate (DSS) and the trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis were\n\ninhibited in MMP deficient mice [17, 20, 21]. Furthermore, it has been shown that MMP-9 inhi-\n\nbition (by a pharmacologic inhibitor or by genetic knock down) prevented the intestinal inflam-\n\nmation in an ileus model of enterocolitis [22]. Together, all previous data suggested the critical\n\nrole of MMP-9 in mediating the development of intestinal inflammation. Little is known about\n\nthe mechanisms of MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal TJ permeability, and even less has\n\nbeen reported on whether MMP-9 has a critical role in the pathogenesis of IBD in relation to\n\nthe TJ barrier function. Our recent studies suggested that MMP-9 at clinically relevant concen-\n\ntrations causes an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability in vitro and in vivo [23]; how-\never, the intracellular mechanisms involved in MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal TJ\n\npermeability remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to further elucidate the intracellular\n\nmechanisms involved in the MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability,\n\nusing a well-established in vitro intestinal epithelial model system consisting of filter-grown\nCaco-2 monolayers. Our results showed that the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ perme-\n\nability was mediated by an activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. Identification of intracellular\nand molecular processes involved in the MMP-9 disruption of intestinal TJ barrier function\n\ncould be important in developing new restorative approaches to enhance the intestinal TJ bar-\n\nrier and subsequently in preventing intestinal inflammation.\n\nPLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-κB activation\n\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 2 / 17\n\nCompeting interests: The authors have declared\n\nthat no competing interests exist.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544\n\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nReagents\n\nDMEM, trypsin, FBS, glutamine, penicillin, streptomycin, PBS and horseradish peroxidase\n\n(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies for Western blot analysis were purchased from Invi-\n\ntrogen Life Technologies (San Francisco, CA). MLCK antibody was obtained from Sigma\n\n(St. Louis, MO). Phospho-NF-κB p65 and IκB-α, NF-κB p65 and β-actin antibodies were pur-\nchased from Santa Cruz (Dallas, TX). SiRNA of NF-κB p65 (RelA), and transfection reagents\nwere obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). The active form of MMP-9 was purchased\n\nfrom Abcam (Cambridge, MA), isolated from stimulated human neutrophil granulocytes,\n\ndisulfide-bridged MMP-9 homodimer. All other chemicals were of reagent grade and were\n\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), VWR (Aurora, CO), or Fisher Scientific\n\n(Pittsburgh, PA).\n\nCell culture\n\nCaco-2 cells (passage 20) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection-ATCC\n\n(Manassas, VA) and maintained at 37˚C in a culture medium composed of DMEM with 4.5\n\nmg/ml glucose, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 U/ml streptomycin, 4 mM glutamine, 25 mM HEPES,\n\nand 10% FBS. The cells were kept at 37˚C in a 5% CO2 environment. For growth on filters,\n\nhigh-density Caco-2 cells (1 X 10\n5\n\ncells) were plated on Transwell filters with 0.4-μm pore\n(Corning, Corning, NY) and monitored regularly by visualization with an inverted microscope\n\nand by epithelial resistance measurements. Caco-2 monolayers were cultured for 3–4 weeks\n\nafter seeding and only Caco-2 cells from passages 21 to 28 were used to maintain consistency.\n\nThe filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers have been used extensively over the last 20 years as in\nvitro model system of functional epithelial barrier [24].\n\nDetermination of epithelial monolayer resistance and paracellular\n\npermeability\n\nThe transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) of the filter-grown Caco-2 intestinal monolayers\n\nwas measured using an epithelial voltohmeter (EVOM; World Precision Instruments, Sara-\n\nsota, FL) as previously reported [23, 25]. Electrical resistance was measured in 5% difference\n\non three consecutive measurements. Caco-2 paracellular permeability was assessed by measur-\n\ning the luminal-to-serosal flux rate of a paracellular probe, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled\n\nFITC dextran 10 kDa (mol wt.: 10,000 g/mol). For determination of mucosal-to-serosal flux\n\nrates, known concentration (25 μg/ml) of FITC dextran 10 kDa was added to the apical solu-\ntion at the beginning of each experiment. After each experimental period, the solution from\n\nthe basolateral chamber was collected and measured in a fluorescence microplate reader (Bio-\n\ntek Flx 800). All flux studies were carried out at 37˚C and filter-grown Caco-2-monolayers\n\nhaving epithelial resistance of 400–550 O�cm\n2\n\nwere used. All of the permeability experiments\n\nwere repeated three to four times in triplicate.\n\nAssessment of protein expression by Western blot analysis\n\nProtein expression from Caco-2 cells was assessed by Western blot analysis, as previously\n\ndescribed [23, 26]. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (50 mM Tris�HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,\n\n500 M NaF, 2 mM EDTA, 100 M vanadate, 100 M PMSF, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml pepstatin A,\n\n40 mM paranitrophenyl phosphate, 1 g/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100) on ice for 30 min.\n\nThe lysates were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge (5417R; Haup-\npauge, NY) to obtain a clear lysate. The supernatant was collected and protein concentration\n\nPLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-κB activation\n\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 3 / 17\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544\n\n\nwas determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Laemmli gel\n\nloading buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to the lysate containing 10–20 μg of protein and boiled at\n100˚C for 7 min, after which proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins from the\n\ngel were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane overnight. The membrane was incubated\n\nfor 2 hrs in blocking solution (5% dry milk in TBS-Tween-20 buffer) and then incubated with\n\nantibody in blocking solution. After a wash in TBS-1% Tween buffer, the membrane was incu-\n\nbated in secondary antibody and developed using enhanced chemi-luminescence reagents on\n\nChemiDoc Gel Imaging (Biorad, Hercules, Ca).\n\nTransfection of siRNA NF-κB p65\nTargeted siRNAs were obtained from Dharmacon (Chicago, IL). Caco-2 monolayers were\n\ntransiently transfected using DharmaFect transfection reagent. Briefly, 5 x 10\n5\n\ncells per filter\n\nwere seeded into a 12-well transwell plate and grown to confluence. Caco-2 monolayers were\n\nthen washed twice with PBS and 0.5 ml of Accell Media was added to the apical compartment\n\nof each filter and 1.5 ml was added to the basolateral compartment of each filter. Five nano-\n\ngrams of the siRNA and 2 μl of DharmaFect reagent were added to the apical media. Non-tar-\nget (NT) siRNA was used as a control. The MMP-9 experiments were carried out 72 hrs after\n\ntransfection. The efficiency of silencing was confirmed by Western blot analysis.\n\nNuclear extracts and ELISA\n\nFilter-grown Caco-2 cells were treated with MMP-9 for 60 minutes. Nuclear and cytoplasmic\n\nfractions were extracted according to the manufacturer’s protocol using Nuclear Extract Kit\n\nfrom ActiveMotif [27]. The NF-κB DNA-binding activity assay was performed using Trans-\nAM ELISA-based kits from Active Motif according to the manufacturer’s protocol. In brief,\n\nthe binding reactions contained 1 pM biotinylated probe (Integrated DNA Technologies) and\n\n5 μg of nuclear extract in complete binding buffer with a total volume of 50 μl. After 30 min of\nincubation, the solution was transferred to an individual well on the plate and incubated for 1\n\nh. Rabbit NF-κB p65 Ab (2 μg/ml) was added to the well to bind NF-κB p65 from the nuclear\nextract. After incubation for 1 hr, NF-κB p65 Ab was removed, and 100 μl of anti-rabbit HRP-\nconjugated IgG were added to the well and incubated for 1 hr. Subsequently, 100 μl of develop-\ning solution was added for 2–10 min, and 100 μl of stop solution were added. The absorbance\nat 450 nm was determined using the SpectraMax 190 (Molecular Devices).\n\nImmunostaining of NF-κB p65\nCellular localization of the transcription factor NF-κB p65 was assessed by an immunofluores-\ncent Ab-labeling technique as previously described [28]. At the end of the experimental period,\n\nfilter-grown Caco-2 monolayers were washed twice in cold PBS and were fixed with methanol\n\nfor 20 min. Then, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS at room tempera-\n\nture for 20 min. The Caco-2 monolayers were then incubated in blocking solution composed\n\nof BSA and normal donkey serum in PBS for 1 hr. Cells were then labeled with primary Abs in\n\nblocking solution overnight at 4˚C. After being washed with PBS, the filters were incubated in\n\nFITC-conjugated secondary Ab for 1 hr at room temperature. Prolong Gold antifade reagent\n\nwith DAPI was used to mount the filters onto the coverslips. Immunostaining of NF-κB p65\nwas visualized and images obtained using a Nikon fluorescence microscope equipped with\n\nAxiocam digital camera in automatic mode. Images were processed with Zen software (Zeiss).\n\nPLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-κB activation\n\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 4 / 17\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544\n\n\nMeasurement of IL-8\n\nCaco-2 monolayers were treated with MMP-9 (400 ng/ml) for 24 hrs in serum-free DMEM\n\nmedium. The culture media was then collected and centrifuged and IL-8 levels were then mea-\n\nsured using Multi-Analyte ELISArray kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nAssessment of apoptosis and cell death\n\nAfter MMP-9 experimental treatment (24 and 48 hrs), Caco-2 cells were trypsinized and\n\nassessed for apoptosis using the Annexin V\nFITC\n\nApoptosis Detection kit II from Biolegend\n\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were digested by 0.25% trypsin-EDTA\n\nsolution, washed twice with cold PBS and stained with Annexin V-PE (5 μL) and 7-amino-\nactinomycin D (7-AAD) (5 μL) in binding buffer. Annexin VFITC was used to stain for the apo-\nptotic cells and 7-AAD was used to stain the necrotic cells. Cells were washed two times with\n\nFACS staining buffer and analyzed by 16-color BD LSR Fortessa. Treated or untreated cells\n\nwere washed and 20,000 cells were re-suspended in 20ul of trypan blue. Cells were counted\n\nunder a microscope by using a cell counting hemocytometer. Trypan blue-stained dead or\n\nnecrotic cells were excluded from the total number of cells.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nResults are expressed as mean ± SD of triplicate measurements. Two-way ANOVA were per-\nformed to determine whether different treatments affect the outcomes. Multiple comparisons\n\nwere conducted following significant ANOVA by using t-tests. All analyses were performed\nusing GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Prism 7.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software). A P value of\n0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance. All experiments were repeated at least three\n\ntimes to ensure reproducibility.\n\nResults\n\nNF-κB requirement in MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability\nIn these experiments, MMP-9 (400 ng/ml) caused a time-dependent drop in Caco-2 trans-epi-\n\nthelial resistance (TER) (Fig 1A), as also shown previously by us [23], MMP-9 caused time-\n\ndependent drop in Caco-2 TER (25%) between 24 and 72 hrs of treatment. Conversely, MMP-9\n\ncaused a correlated increase in Caco-2 permeability to a paracellular marker, dextran 10 kDa\n\n(Fig 1B) starting at 12 hrs of MMP-9 treatment and continued up to 72 hrs of treatment (~\n\nFig 1.

The time course of Caco-2 TER recovery following MMP-9 removal was also examined.\n\nThe removal of MMP-9 after 72 hrs of treatment resulted in recovery of the Caco-2 TER starting\n\nat 24 hrs and continued up to 72 hrs of removal until full recovery was achieved (Fig 1C).\n\nMany studies have reported the important role of NF-κB activation in regulating the intesti-\nnal TJ barrier function in vitro and in vivo [29–36]. In these experiments, we examined the\npossible involvement of NF-κB in MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. MMP-\n9 treatment caused a time-dependent increase in phosphorylated NF-κB p65, peaking at 1 hr\nof treatment and continued up to 4 hrs of treatment (Fig 2A). Since IκB-α degradation is\nrequired for the activation of NF-κB p65, we also examined the effect of MMP-9 on IκB-α deg-\nradation in Caco-2 monolayers. MMP-9 caused a time-dependent degradation of IκB-α, indi-\ncating that MMP-9 caused activation of NF-κB p65 (Fig 2A).\n\nTo further validate the MMP-9 activation of NF-κB p65 in Caco-2 monolayers, we examined\nthe effect of MMP-9 on cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 by measuring NF-\nκB p65 expression in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. In control Caco-2 monolayers, NF-\nκB p65 is expressed mostly in the cytoplasmic fraction, with only minimal amount in the\nnuclear fraction (Fig 2B). MMP-9 treatment resulted in cytoplasmic NF-κB p65 translocation\ninto the nuclear fraction (Fig 2B). MMP-9 induced NF-κB p65 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translo-\ncation was also examined by immunostaining. MMP-9 treatment resulted in a rapid increase in\n\nNF-kB p65 cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation following MMP-9 treatment (1-hr\n\nFig 2.

The oligonucleotide containing a mutated NF-κB-binding (mut) motif did not inhibit the NF-κB p65\nbinding to the DNA probe; however, the addition of wild-type (WT) oligonucleotide containing the consensus NF-κB\np65-binding site as a competitive inhibitor prevented the binding of NF-κB. ��� P< 0.001 vs control.

Next, we examined the effect of MMP-9 on NF-κB p65 activ-\nity by assessing the nuclear binding of NF-κB p65 to its consensus sequence by ELISA-binding\nassay. As shown in Fig 2D, MMP-9 caused a significant and marked increase in NF-κB p65\nbinding to the consensus κB sequence (50-GGGACTTTCC-30) on the oligonucleotide probe,\nsuggesting an increase in NF-κB p65 transcriptional activity in response to MMP-9 in Caco-2\nmonolayers. The specificity of NF-κB p65 binding to the DNA probe was confirmed by adding\na high dose of wild-type oligonucleotide containing the consensus κB-binding site as a competi-\ntive inhibitor for NF-κB p65 binding. As expected, the addition of wild-type oligonucleotide\ninhibited the binding of NF-κB p65 to the DNA probe. In contrast, the mutated NF-κB-binding\nmotif (50-CTCACTTTCC-30) did not inhibit the NF-κB p65 binding (Fig 2D), indicatingthat\nMMP-9-activated and -transclocated NF-κB p65 binds to a κB site on DNA. To further investi-\ngate the requirement of NF-κB p65 in the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 intestinal TJ per-\nmeability, we knocked-down the expression of NF-κB p65 by siRNA transfection in filter-\ngrown Caco-2 monolayers. As shown in Fig 2E, knocking-down NF-κB p65 by siRNA transfec-\ntion resulted in a near-complete silencing of p65 expression, and completely inhibited the\n\nMMP-9 induced increase in NF-κB p65 nuclear binding to its DNA probe (Fig 2F).\n\nNF-κB p65 requirement for MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression\nIn the following studies, we showed that knocking-down NF-κB p65 by siRNA transfection\nprevented the MMP-9 induced drop in Caco-2 TER and increase in dextran 10 kDa flux (Fig\n\n3A and 3B), suggesting a crucial regulatory role of NF-κB p65 in the MMP-9 induced increase\nin Caco-2 intestinal TJ permeability. Furthermore, we examined the effect of MMP-9 treat-\n\nment on NF-kB down-stream target gene IL-8 production in Caco-2 monolayers. Fig 3C\n\nshowed that MMP-9 treatment resulted in a significant increase in IL-8 levels in medium col-\n\nlected from Caco-2 cultures as measured by ELISA. Knocking-down NF-kB p65 by siRNA pre-\n\nvented the MMP_9 induced increase in IL-8 production, suggesting that MMP-9 activation of\n\nNF-kB is associated with an increase in the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8.\n\nRecent studies from our laboratory indicated that the MMP-9-induced increase in intestinal\n\nTJ permeability in vitro and in vivo was mediated by an increase in MLCK protein expression\nand activity [23]. However, the intracellular pathways involved in the MMP-9 regulation of\n\nMLCK gene and protein expression remain unclear. We examined the possibility that the NF-\n\nκB p65 pathway regulates the MMP-9 induced up-regulation of MLCK protein expression.\nMMP-9 caused an increase in Caco-2 MLCK protein expression (Fig 3D), and knocking-\n\ndown NF-κB p65 by siRNA transfection inhibited the MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK\nexpression (Fig 3D). These findings indicated that MMP-9 activation of the NF-κB p65 path-\nway mediated the increase in MLCK expression. It has also been reported that MMP-9 modu-\n\nlation of MLCK expression was mediated by p38 kinase activation [23]. To examine the role of\n\np38 kinase in MMP-9-activation of NF-κB in Caco-2 monolayers, we silenced p38 kinase by\nsiRNA transfection and determined MMP-9 activation of NF-κB p65 in Caco-2 monolayers.\nSiRNA p38 kinase prevented the MMP-9 induced activation/phosphorylation of NF-κB p65\n(Fig 3E), suggesting that NF-κB p65 regulation of MLCK is down-stream of p38 kinase\n\nMMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability is not due to apoptosis\n\nMMP-9 has been previously shown to play controversial pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic roles in\n\ndifferent cell types [37–45]. In the following studies, we examined whether MMP-9 induced dis-\n\nruption of Caco-2 TJ barrier was due to apoptosis or cell death. MMP-9 effect on Caco-2 cell apo-\n\nptosis and necrosis was determined by flow cytometry by labeling the apoptotic cells with\n\nPLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-κB activation\n\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 7 / 17\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544\n\n\nAnnexin V\nFITC\n\nand necrotic cells with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) [46].

As shown in Fig 4, MMP-9 treatment did\n\nnot result in Caco-2 cell apoptosis or necrosis, indicating that the MMP-9 induced increase in\n\nCaco-2 TJ permeability was due to intracellular mechanisms not involving apoptosis or cell death.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDespite its central importance in mediating the inflammatory process in IBD and animal mod-\n\nels of colitis, the intracellular mechanisms of MMP-9 regulation of intestinal TJ barrier\n\nFig 3.

The present study demonstrated the involvement of NF-κB\np65 in MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability. The results showed\n\nthat MMP-9 at a physiologically relevant concentration (400 ng/ml) caused rapid and early\n\nactivation of NF-κB p65 in filter-grown Caco-2 monolayers. Moreover, knocking-down NF-\nκB p65 by siRNA prevented the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. Addi-\ntionally, silencing NF-κB p65 prevented the MMP-9 induced up-regulation of MLCK, a key\nregulator of the intestinal TJ barrier. Moreover, the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 intes-\n\ntinal epithelial TJ permeability was not mediated by apoptosis.\n\nMMP-9 is one of the metalloproteinases family consisting of 25 members [47]. MMP-9 is\n\nunique as its protein expression and activity is undetectable in most healthy intestinal tissues\n\nbut has been shown to be highly expressed in a variety of inflammatory states, including IBD\n\n[48]. It has been shown recently that MMP-9 caused an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ per-\n\nmeability in Caco-2 monolayers [23]; however, the intracellular mechanisms involved have yet\n\nto be delineated. In this study, we examined potential intracellular mechanisms that mediate\n\nthe MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial TJ barrier. Extensive studies have\n\nindicated that the transcription factor NF-κB plays a crucial role in regulating the intestinal TJ\nbarrier function and increased permeability in vitro and in animal models of colitis [30, 33,\n49–53], and inhibition of NF-κB signaling improved symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in mice\n[54, 55]. It is also worth noting that NF-κB activity was found to be increased in patients with\nIBD [56]. Moreover, previous studies have provided compelling evidence on the crucial role\n\nthat the NF-κB signaling pathway plays in mediating the cytokine-induced increase in intesti-\nnal epithelial TJ permeability, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-γ, IL-13 and others [26,\n30, 57–62]. Although there appears to be an existing relationship between NF-κB activity and\ndownstream activation of MMP-9 in intestinal inflammation, there is no clear evidence of\n\nMMP-9 activating NF-κB to modulate the intestinal epithelial TJ barrier. For example, it has\nbeen shown that TNF- α induced the expression of MMP-9 in human bronchial epithelial cells\nand that this induction is mediated via the NF-κB -mediated pathway [63, 64]. Earlier studies\nhave shown that Helicobacter pylori induced activation of NF-κB, leading to MMP-9 gene\ntranscription in gastric epithelial cells [65]. More recent studies have shown that aluminum\n\ncaused an increase in HT-29 intestinal epithelial TJ permeability that was mediated by NF-κB\ninduced up-regulation of MMP-9 [66]. In addition to their roles in increasing intestinal per-\n\nmeability, the current study showed the sequential relationship of MMP-9 activating the\n\ndownstream effector NF-κB to regulate the intestinal epithelial TJ barrier function. MMP-9\ncaused a rapid degradation of IκB-α and phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 subunit in Caco-2\ncells. The requirement of NF-κB p65 in the MMP-9 induced increase in TJ permeability was\ndemonstrated by the silencing of NF-κB p65 expression in Caco-2 cells. NF-κB p65 depletion\nby NF-κB p65 siRNA transfection significantly attenuated the MMP-9-induced increase in\nCaco-2 TJ permeability. In combination, these studies confirmed the requirement of NF-κB in\nmediating the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. Interestingly, our results\n\nshowed that inhibition of NF-κB also prevented the MMP-9 activation of the NF-κB target\ngene IL-8. This finding is consistent with previous reports demonstrating the requirement of\n\nintestinal epithelial MMP-9 in mediating intestinal inflammation through increase secretion\n\nof IL-8 and disruption of intestinal epithelial barrier in a genetically engineered mouse model\n\nthat can overexpress MMP-9 specifically in intestinal epithelial cells [67]. Additional investiga-\n\ntion is needed to delineate the MMP-9 induced mechanisms in vivo, including possible recruit-\nment of immune cells that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines leading to further disruption\n\nof the intestinal epithelial TJ barrier.\n\nMMP-9 had been proposed to trigger apoptosis in many cell types [68–70] and the increase\n\nin apoptosis in intestinal epithelial cells has been postulated to be an important mechanism for\n\nPLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-κB activation\n\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 9 / 17\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544\n\n\nthe leakiness observed in IBD patients [71–73]. Due to these findings, we examined the possi-\n\nbility that the MMP-9 induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability may also be due to an\n\nincrease in cell apoptosis. MMP-9 treatment over different time periods did not induce apo-\n\nptosis or necrosis in Caco-2 cells, suggesting that Caco-2 cell apoptosis or cell death was not a\n\nmechanism mediating the MMP-9-induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. The role of\n\nMMP-9 in apoptosis has been controversial: previous studies have shown that MMP-9 up-reg-\n\nulation had a protective effect in colitis associated cancer (CAC) and induced apoptosis via\n\nactivation of Notch-1 signaling [37, 39]; other studies have shown that knock-out models of\n\nMMP-9 resulted in delayed apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes [74]. It is worth noting\n\nthat apoptosis has been suggested to be an important intracellular mechanism for some cyto-\n\nkine (TNF-α, IFN-γ IL-4, and IL-13)-induced increase in intestinal TJ permeability [51, 75–\n77]. In line with our current studies, NF-κB has been shown to protect cells from death by\ninducing expression of anti-apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-xL, FLICE-like inhibitory pro-\n\ntein, and members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family [78, 79]. In contrast, other reports\n\nhave shown that NF-κB activation in epithelial cells caused an increase in the production of\n\nFig 5. Schematic diagram of intracellular mechanism involved in MMP-9 regulation of Caco-2 TJ barrier function.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544.g005\n\nPLOS ONE MMP-9 regulation of intestinal tight junction barrier via NF-κB activation\n\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544 April 7, 2021 10 / 17\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544.g005\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0249544\n\n\ninflammatory chemokines that recruit immune cells to tissues, thereby initiating an inflamma-\n\ntory amplification cascade and acting in a pro-apoptotic manner [80]. Since we have found\n\nherein that MMP-9 caused an increase in intestinal epithelial TJ permeability in an apoptosis-\n\nindependent manner, future studies identifying the anti-apoptotic proteins involved will be of\n\ngreat insight into understanding the intracellular mechanisms required in MMP-9 induced\n\nincrease in intestinal TJ permeability and barrier defect.\n\nPrevious studies from our laboratory and others have shown the central role of myosin light\n\nchain kinase (MLCK) in regulating the intestinal epithelial TJ permeability [81–84]. MLCK is a\n\nCa\n2+\n\n-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase that has been shown to regulate peri-junc-\n\ntional acto-myosin filaments and mechanical induced opening of the TJ barrier in intestinal epi-\n\nthelial cells. Moreover, previous studies have found that increased MLCK expression activity\n\nstrongly correlated with active inflammation in IBD [85]. MLCK has also been shown to be\n\nessential in mediating the TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-13-induced increase in intestinal epithelial TJ\npermeability in vitro and in vivo [25, 30, 34, 85–88]. In addition, several studies have found a\npathogenic role of MLCK in both intestinal barrier dysfunction and intestinal inflammation in\n\nanimal models of IBD [88–90]. Recently, we showed that MMP-9 induced increase in intestinal\n\nepithelial TJ permeability was also mediated by an increase in MLCK expression in a p38 kinase-\n\ndependent manner in vitro and in vivo and in a DSS-colitis mouse model [23, 91]. However, the\ninvolvement of NF-κB in MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression was not determined. In\nthe current study, we demonstrated the requirement of NF-κB activation in MMP-9-upregula-\ntion of MLCK expression in Caco-2 monolayers. Silencing of the NF-κB p65 subunit prevented\nthe MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression and subsequent increase in intestinal epithe-\n\nlial TJ permeability. Consistent with the current data, previous studies have shown that the NF-\n\nκB signaling pathway mediated the cytokine-induced MLCK activation leading to an MLCK-\ndependent increase in intestinal TJ permeability in vitro and in vivo [30, 88, 92, 93].\n\nIn conclusion, the current results demonstrated for the first time that NF-κB plays a key\nrole in MMP-9 induced increase in MLCK expression and subsequently leads to an increase in\n\nintestinal epithelial TJ permeability in Caco-2 monolayers. An overall schematic diagram of\n\nthe intracellular pathway examined in this study is shown in Fig 5.\n\nSupporting information\n\nS1 Raw images.\n\n(PDF)\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceptualization: Rana Al-Sadi.\n\nData curation: Rana Al-Sadi, Jessica Engers, Mohammad Haque.\n\nFormal analysis: Rana Al-Sadi, Mohammad Haque.\n\nFunding acquisition: Rana Al-Sadi.\n\nInvestigation: Rana Al-Sadi, Thomas Y.
