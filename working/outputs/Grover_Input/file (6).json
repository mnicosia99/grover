The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of UII on NADPH oxidase and glucose\ntransport signaling pathways in the skeletal muscle of mice with T2DM and in C2C12 mouse myotube cells. KK/upj-\nAY/J mice (KK) mice were divided into the following groups: KK group, with saline treatment for 2 weeks; KK+\nurantide group, with daily 30 µg/kg body weight injections over the same time period of urantide, a potent urotensin II\nantagonist peptide; Non-diabetic C57BL/6J mice were used as normal controls. After urantide treatment, mice were\nsubjected to an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, in addition to measurements of the levels of ROS, NADPH\noxidase and the phosphorylated AKT, PKC and ERK. C2C12 cells were incubated with serum-free DMEM for 24\nhours before conducting the experiments, and then administrated with 100 nM UII for 2 hours or 24 hours. Urantide\ntreatment improved glucose tolerance, decreased the translocation of the NADPH subunits p40-phox and p47-phox,\nand increased levels of the phosphorylated PKC, AKT and ERK. In contrast, UII treatment increased ROS production\nand p47-phox and p67-phox translocation, and decreased the phosphorylated AKT, ERK1/2 and p38MAPK;\nApocynin abrogated this effect. In conclusion, UII increased ROS production by NADPH oxidase, leading to the\ninhibition of signaling pathways involving glucose transport, such as AKT/PKC/ERK. Our data imply a role for UII at\nthe molecular level in glucose homeostasis, and possibly in skeletal muscle insulin resistance in T2DM.\n\nCitation: Wang H-X, Wu X-R, Yang H, Yin C-L, Shi L-J, et al.

UII acts by binding to the G protein coupled receptor\nGPR14 (now known as UT) [3], and have been detected in\ncardiac and vascular tissues, and the spinal cord, central\nnervous system, kidney, liver and pancreas [4]. Importantly, UII\nand UT are abundant in the skeletal muscle of mouse and\nmonkey, and radio-ligand binding assay has shown that UT\nbinds [125I]UII with high affinity in skeletal muscle [5]. Besides\nits important role in the cardiovascular system, UII also\nparticipates in metabolic regulation and plays a significant role\nin diabetes and its complications [6,7]. Our previous studies\ndemonstrated that the UII/UT system is up-regulated in the\nskeletal muscle of mice with type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM),\nand UII inhibited insulin-stimulated 2-DG uptake in skeletal\n\nmuscle [8]. We speculated that skeletal muscle-derived UII\nmight be involved as an autocrine/paracrine factor in the\npathogenesis of skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR),\nalthough the mechanism remains unclear.\n\nIR, the major defect of T2DM, is a common\npathophysiological state in which higher than normal\nconcentrations of insulin are required to exert its biological\neffect in target tissues such as the skeletal muscle, adipose\ntissue and liver [9]. Considering the skeletal muscle accounts\nfor the majority of insulin-mediated glucose disposal in the\npost-prandial state, skeletal muscle IR contributes significantly\nto the metabolic derangements seen in T2DM patients. The\nprecise molecular mechanisms responsible for insulin\nresistance remain incompletely understood, however,\nparticularly in skeletal muscle. Emerging data indicated that\noxidative stress due to increased reactive oxygen species\n(ROS) generation and/or compromised antioxidant systems\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76796\n\nhttp://www.nsfc.gov.cn/Portal0/default152.htm\nhttp://www.bjnsf.org\n\n\nrepresents an important factor in the progression of insulin\nresistance [10]. One of the main sources of ROS is NADPH\noxidase (NOX), a multi-protein enzyme complex that uses\nNADPH as a substrate to convert molecular oxygen to ROS.\nComponents of NADPH oxidase complex of phagocytes\ninclude the membrane-bound cytochrome b558, composed of 2\nsubunits, p22-phox and gp91-phox, and 4 cytosolic subunits,\np47-phox, p67-phox, p40-phox, and the small GTP-binding\nprotein, Rac. Moreover, expression of gp91phox, p22phox, p40\nphox, p47phox, and p67phox have been documented in\nskeletal muscle [11]. Wei et al found NADPH oxidase activation\nand ROS generation play an important role in Ang II-induced\ninhibition of insulin signaling in skeletal muscle cells [12]. Given\nthese data, studies are warranted to ascertain whether UII\nmediates skeletal muscle IR by increasing ROS production via\nNADPH oxidase.\n\nIn the present study, we sought to determine whether UII\nantagonism improved glucose tolerance by decreasing the\noxidative state in KK mice, and to investigate the effect of UII\non ROS production and on glucose transport signaling in\nC2C12 mouse myotube cells. We study the effects of UII on\nROS production and NADPH oxidase levels, and its\ninvolvement in the regulation of the AKT/PKC/ERK signaling\npathway.\n\nResults\n\nUrantide improves glucose tolerance in KK mice\nBased on the result of the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance\n\ntest (IGTT), the KK group mice remained hyperglycemic and\nglucose intolerant 2 weeks after saline treatment. In contrast,\nblood glucose was reduced in the KK+Urantide group\ncompared to the KK group (p <0.05). Glycemic excursion was\nnormal in the C57BL/6J control group and Urantide group\n(Figure 1).\n\nUrantide decreases MDA content and increases the\nanti-oxidative effect in KK mice\n\nMalondialdehyde (MDA), a product of membrane lipid\nperoxidation, levels in soleus tissue were significantly higher in\nthe KK group than in the control group. Importantly, MDA levels\nwere significantly lower in the KK+Urantide group than in the\nKK group (Figure 2A).\n\nGSH-Px activity in soleus muscle tissue was significantly\nlower in the KK group than in the control group. In contrast,\nGSH-Px activity was significantly higher in the KK+Urantide\ngroup than in the KK group (Figure 2B).\n\nUrantide decreases the translocation of p40-phox and\np67-phox protein in skeletal muscle in KK mice\n\nThe NADPH oxidase complex, including gp91-phox (NOX2),\np67-phox, p47-phox, p40phox and p22phox (NOX4), is expressed\nin skeletal muscle and regulates the production of H2O2. We\n\nFigure 1.  Effect of urantide on blood glucose levels and area under the curve (AUC) in the glucose tolerance test.  KK mice\nwere administrated urantide (30 µg/kg/day) for 14 days prior to calculation of glucose loading (A) and area under the curve (AUC) of\nchanges in blood glucose levels (B). Control: C57BL/6J mice were treated with saline for 14 days; Urantide: C57BL/6J mice were\ntreated with urantide for 14 days; KK:KK mice were treated with saline for 14 days; KK+Urantide: KK mice were treated with\nurantide for 14 days.

As\nshown in Figure 3, the translocation of p67-phox and p40-phox\nwas significantly higher in the KK group than in the control\ngroup. Conversely, urantide treatment significantly decreased\np67-phox and p40-phox protein translocation. NOX2 and p47-\nphox were not affected.\n\nUrantide increases GLUT4 translocation and the\nphosphorylated PKC, AKT and ERK in skeletal muscle\nin KK mice\n\nWe next investigated GLUT4 translocation, the predominant\nglucose transporter isoform in skeletal muscle. Compared to\nthe control group, GLUT4 translocation was significantly\ndecreased in the KK group, in contrast, urantide significantly\nincreased GLUT4 translocation (Figure 4). We next\ninvestigated the phosphorylation status of protein kinase B\n(PKB)/Akt and protein kinase Cζ (PKCζ), which are well-known\nmetabolic switches, and the phosphorylation status of\nextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 MAPK and p38\nMAPK, which are known mediators in glucose transport.\nCompared to the control group, PKC, AKT and ERK protein\nphosphorylation were significantly lower in the KK group than in\nthe control group, and urantide significantly increased PKC,\nAKT and ERK protein phosphorylation.\n\nUII elevates ROS levels and decreases SOD and GSH-\nPx activity in C2C12 cells\n\nTo investigate whether UII can increase ROS levels, C2C12\ncells were exposed to 100 nM UII for 2 h and stained with DCF.\nA strong increase in fluorescence in stimulated C2C12\ncompared to controls indicated increased ROS levels (Figure\n5A). Alternatively, C2C12 cells were treated with UII for 2 h,\nand ROS levels were measured by DCF fluorescence in a flow\ncytometer (Figure 5B) and in a microplate reader (Figure 5C).\n\nPretreatment with the ROS inhibitor apocynin (200 µmol/L)\nfor 30 min significantly decreased UII induced ROS elevation.\nMoreover, UII treatment increased MDA content (Figure 5D)\nand decreased SOD and GSH-Px activity (Figure 5E).\n\nUII elevates p47-phox and p67-phox protein\ntranslocation in C2C12 cells\n\nWe evaluated the role of NADPH oxidase in response to UII.\nC2C12 was stimulated with 100 nM UII, and the translocation\nof the NADPH oxidase subunits NOX2, p67-phox, p47-phox,\np40phox and p22phox was analyzed by western blot (Figure 6).\nTreatment with UII resulted in robust up-regulation of p47-phox\nand p67-phox protein translocation.\n\nFigure 2.  Effect of urantide on MDA content and GSH-Px activity in soleus muscle in mice.  KK mice were administrated\nurantide (30 µg/kg/day) for 14 days prior to measurement of (A) MDA content by thiobarbituric acid assay and (B) GSH-Px activity\nusing a Glutathione Assay Kit. Control (C57BL mice were treated with saline for 14 days), Urantide (C57BL mice were treated with\nurantide for 14 days), KK (KK mice were treated with saline for 14 days), KK+Urantide (KK mice were treated with urantide for 14\ndays). Control: C57BL/6J mice were treated with saline for 14 days; Urantide: C57BL/6J mice were treated with urantide for 14\ndays; KK:KK mice were treated with saline for 14 days; KK+Urantide: KK mice were treated with urantide for 14 days.

UII decreased\ninsulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation, AKT, ERK and p38\nphosphorylation, but UII alone had no this effect. Pretreatment\nwith apocynin for 30 min abrogated the UII-induced GLUT4\ntranslocation and the phosphorylated forms of AKT, ERK and\nP38MAPK in C2C12 cells (Figure 7).\n\nDiscussion\n\nInsulin resistance in peripheral tissues is an essential\nelement in the pathogenesis of T2DM. The KK mouse, an\nanimal model of T2DM, is characterized by insulin resistance,\nhyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia [13]. In the present study,\nwe demonstrated for the first time that urantide administration\nimproves glucose tolerance in this mouse model. Furthermore,\nurantide treatment decreased the level of MDA, as well as p67-\nphox, p40-phox translocation, and increased the phospho-form\nof AKT, PKC and ERK in the skeletal muscle of the KK mouse.\nThese results indicated that urantide may improve skeletal\nmuscle glucose transport signaling pathways by decreasing\nROS production via NADPH oxidase. In order to further study\n\nthe effect of UII on ROS production and the signaling pathways\ninvolved in glucose transport, we evaluated the effect of UII on\nROS production, NADPH oxidases subunits translocations, and\nAKT/PKC/ERK/P38MAPK phosphorylation in C2C12 cells.\nPretreatment with 100 nM UII increased ROS production,\nNADPH oxidases subunits translocations, and decreased\nAKT/PKC/ERK phosphorylation. Taken together, these data\nsuggest that UII can impair skeletal muscle glucose transport\nsignaling pathways by increasing ROS production, and that\nurantide can ameliorate these effects.\n\nROS plays an important role as signaling molecules in\nskeletal muscle IR, and NADPH oxidases are known to be\ninvolved in the ROS production in skeletal muscle [14,15].\nNADPH oxidases consist of five subunits, including p67-phox,\np47-phox, p40-phox, p22-phox and gp91-phox (NOX2) [16].\nIsabel et al found that UII failed to induce angiogenesis in\nNOX2 knockdown and in NOX2 knockout mice, and that UII\nincreased NOX2 transcription in endothelial cells [17].\nMoreover, it has been shown that UII significantly increases\nROS levels in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and this\nresponse was accompanied by elevated protein levels of the\nNADPH oxidases subunits p22-phox and NOX4 [18]. In\naddition, Chen et al showed that UII increased ROS production\nin cardiac fibroblasts [19]. Our results demonstrated that UII\nsignificantly increased ROS levels in C2C12 cells, and this\neffect was accompanied by elevated protein translocation of\nthe NADPH oxidase subunits p47-phox and p67-phox. These\nfindings demonstrate for the first time that UII increases ROS\n\nFigure 3.  Effect of urantide on NADPH oxidase subunit expression in soleus muscle in mice.  KK mice were administrated\nurantide (30 µg/kg/day) for 14 days prior to western blot analysis with antibodies against NOX2, p67-phox, p47-phox, p40phox and\np22phox. Equal loading was confirmed by reprobing the membranes with GAPDH antibody. Control: C57BL/6J mice were treated with\nsaline for 14 days; Urantide: C57BL/6J mice were treated with urantide for 14 days; KK:KK mice were treated with saline for 14\ndays; KK+Urantide: KK mice were treated with urantide for 14 days. Data are presented as the relative increase compared with\ncontrol (100%; n=3, *P<0.05 vs control; # P<0.05 vs KK group).\ndoi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0076796.g003\n\nUII Inhibits Skeletal Muscle Glucose Delivery\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76796\n\n\n\nproduction and NADPH oxidases subunits translocations in\nC2C12 cells.\n\nGlucose transport is mediated by insulin receptor substrate-1\n(IRS-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(PI3-kinase), and other\nsignaling molecules, and down stream substrates activated by\nPI-3-kinase include protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt and protein\nkinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ) [20]. Treatment of C2C12 cells with UII\nsignificantly decreased levels of GLUT4 translocation and\nphospho-AKT activated by insulin, and apocynin reversed\nthese effects. We also determined that UII decreased\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, which are known\nmediators of glucose transport [21], and that apocynin\nimproved these effects. However, treatment of C2C12 cells\nwith UII had no effect on phospho-AKT, ERK and p38 MAPK\nlevels, maybe because C2C12 cell is different from vascular\nsmooth muscle cell. Collectively, these results demonstrated\nthat UII impaired skeletal muscle glucose transport signaling\npathways partly via a mechanism involving ROS production.\n\nIn this study, we found some effects of urantide in vivo are\ndifferent from those of UII in vitro. For example, p-PKC was\nincreased by urantide in vivo but it was not changed by UII in\n\nvitro, however, p38MAPK was not changed in vivo, whereas it\nwas decreased by UII. A close relationship between chronic\ninflammation and skeletal muscle insulin resistance had been\nestablished [10], so the reasons for these differences may be\ndue to the role of inflammatory cytokine. Thus it should further\ndiscuss if these proteins are also phosphorylated by\ninflammatory cytokines.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn the present study, we have shown for the first time that UII\nstimulates NADPH oxidases subunits translocation, enhances\nthe levels of ROS and inhibits phosphorylation of AKT, PKC,\nERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Our results suggest that UII, as an\nautocrine/paracrine factor derived from skeletal muscle, affects\nglucose homeostasis by increasing ROS production, and may\nbe involved in the incidence and development of diabetes.\n\nFigure 4.

Briefly, C2C12 cells were incorporated with\nDCF-DA for 30 min and washed with PBS three times.\nFluorescent images in 24 well plates were immediately\nvisualized with a microscope (Olympus DX-63, Japan). ROS\nlevels were determined in 96 well plates by measuring the\nfluorescence strength with a BioTek Synergy 2 microplate\nreader (Winooski, VT, USA). The intensity of the fluorescence\nwas expressed as arbitrary units per microgram of proteins.\nThe intensity of fluorescence in 6 wells plate was analyzed by\nflow cytometry.\n\nSoleus muscle tissue homogenates were obtained from\nfrozen tissue in cold physiologic saline. Homogenates were\nthen centrifuged at 3,000 g for 15 min at 4°C, and the protein\nconcentrations of the supernatants were determined using a\nBCA Protein Assay Kit (BioTeke Corporation, China). The total\nactivities of SOD (T-SOD) and GSH-Px, as well as the\nmalondialdehyde (MDA) levels, were determined using\ncolorimetric assays with commercial kits (Cat NO: A001-1,\nA005, A003-1, Nanjing Jiancheng Biotechnology Institute,\nChina). The T-SOD activity was measured using a colorimetric\nassay at 560 nm, and the results are presented as U per\nmilligram of protein in the tissue. The GSH-Px activity was\ndetermined as a function of the rate of GSH consumption in a\nreaction in which GSH is converted to GSSG at the same time\nas H2O2 is reduced to H2O. MDA levels were determined using\na spectrophotometer at 532 nm to monitor the reaction with 2-\nthiobarbituric acid (TBA). The results are presented as nmol\nper milligram of tissue protein.\n\nImmunoblotting\nProtein samples were prepared from C2C12 cells and soleus\n\nmuscle tissue, and western blot analysis was performed as\ndescribed [24]. In total, 50µg protein was loaded on SDS-\nPAGE gels, transferred to PVDF membrane and incubated with\nprimary antibodies Anti-AKT (1:1000), anti-phospho-AKT\n(1:800), anti-PKC (1:1000), anti-phospho-PKC (1:800), anti-\nERK1/2(1:1000), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (1:800), anti-gp91-phox\n(1:500), anti-p67-phox (1:500), anti-p47-phox (1:500), anti-p40-\nphox (1:500), anti-p22-phox (1:500) or GLUT4 (1:200). Blots\nwere developed by use of a chemiluminescent system, and\ndensitometry analysis was carried out using a Gel-pro 4.5\nAnalyzer (Media Cybernetics).\n\nNADPH oxidase and GLUT4 translocation\nThe plasma Membrance-enriched fractions isolated by\n\ndifferential centrifugation and further centrifuged at 100,000×g.\nPellets containing the plasma membrane (PM) fractions were\nresuspended in homogenization buffer and analyzed by\nWestern blot analysis using antibodies to NADPH oxidase and\nGLUT4. We have verified PM enriched fractions by noting\nrobust Na+-K+-ATPase α-subunit expression by Western blot\nand by confirming negligible citrate synthase (mitochondria\nactivities) (data not shown).\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll values are expressed as the mean ± SD and were\n\nanalyzed using SPSS 11.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\nDifferences between groups were assessed by one-way\nANOVA or two-way ANOVA, and Bonferroni’s test was used for\nmultiple comparisons. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered\nsignificant.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: HXW XJW.\nPerformed the experiments: HXW XRW HY XJW CLY LJS.\nAnalyzed the data: HXW CLY LJS.
