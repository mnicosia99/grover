The aim of this study was to investigate the \neffects of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and matrix \nmetalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) on alveolar-capillary barrier \ndisruption and lung edema in rat models of severe acute \npancreatitis-associated lung injury (PALI). A total of 40 male \nSprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham \nsurgery group (n=10) and three PALI groups, in which acute \npancreatitis was induced by the retrograde infusion of 5% \nsodium taurocholate (1 ml/kg). The PALI groups were as \nfollows: i) Untreated PALI group (n=10); ii) 2-methoxyestra-\ndiol (2ME2) group (5 mg/kg body mass; n=10); and iii) 2ME2 \ngroup (15 mg/kg body mass; n=10). In the two 2ME2 groups, \nthe HIF-1α inhibitor 2ME2 was administered intraperitoneally \n1 h after the induction of AP. The severity of the pancreatitis \nwas evaluated by the serum amylase levels and pathology. \nThe severity of the lung injury was evaluated by the wet/dry \nratio, blood gas analysis and pathology. The alveolar-capillary \nbarrier disruption was assessed by Evans blue dye extravasa-\ntion. The protein and mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α \nand MMP-9 were studied using enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assays (ELISAs), western blot analysis and reverse \ntranscription-polymerase chain reaction. The active tumor \nnecrosis factor-α levels were measured using an ELISA. The \nHIF-1α inhibitor 2ME2 attenuated the severity of the pancre-\natitis and PALI, while the lung edema and alveolar-capillary \n\nbarrier disruption were significantly ameliorated compared \nwith those in the untreated PALI group. Administration of \nthe higher dose of 2ME2 significantly suppressed the protein \nexpression of MMP-9 in the lung tissues. The results indicate \nthat HIF-1α has a major function in alveolar-capillary barrier \ndisruption and lung edema in PALI via a molecular pathway \ncascade involving MMP-9. Inhibition of HIF-1α by 2ME2 \nattenuates alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and lung \nedema. Pharmacological blockade of this pathway in patients \nwith PALI may provide a novel therapeutic strategy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAcute pancreatitis (AP) is an inflammatory disorder in which \na complex cascade of immunological events develops, which \naffects the pathogenesis and clinical course of the disease, \nvarying from a mild, self-limiting, transient illness to a severe, \nfatal outcome (1). Severe AP is characterized by pancreatic \ntissue necrosis, as well as complications including systemic \ninflammatory response syndrome and multiple organ dysfunc-\ntion syndrome. Of the total number of patient mortalities due \nto severe AP, >50% are ascribed to acute lung injury in the \nearly stage (2), also known as pancreatitis-associated lung \ninjury (PALI).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that pulmonary \nedema following PALI causes pulmonary swelling, which \nconsequently produces secondary microvascular leakage, \nalveolar-capillary barrier disruption, and even alveolar damage \nand mortality (3-5). In severe PALI, pulmonary edema poses a \ncritical clinical problem due to its association with acute respi-\nratory function failure (6). Despite the fact that there have been \nsignificant advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis \nof alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and lung edema of \nPALI, as well as the availability of existing PALI treatments \nthat attenuate the aforementioned derangements, the molec-\nular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain poorly \nunderstood. The lack of effective drugs to ameliorate the \ninitiation and progression of PALI-induced alveolar-capillary \nbarrier disruption and lung edema has led to increased interest \n\nEffects of hypoxia‑inducible factor‑1α and matrix \nmetalloproteinase‑9 on alveolar‑capillary barrier \ndisruption and lung edema in rat models of severe \n\nacute pancreatitis‑associated lung injury\nBING QI1-2,  HAI-LONG CHEN2,  DONG SHANG2,  YING DONG3,  GUI-XIN ZHANG2  and  LEI YU1\n\n1Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116044; 2Department of Acute Abdominal Surgery, First Affiliated \nHospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116011; 3Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, \n\nThe Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning 116021, P.R.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the \nexpression levels of MMP-9 in lung tissues of PALI model \nrats are markedly increased compared with those in healthy \nrat lungs (13). The proteolytic cleavage function of MMP-9 \nresults in disruption of the alveolar-capillary barrier and \nlung edema (8). When the integrity of the alveolar-capillary \nbarrier is compromised, vessel permeability increases and \nthe alveolar-capillary barrier is no longer able to regulate the \npassage of molecules between the interstitial and lung paren-\nchyma. This type of alveolar-capillary barrier dysregulation \nleads to an increase in the amount of water in the extracellular \nspaces of the lung tissue, namely, edema. In numerous types \nof lung pathologies, including PALI, the levels of MMP-9 are \nmarkedly upregulated. Thus, MMP-9 is considered to partici-\npate in the formation and progression of alveolar-capillary \nbarrier disruption and lung edema (7,8). However, the \nmolecular cascade leading to the upregulation of the levels \nof MMP-9 following the development of PALI has not been \nelucidated clearly.\n\nHypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a highly conserved \ntranscription factor that is present in almost all types of \ncell; it is strictly regulated by O2 availability. HIF-1 exists \nas a heterodimer consisting of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α \n(HIF-1α) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1β (HIF-1β) subunits. \nHIF-1β is ubiquitously expressed, whereas HIF-1α is \nobserved at low levels under normoxic conditions (14). \nHIF-1α, an upstream transcription factor induced by hypoxia, \nregulates the subsequent expression of numerous types of \nproteins in response to the various pathophysiological condi-\ntions induced by hypoxia (4,15). Although previous studies \nhave shown that the levels of HIF-1α are upregulated in \nAP (16,17), a study has also reported that HIF-1α is associated \nwith augmented pulmonary vascular barrier disruption (18). \nHowever, the potential role of HIF-1α in lung tissue injury \nor restoration following the development of PALI remains \nunclear. Thus, whether HIF-1α contributes to the formation \nof alveolar-capillary disruption and lung edema by regulating \nthe expression of MMP‑9 in PALI remains to be clarified. \nThe effects of HIF-1α following PALI also require further \nelucidation.\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to determine \nwhether a molecular cascade involving HIF-1α and MMP-9 \nis causally associated with alveolar-capillary disruption and \nlung edema formation in a rodent model of PALI. This study \nfurther sought to provide novel data that may support potential \n\ntherapeutic targets within this cascade for the alleviation of \nalveolar-capillary disruption and lung edema in PALI.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nAnimals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, 180-220 g in weight, \nwere supplied by the Experimental Animal Center of Dalian \nMedical University (Dalian, China). The animals fasted over-\nnight prior to the experiment, with water provided ad libitum. \nThis study was conducted in strict accordance with the recom-\nmendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory \nAnimals of the National Institutes of Health (1st edition, \npublished in 1996). The animal use protocol was reviewed and \napproved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee \nof Dalian Medical University.\n\nExperimental design. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats \nwere randomly divided into the sham surgery group (control \ngroup, n=10), in which the rats only underwent sham surgery, \nand three PALI groups (n=10 in each group), in which AP was \ninduced by retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate \n(1 ml/kg). The PALI groups were as follows: i) Untreated \nPALI group; ii) animals treated with the HIF-1α inhibitor, \n2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2; 5 mg/kg body mass; Selleck \nChemicals, Houston, TX, USA); and iii) animals treated \nwith 2ME2 (15 mg/kg body mass). 2ME2 was administered \nintraperitoneally 1 h after the induction of AP. All rats were \nsacrificed by femoral venous puncture 24 h after the induction \nof AP. Blood was immediately extracted from the abdominal \naorta of the rats for blood gas analysis. Both lung tissues were \nalso immediately collected and put into a freezing tube, which \nwas then placed in liquid nitrogen and transferred to a refrig-\nerator at -80˚C. The frozen lung tissues were used for RT-PCR \nand Western blot evaluation.\n\nInduction of AP. AP was induced in 30 of the rats based on \na previously described method (5), with minor modifications. \nMidline sterile laparotomy was performed under anesthesia \nwith 10% chloral hydrate (Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagent \nCo., Ltd., Tianjin, China) at a dose of 3 ml/kg by intra-\nperitoneal injection. Sodium taurocholate (≤5%; 1 ml/kg; \nSigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was retrogradely infused \ninto the distal end of the bile-pancreatic duct. The proximal \nbile duct was temporarily occluded at the hepatic portal by a \nvascular clamp for 5 min. Subsequently, the vascular clamp \nwas removed and the duodenal and abdominal wounds were \nclosed. The 10 rats in the sham surgery group only underwent \na laparotomy. \n\nSerum amylase. In total, 10 rats were sacrificed to test the \nserum amylase. Serum was harvested from the collected \nblood by centrifugation using a high speed freezing centrifuge \nat 1,006 x g for 10 min. The serum was stored at ‑80˚C prior \nto evaluation of the serum amylase levels using an auto-\nmatic chemistry analyzer (Vitros 3600; Johnson & Johnson, \nRochester, NY, USA).\n\nWet/dry ratio. In total, 10 rats were sacrificed to test the wet/dry \nratio. The magnitude of the pulmonary edema in the rats was \ndetermined by calculating the wet/dry ratio according to the \n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE  8:  899-906,  2014 901\n\nfollowing formula (7): Wet/dry ratio (%) = [(wet weight - dry \nweight)/dry weight] x 100, where the wet weight is the initial \nleft lung weight and the dry weight is the weight of the lung \nfollowing incubation at 72˚C for 24 h.\n\nEvans blue dye extravasation. In total, 10 rats were sacrificed \nto test the Evans blue dye extravasation. The pulmonary \nmicrovascular permeability of the rats was measured \nusing a modification of the Evans blue dye (Sigma‑Aldrich) \nextravasation technique as previously described (19). Briefly, \nthe rats were injected with 5% Evans blue dye through the \ninternal jugular vein at a dose of 2 mg/100 g 30 min prior \nto sacrifice. Immediately after sacrifice, the lung tissues were \ncollected and washed with normal saline. The lung tissues \nwere then weighed after drying with filter paper. The Evans \nblue dye was extracted following homogenization in 1 ml \ndeionized formamide and pulverization using an Ultrasonic \nLiquid Processor. A further 3 ml deionized formamide and \n1 ml deionized formamide was added, and the mixture was \nincubated at 37˚C for 48 h. The supernatant was separated by \ncentrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min.  The quantity of dye \nextracted was determined spectrophotometrically at 620 nm \nand calculated from a standard curve established with known \namounts of Evans blue dye. Results are expressed as mg of dye \nper g of wet tissue.\n\nELISA. A total of 10 rats was sacrificed to test the ELISA. \nThe levels of HIF-1α, MMP-9 and tumor necrosis factor-α \n(TNF-α) in the serum were measured using commercially \navailable ELISA kits (Shanghai Westang Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., \nShanghai, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nReverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR). \nTotal RNA was extracted from the frozen tissue of the right \nlower lung lobe with chloroform and RNAiso Plus reagent \n[Takara Biotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd., Dalian, China] \naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. The lungs were \nextracted from 8 rats. The total RNA was solubilized in \nRNase-free water and quantified by NanoVue spectropho-\ntometric measurement of the nucleic acids and proteins (GE \nHealthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). The purity of the RNA was \nassured by examining the optical density (OD)260/OD280 \nratio. The RNA (2 µl) was reverse transcribed to complemen-\ntary DNA using an RNA PCR kit (AMV) Ver. 3.0 [Takara \nBiotechnology (Dalian) Co., Ltd.] according to the manufac-\nturer's instructions. The PCR was performed using the primers \npresented in Table I. The amplification steps were as follows: \nInitial denaturation at 95˚C for 3 min, 94˚C denaturation for \n\n30 sec, 51˚C annealing for 30 sec and 72˚C extension for \n45 sec for 40 cycles, for HIF-1α; initial denaturation at 95˚C \nfor 3 min, 94˚C denaturation for 30 sec, 60˚C annealing for \n30 sec and 72˚C extension for 45 sec for 40 cycles, for MMP-9; \nand initial denaturation at 95˚C for 3 min, 94˚C denaturation \nfor 30 sec, 52˚C annealing for 30 sec and 72˚C extension for \n45 sec for 40 cycles, for β-actin. The PCR products (~5 µl) \nwere electrophoresed using 1.7% agarose gel (Biowest, \nBarcelona, Spain) containing ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/ml; \nBiosharp Biotech Co., Hefei, China). The gels were visualized \nunder UV light, and images of the gels were captured. The \nband intensities were determined by the ODs with individual \nPCR product/β-actin ratios.\n\nWestern blot analysis. A total of 8 rats were used to extract the \nlungs. The frozen lung tissues were mechanically processed \nin lysis buffer (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, \nChina) with protease inhibitors, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluo-\nride and phosphatase inhibitor on ice using a protein extraction \nkit (Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.) according to the \nmanufacturer's instructions. The total protein concentration \nwas determined by NanoVue spectrophotometric measure-\nment of the nucleic acids and proteins (GE Healthcare). Equal \nvolumes (20 µl) of tissue extracts normalized by protein \nconcentration were separated by electrophoresis through \n10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad \nLaboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to \npolyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were \nblocked with 5% evaporated skimmed milk (BD Biosciences, \nSparks, MD, USA) and then separately incubated with rabbit \nmonoclonal antibody against HIF-1α (1:1,000; Epitomics \nInc., Burlingame, CA, USA) and rabbit monoclonal antibody \nagainst MMP-9 (1:1,000; Epitomics Inc.). Equal loading of \nprotein was confirmed and adjusted by β-actin monoclonal \nantibody (1:1,000; Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Ltd., \nWuhan, China). These antibodies were incubated with the \nmembrane at room temperature for 2 h. Following three wash \ncycles in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, the membrane \nwas incubated with secondary antibody peroxidase-conjugated \nAffiniPure goat anti‑rabbit IgG (1:5,000; ZSGB‑BIO, Beijing, \nChina). To quantify the relative expression levels of the target \nprotein, blot images were captured and analyzed using an \nimage analysis program (BioSpectrum AC 410; UVP, LCC, \nUpland, CA, USA). The expression intensities of the proteins \nfrom the different groups were statistically compared.\n\nHistological examination. In total 8 rats were used to extract \nthe lungs.

Paraffin sections (4 µm thick) were \nstained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for examination \nby light microscopy (model TS100, Nikon, Japan). A scoring \nsystem to grade the degree of lung and pancreatic injury was \nemployed (20,21). In this system, the lung injury was assessed \nfrom the degree of edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and \nbleeding, each of which was scored on a scale of 0-3, and the \npancreatic injury was assessed from the degree of edema, \ninflammation, vacuolization and necrosis, each of which was \nscored on a scale of 0-4. The grading was performed by a \nblinded pathologist. The injury scores were calculated by \nadding the individual scores for each category.\n\nStatistical analysis. All data are presented as the mean ± stan-\ndard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS \nsoftware for Windows, version 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, \nUSA). The differences among multiple groups were assessed \nusing χ2 analysis with P<0.05 considered to indicate a statisti-\ncally significant difference.\n\nResults\n\nGeneral information. Compared with those of the control \ngroup, the levels of serum amylase, PaCO2 and the wet/dry \nratio increased and PaO2 decreased in the untreated PALI \ngroup. Following the administration of the HIF-1α inhibitor, \nthe levels of serum amylase, PaCO2 and the wet/dry ratio \ndecreased, whereas the PaO2 increased, compared with those \nin the untreated PALI group. Furthermore, the effect of the \nlarger dose of the HIF-1α inhibitor was stronger than that of \nthe smaller dose (Table II).\n\nLung permeability. The rats in the untreated PALI group \nshowed a significant increase in the microvascular capillary \npermeability of the lung compared with that of the sham surgery \ngroup. Following the administration of the HIF-1α inhibitor \n2ME2 (5 mg/kg), the capillary leakage was reduced significantly \ncompared with that of the untreated PALI group. Compared \nwith that of the PALI + 2ME2 (5 mg/kg) group, the blue dye \naccumulation in the lung parenchyma of the PALI + 2ME2 \n(15 mg/kg) group was significantly reduced (Fig. 1A).\n\nLevels of active HIF‑1α, MMP‑9 and TNF‑α. For the quan-\ntitative determination of the active levels of HIF-1α, MMP-9 \n\nand TNF-α in the serum, a fluorescence ELISA designed \nto measure the HIF-1α, MMP-9 and TNF-α activity levels \nwas used. The results showed that compared with those of \nthe control group, the levels of HIF-1α, MMP-9 and TNF-α \nincreased in the untreated PALI group. Following the admin-\nistration of the HIF-1α inhibitor, the levels of HIF-1α, MMP-9 \nand TNF-α decreased compared with those of the untreated \nPALI group. Furthermore, the effect of the larger dose of the \nHIF-1α inhibitor was stronger than that of the smaller dose \n(Fig. 1B-D).\n\nHIF‑1α and MMP‑9 mRNA expression levels. The RT-PCR \nshowed that the mRNA expression levels of HIF-1α and \nMMP‑9 were upregulated significantly in the untreated PALI \ngroup compared with those in the control group. However, the \nHIF-1α and MMP-9 mRNA levels in the lung tissues did not \nexhibit significant differences between the untreated PALI \ngroup and the two 2ME2 groups (Figs. 1E, 1F and 2A).\n\nHIF‑1α and MMP‑9 protein expression levels. HIF-1α expres-\nsion levels are reportedly upregulated during AP (16,17). \nHIF-1α was almost undetectable in the lung tissues of the \nrats in the sham surgery group. The HIF-1α and MMP-9 \nprotein expression levels showed significant increases in the \nuntreated PALI group compared with those in the control \ngroup. Compared with those in the untreated PALI group, \nthe HIF-1α protein expression levels were significantly \nreduced in the PALI + 2ME2 (5 mg/kg) and PALI + 2ME2 \n(15 mg/kg) groups. However, the difference in the MMP-9 \nprotein levels between the untreated PALI and PALI + 2ME2 \n(5 mg/kg) groups was weakly distinguishable, whereas in the \nPALI + 2ME2 (15 mg/kg) group, the MMP-9 protein expres-\nsion levels were significantly reduced compared with those in \nthe untreated PALI group (Figs. 1G, 1H and 2B).\n\nHistological examination. The lung and pancreatic tissues \nwere sectioned, stained with H&E and scored for edema, \nacinar necrosis, hemorrhage and fat necrosis, inflammation \nand perivascular infiltration (Table III).\n\nThe rats in the untreated PALI group showed significant \nincreases in pathological scores of lung and pancreatic tissues \ncompared with those in the sham surgery group. Compared with \nthose in the PALI + 2ME2 (5 mg/kg) group, the pathological \nscores of the lung and pancreatic tissues in the PALI + 2ME2 \n(15 mg/kg) group were significantly reduced (Figs. 1I and 3A‑D, \nand Figs. 1J and 3E-H for lung and pancreas, respectively).\n\nTable II.

Keck et al (13) found that MMP-9 \nalso participates in the pathogenesis of PALI. Thus, whether \nHIF-1α contributes to the formation of lung edema by regu-\nlating MMP‑9 requires clarification.\n\nThe major finding of the present study is that the concur-\nrently elevated expression levels of HIF-1α and MMP-9 in the \nlung tissues of rat models of PALI temporally coincided with \nlung edema formation and alveolar-barrier disruption. In the \nPALI model used in the present study, the edema, determined \nby the wet/dry ratio, was reduced by the HIF-1α-selective \ninhibitor, 2ME2, compared with that in the untreated PALI \ngroup. In addition, the alveolar-barrier disruption determined \nby Evans blue dye extravasation was also ameliorated by the \ninhibition of HIF-1α by 2ME2. At the same time, the inhibition \n\nFigure 3.

PALI, \npancreatitis-associated lung injury; 2ME2, 2-methoxyestradiol.\n\n\n\nEXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE  8:  899-906,  2014 905\n\nof HIF-1α caused reduced levels of serum amylase, PaCO2 and \npathological scores of the tissues of the lung and pancreas, as \nwell as increased PaO2 compared with those in the untreated \nPALI group.\n\nThe data in the present study further support the hypoth-\nesis that HIF-1α affects the pathogenesis of PALI, which is \nconsistent with the findings of previous studies (14,16,18). \nBlocking HIF-1α expression may prevent the formation of \nlung edema and alveolar-capillary barrier disruption, alle-\nviate PALI and provide a novel approach for the treatment \nof AP.\n\nFurthermore, the larger dose of the HIF-1α inhibitor down-\nregulated the protein expression levels of MMP-9 in the PALI \nmodel compared with those in the untreated PALI group. The \nfindings of the present study suggest a functional interaction \nlinking MMP-9 and HIF-1α, which is possibly dysregulated in \nPALI. The data also suggest that HIF-1α regulates the expres-\nsion levels of MMP-9, which are crucial in edema formation \nand alveolar-capillary barrier disruption in PALI.\n\nThe large quantities of inflammatory factors that enter the \nlung tissues in PALI cause damage and necrosis of lung epithe-\nlial cells, microvascular endothelial cells and tight junctions. \nFurthermore, pancreatic proteinase activates the complemen-\ntary systems, indirectly leading to increased tissue damage \neffects and pulmonary transudate, which cause a reduction in \nthe pulmonary functions of ventilation. Thus, hypoxia may be \na severe consequence of PALI, leading to aberrations in lung \nfunction and repair (15). Hypoxia also results in damage of \nthe alveolar lining layer, apoptosis of alveolar epithelial cells, \nlung edema, increased vascular permeability and augmented \nbarrier disruption (14,18).\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated that hypoxia elicits \ntissue inflammation (23,24). For example, Hartmann et al (24) \ndemonstrated that exposure to a high altitude is associated with \nelevated levels of inflammatory mediators in humans. Similarly, \nmice that are exposed to acute hypoxia (e.g., 8% oxygen over \n8 h) develop elevated plasma levels of cytokines, in conjunction \nwith pulmonary edema and inflammatory cell accumulation in \nthe lungs and other organs (9,25). In the inflammatory response, \na large dose of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-8) and serine \nproteases derived from the pancreas may activate polymorpho-\nnuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which secrete significant amounts \nof MMP-9. Subsequently, MMP-9 promotes PMN migration, \nalveolar capillary leakage and lung edema (13,26) (Fig. 4).\n\n2ME2 is a naturally endogenous-occurring metabolite \nof estradiol, which post-transcriptionally downregulates the \nexpression levels of HIF-1α and is an anti-angiogenic and anti-\ntumor agent (27,28). Studies have provided in vitro and in vivo \nevidence that 2ME2 has a direct effect on the inhibition  of \nHIF-1α and the inhibition is not the result of a ‘side-effect’ \nof mitotic arrest (29,30). Furthermore, 2ME2 treatment \nreduces the levels of nuclear and total HIF-1α proteins in a \ndose-dependent manner. The downregulated expression levels \nof HIF-1α post-transcription may be the reason for the absence \nof statistical significance between the HIF-1 and MMP-9 \nmRNA expression levels following the administration of \n2ME2 and in the untreated PALI group in the present study. \n2ME2 inhibits HIF-1α translation and nuclear translocation, \nthereby suppressing the inflammatory response, PMN activa-\ntion and MMP-9 expression (27).\n\nThe aforementioned results suggest that HIF-1α may be \nan upstream protein that causes the alveolar-capillary barrier \ndisruption and lung edema formation in PALI through its \nregulatory expression of catalytic enzymes, including MMP-9.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study demonstrated in a PALI \nmodel that an HIF-1α-MMP-9 signaling cascade exists, \nwherein PALI first triggers induction of HIF‑1α, which in turn \nupregulates MMP-9 expression levels and leads to pathophysi-\nological alveolar-capillary barrier disruption and lung edema. \nInhibition of HIF-1α may provide novel insights into PALI. \nThese findings enhance our knowledge of the prevention of \nacute lung injury secondary to severe AP.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank The Key Laboratory for Basic Research \nof Difficult and Critical Diseases with Integrated Traditional \nand Western Medicine of Liaoning Province.
