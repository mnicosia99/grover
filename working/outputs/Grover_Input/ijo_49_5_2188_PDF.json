Essentially, there was a direct  duplication of certain of the western blotting data between  Fig. 2 (the E-cadherin and Actin data) and Fig. 3C (the Zyxin  and Actin data).  After having re-examined our original data, we realize that  we inadvertently duplicated the data from Fig. 2 in Fig. 3C (the  Zyxin and Actin data).  A corrected version of Fig. 3C (containing the true Zyxin  and Actin data), and, by natural process, also of Fig. 6, are  presented below, in which the Zyxin data in Figs. 3C and 6 are   now correctly shown. Since the Zyxin data was a control for  the siZyxin knockout of HOC313, this error did not affect the  results of the Rho family analysis in this study. We sincerely  apologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our article  who drew this matter to our attention. Furthermore, we regret  any inconvenience this mistake has caused.  Figure 3. (A and B) Immunocytochemical analysis of cell morphological  changes induced by Zyxin siRNA treatment. Blue, nuclear (DAPI); red, actin  (phalloidin); green, Zyxin (FITC). Note that Zyxin was localized at adhesion  plaques and some overlapped with actin stress fibers (arrow). Treatment with  Zyxin siRNA resulted in reduced expression of Zyxin and morphological  changes from spindle to polygonal shape. (C) Inhibition of Zyxin expression  by Zyxin siRNA treatment did not alter LPP or TRIP-6 expression.  Figure 6. Analysis of Rho family proteins by western blotting. Rho family  small GTPases involved in cell migration and invasion, such as RhoA, Rac1  and CDC42, were examined. There was no significant difference in expres- sion of RhoA, but expressions of Rac1 and CDC42 were slightly reduced in  Zyxin siRNA-treated cells.   '}
