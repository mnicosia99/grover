Essentially, there was a direct \nduplication of certain of the western blotting data between \nFig. 2 (the E-cadherin and Actin data) and Fig. 3C (the Zyxin \nand Actin data).\n\nAfter having re-examined our original data, we realize that \nwe inadvertently duplicated the data from Fig. 2 in Fig. 3C (the \nZyxin and Actin data).\n\nA corrected version of Fig. 3C (containing the true Zyxin \nand Actin data), and, by natural process, also of Fig. 6, are \npresented below, in which the Zyxin data in Figs. 3C and 6 are  \nnow correctly shown. Since the Zyxin data was a control for \nthe siZyxin knockout of HOC313, this error did not affect the \nresults of the Rho family analysis in this study. We sincerely \napologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our article \nwho drew this matter to our attention. Furthermore, we regret \nany inconvenience this mistake has caused.\n\nFigure 3. (A and B) Immunocytochemical analysis of cell morphological \nchanges induced by Zyxin siRNA treatment. Blue, nuclear (DAPI); red, actin \n(phalloidin); green, Zyxin (FITC). Note that Zyxin was localized at adhesion \nplaques and some overlapped with actin stress fibers (arrow). Treatment with \nZyxin siRNA resulted in reduced expression of Zyxin and morphological \nchanges from spindle to polygonal shape. (C) Inhibition of Zyxin expression \nby Zyxin siRNA treatment did not alter LPP or TRIP-6 expression.\n\nFigure 6. Analysis of Rho family proteins by western blotting. Rho family \nsmall GTPases involved in cell migration and invasion, such as RhoA, Rac1 \nand CDC42, were examined. There was no significant difference in expres-\nsion of RhoA, but expressions of Rac1 and CDC42 were slightly reduced in \nZyxin siRNA-treated cells.\n\n\n'}
