China\n\nAbstract\n\nHeterosis is associated with differential gene expression between hybrids and their parental lines, and the genes involved in\ncell proliferation played important roles. AtARF2 is a general cell proliferation repressor in Arabidopsis. In our previous study,\ntwo homologues (ZmARF10 and ZmARF25) of AtARF2 were identified in maize, but their relationship with heterosis was not\nelucidated. Here, the expression patterns of ZmARF10 and ZmARF25 in seedling leaves of maize hybrids and their parental\nlines were analyzed. The results of qRT-PCR exhibited that ZmARF25 was down-regulated in leaf basal region of hybrids.\nMoreover, overexpression of ZmARF25 led to reduced organ size in Arabidopsis, which was mainly due to the decrease in cell\nnumber, not cell size. In addition, the cell proliferation related genes AtANT, AtGIF1 and AtGRF5 were down-regulated in\n35S::ZmARF25 transgenic lines. Collectively, we proposed that the down-regulation of ZmARF25 in maize hybrid may\naccelerate cell proliferation and promote leaf development, which, in turn, contributes to the observed leaf size heterosis in\nmaize.\n\nCitation: Li C, Wang C, Meng L, Xing J, Wang T, et al.

In spite of its importance\n\nand successful application, the underlying molecular mechanism\n\nfor heterosis is still needs to be elucidated [2–5]. Studies on plant\n\nform evolution suggest that phenotype evolution often proceeds\n\nthrough changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of gene\n\nexpression [6]. Theoretically, all the genes in hybrid are inherited\n\nfrom its two parental lines, but hybrid performance or phenotype\n\ncan be quite different from its parents, thereby, demonstrating\n\nheterosis [7,8]. Therefore, the alteration of gene expression in\n\nhybrids may be responsible for hybrid vigor [4,8]. Up to date,\n\ngenome wide gene expression profiles of different organs or tissues\n\nbetween hybrids and their parents in plants have been analyzed\n\n[9–15], and all possible modes of gene action were observed,\n\nincluding additivity, high- and low-parent dominance, under-\n\ndominance, and overdominance [9–15]. To gain further insight\n\ninto the possible roles of differentially expressed genes between\n\nhybrid and its parental lines in plant development and heterosis,\n\nthe functions of some differentially expressed genes have been\n\ncharacterized, and some of which may contribute to the observed\n\nheterosis. For example, overexpression of wheat hybrid up-\n\nregulated gene (ADP-ribosylation factor, TaARF) in Arabidopsis\n\ndisplayed increased growth rates during the seedling and adult\n\nstages [16]. Overexpression of Larix hybrid up-regulated gene\n\nLaAP2L1, a member of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor\n\nfamily, led to markedly enlarged organs and heterosis-like traits in\n\nArabidopsis [17]. Expression of an up-regulated protein ZmACT2\n\nin dry embryos of maize hybrid in Arabidopsis partially comple-\n\nmented the low germination phenotype in the Atact7 mutant [18].\n\nHeterosis affects nearly any trait in nearly every hybrid, hence\n\none of the major challenges for expression analysis is deciding\n\nwhich tissue to be analyzed [19,20]. It was proposed that seedling\n\nleaves can be used as a model system to investigate the molecular\n\nbasis of maize heterosis, because it is commonly observed that\n\nhybrids produce larger leaf areas than their corresponding\n\nparental lines [20–24]. At the cellular level, a crucial effect of\n\nleaf size heterosis is manifested by primarily increases in cell\n\nnumber, not cell size [25–27]. Recent study provided molecular\n\nevidence for the relationship between cell proliferation and\n\nheterotic maize growth. For example, the expression level of\n\nmaize CNR gene, ortholog of fruit weight 2.2 (fw2.2) in tomato, was\n\nfounded to be negatively correlated with growth activity and\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e94830\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0094830&domain=pdf\n\n\nhybrid vigor [28]. Collectively, it reveals that the study of cell\n\nnumber control is eminently important to understanding the\n\nunderlying mechanism for leaf size heterosis.\n\nIn Arabidopsis, auxin signaling plays a vital role in leaf growth\n\nand development processes and some key genes, including\n\nAtARF2, AtARF7 and AtARF19, have been identified [29–31]. In\n\nour previous study, 31 maize genes that encode ARFs (Auxin\n\nResponse Factors) were identified in maize genome, and\n\nphylogenetic analysis demonstrated that two of them, ZmARF10\n\nand ZmARF25, were homologous to Arabidopsis growth repressor\n\nAtARF2 [32]. In this study, the expression patterns of ZmARF10\n\nand ZmARF25 in seedling leaves of maize hybrids and their\n\nparental lines were investigated and the function of hybrid down-\n\nregulated gene ZmARF25 was characterized. Our data showed that\n\nectopic expression of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis led to reduced organ\n\nsize, indicating that the alteration of auxin signaling pathway\n\nmight play an important role in maize leaf size heterosis.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nPlant Materials and Growth Conditions\nMaize inbred lines Mo17, B73, Zong3, 87-1 and their hybrids\n\nMo17/B73, B73/Mo17, Zong3/87-1, 87-1/Zong3, B73/Zong3,\n\nZong3/B73, B73/87-1 and 87-1/B73 were used for this study.\n\nMaize seeds were imbibed at 28uC in the dark, and the seeds after\ngermination were selected with the same length of coleoptile\n\n(2.0 cm) to grow in hydroponic culture on a 16 h light/8 h dark\n\ncycle, at a temperature of 29uC and 25uC for the light and dark\ncycle, respectively. In maize leaf, the mature zone is composed of\n\nfully differentiated cells and cell division is restricted to the growing\n\nzone composed of immature cells [19,33]. Therefore, thirty\n\nmillimeters from the base of the third leaves and twenty\n\nmillimeters from the tip of the same leaf of a seedling 5 days\n\nafter germination (DAG) were dissected and harvested for RNA\n\nextractions.\n\nFigure 1.

Seeds were sown on\nhalf-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates with 3% sucrose\n\nand 0.8% agar in a culture room at 22uC under a 16/8 light/dark\ncycle. After germination, 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were\n\ntransplanted and grown at a density of four plants per pot\n\ncontaining a mixture of soil and vermiculite (2:1) at 22uC under a\n16/8 light/dark cycle with 70% relative humidity.\n\nLeaf Area Measurements\nLeaves were scanned using ImageScanner (GE Healthcare,\n\nUSA), and measured with a public domain image analysis software\n\n(ImageJ version 1.32; http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). For maize leaf\n\narea measurements, the third leaves were harvested in the\n\nmorning (10:00–10:30 am) and experiments were done in three\n\nbiological replicates and 10 plants of each genotype were analyzed\n\nfor each replicate. The t-test was used to determine the significance\n\nof the differences in leaf areas between hybrid and the\n\ncorresponding mid-parental value. The mid-parent heterosis\n\n(MPH) was calculated using the following formula: MPH = (F12\n\nmid-parental value)/mid-parental value in %, where F1 is the\n\naverage value of hybrid, and the mid-parental value is the average\n\nvalue of the two parents.\n\nTen 30-day-old Arabidopsis plants of each transgenic line and\n\nwild-type were selected randomly for the fully expanded fifth leaf\n\narea measurements. The t-test was used to determine the\n\nsignificance of the differences in leaf area between transgenic\n\nplants and wild-type plants.\n\nHistological Analysis\nAfter the area measurements, the fully expanded fifth leaves of\n\nthe ten 30-day-old Arabidopsis plants of each transgenic line and\n\nwild-type were used for epidermal cell size measurements. Leaves\n\nwere first boiled in water for 10 min to kill the cells, and then\n\nimmersed in 95% ethyl alcohol, after decolorized, they were\n\ntransferred to hot (96uC) 85% lactic acid for 8 min. Finally, the\nleaves were transferred to room temperature lactic acid and\n\nexamined using a Nikon Stereo Microscope. The number of\n\nepidermal cells was determined in an area of 0.58 mm\n2\n\nin the\n\nmiddle region of the fifth leaf blade. The average cell size was\n\nmeasured by dividing 0.58 mm\n2\n\nby the number of epidermal. The\n\ntotal number of cells per leaf was calculated by dividing the leaf\n\narea by the average cell size. Statistical calculations were\n\nperformed with Microsoft EXCEL.\n\nIsolation of DNA and Total RNA\nTotal DNA was extracted by the cetyltrimethylammonium\n\nbromide (CTAB) method [34] with minor modifications. Total\n\nRNA was extracted using a standard Trizol RNA isolation\n\nprotocol (Invitrogen, USA), and then treated with RNase-free\n\nDNaseI (Promega, USA) to remove genomic DNA. The amount\n\nand quality of the total RNA were verified by electrophoresis on a\n\n1% agarose gel. The concentration of RNA was measured using a\n\nNanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND- 1000; NanoDrop Technolo-\n\ngies). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using 2 mg of\nDNase digested total RNA with oligodT15 primer according to\n\nthe manufacturer’s protocol for RT-PCR first-strand synthesis\n\n(TaKaRa, Japan).\n\nFigure 2.

PCR conditions consisted of an initial\n\nstep at 95uC for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95uC for 15 s,\nfollowed by 60uC for 15 s, and then 72uC for 30 s. For\namplification product specificity, a melting curve was generated\n\nat the end of each run, and verified by agarose gel electrophoresis\n\nof PCR products. All reactions were run in triplicate, and each\n\nreaction was completed with a melting curve and amplification\n\ncurve analysis to confirm the amplification specificity. Ct values\n\nwere determined using the CFX96 software with default settings.\n\nDifferences between the Ct values of target gene and Actin were\n\ncalculated as DCt = Cttarget gene2CtActin, and the relative expres-\nsion levels of target genes were determined as 2\n\n2DCt\n. For each\n\nsample, PCR was performed on three biological replicates. The\n\naverage values of 2\n2DCt\n\nwere used to determine difference in gene\n\nexpression. Actin was amplified as an endogenous control.\n\nStatistical analysis of the difference in the relative expression\n\nlevels of target genes was performed by using t-test.\n\nGene Cloning and Sequence Analysis\nPCR was performed using the ZmARF25-F/R primer pair\n\nfrom the first-strand cDNA from the B73 seedling leaves. PCR\n\nconditions consisted of an initial step at 94uC for 5 min followed\n\nby 35 cycles of 94uC for 25 s, 58uC for 25 s, and 72uC for 2 m\n45 s; and then a final step at 72uC for 10 min. The PCR products\nwere confirmed by visualization of the samples by electrophoresis\n\non 1% agarose gel and stained by Ethidium bromide. The samples\n\nwere extracted with MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen,\n\nGermany), and these purified PCR products were cloned into\n\npGEM-T plasmid vector (Promega, USA).

To construct overexpression vector 35S::ZmARF25, the\n\nfragments were transferred from the pDONR221 vectors to\n\npB2GW7 vector by Gateway LR recombination (Invitrogen,\n\nUSA). This construct was transformed into Arabidopsis (Col-0) via\n\nthe floral dip method using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain\n\nGV3101 [35]. Transgenic plants were selected on 1/2 MS medium\n\ncontaining herbicides (Basta). The herbicide resistant seedlings were\n\ntransferred to a mixture of soil and vermiculite (2:1) and generated\n\nhomozygous lines by self-fertilization. Statistical analysis of the\n\ndifference in traits between transgenic plants and wild-type plants\n\nwas performed by using t-test.\n\nResults\n\nComparison of Maize Leaf Area between Hybrids and\ntheir Parental Lines\n\nPrevious studies revealed that maize hybrid exhibited heterosis\n\nin leaf size [24]. In this study, dynamic growth patterns of maize\n\nhybrid Mo17/B73 and its inbred parental lines were investigated\n\nin terms of the third leaf area and mid-parent heterosis (MPH) was\n\ncalculated. The results exhibited that leaf areas of hybrid Mo17/\n\nB73 were significantly larger than its parental lines at 8, 10 and 12\n\nDAG. Remarkably, MPH (72.00%) at 8 DAG was much higher\n\nthan that of 10 and 12 DAG (60.50% and 58.26%) [Figure S1].\n\nThus, the third leaf areas of eight hybrids and their parental lines\n\nat 8 DAG were further measured and compared. It can be seen\n\nthat the leaf areas of all hybrids were significantly larger than those\n\nof their parental lines at 8 DAG [Figure 1A].\n\nIdentification of a Hybrid Down-regulated Gene\nZmARF25 in Maize Seedling Leaves\n\nTo gain insight into the relationship of ZmARF10 and ZmARF25\n\nwith leaf size heterosis, expression patterns of these two genes in\n\nthe third leaves of hybrids Mo17/B73 and B73/Mo17 and their\n\nparental lines. Considering of the time lag between differential\n\ngene expression and the observed heterosis of leaf size at 8 DAG,\n\nthe third leaves at 5 DAG were selected for qRT-PCR analysis. As\n\nshown in Figure 1B, the relative expression levels of ZmARF25 in\n\nthe basal region of Mo17/B73 and B73/Mo17 hybrids were\n\nsignificantly lower than the levels observed in parental lines,\n\nwhereas no significant differences in the expression patterns of\n\nZmARF10 were observed in these hybrids. Most notably, no\n\nobvious expression alterations were detected for ZmARF10 and\n\nZmARF25 in the leaf tip regions of the hybrids and their parental\n\nlines [Figure 1C]. Furthermore, the expression patterns of\n\nZmARF25 between other hybrids and their parental lines were\n\nalso investigated and we observed that ZmARF25 was down-\n\nFigure 3.

Therefore, ZmARF25 was selected for further\n\ninvestigation.\n\nTo obtain the cDNA with complete open reading frame (ORF)\n\ncorresponding to ZmARF25, cDNAs from B73 seedling leaves were\n\namplified with ZmARF25-F/R primer pair and one unique PCR\n\nfragment of about 2500 bp was produced (data not shown). The\n\nPCR products were cloned into pGEM-T and three clones were\n\nsequenced. One 2552 bp fragment was obtained and no\n\nnucleotide polymorphisms were detected for all sequenced clones.\n\nSequence analysis revealed that the PCR product contains a\n\ncomplete ORF, which encodes a polypeptide of 801 amino acids\n\nwith a calculated molecular mass of 89.79 kD and isoelectric point\n\nof 6.09, which was consistent with our previous study [32].\n\nStructure analysis exhibited that ZmARF25 has a typical ARF-\n\ntype structure with a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) that\n\nconsists of a plant-specific B3-type subdomain and an ARF\n\nsubdomain required for efficient in vitro binding to the auxin\n\nresponse elements (AuxREs) in the N-terminus, a typical carboxy-\n\nterminal dimerization domain (CTD) with both III and IV\n\nsubdomains and a middle region (MR) that might function as a\n\nrepression domain (RD) since it is enriched in serine (S) [Figure 2]\n\n[36–39].\n\nFunctional Analysis of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis\nTo investigate the possible function of ZmARF25, overexpres-\n\nsion Arabidopsis transgenic plants were generated and herbicide-\n\nresistant T0 transformants were transferred into soil and grown in\n\na greenhouse to obtain segregating T1 progeny for genetic\n\nanalysis. Of the 21 transformants, eight overexpression lines\n\nshowed a 3:1 segregation pattern for herbicide resistance, among\n\nwhich four (35S::ZmARF25 #1–4) were selected for further\nanalysis. As shown in Figure 3A, the insertion of the overexpres-\n\nsion vector was confirmed by genomic PCR. ZmARF25 is a\n\nhomologue of AtARF2 in Arabidopsis [32], the relative expression\n\nlevels of exogenous gene ZmARF25 and endogenous gene AtARF2\n\nin the transgenic and wild-type plants were analyzed by qRT-\n\nPCR. The results showed that different expression levels of\n\nZmARF25 were observed in these overexpression lines, but the\n\ntranscription of AtARF2 in the transgenic lines was not affected\n\n[Figure 3B]. Subsequent analysis was conducted using these T3\nhomozygous transgenic plants. As shown in Figure 4,\n\n35S::ZmARF25 #1–4 transgenic lines displayed markedly de-\ncreased leaf areas, shorter siliques and plant height with smaller\n\ninflorescences and flowers in comparison with wild-type. Further\n\nanalysis revealed that the size of the fifth leaves of 35S::ZmARF25\n\nplants was decreased by approximately 60,80% as compared to\nwild-type [Figure 4D]. In addition, the plant height and the silique\n\nlength of transgenic plants were about 40–60% and 56% of that of\n\nwild-type, respectively [Figure 4E, F]. Collectively, these data\n\nindicated that overexpression of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis decreased\n\nthe size of aerial organs by inhibiting organ growth and\n\ndevelopment.\n\nTo determine whether it is cell number or cell size, or both that\n\ncontribute to the changed leaf size in transgenic lines, we observed\n\nFigure 4.

The\n\nresults showed that there was no distinct difference in cell size\n\nbetween the ZmARF25 overexpression and wild-type plants\n\n[Figure 5A, B], whereas cell number of 35S::ZmARF25 plants\n\nwas significantly lower when compared to wild-type plants\n\n[Figure 5C], indicating that the decrease in cell numbers, not\n\ncell size, was associated with the diminution of leaf size in\n\n35S::ZmARF25 plants.\n\nExpression Analysis of Organ Size-associated Genes\nbetween 35S::ZmARF25 Transgenic Lines and Wild-type\n\nTo elucidate the underlying regulation mechanism of ZmARF25,\n\nexpression patterns of organ size-associated genes AtANT, AtGIF1,\n\nAtGRF5 and AtEXP10 between 35S::ZmARF25 and wild-type\n\nplants were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The results showed that the\n\nexpression levels of AtANT, AtGIF1 and AtGRF5 were significantly\n\ndecreased in 35S::ZmARF25 plants, whereas no obvious alteration\n\nof AtEXP10 expression was observed [Figure 6]. In Arabidopsis,\n\nAtANT, AtGIF1 and AtGRF5 were reported to be involved in cell\n\nproliferation while AtEXP10 played important roles in cellular\n\nexpansion [40–44]. Collectively, it could be concluded that\n\noverexpression of ZmARF25 inhibited the transcription of cell\n\nproliferation associated genes, which is consistent with the\n\ndecreased cell numbers observed in 35S::ZmARF25 plants.\n\nDiscussion\n\nZmARF25 Repressed Organ Size by Decreasing Cell\nNumbers in Arabidopsis\n\nAuxin response factors (ARFs) are transcription factors that bind\n\nwith specificity to TGTCTC-containing AuxREs found in\n\npromoters of primary/early auxin response genes and mediate\n\nresponses to the plant hormone auxin [36–39]. Genome-wide\n\nanalysis revealed that ARF genes are represented by a large\n\nmultigene family in plants [32,45–49]. Most ARFs contain a\n\nconserved N-terminal DBD, a variable MR and a typical CTD\n\n[36,37,45–49]. The DBD specifically binds to the conserved\n\nAuXRE, the CTD is modular with amino acid sequence related to\n\ndomains III and IV in Aux/IAA proteins, making it function as a\n\ndimerization domain among the ARFs or with several Aux/IAA\n\nproteins. The structure of MR determines whether the ARF acts\n\nas an activator or repressor. Activation domain (AD) of ARFs is\n\nusually enriched in glutamine (Q), serine (S) and leucine (L), while\n\nrepression domain (RD) is enriched in either S, L and proline (P);\n\nS, L and/or glycine (G) or S [32,39]. In this study, one hybrid\n\ndown-regulated gene ZmARF25 that encoded a typical ARF-type\n\nprotein was identified in maize. Most notably, ZmARF25 has a\n\nMR enriched in S, indicating that it might act as a repressor. Our\n\nprevious study indicated that ZmARF25 was homologous to\n\nAtARF2 in Arabidopsis and OsARF4 in rice [32]. AtARF2 has been\n\nidentified as a general repressor of cell division, one aspect of many\n\nbiological processes regulated by auxin [29]. However, our\n\nknowledge about the functions and regulations of ZmARF25 gene\n\nis quite limited. Here, we demonstrated that overexpression of\n\nZmARF25 in Arabidopsis resulted in significant size reduction of\n\nplant organs. Although the results of ZmARF25 overexpression in\n\nArabidopsis may not fully reflect its precise functions in maize, it is\n\nreasonable to assume that ZmARF25 may be involved in maize\n\ngrowth and development process, which deserves for further\n\ninvestigation.\n\nAt the cellular level, organ size is determined by two\n\ndevelopmental forces,cell proliferation and cell expansion, which\n\npartially overlap in time and are assumed to be coordinated [50].\n\nNevertheless, larger organ tends to be composed of more cells\n\nrather than bigger cells in different species [51]. In present study,\n\nwe noted that overexpression of ZmARF25 in Arabidopsis signifi-\n\ncantly decreased the cell number, resulting in smaller organs in\n\n35S::ZmARF25 transgenic plants when compared to wild-type.\n\nRecently, some regulatory genes that affect leaf development have\n\nbeen identified and characterized at the molecular level. For\n\nexample, loss of AtANT function reduces the size of all lateral shoot\n\norgans by decreasing cell number [41]. AtGIF and AtGRF5 act\n\ntogether and are required for the development of appropriate leaf\n\nsize and shape by promoting and/or maintaining of cell\n\nproliferation activity in leaf primordial [42,43]. On the other\n\nhand, expansins are thought to function in the control of plant cell\n\ngrowth, and leaf size was substantially reduced in antisense lines\n\nwith suppressed AtEXP10 expression, whereas overexpression of\n\nFigure 5.

Collectively, we\n\nspeculate that ZmARF25 regulates the process of cell proliferation\n\nby altering the expression of AtANT, AtGRF5 and AtGIF1 in\n\nArabidopsis.\n\nExpression Patterns of ZmARF25 in Maize Hybrids and\ntheir Parental Lines was Tissue and Genotype Dependent\n\nLeaf differentiation proceeds basipetally (from tip to base) in a\n\nhighly regular and continuous manner [52–54]. Maize leaves have\n\na basal growing region, which is composed of immature cells,\n\nenclosed by older leaves [19,33,55]. Dynamics of the third leaf of\n\nmaize seedling transcriptome and proteome along the maize leaf\n\ndevelopmental gradient have been discussed. The results showed\n\nthat genes and proteins expressed at the highest levels near the\n\nbase of the leaf involved in cell wall biosynthesis, DNA synthesis,\n\ncell cycle regulation and chromatin structure regulation, protein\n\nmetabolism, potential signaling proteins, auxin and brassinosteroid\n\nbiosynthesis and signaling, respiratory pathways and vesicle\n\ntransport [19,56]. Interestingly, relative expression level of\n\nZmARF25 gene in the basal region of hybrids Mo17/B73 and\n\nB73/Mo17 was significantly lower than that of two parental lines.\n\nOn the other hand, no significant alteration in expression was\n\nobserved in the tip region, which is consistent with the observation\n\nthat different regions within a leaf displayed different expression\n\npatterns [19,56]. Taken together, we proposed that leaf basal\n\nregion was the appropriate tissue for further investigation of the\n\nmolecular basis of leaf size heterosis.\n\nRecently, many studies have analyzed heterosis-associated gene\n\nexpression in leaves of maize, rice and wheat [7–14,20], but there\n\nhas been no obvious consensus about genes that are differentially\n\nexpressed in hybrids, which might be the result of significant\n\ndifferences in species, different genotypes within species, distinct\n\ntissues, experimental designs and statistical procedures applied [7–\n\n14,20]. In this study, we noted that the ZmARF25 gene was down-\n\nregulated in B73/Mo17, Mo17/B73, Zong3/87-1, 87-1/Zong3,\n\nB73/87-1, 87-1/B73 and Zong3/B73, but no significant expression\n\ndifference was detected between B73/Zong3 and its parental lines,\n\nwhich may be attributed to the influence of maternal affect, because\n\nthe mid-parent heterosis of hybrid B73/Zong3 was lower than that\n\nof Zong3/B73.\n\nDown-regulation of ZmARF25 in Hybrids may Contribute\nto the Observed Heterosis for Leaf Size\n\nEnlarged organ size, such as the increased leaf area, is an\n\nimportant feature of heterosis and also has a close relationship with\n\nthe crop yield [12, 28 and 57]. A key observation made in maize\n\nheterosis was that the greater plant size is primarily (90%) due to\n\nincreases in cell number, not cell size [25]. Recently study reported\n\nthat transgenic over-expression of Zea mays ARGOS1 (ZAR1)\n\nenhanced maize organ growth [58]. The expression level of CNR\n\ngene was found to be negatively correlated with tissue growth\n\nactivity and hybrid vigor [28,57]. In this study, the expression\n\npatterns of ZmARF10 and ZmARF25 in maize hybrids and their\n\nparental lines were analyzed. We found that ZmARF25 gene was\n\ndown-regulated in hybrids. Moreover, 35S::ZmARF25 transgenic\n\nArabidopsis plants displayed markedly decreased aerial organ size in\n\ncomparison with wild-type. Considering the decreased cell\n\nnumber in 35S::ZmARF25 plant leaves, we proposed that the\n\ndown-regulation of ZmARF25 gene in maize hybrid could\n\naccelerate cell proliferation and promote leaf development, which,\n\nin turn, contributes to the observed heterosis for leaf size.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 The third leaf area of hybrid Mo17/B73 and\nits parental lines at 8 DAG, 10 DAG and 12 DAG.
