The PI3Kd inhibitor Cal-101 is cytotoxic in B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro and is\n\nactive in the treatment of CLL in vivo. Interestingly, we demonstrated that BKM120 is 3.6 fold more toxic than Cal-101 in\n\nmalignant B-CLL lymphocytes in vitro. BKM120 cytotoxicity correlated with the basal expression of proteins involved in the\n\nPI3K/Akt pathway. A protein signature of PI3K pathway proteins predicts the response to BKM120 treatment. In the primary\n\nB-CLL lymphocytes tested in vitro, BKM120 decreased the phosphorylation status of molecular biomarkers used as indicators\n\nof PI3K pathway inhibition in vivo. Also, BKM120 induced apoptosis in primary B-CLL cells culture in the presence and\n\nabsence of stromal cell support. Our findings suggest that BKM120 should be tested clinically in CLL.\n\nChronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the\naccumulation of malignant B lymphocytes expressing the sur-\nface antigens CD19, CD20, CD23 and CD5.1 These B-CLL\ncells display altered apoptosis that is caused by both primary\ntumor features and co-dependent stromal elements.2 Current\ntreatments for this disease include chemotherapeutic [alkyl-\nating agents (chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, bendamus-\ntine)], purine analogs (Fludarabine) and immunotherapeutic\nagents (Rituximab, Alemtuzumab) or the combination of\nimmunotherapy with chemotherapeutics drugs [the gold\nstandard for CLL treatment is now fludarabine, cyclophos-\nphamide and rituximab (FCR)]. However, none of these\nstandard treatments result in curative therapy supporting the\n\nneed for the investigation of new therapeutic targets and\ndrug development in CLL as well as markers that can predict\nthe clinical response to these treatments.3\n\nThe B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling has been considered\ncritical for B-CLL survival and recent studies demonstrated\nthat inhibition of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), a BCR\nassociated kinase, blocked chemokines signaling leading to\ninhibition of CLL cell migration and survival resulting in\nCLL regression.4,5\n\nThe phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) cascade is also a crit-\nical component of survival signaling including PI3K-activated\nAkt (phosphorylated Akt) which inhibits cell death pathways\nby inactivating pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bad, procas-\npase-9 and members of the Forkhead transcription factor fam-\nily. Overexpression of PI3K appears to play a critical role in\nB-CLL cell survival. Freshly isolated CLL lymphocytes have\nhigh levels of NF-jB activity and loss of NF-jB and Akt activ-\nity is associated with apoptosis.6–8 Cal-101 is a specific inhibi-\ntor of the delta isoform of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase; the\ndelta isoform is expressed primarily in hematopoietic lineages\nand is functionally important in B cells. Preclinical data sug-\ngest that Cal-101 is cytotoxic to CLL in vitro.8 At the 2010\nASH meeting, results were presented of a phase I study of 37\npatients with CLL who were treated with Cal-101.9 Patients\nhad a median of five prior regimens; 65% were refractory to\ntheir most recent prior regimen; 81% had bulky lymphadenop-\nathy; and 36% of the patients had del17. All patients showed\nreduction in lymphadenopathy with 80% achieving a nodal\nresponse. However, concomitant with the decrease in lymph-\nadenopathy there was an increase in lymphocytosis in about\n60% of patients over the first 1–2 months of therapy. This\nlymphocytosis appeared to represent a redistribution of lym-\nphocytes from lymph nodes and bone marrow to peripheral\n\nKey words: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, BKM120, PI3K, leukemia\n\ntherapy, CLL apoptosis\n\nAbbreviations: BCR: B-cell receptor; BTK: Bruton tyrosine kinase;\n\nCLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia; DMEM: Dulbecco’s modified\n\neagle medium; FBS: fetal bovine serum; FCR: fludarabine,\n\ncyclophosphamide and rituximab; MRD: minimal residual disease;\n\nPI: phosphoinositide\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online\n\nversion of this article\n\nGrant sponsor: Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Grant\n\nnumbers: MOP-110991 to Lawrence Panasci and MOP-106528 to\n\nRaquel Aloyz\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.27989\n\nHistory: Received 11 Sep 2012; Accepted 29 Nov 2012; Online 12\n\nDec 2012\n\nCorrespondence to: Lawrence Panasci or Raquel Aloyz, 3755 Cote\n\nSte Catherine Road, H3T 1E2, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Tel.:\n\nþ514-3408248, Fax: þ514-3408302, E-mail: lpanasci@hotmail.com\nor raquel.aloyz@mcgill.ca\n\nS\nh\no\nrt\n\nR\nep\no\nrt\n\nInt.

Patients generally experienced significant clinical ben-\nefit from the improvement in lymphadenopathy, with no nega-\ntive consequences from the lymphocytosis. The lymphocytosis\ndid limit the response rate, however, to 26%. Thus, Cal-101 is\nactive in the treatment of refractory CLL. Currently, the pan\nclass I PI3K inhibitor BKM120 developed by Novartis is under\ninvestigation in phase I and II clinical trials in advanced solid\ntumor patients8,10 (clinicaltrials.gov).\n\nMaterial and Methods\nPatients\n\nSixty-five patients with a diagnosis of B-CLL followed at the\nJewish General Hospital of Montreal were enrolled in the\nstudy after informed consent. Patients were either clinically\nuntreated (n ¼ 36) or treated with chemotherapy (n ¼ 29)\nfor various time periods (Supporting Information Table 1).\n\nCell lines\n\nThe three B-CLL cell lines JVM2, EHEB and MEC2 (DSMZ,\nBraunschweig, Germany) were maintained in RPMI (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA), complemented with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS). BMS2 stromal cell line were maintained in Dulbecco’s\nmodified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS.\n\nCytotoxicity assay\n\nLymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood using\nFicoll-Hypaque (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) as described.11\n\nThe isolated lymphocyte population was 97.85 6 1.72% ma-\nlignant B-lymphocytes (expressed as a mean % 6 S.D.). The\nCLL lymphocytes (3 � 106 cells/ml) were treated with vari-\nous concentrations of BKM120 (0.2–20 lM) (Novartis\nPharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) or Cal-101 (0.4–50 lM) (LC\nLaboratories, Woburn, MA). Control samples were incubated\nwith the greatest volume of DMSO. The MTT assay was per-\nformed 72 h after treatment as previously described12 and\nthe cytotoxic effect of the drug presented as the IC50 (the\ndrug concentration resulting in 50% of control).\n\nWestern blot analysis\n\nCell lysates (50 lg/sample) and protein migration were obtained\nas described before.13 The antibodies utilized were: 4E-BP1, 4E-\nBP1 (Thr37/46), Akt, Akt (Ser473), mTor, p70S6K, p70S6K\n(Thr389), PTEN, raptor and rictor (Cell signalling Technology,\nDanvers, MA) and actin, (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa\n\nCruz, CA). The blots were developed using the appropriate\nHRP-secondary antibodies [anti-mouse (GE Healthcare, Piscat-\naway, NJ), anti-rabbit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) or anti-goat\n(Santa Cruz)] and ECL (GE Healthcare). Protein levels were\nquantified by densitometry with Scion image software (Scion\nCorporation, Frederick, MA) and normalized to actin or the total\nprotein expression for the phosphorylated form of the protein.\n\nApoptosis assay\n\nFor this assay, 3 � 106 cells were treated with the DMSO or\nBKM120 IC50 in the presence or absence of stromal cell for\n24 hr. The induction of apoptosis was determined using the\nAPC AnnexinV/Dead cell apoptosis kit (Invitrogen).\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nThe Pearson Product Moment Correlation and t-testing were\nused for the correlative analysis of predictive biomarkers. The\nprotein expression correlation with BKM120 cytotoxicty with\nthe best p values were utilized to generate Figure 1c. Statisti-\ncal analyses were performed by Friedman Repeated Measures\nAnalysis of Variance on Ranks followed by Bonferroni t-test\nwith SigmaStat software (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).\n\nResults and Discussion\nIn view of the critical role of PI3K in CLL homeostasis, the\nactivity of BKM120 was examined in primary B-CLL lym-\nphocytes and in B-CLL cell lines. The in vitro cytotoxic effect\nof BKM120 was assessed in 3 B-CLL cell lines and in pri-\nmary B-lymphocytes isolated from the 65 B-CLL patients en-\nrolled in our study (Supporting Information Table 1) utilizing\nthe MTT assay. The IC50 (drug concentration resulting in\n50% cell death) obtained in the B-CLL cell lines JVM2,\nEHEB and MEC2 were 0.9 6 0.1, 0.7 6 0.1 and 0.7 6 0.1\nlM, respectively. BKM120 was cytotoxic (IC50 below the\nmaximum concentration (20 lM) of BKM120 used in the\nMTT assay) in 78% of the primary B-CLL lymphocytes sam-\nples tested. There are subsets of patients such as those with\n17p (del17) or 11q (del11) deletions, who have a high-risk\nfor poor response to treatment.14 In our study, BKM120 is\ncytotoxic in patients’ samples harboring these deletions (Sup-\nporting Information Tables 1–2, Supporting Information Fig.\n1). In the phase I clinical study, the maximum plasma con-\ncentration (Cmax) of BKM120 obtained after administration\nof the maximum tolerated dose of the drug was 5 lM.15\n\nInterestingly, 60% of the B-CLL samples tested in our study\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nNone of the standard treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) result in curative therapy. In view of the critical role\n\nof PI3K in CLL homeostasis, here the authors examine the activity of the pan class I PI3K inhibitor BKM120. They find that\n\nclinically achievable concentrations of BKM120 have antitumor activity in CLL lymphocytes associated with down-regulation of\n\nthe PI3K pathway in vitro. They identify a protein signature predicting BKM120 sensitivity in CLL lymphocytes. Moreover,\n\nBKM120 presents significantly greater cytotoxicity than the PI3Kd inhibitor Cal-101, which is especially relevant since Cal-101\n\nhas known antitumor activity in relapsed CLL patients.\n\nS\nh\no\nrt\n\nR\nep\no\nrt\n\n248 PI3K Induced Cell Death in B-CLL Cells\n\nInt.

These results indicated that BKM120 may be useful\nas a single agent in CLL therapy (Fig. 1a, Supporting Infor-\nmation Table 2). Previous studies have shown that the PI3Kd\ninhibitor CAL-101 is cytotoxic in B-CLL lymphocytes in\nvitro.8,16 We therefore compared, by MTT assay, both PI3K\ninhibitors for their potency to induce cell death in 20 pri-\nmary B-CLL cells samples and demonstrated that BKM120 is\n3.6 fold more toxic than CAL-101 in malignant B-CLL lym-\nphocytes in vitro (Fig. 1b, Supporting Information Table 2).\nFurthermore, BKM120 is cytotoxic (IC50 < 20 lM) in 80%\nof these 20 samples tested while CAL-101 is only cytotoxic\n(IC50 < 50 lM) in 45% of these samples. CLL has a widely\n\nvariable response to therapy. Thus, we were interested in\nidentifying molecular features that can predict response to\nBKM120 treatment. We analyzed our samples for somatic\nmutations in the immunoglobulin variable region (IgVH)\ngenes and CD38 expression profiles as well as the basal\nexpression of proteins involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway.\nData Analysis with the Pearson product moment correlation\ntest demonstrated positive correlations between BKM120\ncytotoxicity and the basal expression of Akt (r ¼ 0.592, p ¼\n2.468E-06, n ¼ 54), rictor (r ¼ 0.418; p ¼ 1.65E-03; n ¼ 54),\nraptor (r ¼ 0.463; p ¼ 4.5E-03; n ¼ 54), p70S6K (r ¼ 0.584,\np ¼ 3.561E-06, n ¼ 54) and 4E-BP1 (r ¼ 0.371, p ¼ 5.75E-\n03, n ¼ 54) but not with PTEN, mTor, IgVH or CD38\nexpression. To further analyze these predictive markers, we\n\nFigure 1.

We then\nsimultaneously examine these different correlative markers\ntogether. We demonstrated that all patients with a BKM120\nIC50 � 3 lM expressed low level of raptor and p70S6K (Fig.\n1c). Thereby, simultaneous expression of low basal level of\nthese two proteins may be useful to predict response to\nBKM120.\n\nTo determine whether the cytotoxic effect observed in our\nstudy was related to BKM120-induced PI3K inhibition, we\ninvestigated the phosphorylation status of Akt, a direct down-\nstream target of PI3K in the three cell lines. In all cell lines,\nincluding the p53 mutated cell line MEC2, BKM120 inhibits\nAkt phosphorylation (Akt S473) 24 hr after treatment\n(Fig. 1d). In vitro studies have identified that stromal cells\npromoted cell survival and drug resistance of B-CLL lympho-\ncytes by cell–cell interaction and secretion of chemokines.17\n\nFurthermore, bone marrow microenvironment modulates the\nPI3K/Akt pathway and prevents apoptosis of primary CLL\nlymphocytes.18 To determine whether stromal cells can pro-\ntect B-CLL against BKM120 activity, six primary B-CLL sam-\nples were tested for AnnexinV/7-AAD staining 24 hr after\nBKM120 treatment in the presence or absence of the murine\nstromal cells BMS2. In the absence of BMS2 stromal cell sup-\nport, BKM120 induced apoptosis in the six primary B-CLL\nlymphocytes samples tested (mean AnnexinV positive cells:\nDMSO ¼ 17.2 6 3.7% vs. BKM ¼ 33.2 6 5.5%; p < 0.001).\nAs previously described17 the stromal cells protected B-CLL\nlymphocytes from apoptosis (DMSO ¼ 17.2 6 3.7% vs.\nBMS2 þ DMSO ¼ 5.6 6 1.1%; p ¼ 0.004) but were not able\nto protect these malignant lymphocytes against BKM120\n(BMS2 þ DMSO ¼ 5.6 6 1.1% vs. BMS2 þ BKM120 ¼ 23.6\n6 5.8%; p ¼ 0.005) (Figs. 2a and 2b). The same results were\nobtained when we assessed the cleavage of caspase-3 (Sup-\nporting Information Fig. 2). There is increasing evidence that\nthe major cause of resistance to therapy in CLL patients is a\nconsequence of a small number of leukemic cells that remain.\nThis phenomenon, called minimal residual disease (MRD), is\nin part a consequence of protection conferred by the stromal\nmicroenvironment to the malignant lymphocytes and eradi-\n\ncation of MRD by alemtuzumab treatment improved overall\nand treatment-free survival in CLL patients.17,19 Interestingly,\nour results demonstrated that the stromal cell microenviron-\nment can not protect B-CLL lymphocytes from apoptosis\ninduced by BKM120 treatment.\n\nMolecular biomarkers such as p70S6K and 4E-BP1 have\nbeen used as indicators of PI3K pathway inhibition in vivo\nand BKM120 inhibits p70S6K phosphorylation in rat fibro-\nblast cell lines in vitro.20,21 We demonstrated that the\nBKM120 IC50s correlated with basal p70S6K and 4E-BP1\nprotein expression in primary B-CLL lymphocytes. We then\nassessed in vitro the phosphorylation status of these two pro-\nteins used as biomarkers in vivo, in 8 (p70S6K T389) and 11\n(4E-BP1 T37/46) primary B-CLL samples after treatment\nwith BKM120. Results demonstrated that after 24 hr treat-\nment, BKM120 decreased the phosphorylation status of 4E-\nBP1 (Figs. 2c and 2d) and p70S6K (Figs. 2e and 2f).\n\nAlthough many patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis,\nCLL is a progressive disease and patients eventually require\ntreatment. The main problems during the treatment of\npatients living with CLL are the side effects of therapies and\nthe resistance developed by malignant cells after these treat-\nments. Thereby, no current standard treatment option\nresults in curative therapy, and all patients eventually die.\nTaken together, our results demonstrated that the class I\nPI3K inhibitor BKM120 may be useful as a single agent in\nCLL patients independently of their IgVh mutational status,\nCD38 expression or genomic deletions (del11 and del17).\nFurthermore, a combination of different biomarkers\n(expression of raptor and p70S6K) may predict the response\nto BKM120 treatment. Also, BKM120 abolished the protec-\ntion against apoptosis and drug resistance conferred by the\nmicroenvironment to the primary B-CLL lymphocytes in\nvitro. Our preclinical study demonstrated that BKM120, a\nmolecule with acceptable clinical toxicity,15 may be useful in\nthe treatment of CLL.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe authors thank the Manitoba CLL tissue bank for the IgVH mutation\nanalysis, Novartis for providing BKM120 and Dr Koren Mann for sharing\nthe BMS2 cells.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
