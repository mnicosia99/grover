In this study, we investigated\nthat one voltage gated sodium channel Nav1.7 plays a vital role in lowering heat pain threshold after burn injury,\nand the hypothesis that knockdown of Nav1.7 attenuates pain following burn injury.\n\nMethods: Sixty eight adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into 4 treatment groups: (1) sham, which hind\npaw was put on the room temperature metal plate for 15 s (2) burn model, which hind paw was put on the 85 °C\nmetal plate for 15 s. (3) Burn injury + lentiviral vector -SCN9AsiRNA-GFP (LV- SCN9AsiRNA-GFP group, n = 18), which\nreceive the DRG microinjection of LV- SCN9AsiRNA-GFP on the zero day. (4) Burn injury + lentiviral vector negative\ncontrol (LV-NC-GFP group, n = 18), which receive the DRG microinjection of empty lentiviral vector on the zero day.\n\nResults: Both mechanical and heat threshold were measured from day 1 to 21. Meanwhile, expression of sodium\nchannels Nav1.7 in injured dorsal root ganglia were measured on post-operative days 7(POD 7). Rats exhibited\ndecreased thresholds on both mechanical allodynia and thermal withdrawl latency, accompanied by increased\nNav1.7 and c-fos expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG). And knockdown of Nav1.7 in L5DRG led to the attenuation\nof burn injury-induced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the rats.\n\nConclusion: We provide evidence that shRNA mediated knockdown of Nav1.7 attenuates burn induced pain in rats as\nwell as decreased the activiation of c-fos protein.\n\nKeywords: Nav1.7, Burn injury pain, Lentiviral vector, shRNA, Dorsal root ganglion\n\nBackground\nBurn injury occurs with a high prevalence and causes\nhigh morbidity [12]. Globally, nearly 11 million people\nhave burn pain which is severe enough to require medi-\ncal attention, each year [17]. Burn pain is a spontaneous\nongoing unpleasant feeling, and induces both persistent\nthermal and mechanical hyperalgesia [19]. Currently, the\ncure for burn-injury remains a challenge. Therefore, great\neffects have focused on understanding basic mechanisms\nof pain caused by burn injury [3, 19].\nVoltage gated sodium (Nav) channels are known to\n\nplay a key role in the induction of nociceptors, especially\n\nin the initial rising phase of the action potential. Nav\nchannels are composed of a family of α-subunit (Na v\n1.1–1.9) and one or more β-subunits (b1-b4) [2, 13]. Up\nto now, 9 subtypes of Nav channels have been identified\nin human, and changes in their expression may underlie\nhypersensitivity in pain states [5]. Among Nav channels,\nNav1.7 is encoded by the gene SCN9A [26]. Nav1.7 has\nraised interest among the pain researchers, since it has\nbeen found to be related to paroxysmal extreme pain dis-\norder [15], erythromelalgia [4], and painful neuropathy in\ntype 2 diabetes [7]. Recently, Nav1.7 also has been found\nto be essential for lowering heat pain threshold after burn\ninjury [19]. Therefore, Nav1.7 is considered to play a crit-\nical role in pain pathways. In addition, Nav1.7 channel\navailability sets the AP shape, initiation of burst firing [24]\nIn this study, we aimed to investigate the role of Nav1.7 in\nburn injury.\n\n* Correspondence: zwd@zzu.edu.cn\n†Equal contributors\n1Department of Anatomy, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou\nUniversity, Henan, China\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n© 2016 Cai et al.

In addition, we exam-\nined the expression of c-fos protein because c-fos overex-\npression was associated with high-grade lesion [6, 16], and\nthe c-fos has been considered as a rapidly expressed gene\nmarker of pain [9] or nociceptive neuronal activation [10].\nSmall hairpin RNA (shRNA) is a new tool for gene knock-\ndown. For the expression of shRNA in the cells it is\nusually delivered into cells by plasmids or viral or bac-\nterial vectors [8, 23]. Slow virus vector can not only\ntransfect undivided neurons, but also can be integrated\ninto the host genome, leading to the silencing of target\ngenes for a long time and even permanently [11, 20].\nRecently, the most common carrier system for the ex-\npression of shRNA is to transfect viral vector harboring\nthe promoter of RNA pol III as well as a piece of spe-\ncial structure of its downstream gene into the host cell,\nshRNA could be cut into siRNA by Dicer enzyme in\nthe cells [18, 22, 27].\n\nMethods\nBurn injury model\nAnimal experiments were approved by the Ethics com-\nmittee of Henan province. Zhengzhou, Henan, China.\nMale SD rats (weight 180–220 g) were purchased from\n\nAnimal Experiment Center of Henan Province, housed 4\nper cage and maintained on a 12 h light/dark schedule\nin a temperature-controlled at 25 °C environment with\navailable access to food and tap water. The rats were\nrandomly divided into 2 groups (n = 16): Burn injury\ngroup: A metal plate cover floated on which water circu-\nlated from 85 °C water bath was arranged. One hind\npaw of each rat was held in contact with the metal plate\ncover for 15 s to establish the burn model. Sham group:\nSham-treated animals went through the identical treat-\nment except that the hind paw was placed on the room\ntemperature metal plate instead of 85 °C. Burn injury\nwas performed n the rats as described previously [19].\nAnesthesia was induced with 5 % isoflurane and main-\ntained at 2.5 % (V/VO2 2 l.\n\nmin-1) before the process and\nremained throughout the duration of the process. Rats\nwere allowed to recover from anesthesia in their home\ncages within 10 min after operation. According to the\nbehavioral test results, animals displayed the extreme\nacute pain on 7 d after operation. Therefore, animals\nwere sacrificed on 7 d to collect DRGs.\n\nBehavioral test\nRats were habituated to the test apparatus for at least 30\nmin before test on test days.\nBehavioral test was performed blindly to treatment\n\ngroup. Hind paw radiant heat (Hargreaves’) test: Rats\n\nwere placed in plastic chambers on a glass surface main-\ntained at 25 °C. A radiant heat source was focused on\nthe hind paw and latency to respond was recorded in\nthree trials per paw, separated by at least 10 min. Heat\nintensity was 30 % and cutoff to avoid tissue damage\nwas 30 s. von Frey test of mechanical threshold: rats\nwere placed in plastic chambers on a wire mesh grid and\nstimulated with von Frey filaments according to the up-\ndown method described previously [1].\n\nApplication of lentiviral vector-mediated shRNA\nThirty six male SD rats were randomly divided into\n2 groups (n = 18): Burn injury + empty lentiviral vec-\ntor -SCN9AsiRNA-GFP (LV3- SCN9AsiRNA-GFP group),\nburn injury + lentiviral vector negative control (LV3-NC-\nGFP group). Recombinant Lentivirus were offered by\nShanghai GenePharma Co.,Ltd. On the zero day, burn in-\njury model rats in LV3-NC group and LV3- SCN9A group\nreceived DRG microinjection [14] of 4 μl empty lentiviral\nvector and LV3- SCN9A vector, respectively. On the day\nbefore burn injury and 4 d, 7 d, 14 d, 21 d after burn injury\n(Post Operation Days, POD4, POD7.POD14, and POD21),\nmechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal\nlatency were measured. Rats were scarified on 7 d after op-\neration and DRG was collected.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nUnder deep anesthesia with isoflurane, the rats were per-\nfused with normal saline followed by cooled 4 % parafor-\nmaldehyde in 1 M phosphate buffer. L4 -6 DRGs were\ncollected at 4 d, 7 d, 14 d, and 21 d. DRG was paraffin em-\nbedded and sectioned at 20 mm. For single labeling, 3 sets\nof DRG sections (4–5 sections/DRG) were collected. After\nbeing dewaxed by gradient with xylene ethanol, the sections\nwere rinsed by PBS 5 min/times. After Antigen repair, the\nsections were blocked with goat serum for 2 h at room\ntemperature. Then, the sections were incubated with\nNav1.7 mouse monoclonal antibody (1 mg/mL; abcam) and\nC-fos goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500; Beijing Zhongshan\nbiotechnology) for 30 min at 37 °C then at 4 °C overnight.\nThe sections were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit\nantibody conjugated with FITC (1:80; Shanghai Weiao bio-\ntech) or donkey anti-mouse antibody conjugated with Cy3\n(1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h or DAPI (1:1000;\nSigma) at room temperature (RT) and covered with\nBSA (10 %; Shanghai Weiao biotech). All stained sec-\ntions were viewed with an epifluorescence microscope\n(Olympus Corporation, Japan).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nTotal protein was extracted from L4–6 DRGs of the rats\nusing tissue protein extraction reagent (Weiao Biotech,\nShanghai, China). The proteins were loaded and sepa-\nrated by sodium dodcyl sulfate (SDS)- polyacrylamide\n\nCai et al. BMC Anesthesiology  (2016) 16:59 Page 2 of 7\n\n\n\ngels, electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene\nfluoride membranes (Millipore, MA, US). The mem-\nbranes were then blocked with the blocking buffer (5 %\nfat free dry milk with TBST) for 2 h at RT and incubated\nwith rabbit anti-Nav1.7 (1:600, Abcam, England) at 4 °C\nfor 2 nights. Finally, the membranes were incubated with\ngoat anti-rabbit antibody (1:800, Zhongshan Jinqiao, China)\nfor 2 h at RT and signal was detected with ECL detection\nreagents (Alphalmager proteinsimple, San Jose, USA).\n\nStatistical analysis\nFor statistical analysis, GraphPad Prism software was\nused. Behavioral data and immune fluorescence intensity\nwere analyzed by either the Student’s t-test to compare 2\ngroups or ANOVA followed by planned comparisons of\nmultiple groups. In both cases, when significant main\neffects were observed, P < 0.05 was considered to be\nstatistically significant.\n\nResults\nNociceptive behaviors after burn injury\nAfter burn injury, SD rats displayed increased sensitivity to\nheat and mechanical stimuli. To elucidate basic mechanism\n\nof burn injury-induced sensitization, we first established\na model of focal second-degree burn in rats.\nWe found that withdrawal thresholds to heat and\n\nmechanical stimuli were reduced in the burned hind paw\nat the earliest time point examined (2–4 h after the\nheat pain) and the decreases lasted 14–21 days (Fig. 1a, b).\nHowever, no obvious changes in response thresholds were\nobserved in sham-treated rats or in the contralateral hind\npaw of burn model rats.\n\nProtein expression change after burn injury\nNext we examined the expression of Nav1.7 and c-fos\nprotein in DRG neurons of burn injury rat model. Im-\nmunohistochemical and Western blot analysis indicated\nthat Nav1.7 expression and nerve injury marker c-fos\nprotein expression were increased in DRG neurons of\nburn injury rats on day 7 after injury (Fig. 2). These data\nindicate that the expression of Nav1.7 as well as c-fos\nprotein was related to burn injury.\n\nNociceptive behaviors after treatment\nTo knockdown Nav1.7 efficiently after burn injury in\nadult rats, we injected lentiviral vector harboring Nav1.7\nshRNA into L4 DRG which innervates partial area of the\n\nFig. 1 Bury injury causes the hypersensitivity to heat and mechanical stimuli in rat. (a) Response thresholds to mechanical stimuli in the von Frey\ntest are strongly decreased on the ipsilateral side in burn model animals and unchanged in sham-treated animals. (b) neither on the contralateral\nside. Mechanical hypersensitivity resolves within 3 weeks. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001, NS: not statistically significant; n =16 rats/group.) (c)\nResponse thresholds to radiant heat stimuli (Hargreaves’test) are strongly decreased on the ipsilateral side in burn model animals and unchanged\nin sham-treated animals. (d) And there was no change on the contralateral side. Heat hypersensitivity is present at the earliest time point\nassessed and resolves within 3 weeks. (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001vs sham group; n=16 rats/ group.)\n\nCai et al. BMC Anesthesiology  (2016) 16:59 Page 3 of 7\n\n\n\nhindpaw. Lentiviral vector-mediated shRNA on 0d after\nburn injury inhibited the development of burn injury pain,\nattenuated both withdrawal thresholds to heat and mecha-\nnical stimuli on 21 d after burn injury (Fig. 3). Further-\nmore, mechanical withdrawal threshold was alleviated\nfrom 3 d after burn injury (P = 0.0008) while heat thresh-\nold was increased from 7 d after burn injury (P < 0.0001).\n\nProtein expression change after treatment\nTo further examine the effects of Nav1.7 knockdown on\nthe expression of Nav1.7 and c-fos protein in DRG neu-\nrons, we performed immunohistochemical and Western\nblot analysis. Compared with negative negative control\ngroup, Nav1.7 expression was significantly reduced in\nthe DRG of the rats in LV- SCN9A group on 7 d after\nburn injury. And the burn injury didn’t occurred the sig-\nnificant increase on c-fos protein in the DRG of the rats\nin LV- SCN9A group on 7 d after burn injury, while the\nnegative control group did (Fig. 4).\n\nDiscussion\nBurn injury arouses worldwide attention due to the large\nnumber of the patients and the abnormal acute pain\nwhich torments the patients in duration of therapy. Burn\n\ninjury causes the release of various inflammatory media-\ntors, as well as the Nav1.7 and c-fos proteins which are\nrelated to local and systemic inflammation or neurons\nactivation. In this study, we established a rat model of\nfocal second-degree burn injury to simulate the burn\ncondition, for the investigation of mechanisms under-\nlying burn-related pain. Using this model, we performed\nbehavioral experiments and also examined the expres-\nsion of sodium channel isoforms in the peripheral ner-\nvous system. We found that Nav1.7 is associated with\nburn-induced hypersensitivity to heat stimuli. Next we\ninjected lentiviral vector-mediated shRNA into DRG\nmicroinjection to knockdown SCN9A gene to under-\nstand the role of Nav1.7 in burn injury induced pain.\nRecently, several Nav1.7 inhibitor has been utilized, for\n\ninstance,benzazepinones could block Nav1.7 sodium chan-\nnels, and methadone could be a local anaesthetic-like in-\nhibitor of Nav1.7 sodium channels [21]. However, the\napplication of these inhibitors has several concerns, includ-\ning the specificity and side effects such as neurotoxicity.\nTherefore, in our present study, we chose the lentiviral\nvector-mediated shRNA to specifically knockdown Nav1.7\nto elucidate the role of Nav1.7 in burn injury pain.\nTo our knowledge, there are various ways to deliver\n\ndrugs and biological to DRG, including epidural injection\n\nFig. 2 Effect of burn injury on number of Nav1.7 and c-fos positive neurons, andexpression of Nav1.7 protein 7 d after burn injury in DRGs. a, b Nav1.7\nand c-fos labeled neurons were significantly increased after burn injury. c The expression of Nav1.7 protein was up-regulated in the DRGs of burn\nmodel rats.

BMC Anesthesiology  (2016) 16:59 Page 5 of 7\n\n\n\n(Long term catheterization), intrathecal injection [25], dir-\nect injection of the ganglion (DRG microinjection), and\ninjection of peripheral tissue or the peripheral nerve like\nsciatic nerve. Considering that Nav1.7 is mostly expressed\nin DRG, we chose the DRG microinjection method to de-\nliver lentiviral vector shRNA.\nPrevious study reported that the expression of Nav1.7\n\nwas increased in DRG neurons of burn-injury rats, thus\nwe hypothesized that inhibiting Nav1.7 expression could\nprevent or relieve pain after burn injury, and alleviate\nthe lesion in the burn injury-related neurons by reducing\nthe expression of c-fos protein. In this study, we injected\nlent virus vector Nav1.7 shRNA to the DRG of the burn-\ninjury rats at the day we perform the burn injury. Our\ndata showed that the MWT of the left hind leg of burn-\ninjury rat model had a significant rise at 4 d, 7 d and 21 d,\nexhibiting an apparent resistance to damage effect. We\nchose the 7 d after burn injury as the typical time point\nfor protein expression analysis by Western Blot, because\nit’s the time point that the ipsilateral withdrawal thresh-\nolds and latencies in the shRNA groups were both signifi-\ncantly increased.\n\nConclusions\nIn summary, our data showed that shRNA mediated\nknockdown of Nav1.7 in L5DRG led to the attenuation\nof burn injury-induced mechanical allodynia and ther-\nmal hyperalgesia as well as the decrease of the activation\nof c-fos protein.in the rat hind paw. Therefore, Nav1.7 is\na potential target to treat burn injury pain, and lentivirus\nmediated Nav1.7 shRNA have potential clinical applica-\ntion for gene therapy of burn injury pain.\n\nAbbreviations\nDRG, dorsal root ganglion; LV, lentiviral vector; NC, negative control; POD,\npost-operative days; PWL, paw withdrawal latency; PWT, 50 % paw withdrawal\nthreshold; RT, room temperature\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe gratefully acknowledge the National Natural Science Foundation\nCommittee of China and Zhengzhou University for their financial support.\n\nFunding\nThis work was supported by independent innovation project of Zhengzhou\nUniversity, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China, and grant from the\nNational Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81471144;81200866), China,\nand Special scientific research fund for young teachers of Zhengzhou\nUniversity, Zhengzhou, Henan, China\n\nAvailability of data and materials\nAll the data and materials will be available upon publication of the study results.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\nJC and WDZ contributions to the conception and design.
