Jesse Gore, Julie L. Wilson, Murray Korc*\n\nDepartments of Medicine, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, The Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center and the Center for\n\nPancreatic Cancer Research, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly cancer with a poor prognosis that is characterized by excessive\nmitogenic pathway activation and marked chemoresistance to a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic drugs. Dual\nspecificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) is a key negative regulator of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Yet,\nDUSP1 is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer cells (PCCs) in PDAC where it paradoxically enhances colony formation in soft\nagar and promotes in vivo tumorigenicity. However, it is not known whether DUSP1 overexpression contributes to PDAC\nchemoresistance. Using BxPC3 and COLO-357 human PCCs, we show that gemcitabine activates c-JUN N-terminal kinase\n(JNK) and p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), key kinases in two major stress-activated signaling pathways.\nGemcitabine-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation mediates increased apoptosis, but also transcriptionally upregulates\nDUSP1, as evidenced by increased DUSP1 mRNA levels and RNA polymerase II loading at DUSP1 gene body. Conversely,\nshRNA-mediated inhibition of DUSP1 enhances JNK and p38 MAPK activation and gemcitabine chemosensitivity. Using\ndoxycycline-inducible knockdown of DUSP1 in established orthotopic pancreatic tumors, we found that combining\ngemcitabine with DUSP1 inhibition improves animal survival, attenuates angiogenesis, and enhances apoptotic cell death,\nas compared with gemcitabine alone. Taken together, these results suggest that gemcitabine-mediated upregulation of\nDUSP1 contributes to a negative feedback loop that attenuates its beneficial actions on stress pathways and apoptosis,\nraising the possibility that targeting DUSP1 in PDAC may have the advantage of enhancing gemcitabine chemosensitivity\nwhile suppressing angiogenesis.\n\nCitation: Liu F, Gore AJ, Wilson JL, Korc M (2014) DUSP1 Is a Novel Target for Enhancing Pancreatic Cancer Cell Sensitivity to Gemcitabine.

While resection prolongs survival and\n\noffers a potential cure, 80–85% of PDAC are unresectable at the\n\ntime of diagnosis due to the presence of distant metastases,\n\nperitoneal seeding, or invasion into adjacent vital structures [2].\n\nThe chemotherapeutic agent gemcitabine (29,29-difluorodeoxycy-\n\ntidine, dFdC) has been the standard of care for patients with\n\nlocally advanced or metastatic disease [3]. Recently, the Food and\n\nDrug Administration approved the combination of gemcitabine\n\nand nab-paclitaxel, based on the finding that this combination\n\nimproved overall survival to 8.5 months versus 6.7 months with\n\ngemcitabine alone [4]. It is generally accepted that improving\n\nresponsiveness to gemcitabine in PDAC would lead to an\n\nadditional increase in patient survival.\n\nThe resistance of PDAC to gemcitabine and many other\n\nchemotherapeutic agents is due, in part, to a wide range of genetic\n\nand epigenetic alterations which lead to abnormal activation of\n\ncell survival and anti-apoptotic pathways [5], an intense desmo-\n\nplasia which interferes with drug delivery to the tumor mass [6,7],\n\nand changes in expression of key molecules involved in\n\ngemcitabine uptake, intracellular activation and efflux [8]. There\n\nis an urgent need, therefore, to advance our understanding of the\n\nmechanisms underlying chemoresistance in PDAC, in order to\n\ndevise new and more effective chemotherapeutic strategies.\n\nAbnormal activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases\n\n(MAPKs) plays a critical role in regulating cell survival and\n\napoptosis [9,10]. MAPKs can be grouped into three families:\n\nextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun-NH2 kinase\n\n(JNK), and p38 MAPK [9,10]. Upon stimulation by mitogen or\n\nenvironmental stress, MAPKs are activated through phosphory-\n\nlation on their tyrosine and threonine residues by upstream\n\nMAP2K kinases [9,10]. Activated MAPKs phosphorylate a\n\nspectrum of target substrates, including protein kinases and\n\ntranscription factors involved in regulating cell proliferation,\n\ndifferentiation, survival, and apoptosis [9,10]. Despite the\n\nexistence of crosstalk pathways among different MAPKs, most\n\nevidence supports the concept that activated ERK promotes cell\n\nproliferation, survival, and motility, while JNKs and p38 MAPKs\n\nnegatively regulate cell cycle progression and induce apoptotic cell\n\ndeath in response to environmental stress [9,10].\n\nThe dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family of proteins\n\nconsists of 25 members [11]. DUSPs can dephosphorylate both the\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e84982\n\n\n\nthreonine/serine and tyrosine residues of their substrates and thus\n\nfunction as negative regulators of MAPKs [11]. DUSP1/MKP-1 is\n\na nuclear MAPK phosphatase that is a direct transcriptional target\n\nof p53, E2F-1, c-Jun, and ATF2, and that is induced in response to\n\noxidative stress, hypoxia, and other stresses such as nutritional\n\ndeprivation and chemotherapeutic drugs [12–14]. DUSP1 is\n\noverexpressed in a range of epithelial tumors including PDAC,\n\nnon-small-cell lung cancer, breast, ovarian, gastric, and early-stage\n\nprostate cancer [15–20], and this overexpression is correlated with\n\npoor patient survival in ovarian cancer [18]. The increased\n\nDUSP1 expression in breast cancer is inversely correlated with\n\nJNK activity and markers of apoptosis, suggesting an anti-\n\napoptotic role of DUSP1 via its activity towards JNK [17]. In\n\nsupport of this conclusion, cancer cells that overexpress DUSP1\n\nare resistant to chemotherapy and Fas ligand-induced apoptosis,\n\nwhereas reduction of DUSP1 levels using a small interfering RNA\n\nenhances sensitivity to these agents [21–23]. Conversely, in\n\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increased DUSP1 levels correlate\n\nwith better prognosis [24]. Moreover, DUSP1 negatively regulates\n\nERK signaling in HCC cells, thereby inhibiting their proliferative\n\npotential, suggesting that DUSP1 is a tumor suppressor gene in\n\nHCC [24]. Thus, the deleterious consequences of DUSP1\n\noverexpression are likely cancer specific.\n\nWe reported that DUSP1 is overexpressed in PDAC, and that\n\nantisense-mediated suppression of DUSP1 expression reduces\n\ntumor development in nude mice [15]. It is not known, however,\n\nwhether DUSP1 could be a target for improving response to\n\ngemcitabine-based chemotherapy in PDAC. We now demonstrate\n\nthat gemcitabine activates JNK and p38 MAPK, thereby leading\n\nto increased apoptosis and DUSP1 transcription. Conversely,\n\nshRNA-mediated inhibition of DUSP1 enhances gemcitabine-\n\ninduced JNK and p38 MAPK activation and sensitizes PDAC cells\n\nto gemcitabine. Using a doxycycline-inducible strategy to suppress\n\nDUSP1 in established orthotopic pancreatic tumors, we show that\n\ncombining gemcitabine with DUSP1 inhibition prolongs survival,\n\nattenuates angiogenesis, and enhances apoptotic cell death. Thus,\n\nDUSP1 can be a potential therapeutic target for enhancing PDAC\n\nsensitivity to gemcitabine.\n\nResults\n\nJNK and p38 MAPK Signaling Pathways are Activated in\nResponse to Gemcitabine\n\nThe effects of gemcitabine on the PCC growth were evaluated\n\nusing the MTT assay. In all three cell lines, gemcitabine exerted a\n\ndose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. AsPC-1 was most\n\nresistant to gemcitabine, with an IC50 greater than 100 ng/mL,\n\nwhereas BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells were more sensitive to\n\ngemcitabine, with IC50 values of 10 ng/mL and 5 ng/mL,\n\nrespectively (Fig. 1A).\n\nTo evaluate the effects of gemcitabine on the activation of\n\nMAPKs, cells were incubated with gemcitabine at a concentration\n\nclose to their respective IC50 s. In BxPC-3 and COLO-357,\n\ngemcitabine induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK,\n\nkey kinases in two major stress-activated signaling pathways\n\n(Fig. 1B). Gemcitabine also increased the levels of phospho-c-Jun\n\nin these cells (Fig. 1B). Given that phospho-c-Jun is a common\n\ndownstream target of p38 MAPK and JNK pathways, this\n\nobservation confirmed the activation of p38 MAPK and JNK\n\nsignaling. Moreover, the levels of cleaved caspase 3 and cleaved\n\nPARP correlated with p38 MAPK, JNK, and c-Jun activation,\n\nsuggesting that p38 MAPK and JNK pathways mediate apoptotic\n\nFigure 1.

By contrast, AsPC-\n\n1 cells were more resistant to gemcitabine, as evidenced by the\n\nabsence of p38 MAPK and JNK activation and the lower levels of\n\ncleaved caspase 3 and cleaved PARP, even at a concentration as\n\nhigh as 100 ng/mL (Fig. 1B). To determine whether gemcitabine\n\ninduced apoptosis through p38 MAPK and JNK activation,\n\nBxPC-3 cells were incubated with gemcitabine in the absence or\n\npresence of p38 MAPK (SB203580) or JNK (SP600125) inhibitors.\n\nThe levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 were decreased\n\nby SB203580 and SP600125, when added to gemcitabine (Fig. 1C).\n\nThus, in sensitive cell lines, gemcitabine activates p38 MAPK and\n\nJNK signaling which induces apoptotic cell death, whereas\n\ngemcitabine-resistance is associated with lower levels of apoptosis\n\nand markedly attenuated p38 MAPK/JNK activation.\n\nGemcitabine Activates DUSP1 Transcription through JNK\nand p38 MAPK Signaling\n\nConsidering that DUSP1 is a key regulator of MAPK activities\n\n[11], we next examined the expression of DUSP1 in response to\n\ngemcitabine and the underlying mechanism regulating its expres-\n\nsion. In both BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells, DUSP1 mRNA and\n\nprotein levels were induced at 24 h and 48 h following\n\ngemcitabine addition, coinciding with the activation of p38\n\nMAPK and JNK (Fig. 2A). By contrast, no significant changes\n\nin DUSP1 levels were observed in gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1\n\ncells, consistent with the low levels of apoptosis and the absence of\n\np38 MAPK and JNK activation upon treatment (Fig. 2A).\n\nIn response to various stimuli, the transcription factor AP-1 (c-\n\nJun, c-Fos, ATF2), which is the major downstream target of p38\n\nMAPK and JNK signaling, has been shown to associate with the\n\nDUSP1 promoter and regulate its transcription [14,25]. To\n\ndetermine whether p38 MAPK and JNK signaling mediate the\n\ninduction of DUSP1 expression by gemcitabine, BxPC-3 and\n\nCOLO-357 cells were treated with gemcitabine in the absence or\n\npresence of SB203580, SP600125, or their combination.\n\nSB203580 and SP600125 decreased the induction of DUSP1\n\nmRNA levels by gemcitabine, whereas their combination com-\n\npletely blocked this induction. By contrast, ERK inhibition with\n\nU0126 failed to alter gemcitabine-mediated induction of DUSP1,\n\nsupporting the conclusion that p38 MAPK and JNK rather than\n\nERK signaling mediate DUSP1 induction by gemcitabine\n\n(Fig. 2B).\n\nThe increase in DUSP1 mRNA levels could be due to enhanced\n\ntranscriptional activity or posttranscriptional mRNA stability.\n\nTherefore, chromatin immunoprecipitation against RNA poly-\n\nmerase II, which is the core component of the transcription\n\nmachinery, was next carried out, followed by Q-PCR to quantify\n\nthe amount of RNA polymerase II bound to the gene body region\n\nof DUSP1. This assay allows for direct measurement of the active\n\nelongation step and reflects the transcriptional activity of the\n\nDUSP1 gene. Incubating BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells with\n\ngemcitabine for 24 h increased the amount of RNA polymerase II\n\nloading at the gene body region of DUSP1 by 6 fold and 12 fold\n\nrespectively (Fig. 2C), pointing to transcriptional activation of\n\nDUSP1 by gemcitabine.

Together, these results indicate that p38 MAPK and\n\nJNK signaling mediates DUSP1 transcriptional activation by\n\ngemcitabine.\n\nInterruption of the DUSP1 Negative Feedback Loop\nEnhances Chemosensitivity to Gemcitabine and Cisplatin\n\nTo investigate the effect of silencing DUSP1 on MAPK\n\nactivities and gemcitabine chemosensitivity, AsPC-1, BxPC-3,\n\nand COLO-357 cells were stably transduced with lentivirus\n\nexpressing shRNA against DUSP1 or non-targeting scramble\n\ncontrol and then incubated with various gemcitabine concentra-\n\ntions. In all three cell lines, DUSP1 knockdown using two shRNAs\n\nincreased the growth inhibitory actions of gemcitabine. Thus,\n\nsilencing DUSP1 shifted the IC50 values for gemcitabine in AsPC-\n\n1, BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells from 500 to 10 ng/ml, from 10 to\n\n5 ng/ml, and from to 5 to 2.5 ng/ml, respectively (Fig. 3A). These\n\nresults suggest that DUSP1 knockdown enhanced gemcitabine\n\nchemosensitivity, and that the sensitizing effects were more\n\nmarked in cells with high chemoresistance.\n\nThe anti-DUSP1 antibody routinely revealed 2 closely-migrat-\n\ning bands on western blots (Fig. 2–3). However, DUSP1\n\nknockdown with two highly specific shRNAs targeting DUSP1\n\nspecifically silenced expression of the lower band (Fig. 3B),\n\nindicating that the upper band was non-specific. DUSP1\n\nknockdown with the same highly specific shRNAs also potentiated\n\ngemcitabine-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by increased levels of\n\ncleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 3B). Higher levels of\n\ngemcitabine-induced phospho-p38 MAPK and phospho-JNK\n\nwere also noted in DUSP1 knockdown cells, compared with\n\nscramble control, suggesting that silencing DUSP1 de-repressed\n\np38 MAPK and JNK signaling, thereby leading to enhanced\n\napoptotic cell death in response to gemcitabine (Fig. 3B).\n\nConsidering that gemcitabine may be used in conjunction with\n\ncisplatin or 5-fluorouracil to treat locally advanced or metastatic\n\nPDAC [26,27], we next sought to determine whether targeting\n\nDUSP1 would have similar sensitizing effects on other chemo-\n\ntherapeutic agents besides gemcitabine. To this end, BxPC-3 and\n\nCOLO-357 cells stably expressing shRNA against DUSP1 or\n\nscramble control were treated with various concentrations of\n\ncisplatin. In both BxPC-3 and COLO-357 cells, DUSP1\n\nknockdown decreased of the IC50 from 2 to 0.5 mg/ml, and also\npotentiated cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by\n\nincreased levels of cleaved PARP and cleaved caspase 3 (Fig. 4A,\n\n4B). Higher levels of cisplatin-induced phospho-p38 MAPK and\n\nFigure 3. Effects of DUSP1 knockdown on gemcitabine response in human pancreatic cancer cells.

Taken together, these results suggest that interrupting\n\nthe negative feedback on p38 MAPK and JNK signaling by\n\nsuppressing DUSP1 could enhance apoptosis and improve the\n\nchemosensitivity of pancreatic cancer to multiple chemotherapeu-\n\ntic agents.\n\nKnockdown of DUSP4, Another Nuclear DUSP, Fails to\nEnhance Chemosensitivity\n\nWe next sought to determine whether enhanced chemosensi-\n\ntivity is unique to DUSP1 silencing or a common feature of\n\ntargeting any DUSP family members. Accordingly, we chose to\n\nknockdown DUSP4/MKP-2, due to its similarity to DUSP1 in\n\nterms of subcellular localization and substrate preference [11].\n\nAsPC-1 and BxPC-3 cells were stably transduced with lentivirus\n\nencoding shRNA against DUSP4 or non-targeting scramble\n\ncontrol. Successful silencing of DUSP4 was confirmed with\n\nimmunoblotting (Fig. 5B). However, DUSP4 knockdown failed\n\nto affect MAPK activation or the response to gemcitabine in either\n\ncell line (Fig. 5A, 5B). Thus, DUSP1 is a potential therapeutic\n\ntarget for potentiating stress-activated MAPKs signaling and\n\nenhancing gemcitabine chemosensitivity, which is not necessarily\n\na shared characteristic of all DUSP family members.\n\nGemcitabine and DUSP1 Knockdown Combine to\nProlong Survival, Attenuate Tumor Angiogenesis and\nProliferation, and Enhance Apoptosis\n\nWe next sought to evaluate the effect of inhibiting DUSP1 on\n\ngemcitabine chemosensitivity in an orthotopic mouse model. To\n\nstudy the therapeutic potential of targeting DUSP1 in fully\n\nestablished pancreatic tumors, we stably transduced COLO-357\n\nhuman pancreatic cancer cells with lentivirus expressing doxycy-\n\ncline-inducible shRNA against DUSP1 or a non-targeting\n\nscramble control, before injecting the cells into the pancreas of\n\nimmunodeficient mice in a TET-OFF state. Two weeks later, cells\n\nexpressing doxycycline-inducible shRNA against DUSP1 or\n\nscramble control formed tumors of similar size, which could be\n\neasily palpated. All the mice were imaged on day 15 post-surgery,\n\nusing a high resolution ultrasound, and tumor volumes were\n\ncalculated based on acquired 3-D images, confirming that both\n\ngroups formed tumors of equal volume (Fig. 6). Starting at day 18\n\npost-surgery, doxycycline was continuously administered in the\n\ndrinking water, and mice were randomized into 2 groups to\n\nreceive vehicle or gemcitabine (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injec-\n\ntion, twice weekly). Gemcitabine alone or DUSP1 silencing alone\n\nfailed to prolong animal survival (Fig. 7A). However, comparison\n\nof the shRNA-scramble/gemcitabine group and the shRNA-\n\nDUSP1/gemcitabine group revealed that DUSP1 knockdown\n\nFigure 4.

The increase in survival time\n\nwas even greater when comparing the shRNA-DUSP1/gemcita-\n\nbine group with the shRNA-scramble/vehicle group (p = 0.009),\n\nsuggesting that DUSP1 silencing enhanced gemcitabine sensitivity\n\nin vivo (Fig. 7A).\n\nIn agreement with in vitro findings, gemcitabine treatment\n\nincreased DUSP1 mRNA levels in shRNA-scramble tumors.\n\nMost of the shRNA-DUSP1 tumors had relatively low levels of\n\nDUSP1, whereas one tumor showed high DUSP1 levels, possibly\n\ndue to shorter doxycycline exposure or contamination with\n\nadjacent non-tumor tissue when harvesting the sample. These\n\nresults suggest that doxycycline successfully induced shRNA\n\nexpression. However, due to high variability among each mouse,\n\nthe difference in DUSP1 levels among different groups was not\n\nstatistically significant (Fig. 7B).\n\nTo evaluate the effects of DUSP1 silencing and gemcitabine\n\ntreatment on tumor angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis,\n\ntumor tissues were next analyzed by immunohistochemical\n\nstaining for CD34 (angiogenesis) and Ki67 (proliferation), as well\n\nas by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end\n\nlabeling (TUNEL) and cleaved caspase 3 immunoreactivity, both\n\nof which are markers of apoptosis. Gemcitabine slightly attenuated\n\nCD34 and Ki67 signals, while DUSP1 knockdown had a marked\n\ninhibitory effect on CD34 staining and a more moderate but\n\nhighly significant inhibitory effect on Ki67 staining (Fig. 7C, 7D).\n\nDUSP1 silencing also led to enhanced cleaved caspase 3\n\nimmunoreactivity and TUNEL signals, compared with scramble\n\ncontrol tumors, indicating that there was an increase in apoptotic\n\ncell death following DUSP1 knockdown. The increase in caspase 3\n\ncleavage and DNA fragmentation was even greater when\n\ncombining DUSP1 silencing with gemcitabine (Fig. 7C, 7D).\n\nThus, targeting DUSP1 in vivo led to suppressed angiogenesis and\n\ncancer cell proliferation, and enhanced gemcitabine-induced\n\napoptosis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nJNK1, -2, and -3 are encoded by MAPK8, MAPK9 and\n\nMAPK10, respectively, and alternative splicing gives rise to at\n\nleast ten isoforms [9]. By contrast, p38 MAPK-a, -b, -c and -d are\nencoded by MAPK14, MAPK11, MAPK12, and MAPK13, respec-\n\ntively, and there are two alternatively spliced isoforms of MAPK14\n\n[9].

While\n\nthe role of specific isoforms was not evaluated, gemcitabine-\n\nactivated JNK and p38 MAPK signaling also induced DUSP1\n\ntranscription, as evidenced by increased DUSP1 mRNA levels and\n\nincreased RNA polymerase II loading at DUSP1 gene body.\n\nMoreover, shRNA-mediated inhibition of DUSP1 enhanced\n\ngemcitabine-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation and\n\nsensitized PDAC cells to gemcitabine and cisplatin, leading to\n\ndecreased cell proliferation and increased PARP and caspase 3\n\ncleavage. These results suggest that gemcitabine-mediated activa-\n\ntion of JNK and p38 MAPK leads to the upregulation of DUSP1,\n\nwhich in turn contributes to a negative feedback loop that\n\nattenuates JNK and p38 MAPK activities, thereby interfering with\n\nthe beneficial actions of gemcitabine on stress pathways and\n\napoptosis (Fig. 8). These observations raise the possibility that\n\nDUSP1 can be a potential therapeutic target for enhancing PDAC\n\nsensitivity to multiple chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover,\n\nDUSP1 targeting leads to increased levels of p-ERK1 and p-\n\nERK2 [15], and ERK activation in pancreatic cancer cells\n\nenhances gemcitabine chemoresistance [28]. Thus, gemcitabine-\n\ninduced increases in JNK and p38 MAPK activities are crucial for\n\nits pro-apoptotic actions.\n\nDownregulation of DUSP1 suppresses the expression of\n\nangiogenic factors, such as SH2D2A and VEGF-C in non-small-\n\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and functional assays have\n\nconfirmed the role of DUSP1 in promoting tumor angiogenesis\n\n[29]. Furthermore, in human NSCLC specimens, DUSP1 co-\n\nlocalizes with CD31-positive vascular structures, and a close\n\ncorrelation between increased VEGF-C and DUSP1 expression\n\nhas been demonstrated [29]. These results support the concept\n\nthat DUSP1 may play an important role in tumor angiogenesis.\n\nAlthough PDAC is characterized by marked desmoplasia and\n\nhypoperfusion, it also exhibits a high propensity to metastasize via\n\nhematogenous or lymphatic routes, even when the primary tumor\n\nis small [30]. Moreover, PDAC exhibits foci of micro-angiogenesis\n\nand overexpress multiple pro-angiogenic factors, and enhanced\n\nangiogenesis, high serum VEGF-A levels, and increased VEGFR-\n\n2 expression have been correlated with a worse prognosis in\n\nPDAC patients [30]. Together, these reports underscore the\n\npotential importance of aberrant angiogenesis in PDAC and\n\nimplicate DUSP1 as contributing to this process.\n\nUsing doxycycline-inducible knockdown of DUSP1 in estab-\n\nlished orthotopic pancreatic tumors, in the present study we\n\ndetermined that combining gemcitabine with DUSP1 inhibition\n\nprolonged animal survival and enhanced apoptotic cell death,\n\ncompared with gemcitabine alone. In addition, DUSP1 knock-\n\ndown markedly attenuated PCC proliferation and tumor angio-\n\ngenesis. Our use of immune deficient mice precludes an\n\nassessment of the consequence of DUSP1 inhibition on the\n\nFigure 6. Quantitation of orthotopic tumors.

Given that DUSP1 is known to\n\nmodulate macrophage proliferation and activation [31], studies\n\nwith syngeneic or genetically engineered mouse models of PDAC\n\nwill be required to address this aspect of DUSP1 function in\n\nPDAC.\n\nThe mechanisms that lead to increased DUSP1 expression in\n\nPDAC are not known. It has been demonstrated, however, that\n\nhypoxia can upregulate DUSP1 transcription [14], and PDAC is a\n\nhighly desmoplastic tumor with a markedly hypoxic microenvi-\n\nronment [5–7]. Moreover, in the presence of oxidative stress,\n\nE2F1 induces DUSP1 expression [13], and E2F1 is upregulated in\n\nPDAC as a consequence of RB dysfunction and excessive PI3K\n\nactivation [32,33]. Taken together with the present findings, these\n\nobservations suggest that PDAC may be ‘‘primed’’ to exhibit\n\nincreased DUSP1 activation in response to gemcitabine, and\n\nsuggest that targeting DUSP1 in PDAC could enhance the\n\nbeneficial actions of gemcitabine by promoting apoptosis and\n\nsuppressing pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and tumor\n\nangiogenesis.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics Statement\nAll animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal\n\nCare and Use Committee of Indiana University (Permit Number:\n\n10108).
