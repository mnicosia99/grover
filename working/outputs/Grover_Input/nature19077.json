Carlson, Michael Hsu & Irina M. Conboy  Nature 454, 528-532 (2008); doi:10.1038/nature07034  In Fig. 1a of this Letter, the immunofluorescence images for myostatin  and follistatin are inaccurate owing to many versions of this figure in  multiple revisions of our manuscript. Specifically, the immunofluores- cence panels representing anti-myostatin and anti-follistatin staining  were duplicated. We would like to thank the anonymous reader who  pointed out this error. We have repeated the age-specific immunoflu- orescence experiments for myostatin and follistatin, and the results  confirm our original conclusion that no age-specific differences are  detected (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we have performed quantification of  the pixel density, and although there are areas with higher and lower  signals for these proteins in both young and old muscle sections, the  P values suggest no age-specific differences. We thank M. Mehdipour  for performing the experiments and analysing the data on age-specific  muscle tissue levels of myostatin and follistatin.

Shown are  representative images at × 20. Dystrophin immunofluorescence (green)  outlines the muscle fibres in 10-μ m skeletal muscle cryosections that are  immunostained for follistatin and myostatin (red); Hoechst (blue) stains  all nuclei. P values for mean pixel density of myostatin and follistatin   (with rabbit IgG control signals subtracted) show no statistically  significant differences between young and old muscle.    2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.
