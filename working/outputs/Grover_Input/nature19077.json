Carlson, Michael Hsu & Irina M. Conboy\n\nNature 454, 528–532 (2008); doi:10.1038/nature07034\n\nIn Fig. 1a of this Letter, the immunofluorescence images for myostatin \nand follistatin are inaccurate owing to many versions of this figure in \nmultiple revisions of our manuscript. Specifically, the immunofluores-\ncence panels representing anti-myostatin and anti-follistatin staining \nwere duplicated. We would like to thank the anonymous reader who \npointed out this error. We have repeated the age-specific immunoflu-\norescence experiments for myostatin and follistatin, and the results \nconfirm our original conclusion that no age-specific differences are \ndetected (Fig. 1). Furthermore, we have performed quantification of \nthe pixel density, and although there are areas with higher and lower \nsignals for these proteins in both young and old muscle sections, the \nP\xa0values suggest no age-specific differences. We thank M. Mehdipour \nfor performing the experiments and analysing the data on age-specific \nmuscle tissue levels of myostatin and follistatin.\n\nCORRECTIONS & AMENDMENTS\n\nFollistatin Dystrophin Hoechst\n\nYoung Old Young Old\n\nMyostatin Dystrophin Hoechst\n\na\n\nFigure 1 | This is a repeat of Fig. 1a of the original Letter. Shown are \nrepresentative images at × 20. Dystrophin immunofluorescence (green) \noutlines the muscle fibres in 10-μ m skeletal muscle cryosections that are \nimmunostained for follistatin and myostatin (red); Hoechst (blue) stains \nall nuclei. P\xa0values for mean pixel density of myostatin and follistatin  \n(with rabbit IgG control signals subtracted) show no statistically \nsignificant differences between young and old muscle.\n\n© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.
