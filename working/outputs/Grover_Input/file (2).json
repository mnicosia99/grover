However, the nature and regulation of the innate and\n\nadaptive immune systems of this waterfowl species are not completely understood due to\n\nlimited information on the goose genome. Recently, transcriptome sequencing technology\n\nwas applied in the genomic studies focused on novel gene discovery. Thus, this study de-\n\nscribed the transcriptome of the goose peripheral blood lymphocytes to identify immunity\n\nrelevant genes.\n\nPrincipal Findings\n\nDe novo transcriptome assembly of the goose peripheral blood lymphocytes was se-\nquenced by Illumina-Solexa technology. In total, 211,198 unigenes were assembled from\n\nthe 69.36 million cleaned reads. The average length, N50 size and the maximum length of\n\nthe assembled unigenes were 687 bp, 1,298 bp and 18,992 bp, respectively. A total of\n\n36,854 unigenes showed similarity by BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant (Nr)\n\nprotein database. For functional classification, 163,161 unigenes were comprised of three\n\nGene Ontology (Go) categories and 67 subcategories. A total of 15,334 unigenes were an-\n\nnotated into 25 eukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) categories. Kyoto Encyclopedia of\n\nGenes and Genomes (KEGG) database annotated 39,585 unigenes into six biological func-\n\ntional groups and 308 pathways. Among the 2,757 unigenes that participated in the 15 im-\n\nmune system KEGG pathways, 125 of the most important immune relevant genes were\n\nsummarized and analyzed by STRING analysis to identify gene interactions and relation-\n\nships. Moreover, 10 genes were confirmed by PCR and analyzed. Of these 125 unigenes,\n\n109 unigenes, approximately 87%, were not previously identified in the goose.\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 1 / 30\n\nOPEN ACCESS\n\nCitation: Tariq M, Chen R, Yuan H, Liu Y, Wu Y,\nWang J, et al.

After genome se-\nquencing of the chicken and duck, both became the first-class avian species, which allows im-\nmunologic comparison with other animals [1,2]. Subsequently, the avian species have been\nfurther elucidated in the evolutionary process [2], with the recent availability in fish and mam-\nmal genomes [3]. The goose genome requires study because it is one of the most important wa-\nterfowl species and is also a vital component in the fast-growing poultry economy of China,\nwhich has become the largest goose production country in the world [2].\n\nInterest in the goose immune system comes not only from its importance as a food animal\nspecies, but also for its role as a natural reservoir of many avian viruses, such as influenza virus\n[4]. Therefore, it is essential to illustrate the nature and regulation of the innate and adaptive\nimmune systems in the goose [5]. However, except chicken and other poultry such as goose,\nrelatively little is known about their immune systems at the molecular level [6]. Thus, the dis-\ncovery of important immune genes and functional studies can help elucidate immunological\nresponses and the natural or inherited disease resistance ability. To date, only a few research\nstudies have examined the goose species and their relevant genes; some of the genes, including,\nCD8α [6], CD4 [4], interleukin(IL)-17A [7], IL-6 [8], Toll like receptor (TLR) 5 [9], MHCI/II\n[5,10], interferon(IFN)-γ [11], IFN-α [12] and IL-2 [13] were cloned. Despite these studies,\nmany genes related to the goose immune system remain unknown.\n\nTo date, the goose transcriptome profiling studies on the identifying the genes responsible\nfor follicle development and reproductive biology in the laying and broodiness [2,14], and\ncomprehensive analyzing the transcriptome of geese to understand the geese development and\nmetabolism [15] has been reported. These research studies were quite different from identify-\ning genes related to the goose immune system. To study the immune system, we are the first to\npresent here the de novo transcriptome of Chinese goose (Anser cygnoides) peripheral blood\nlymphocytes (PBLs) using Illumina-Solexa sequencing technology, which is a powerful tool for\ntranscriptome analysis [16]. All of the obtained transcriptome and unigenes were annotated\nlargely from the duck and the chicken, because these two species are closely related to the\ngoose. This study produced the first characterized transcriptome of this waterfowl and provid-\ned a genomic picture related to previously undiscovered immune genes. Through the function-\nal annotation of the assembled sequences and identification of the sequenced unigenes, our\nstudy identified important novel immune genes related to antigen processing and presentation,\ntoll like receptor signaling pathways, complement cascades, natural killer cell-mediated cyto-\ntoxicity response, and inflammatory response by chemokines and cytokine-mediated signaling\npathways in the goose.\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 2 / 30\n\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics Statement\nThis study was conducted according to the management regulations of experimental animals\nin Beijing and was approved by the Animal Care Committee of China Agricultural University,\nBeijing, People's Republic of China.\n\nGeese Rearing and Blood Sample Preparation\nThe five Chinese geese used in this study were raised in the animal isolator house, college of\nveterinary medicine, China agricultural university, Beijing. These birds were kept under same\nenvironmental conditions and provide ad libitum water and locally available commercial feed.\nThe blood samples from geese were collected by sterilizing the wing and femoral vein with the\nsurgical cotton containing 70% alcohol. From each bird, 5–10 ml blood was taken and properly\nmixed with equal volume of EDTA as an anticoagulant, containing tube (1:1) (TBDscience,\nChina).\n\nPeripheral Blood Lymphocytes Separation and RNA Extraction\nFor the separation of PBLs, we used a sterile pipette to take 5 ml blood, and added to an equal\nvolume of PBS and mixed well. Then slowly added the blood/PBS mixture on the top of the\n10 ml Ficoll-hypaque solution containing tube and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. After\ncentrifugation, the tube contained 4 layers (first layer: plasma layer, second layer: white lym-\nphocyte layer, third layer: transparent Ficoll-hypaque layer and fourth layer: erythrocytes). At\nthis point, we removed the upper layer that contains the plasma and most platelets, and the sec-\nond layer containing lymphocytes was carefully aspirated with a sterile pipette into a new cen-\ntrifuge tube, which contained 10 ml of washing solution. The tube was thoroughly mixed and\ncentrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 min. Then removed supernatant, re-suspend cells in washing\nbuffer, and the washing step was repeated twice to obtain the lymphocytes. The total RNA\nwas extracted from the collected Chinese goose lymphocytes using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA)\naccording to the manufacturer’s protocol. Total RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I\n(Promega, USA) for 30 min and then incubated at 37°C to remove residual DNA. The RNA\npurification was carried out using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, USA) following the manufac-\nturer’s instructions.\n\ncDNA Library Construction\nTotal RNA was prepared to construct the cDNA library and Illumina-Solexa was carried out.\nIn brief, mRNA was isolated and purified from 10 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic\nbeads, and short fragments (200–700 bp) were obtained. These short RNA fragments were\nused as templates for first-strand cDNA synthesis by random hexamer–primers, and then the\nsecond-strand cDNA as synthesized by adding buffer, dNTPs, RNAse H and DNA polymerase\nI. After purification and paired-end (PE) repair, 5’ and 3’ ends of the cDNA fragments were li-\ngated with sequencing adapters and were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to\ngenerate the templates. The cDNA templates were further enriched by PCR amplification to\ngenerate the cDNA library. The cDNA library was sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq 2000 se-\nquencing platform and the raw reads were generated using the Solexa pipeline according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions.\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 3 / 30\n\n\n\nDe Novo Transcriptome Assembly\nThe raw reads were cleaned by removing adapter sequences, non-coding RNA (such as rRNA,\ntRNA and miRNA) and low-quality sequences (reads with uncertain bases ‘N’). To insure the\nquality control of raw read data, we used two steps; the first was the sliding window method\nto remove low quality segments (Threshold quality 20, window size 5 bp, and threshold length\n35 bp), and the second was the removal of reads that contained N as a part of the sequence\n(Threshold length 35bp). De novo transcriptome assembly was performed by the Trinity pro-\ngram [17] (Version r2013/08/14), and the longest transcription sequences were taken and de-\nfined as unigenes. To measure RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped\nreads), the number of sequenced reads that aligned to a gene must be normalized to remove\nthe biases in the aligned sequences [18]. The RPKM was calculated for all assembled unigenes\nin every sample by single-end mapping using software bowtie2 (version 2.1.0). The unique fea-\nture of this tool is that it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome and therefore it is\nmostly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies [19]. All unigenes were\narranged in descending order from the first unigene. When the assembled length covered half\nof the total length of all unigenes, the length of the current unigenes was considered to be N50.\nAnd when the assembled length covers 90% of the total length, the length of the current uni-\ngene was considered to be N90. The sequence database generated in this study is available at\nthe National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database Short Read Archive\nunder the accession number SRX399106.\n\nAnnotation and Classification of the De Novo Transcriptome\nAll unigenes were searched for homologous genes using BLAST and annotation against the\nNCBI Nr database (non-redundant, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), using an E-value cut-off of\n10−5. Unigene sequences were also aligned by BLASTx to various protein databases in the fol-\nlowing order: Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/), Gene Ontology(GO)\n(http://www.geneontology.org/), Conserved Domain Database (CDD) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.\nnih.gov/cdd/), Pfam database (http://pfam.janelia.org/), eukaryotic Orthologous Groups\n(KOGs) (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG/KOG/), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Ge-\nnomes (KEGG) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/). The unigenes were sorted to recover proteins\nwith the most similarity to the given unigenes with putative functional annotations. When the\naligned results were different from database sequences, then most privileged results of Nr were\nselected, followed by the Swiss-port, TrEMBL, CDD, PFAM, GO, KOG and KEGG databases.\nGO terms at the 2nd level were used to perform the GO annotation of the unigenes under the\nbiological, molecular functions and cellular components. The unigene sequences were also\naligned to the KOG database to predict and classify possible functions, and the pathway assign-\nments were performed according to the KEGG pathway database [20].\n\nIdentification and Annotation of the Goose Immunity Relevant Genes\nThe identification of the most important immunity relevant genes was assembled mainly ac-\ncording to search in our BLAST annotation results to the NCBI databases. A set of keywords\nrepresentative of immune genes was used to predict immune-related genes based on the anno-\ntation results. Similarly, to find the most genes belonging to functions of the immune system,\nthe GO term and KEGG pathway information were also used to identify the most important\ngenes. The immune genes were detected not only as described by [21], but also according to\nthe GO categories “response to stimulus” and “immune system process”, and KEGG pathways\n“immune system” and “immune diseases,” which had a direct relationship with the immunity\ngenes. Then the finding of the presence and absence of immune relevant genes of goose in\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 4 / 30\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/uniprot/\nhttp://www.geneontology.org/\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd/\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd/\nhttp://pfam.janelia.org/\nhttp://ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG/KOG/\nhttp://www.genome.jp/kegg/\n\n\ncomparison with the duck, chicken, turkey and zebra finch were individually search by gene\nname and identifying regions of the goose immune related genes that were conserved in other\nspecies using BLAST annotation results of the NCBI database.\n\nSTRING Analysis\nTo find out the functional relationship among immune relevant genes, 125 transcripts were im-\nported by selecting Gallus gallus as a model organism to STRING 9.1 http://string-db.org/ (a\ndatabase of known and predicted protein interactions), which responds by displaying a net-\nwork of nodes (proteins) connected by colored edges representing functional relationships. In-\nteractions of these genes were identified, based on the evidence indicated in the edge map. The\nSTRING database assembles data from genomic context, high-throughput experiments, con-\nserved co-expression and data mining to integrate data from these sources into groups with di-\nrect physical and indirect functional associations. Complete knowledge of all direct and\nindirect interactions between proteins represents an important milestone towards a compre-\nhensive description of cellular mechanisms and functions [22].\n\nPCR Reaction\nPCR was performed to confirm the expression of the recognized immune-related genes. Ten\ngenes, BAFF, C1qA, C1qB, C1qC, SOCS1, SOCS3, TLR3, IL1RL1, C8G and CD74 were utilized\nto confirm the sequencing data. Genes were selected based on their functions in innate, adap-\ntive immune system and signaling pathways. Primer sequences were designed according to se-\nquences from our transcriptome data. Information of individual primer sequences of the\nselected 10 genes are listed in S1 Table. For PCR, a TAKARA LA Taq and Primer STAR HS\nDNA Polymerase kits (Takara Biotechnology (Dalian) Co.Ltd) were used according to the\nmanufacturers’ instructions. All reactions were run in triplicate.\n\nData Analysis\nAmino acid sequences alignment of 10 immune relevant genes (BAFF, C1qA, C1qB, C1qC,\nSOCS1, SOCS3, TLR3, IL1RL1, C8G and CD74) was analyzed by the ClustalW2.0 program\n(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/) and phylogenetic trees of C1qs and SOCSs con-\nstructed by the neighbor-joining method with Mega 5.1 software [23].\n\nResults\n\nIllumina-Solexa Sequencing and De Novo Assembly\nDe novo transcriptome sequence data were obtained using Illumina-Solexa deep sequencing to\nunderstand the genetic structural design of the goose lymphocyte transcriptome. A cDNA li-\nbrary of goose peripheral blood lymphocytes was sequenced using Illumina-Solexa sequencing\ntechnology. Through Solexa RNA paired end sequencing, we generated 91.93 million raw\nreads with 9.19 Giga base pairs (Gbp) as listed in Table 1. After removing adaptor sequences,\nambiguous nucleotides and low-quality sequences, 69.36 million clean reads with a length of\n93.65 bp remained. The GC content and average length was 47% and 93.65 bp, respectively.\nAssembly of all of the clean reads resulted in 211,198 unigenes that ranged from 201 bp to\n18,992 bp with the average length of 687 bp and a total length size of 69.5 Mb. Next, all uni-\ngenes were sorted in descending order to find the N50 length of 1298 bp and the N90 length of\n260 bp. All assembled 211,198 unigene transcripts were more than 200 bp in the length, which\nindicated that the unigenes were worthy and assured most of the transcriptome sequences. The\nlength distribution of the assembled unigenes in the sequenced cDNA library was shown in\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 5 / 30\n\nhttp://string-db.org/\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalw2/\n\n\nFig. 1A, with the highest number of unigenes (91,069) and the lowest number of unigenes\n(947) collected under 250 bp and 1950 bp length sizes, respectively.\n\nThe number of clean reads to each annotated unigene was calculated and then normalized\nby RPKM and bowtie2 software. Out of the 211,198 unigenes, 143,901 (approximately 68.1%)\nhad a RPKM value less than one, 59,616 (28.2%) had a RPKM value between 1 and 10, 4051\n(1.9%) had a RPKM value between 10 and 100, and 3630 (1.7%) had a RPKM value of greater\nthan 100 (Fig. 1B).\n\nBLAST Analysis\nThe quality control reads data were randomly selected and aligned with the NCBI nucleotide\ndatabase. For each query, we selected the best one among all of the aligned sequences with an\nE-value of 10−10 and that covered more than 80% similarity. All unigene sequences were\naligned against the public database using the BLAST comparison to known sequence databases\nand functional annotation with similarity>30% and an E-value cut of 10−5. The alignment re-\nsults of the public databases (Nr, Swissport, TrEMBL, Pfam, CDD, KOG and KEGG) were\nshown in Table 2. The aligned sequences were matched with the Nr 17.44%, TrEMBL 17.70%\nand SWISSPORT 15.14% databases, respectively. The 36,854 (17.44%) unigene BLAST hits in\nthe Nr database were studied as the Nr database had the maximum annotated unigenes. How-\never, the alignments with Nr database were in the top five hits species (Fig. 1C), and most of\nthe aligned sequences were matched to the Gallus gallus 17,238 (55.59%). The E-value distribu-\ntion showed that 13,890 (37.7%) unigenes were significantly homologous with a significance of\n1E-5 to 1E-50, and 7123 unigenes were in the range from 1E-50 to 1E-100 (Fig. 1D). Similarly,\nthe identity distribution of unigenes revealed that 26,985 (73.2%) unigenes were highly\nmatched to 80–100% identity and 5436 (14.7%) unigenes were between 60–80% matched\n(Fig. 1E). In addition, the score distribution showed that 900 (7.8%) unigenes had scores less\nthan 500, 84 (0.7%) unigenes had scored more than 3,000, and 6882 unigenes (60.1%), which\nwas the greatest number, had a score between 500 and 1000 (Fig. 1F).\n\nTable 1.

The NCBI\neukaryotic orthologous groups (KOGs) include sequences from 7 eukaryotic genomes [24]. To\nfurther evaluate the transcriptome library, the accuracy of our annotation sequences in the\nKOG functional classification was examined. All unigenes were aligned to the KOG database\nfor prediction and classification into different functional categories. There were 15,334 uni-\ngenes annotated into 25 KOG categories (Fig. 2). The largest group was signal transduction\nmechanism at 5787 (2.74%) followed by the general function prediction only at 2792 (1.32%),\nposttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones at 2168 (1.02%), and cytoskeleton\nat 1876 (0.88%). Nuclear structure 75 (0.03%) and cell motility 45 (0.02%) were the KOG cate-\ngories with the least represented unigenes.\n\nGene Ontology (GO) is an international standardized gene functional classification system\nthat uses strict definitions to comprehensively describe the properties of genes and their prod-\nucts in any organism [25]. A total of 163,161 unigenes were assigned in GO annotations and\nwere divided into three categories and 67 functional categories. The biological process category\ncontained 72,844 unigenes, followed by the 60,500 in the cellular component category and\n29,817 in molecular function category (Fig. 3). In the biological process category, ‘cellular pro-\ncess’ at 14,596 (8.95%), ‘metabolic process’ at 12,660 (7.75%) and biological regulation at 7317\n(4.48%) were the most highly represented. In addition, unigenes were categorized into other 27\nimportant biological processes, including ‘regulation biological process’ at 7075 (4.33%) uni-\ngenes, ‘response to stimulus’ at 4686 (2.8%) unigenes, ‘signaling’ at 3570 (2.2%) unigenes and\n‘immune system process’ at 512 (0.3%) unigenes, which were mainly involved in resistance or\nthe defense system in the geese. However, 17 GO functional groups were assigned to the cellu-\nlar component category with ‘cell’ and ‘cell part’ with the same number of unigenes at 13,309\n(8.15%), followed by ‘organelle’ at 8771 (5.37%) and ‘membrane’ at 6,841 (4.19%) as the most\nrepresented. Likewise, 20 GO functional groups were assigned into the molecular function cat-\negory with ‘binding’ at 13,457 (8.2%) and ‘catalytic activity’ at 9,144 (5.60%) as the most\nhighly represented.\n\nTo evaluate the biological system of the geese, we aligned the annotated sequences to the\ncorresponding KEGG pathways and analyzed the relationship between unigene and pathways\nto further understand the biological functions and gene interactions [20]. Out of 211,198 uni-\ngenes, 39,585 (18.74% of total unigenes) KEGG pathways and annotated unigenes were catego-\nrized into six biological functional groups (Table 3). A total of 39,585 unigenes had significant\nmatches in the database and were assigned to 308 KEGG pathways. Some of unigenes were\nmapped to more than one pathway. Among unigenes mapped into pathways, the highest\n\nTable 2.

The lymphocytes have pivotal functions in cell-mediate\nimmunity: the innate (by NK cells) and adaptive (by T-cells) immune systems, as well as the\nantibody derived humoral (by B cells) immune response, are the main functions of lymphocyte\n[25]. Our present analysis show that large numbers of the unigenes lye in the immune relevant\npathways. Out of the six groups listed above, human diseases and organismal systems con-\ntained the most unigenes. Within organismal systems, it is noteworthy that the immune sys-\ntems group, comprised 2757 (6.96%) out of 39,585 unigenes were involved in 17 KEGG\npathways (Table 3).

In this study, we were interested in identifying im-\nmune-related genes in the transcriptome of the goose PBLs. According to the literature and\nour sequence analyses, 125 immune-related genes were identified (Table 4). We identified the\nmost important genes that are relevant to immunity in different KEGG pathways. The antigen\nprocessing and presentation category contained 10 unigenes, including MHCI, MHCII,\nTAPBP. The toll-like receptor signaling pathway category contained 13 unigenes, including\nTLR-2, −3, −4, −5, −7, −13, −15, −18, FADD, LY96, MyD88. The chemokine signaling pathway\ncategory contained 14 unigenes, including CCLs, CCRs, CXCRs, XCR1. The cytokine-cytokine\nreceptor interaction category contained 30 unigenes, including ILs, ILRs, IRAK, BMP2,\nTGFBR. The transcription factors for immune response category contained 15 unigenes, in-\ncluding IFRs, MX, BLNK, NOD1. The complement and coagulation cascades category con-\ntained 18 unigenes, including C2, C3, C5, C8, C1S, C1R, C1qA-C, MBL, A2M. The natural\nkiller cell mediates cytotoxicity category contained 11 unigenes unigenes, including PRF1,\nNFAT, MAP3K14, LCK, PAK1, ZAP70, LCP2, MST1R, PTPN1, CTLA4 The NF-kappa B sig-\nnaling pathway category contained 10 unigenes, including NFKBI, CARD11, BTK, MALT1,\nTRAF3, BAFF. The Jak-STAT signaling pathway category contained 5 unigenes, including\nSOCS1, SOCS3, CBL, STAT1, STAT3 (Table 4). Of the 125 unigenes, only 16 (approximately\n13%) unigenes from the known goose species (anser anser 9, and anser cygnoides 7) were iden-\ntified using an NCBI database blast search.

The\nmature peptides of the C1qA, B, C chains are 243, 244 and 242 amino acids in size, respectively\n(Figs. 6–8).

A motif shared between C1qA, B and\nC, Hyp-Gly-Lys-X-Gly-Pro/Tyr/Asn (where Hyp is hydroxyproline), mediates binding to C1r\nand C1s [28]. Similar regions are also observed in the goose C1q chains, such as Hyp79-Phe84\nin C1qA, Hyp77-Pro82 in C1qB and Hyp84-Pro89 in C1qC. Among them, the C1r-C1s bind-\ning regions are most conserved in C1qB, followed by C1qC. Most of the variations are found in\nC1qAs, especially among the avian species.\n\nAs a versatile pattern recognition molecule, the heterotrimeric globular domain (gC1q) of\nC1q is thought to be capable of engaging a broad range of ligands, including aggregated IgG\nand IgM, C-reactive protein (CRP), human T cell lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-I) gp21 peptide\n[29]. Val183, Arg184, Arg185 in human C1qA, Arg126, Arg139 and Arg154 in human C1qB\nand Arg184 in human C1qC are the key sites for IgG interaction. These sites are strictly con-\nserved in the goose C1qB and in other C1qBs. These sites are not seen in the C1qAs and C1qCs\nof other species, even in a mammal (mouse). The Lys200 and Trp147 sites of human C1qA\nthat interact with CRP are not found in other species, except for in the mouse. Tyr198 of the\nhuman C1qB is relatively well conserved among different species because the same or similar\namino acids are found in other C1qBs. In contrast, His129, Pro131, Ala133 and Pro134 of\nhuman C1qC, which are important in binding to the HTLVI gp21 peptide, are not observed in\nother C1qCs. However, the calcium ion binding sites of C1qs are strictly conserved from geese\nto humans. These sites are Gln195 in goose C1qA, and Asp192, Tyr193 and Gln199 in goose\nC1qB. The different conservation of binding sites may reflect the presence of different ligands\nin different species.\n\nAnother important component of innate immunity is the Toll like receptor family. Here, we\nidentified goose TLR3 using our EST library. The extracellular region of goose TLR3 has 22\nLRR regions, 1 LRRNT region and 1 LRRCT region (S2 Fig.). The identity of goose TLR3 to\nother TLRs ranges from 95.88% to 59.45%. Similar to human TLR3, the N-glycosylation sites\nof goose TLR3 are related to the specific interaction surface structure [30] and are Asn25,\nAsn43, Asn97, Asn168, Asn219, Asn224, Asn247, Asn360, Asn469, Asn598 and Asn624. Some\nvariant sites are also observed in goose TLR3, such as Asp30, Lys237 and Asp263, which may\nbe specie specific. The conserved disulfide bonds are formed by Cys68-Cys95 and\nCys611-Cys639 in goose TLR3. The functional sites, such as Asn219, are important for the re-\nsponse to ds-RNA. Asn168 is related to TLR3 expression levels, and His501 and Asn503 are re-\nquired for RNA binding and the activation of NF-kappa-B. All of these functional sites are\nconserved in the goose TLR3 (S2 Fig.).\n\nB-cell activating factor (BAFF) is critical for the stimulation and maturation of B-cells in the\nadaptive immune system and is also found in our goose cDNA library. The identities among\navian species are particularly high and range from 91.99% to 99.65% (S3 Fig.). Similar to the\nother BAFFs, goose BAFF is mainly composed of a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) domain,\nwhich is relatively well conserved among various different species. In the TNF domain, the tri-\nmer interface sites are hydrophobic residues such as Gln151, Phe197, Tyr199, Tyr249, Ala254,\nTyr281 and Val285 and are conserved from geese to humans. The TNFR 50s-loop binding sites\n(Leu172, Ser174, Gly212, Lys219 and Ser228 in goose BAFF) are also found in all species with-\nout any modification. The conserved long DE loop, known as the “flap”, is unique to BAFF in\nthe TNF family and is located between sites 219 to 228 of goose BAFF. The furin cleavage sites\nof goose BAFF are “Arg-Gly-Arg-Arg”. Compared with the mammalian BAFFs, the BAFFS are\nmore conserved among the avian species. The Cys235 and Cys248 of goose BAFF are responsi-\nble for the formation of conserved intra-chain disulfide bond. The N-Glycosylation site\n(Asn245) in the TNF domain is conserved among different species, and the other site (Asn102)\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 20 / 30\n\n\n\nonly found in mouse and human (S3 Fig.). These results indicate that the functional sites of\nBAFF have changed very little during evolution.\n\nAmong the signal transduction pathways, the JAK-STAT pathway is mainly expressed in\nwhite blood cells and involved in the regulation of the immune system. Suppressor of cytokine\nsignaling (SOCS) proteins 1 and 3 are inhibitors of JAKs and implicated in inflammation, and\nthey were cloned in this study. Similar to the SOCS proteins from other species, goose SOCS1\nis also composed of an SH2 domain and a SOCS box. An extended SH2 subdomain (ESS) is im-\nportant for JAK phosphotyrosine binding and is located at the beginning of the SH2 domain.\nThe KIR domain is involved in signal and kinase inhibition and is located between Phe51 and\nPhe60 in goose SOCS1 (Fig. 9). The Elongin BC complex binding domain is known as a BC-\nbox, has the motif (A/P/S/T) -L-x (3) -C-x (3)—(A/I/L/V), and is located between 169 and 179\nsites in the goose SOCS1. Compared with the conserved KIR domain and B-C box, the Sup-\npressor of cytokine signaling 1 sequence is 7 or 8 poly-serines and can only be found in mam-\nmalian species. The sites for JH1 binding and JAK signal transduction suppression, such as\nPhe51, Phe54, Asp59, Tyr60, Ile63 and Leu70, are conserved between geese and humans.\nArg100, which is important to suppress LIF and IL-6 signal transduction, is highly conserved.\nAccording to the alignment, SOCS1 is relatively similar among different species and the identi-\nties are all over 60% (Fig. 9). However, SOCS3 is highly conserved; the similarity between\ngoose SOCS3 and duck SOCS3 can reach up to 100% and the smallest similarity is 88.04%\n(Fig. 10). Similar to SOCS1, the SH2 domain, SOCS box, KIR domain and ESS domain are con-\nserved in goose SOCS3. The sites important for EPO/LIF-induced signaling suppression are\nLeu22, Phe25, Glu30, Tyr31, Val34, Leu41, Gln45 and Arg71 in goose SOCS3. The Leu58,\nLeu93 and Arg94 sites of goose SOCS3 are important for the binding to Tyr429/Tyr431 phos-\nphorylated EPOR. These functional amino acids are all conserved from birds to mammals.\n\nThe results listed above indicated that the genes involved in adaptive and innate immunity\nplay central roles in goose immunity, while the toll-like receptor, chemokines, complement sys-\ntem and Jak-STAT signaling pathway act as the functional bridge between the innate and adap-\ntive immune responses.\n\nSTRING Analysis\nBased on the identified 125 immune-related genes, STRING 9.1 (http://string-db.org/) was\nused to analyze the interactions and relationships among these genes. From 125 goose genes,\n105 were matched well to the known immune genes of Gallus gallus in the STRING database\n(Fig. 11). In particular, the genes, whose sequence information has been confirmed by our PCR\nreactions, play important roles in the immune interaction nets. Like SOCS3, it can interact\nwith IL receptors of Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway, STATs of Jak-STAT sig-\nnaling pathway, PTPN11 of Natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity pathway and IRF1 of\nTranscription factors for immune response pathway. By the interaction of SOCS3, various im-\nmune pathways are connected as a whole one and SOCS1, SOCS3 and PTPN11 were very\nstrongly linked with many signaling pathways, which indicates that all of these genes interacted\nwith each other and comprise a classical network of different genes. C1qs are also the key knots\nfor complement pathway by interact with C1s and C1r and then in the downstream, C3 was ac-\ntivated. Myd88 is the centre modular of Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. It can interact\nwith various TLRs, including TLR3, leading to NF-kappa-B activation of immune defense. No\nconnection is observed in BAFF/TNFFSF13B, it may due to the absence of BAFF receptors in\nthis analysis. These results show us these immune genes of goose have similar functions and re-\naction modes as in other species (like chicken). These immune molecules do not work\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 21 / 30\n\nhttp://string-db.org/\n\n\nFig 9.

As geese serve as one of the principal natural reservoirs for influenza\nA viruses, its study is of special interest in medicine and public health problem [31,32]. Due to\nlack of genomic information, it is important for us to understand the immune repertoires of\ngeese. After the high-throughput RNA sequencing of the transcriptome, it became one of the\nmost convenient method to obtain the overall gene information. Here, we present the study\nabout the immune-related genes and pathways in goose transcriptome. The results describe the\n\nFig 11.

Seven different colored lines link a number of nodes and represent seven types of evidence used in predicting the\nassociations.

This pooling strategy was widely used in other similar studies [2,\n14, 15]. To date, only 2 studies have reported on the transcriptome data from goose ovaries and\nother body tissues [2–15]. In this study, a large genomic description of goose PBLs was provid-\ned. Compared to other transcriptome data, this goose PBLs transcriptome library is larger in\ndata size and has more raw reads (91.93 million compared to 84.14 million and 4.36 million),\nmore clean mapped reads (69.36 million compared to 60.50 million and 3.70 million), and\nmore total annotated matched unigenes (211,198 compared to 568, 39 and 130,517) [2–15],\nwhich characterize the precise gene expression in different tissues in contrast to the goose\nPBLs. These data can provide useful information for further investigations of the\ngoose genome.\n\nWe generated 211,198 unigenes for 69.5 MB total length of the goose PBLs transcriptome.\nThe overall GC content of the transcriptome was calculated to be 47%, which closely resembles\nthe percent GC content that was reported in a previous study [14]. The size distribution indi-\ncated that the length of the 91,069 unigenes was more than 1500 bp, which is much higher\nthan that reported by other researchers [2, 15] for the goose transcriptome. We also noticed\nthat the mean length of unigenes was longer than that reported in other research [2, 15]. We\ncompared our unigenes against the NCBI Nr protein database, allowing further functional an-\nnotation and classification using GO, KOG and KEGG. This functional annotation provides\nexpected information on biological function and biosynthesis pathways for assembled uni-\ngenes. We also found that the Nr database had maximum annotated unigenes and most of the\naligned sequences matched with the chicken (17,238, 55.59%) sequence, suggesting that more\ngenetic similarities exists between the goose (a waterfowl bird) and chickens (a domestic bird).\nAmong the Nr blast hits, only 128 genes were matched to the goose itself, illustrating the limit-\ned number of the goose related genes currently available in the NCBI database. We also found\nthat 26,985 (73.2%) of the unigenes identified in this study have high similarity to the NCBI\nblast result (Fig. 1E) and are covered by 80–100% in the length, which supports the validity of\nour transcriptome data.\n\nThe GO annotation shows that a large number of the unigenes are in the biological process-\nes (72,844) category. As expected, many genes which are involved in the defense system of\ngeese, including response to stimulus (7,075 unigenes), signaling (3,570), and immune system\nprocess (512), were found in this study. We identified a large number of unigenes that are in-\nvolved in the immune system (2,757) in the KEGG pathway’s organismal systems category to\nfurther elucidate the biological functions of these genes in geese. In our goose PBLs transcrip-\ntome data, we found that a large number of the unigenes were in the immune relevant path-\nways and were involved in well-recognized immune pathways, such as chemokine signaling\npathway 348, B-cell receptor, T-cell receptor 134, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway 204, leu-\nkocyte transendothelial migration 244, antigen processing and presentation 74 (Fig. 4). The\navailability of these data would provide an abundant resource for understanding the pathways\nof the goose immune system. Additionally, among the 2,757 unigenes that participated in 15\nimmune system KEGG pathways, we focused on the 125 most important novel genes of the im-\nmune system of goose that were identified. We observed that 109 unigenes of the 125 unigenes\ndescribed here, are novel genes in the goose that were first identified in this study.\n\nOur transcriptome sequence revealed the presence of immune relevant genes in goose.\nThere were no evidence existed, in that majority of the detected immune related genes in goose\nbefore performing this PBLs transcriptome analysis. Here, we are the first to identify several\nimportant genes of the immune pathways and to compare them with genes in the duck,\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 25 / 30\n\n\n\nchicken, turkey and zebra finch. The genomic information has been made available in the\nNCBI database to facilitate the detection of novel genes in the goose (Fig. 5/ Table 4). Except\nfor the duck, the other avian species are different in both habitat and avian family from the\ngoose. Using the NCBI database, we found that 104 of the 125 unigenes in the goose PBLs tran-\nscriptome were shared with the duck (a waterfowl like the goose) and 21 genes (including\nTLR13, CC26, IL8, IFR3, IFR7) were not shared. In the NCBI database, 8 genes (including\nCCL14, CCL26, IFR3, C4–1) were not shared in the chicken, 43 genes (including TAPBP,\nHSP70, HSP90A, TLR3, TLR13, LY96, C8G, BAFF) were not found in the turkey and 30 genes\n(including TAPBP, TLR13, TLR15, CCL14, CCL19, IL9R, IL23R, C2, MBL) were not found in\nzebra finch. A comparison of our sequencing results with the information available in the\nNCBI databases for four other species provides more genomic and transcriptomic information\nand can contribute to the study of the avian transcriptome.\n\nOur ongoing studies on these genes may extend the list of variations in the immune genes of\ngoose with other species. Here, we describe the 10 most likely putative genes of the innate,\nadaptive immune system and signaling pathways identified in the goose PBLs transcriptome,\nwhich were confirmed by PCR and further by comparison of their sequences to that of\nother species.\n\nIn the complement system, C1qA, C1qB and C1qC were cloned and further analyzed by\ncomparison. According to the comparative analysis, goose C1qA, C1qB and C1qC all show the\nhighest identity to the corresponding genes in the duck. The goose is most closely evolutionari-\nly related to the duck and that was further confirmed by an evolutionary tree (S4 Fig.). In the\ntree, the evolutionary distance between different species are arranged consistent with time of\nemergence of each species. As C1qA, C1qB and C1qC belong to the same C1q family, they\nhave a common evolutionary origin in the evolutionary tree. The molecule architecture and\nfunctional sites in the collagen-like domains of these three molecules are conserved among\nbirds, reptiles and mammals. However, the receptor binding sites in the C1q domains varied\nconsiderably in comparison to other species. We also cloned complement component 8,\ngamma polypeptide (C8G), which is a constituent of the membrane attack complex. The C8G\nalignment results show conserved characteristics among the different species (S5 Fig.). With\nthe exception of some functional studies [33], little is known about the avian toll-like receptor\npathway, especially TLR3. Here, the goose TLR3 is shown to have conserved domains and sites\nwith the human TLR3, indicating its evolutionary conservation. Overall, 5 genes of the innate\nimmune system, including C1qA, C1qB, C1qC, C8G and TLR3, have been identified in\nthe goose.\n\nStudies have shown that goose BAFF is a conserved molecule in the adaptive immune sys-\ntem and that it is able to promote bursal B cell survival and proliferation in the goose [34].\nHere, we further confirm the BAFF sequence in our goose cDNA library. BAFF is conserved\namong the avian species, but diverges from the mammalian gene. CD74, the MHCII invariant\nchain, play critical roles in MHC class II antigen processing by stabilizing peptide-free MHCII\nheterodimers and was also cloned in this study [10]. The sequence of the goose CD74 clone\nhere is similar to the one submitted to NCBI, which indicates its functional and conservational\nimportance. IL1RL1/ST2, an IL-1 family cytokine that can activate NF-κB and MAP kinases\nand drive production of TH2-associated cytokines from T helper type 2 cells [35], play impor-\ntant roles in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. The IL1RL1 gene of goose was also\nidentified in our study. IL1RL1 has 3 Ig-like C2 domains and one TIR domain. Of the 5 mam-\nmalian disulfide bonds, 4 are found to be conserved at the Cys32-Cys83, Cys109-Cys145,\nCys128-Cys175 and Cys228-Cys295 sites in the goose IL1RL1 (S6 Fig.). According to the align-\nment, the IL1RL1s in avian species share more sequence similarity with those in reptiles than\n\nTranscriptomic Analysis of Goose Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0121015 March 27, 2015 26 / 30\n\n\n\nwith those in mammals. For instance, the positions of the N- Glycosylation sites are not well\nconserved between the goose and human IL1RL1s.\n\nJAK-STAT pathway plays a central role in lots of biological processes of both innate and\nadaptive immunity. SOCS family proteins are part of a classical negative feedback system that\nregulates cytokine signal transduction. SOCS3 and SOCS1 are negative regulators of cytokines\nthat signal through the JAK/STAT pathway. Here, SOCS1 and SOCS3 genes have been cloned\nfrom the goose and shown to have conserved structural and functional sites. The evolutionary\ntree indicates that SOCS1 and SOCS3 share a common origin (S7 Fig.). Over long evolutionary\ndistances, the avian SOCS1s diverged after the split between the reptile, avian and mammalian\nlineage. In the evolutionary tree, the SOCS3s of different species are clustered together, indicat-\ning that little change occurred over the course of evolution.\n\nThe 125 immune related genes were further analyzed by gene interaction networks\n(STRING analysis). The results show us a similar immune response network as in other avian\nspecies, and it also confirms the potential functions of these genes in the goose.\n\nConclusion\nThe data described here provide the first PBLs transcriptome profile of the goose immune sys-\ntem. Among 211,198 unigenes, 2,757 unigenes of immune system, 17 immune related path-\nways and their unigenes, 125 important immune genes have been found in the goose EST and\ncompared between the goose, duck, chicken, turkey and zebra finch. The 10 most important\nimmune genes of the goose have been cloned and analyzed. This information will give us an\noverall landscape of the goose immune system and assist us in understanding the goose im-\nmune system. We believe that the availability of this annotated transcriptome will facilitate the\nisolation and characterization of the functional genes involved in different immune system\npathways, as well as validate the molecular genetic approach to disclose the immune system\nof goose.\n\nSupporting Information\nS1 Fig. PCR Validation of the goose immune related genes.
