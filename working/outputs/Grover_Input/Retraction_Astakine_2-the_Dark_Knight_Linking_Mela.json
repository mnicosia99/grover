This ability to respond to environmental daily rhythms has been conserved along evolution, and it is\nfound among species from bacteria to mammals. The hematopoietic process of the crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus is under\ncircadian control and is tightly regulated by astakines, a new family of cytokines sharing a prokineticin (PROK) domain. The\nexpression of AST1 and AST2 are light-dependent, and this suggests an evolutionarily conserved function for PROK domain\nproteins in mediating circadian rhythms. Vertebrate PROKs are transmitters of circadian rhythms of the suprachiasmatic\nnucleus (SCN) in the brain of mammals, but the mechanism by which they function is unknown. Here we demonstrate that\nhigh AST2 expression is induced by melatonin in the brain. We identify RACK1 as a binding protein of AST2 and further\nprovide evidence that a complex between AST2 and RACK1 functions as a negative-feedback regulator of the circadian\nclock. By DNA mobility shift assay, we showed that the AST2-RACK1 complex will interfere with the binding between BMAL1\nand CLK and inhibit the E-box binding activity of the complex BMAL1-CLK. Finally, we demonstrate by gene knockdown that\nAST2 is necessary for melatonin-induced inhibition of the complex formation between BMAL1 and CLK during the dark\nperiod. In summary, we provide evidence that melatonin regulates AST2 expression and thereby affects the core clock of\nthe crustacean brain. This process may be very important in all animals that have AST2 molecules, i.e. spiders, ticks,\ncrustaceans, scorpions, several insect groups such as Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Blattodea, but not Diptera and\nColeoptera. Our findings further reveal an ancient evolutionary role for the prokineticin superfamily protein that links\nmelatonin to direct regulation of the core clock gene feedback loops.\n\nCitation: Watthanasurorot A, Saelee N, Phongdara A, Roytrakul S, Jiravanichpaisal P, et al.

Clock genes and hormones are\n\ncore regulators or pacemakers in circadian regulation, which\n\nreside in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in mammals and the\n\nbrain visual center in insects [2,3]. In Drosophila, the proteins\n\nencoded by clock genes form two distinct heterodimers: Period\n\n(PER) and Timeless (TIM) form one heterodimer, and Clock\n\n(CLK) and Cycle (CYC) form the other [4]. In mammals, the\n\nhomologues of the CLK and PER proteins have the same name,\n\nwhile the homologues of TIM and CYC are called cryptochrome\n\n(CRY) and brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear\n\ntranslocator (ARNT)-like 1 (BMAL1) respectively [5]. The PER-\n\nTIM heterodimer functions as an autoregulatory negative\n\nfeedback loop that causes a decrease in transcriptional activation\n\nby CLK and CYC [6]. Conversely, the CLK-CYC heterodimer\n\ndirectly interacts with the upstream E-boxes (CACGTG) of the\n\nPER and TIM genes to activate their transcription [7]. These clock\n\ngenes are detected in several neural and non-neural tissues,\n\nsuggesting that these feedback loops are not restricted to neurons\n\n[8]. RACK1 was recently identified as an inhibitor of mammalian\n\nCLK-BMAL1 activity by recruiting PKCa during the negative\nfeedback phase of the cycle [9].\n\nAs described above, the SCN serves as the ‘‘master clock’’ in the\n\nmammalian brain [10]. The SCN is reset on a circadian basis by\n\nlight input from the retina during the day and by melatonin\n\nsecretion from the pineal gland at night [11,12]. Several animal\n\nstudies have documented that melatonin is mainly synthesized and\n\nreleased during darkness, while the melatonin level is low in the\n\npresence of light [13]. This hormone is formed not only in the\n\npineal gland but also in the photoreceptive structures of both\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nvertebrates and invertebrates [14]. The melatonin synthesis\n\npattern is known to reflect both daily rhythms and changes in\n\nphotoperiod, demonstrating that melatonin has major roles in\n\nregulating both circadian and seasonal rhythms [15]. Several\n\ncircadian rhythms, such as the rest/activity cycle, core body\n\ntemperature, neuronal electrical activity and locomotor activity,\n\nare driven by melatonin [16,17,18,19]. However, melatonin does\n\nnot directly induce immediate changes in clock gene mRNA\n\nexpression in the rat SCN, suggesting that the phase-shifting effect\n\nof melatonin on the SCN molecular loop implicates a post-\n\ntranslational rather than a transcriptional effect [15]. Little is\n\nknown about the molecular mechanism by which melatonin drives\n\nthe clock gene feedback loops in the SCN. In addition, the\n\nnocturnal increase in the circadian secretion of the cytokine IL-2\n\nand its immunobiological activity are under melatonin control\n\nduring the dark period [20]. There is a link between the rest/\n\nactivity cycle and the immune system via melatonin-cytokine\n\ninteractions [21].\n\nNeuronal tissues that contain circadian clocks are present in the\n\nbrain of the crayfish Cherax destructor and Procambarus clarkii, the\n\nlatter of which is highly related to Pacifastacus leniusculus. These\n\nspecies have photoreceptor cells not only within their eyes, but also\n\nin extraretinal parts of the brain. In Cherax this area is located in\n\nthe anterior median brain soma cluster 6 [22], and the axons from\n\nthese cells terminate in an area within the protocerebral bridge\n\n[23]. It is clear that these brain photoreceptors are sufficient to\n\nmaintain the circadian locomotor rhythm in these animals [23].\n\nThese areas have also recently been shown to be immunoreactive\n\nfor proteins encoded by the clock genes CLK, PER and TIM [24].\n\nSeveral studies imply a conserved role of melatonin as an\n\nimportant transducer of circadian information in invertebrates\n\nand vertebrates, and melatonin production has been demonstrated\n\nin the eyestalks of several crustacean species [25,26]. The presence\n\nof MT2 melatonin receptors have not been conclusively shown in\n\ncrayfish, but indirect evidences for such a receptor were presented\n\nby Mendoza-Vargas et al [27] since the application of the MT2\n\nreceptor selective agonist 8-M-PDOT or antagonist DH97 had a\n\nsignificant effect on how melatonin affected the retinal photore-\n\nceptors [27].\n\nIn mammals, the secretion of prokineticin 2 (PROK2) by the\n\nSCN is implicated in the regulation of the sleep/wake cycle and\n\nlocomotor activity and is known to suppress the function of\n\nmelatonin [28]. The transcription of PROK2 is activated by the\n\nCLK-BMAL1 heterodimer and light [29,30].\n\nCrayfish astakines are invertebrate homologues of the prokine-\n\nticins (PROK), and there are two forms in the crayfish P.\n\nleniusculus: astakine 1 (AST1, AAX14635) and astakine 2 (AST2,\n\nEF568370) [31]. These astakines have been identified in several\n\ninvertebrates, and similar to PROK2, the expression profiles of\n\ncrayfish AST1 and AST2 follow a daily rhythm [32]. In contrast to\n\nAST1, the rhythmic expression of AST2 is at its maximum level in\n\nthe dark phase [32]. Although the patterns of melatonin and AST2\n\nrelease are circadian-regulated in crayfish [32,33], nothing is\n\nknown about their role in regulating rhythmic oscillations. In this\n\nstudy, we provide evidence that melatonin regulates the circadian\n\nrhythm and that this regulation is mediated by AST2 during the\n\ndark phase. Our results imply that AST2 acts as novel negative\n\nfeedback regulator of CLK-BMAL1 activity.\n\nResults\n\nMelatonin induces the expression of AST2\nIn a recent report, we showed that AST2 mRNA is expressed in\n\nthe hematopoietic tissue (HPT) of P. leniusculus at higher levels at\n\nnight than during the day, the time when melatonin is also at a\n\nhigh level [32,33]. Thus, we hypothesized that there may be a\n\nphysiological link between these two molecules. We examined the\n\nexpression of AST1 and AST2 in HPT cells incubated with\n\nmelatonin in vitro (Figure 1A–1B) and in HPT, hemocytes and\n\nbrain injected with melatonin in vivo (Figure 1C–1H). Melatonin\n\nincubation or injection clearly affected AST2 expression\n\n(Figure 1B, 1D, 1F and 1H), whereas AST1 expression was\n\nunaffected by this treatment (Figure 1A, 1C, 1E and 1G). These\n\nresults were also confirmed at the level of translation using an\n\nELISA assay (Figure 2A–2C), in which melatonin treatment\n\nresulted in higher levels of the AST2 protein. When cell lysates\n\nfrom the brain and HPT were analyzed by western blot at 9:00\n\nand 20:00, respectively, the level of AST2 was clearly higher at\n\nnight than during the day (Figure 2D).\n\nAST2 binds to PlRACK1\nIn contrast to AST1, which is a secreted protein, AST2 is\n\nmainly an intracellular protein (Figure S1). To identify any protein\n\nthat interacts with AST2 in HPT cells, recombinant AST2 (GST-\n\nAST2) was used as a bait to bind to proteins in HPT and hemocyte\n\nlysates by far overlay or pull-down assays (Figure 3A–3B). After\n\nexcluding the background proteins found in the control, a protein\n\nwith high similarity to Penaeus monodon RACK1 was identified as an\n\nAST2-binding protein by mass spectra analysis. The Mascot\n\nsearch resulted in significant hits where P. monodon RACK1 had\n\nthe highest significant protein score 781 (Table S1). This protein\n\nwas the significant hit detected in both the far overlay and the\n\nGST pull-down assay.\n\nBy designing degenerate primers from the obtained amino acid\n\nsequences, a complete RACK1 cDNA was identified by RACE\n\ntechnique from P. leniusculus (PlRACK1). The open reading frame\n\nof PlRACK1 contains 957 bp (JQ686053), encoding 318 amino\n\nacids with a calculated molecular mass of 35.7 kDa (predicted\n\nMW using ProtParam program), and its deduced amino acid\n\nsequence was found to consist of seven conserved WD40 repeat\n\nbinding sites (Figure S2). PlRACK1 mRNA was highly expressed\n\nin different crayfish tissues (Figure S3). To confirm the interaction\n\nbetween PlRACK1 and AST2, recombinant GST-PlRACK1 was\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nMost living organisms are able to sense the time and in\nparticular time of day by their internal clocks. So-called\nclock proteins control these internal clockworks. BMAL1\nand CLK are two important clock proteins, which together\nform a complex that serves as a transcription factor and\ncontrols the production of diurnal proteins. These diurnal\nproteins, in turn, inhibit the formation of clock proteins so\nthat the concentration of the different proteins in the cell\noscillates back and forth throughout the day. External\nfactors may affect the balance of clock proteins, and one\nsuch important factor is light. Melatonin is a darkness\nhormone produced in the brain of most animals during\nthe night, and here we show that melatonin controls the\nformation of a protein named AST2 in crayfish. AST2\nbelongs to a group of proteins found in many arthropods,\nsuch as spiders, scorpions, crustaceans, and some insects,\nwhose function has been unknown until now. Now we\ndemonstrate that AST2 is induced by melatonin at night\nand then functions in the internal biological clock by\npreventing BMAL1 and CLK to form a complex. In this way,\nAST2 acts as a link between melatonin and the internal\nbiological clock.\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

The GST-PlRACK1 was used in an in vitro binding\n\nassay with a His-Trx-AST2 fusion protein (predicted mass of\n\n33 kDa). The His-Trx and GST proteins were also expressed and\n\npurified to serve as control proteins (Figure S5B: the predicted\n\nmass of His-Trx and GST proteins are 20 and 26 kDa,\n\nrespectively). As shown in Figure 3C, western blot analysis\n\nrevealed that the His-Trx-AST2 protein was pulled down by\n\nGST- PlRACK1, but not by GST alone. These data indicate that\n\nthere is an interaction between PlRACK1 and AST2.\n\nPlBMAL1 forms a complex with PlRACK1\nThe finding that PlRACK1 is a binding partner of the\n\nmelatonin-induced protein AST2 led us to examine whether\n\nPlRACK1 associates with BMAL1 to thereby act as a regulator of\n\ncircadian rhythm, as has recently been reported in mice [9].\n\nBMAL1 cDNA was amplified from P. leniusculus (PlBMAL1,\n\nJQ670886) with an open reading frame of 1,995 bp that encodes a\n\n664 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of\n\n73.64 kDa. One close sequence to PlBMAL1 was that of BMAL1\n\nfrom Drosophila melanogaster (identity = 55%). Domain homology\n\nanalysis using SMART revealed that the deduced amino acid\n\nsequence was highly conserved in its HLH (helix-loop-helix) DNA-\n\nbinding domain and the protein dimerization PAS and PAC\n\nregions (Figure S4A). The expression of PlBMAL1 was highest in\n\nhemocytes, followed by testis, nerve, intestine and brain (Figure\n\nS4B). An interaction between PlBMAL1 and PlRACK1 was\n\ndemonstrated using a GST pull-down experiment with recombi-\n\nnant GST-PlRACK1 (predicted mass of 62 kDa) and His-Trx-\n\nPlBMAL1 (predicted mass of 94 kDa as shown in Figure S6A–\n\nS6B). This in vitro GST pull-down assay showed an apparent\n\nbinding between these two recombinant proteins (Figure 4A). The\n\nfar western blotting using PlRACK1 without GST tag (predicted\n\nmass of 36 kDa) as a prey and GST- PlBMAL1 (predicted mass of\n\n100 kDa as shown in Figure S6C) as bait, also confirmed this\n\ninteraction (Figure 4B). The results show that the GST-PlBMAL1\n\nwas detected at the place where the PlRACK1 was located,\n\nwhereas the GST control protein could not be detected. Binding of\n\nPlRACK1 to AST2 as well as to PlBMAL1 was detected using far\n\nwestern after SDS-PAGE at reducing condition. The crystal\n\nstructure of human RACK1, with high homology to PlRACK1, is\n\nknown as a sevenfold ß-propeller structure [34]. A comparison of\n\nthe structure of human RACK1 with yeast RACK1 (that lacks\n\nmost of the cysteines present in animal RACK1’s) show a high\n\nsimilarity in the overall structure, indicating that the cysteines are\n\nof minor importance for the main structure characteristics of this\n\ngroup of proteins, which may explain retained binding properties\n\nin the far western assay.\n\nInteraction of AST2 with PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 in vitro\nTo investigate if and how AST2 regulates an oscillatory\n\nmechanism, we examined whether AST2 interacts with the\n\nPlBMAL1-PlRACK1 complex. This interaction is mediated by\n\nAST2 binding to PlRACK1, since we could show that AST2 is not\n\nable to bind to BMAL1 alone (Figure S7). The results from GST\n\npull-down experiments showed that recombinant His-Trx-AST2\n\nstrongly associated with the recombinant GST-PlRACK1/His-\n\nTrx-PlBMAL1 complex, and the binding of His-Trx-PlBMAL1\n\nand His-Trx-AST2 was dependent on the concentration of GST-\n\nPlRACK1 (Figure 4C). These results suggest that AST2 plays an\n\nessential role as a stabilizer of the PlBMAL1-PlRACK1 complex,\n\nthereby suppressing the CLK-BMAL1 interaction during the dark\n\nperiod.\n\nAST2 associates to form an AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1\ncomplex during the dark period in vivo\n\nThe amount of AST2 protein varies in a circadian manner and\n\nis highest during early night in the brain and HPT, while\n\nPlBMAL1 and PlRACK1 protein levels do not change signifi-\n\ncantly according to daily rhythms (Figure 5A–5B). Because our in\n\nvitro experiments indicated an interaction between AST2 and\n\nPlRACK1 and between PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1, we confirmed\n\nthese two interactions with in vivo experiments. To study the in vivo\n\ninteractions between these three proteins during the light and dark\n\nperiods, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments of brain\n\nand HPT extracts. A high-molecular-weight complex was present\n\nat night and disappeared during the day, as shown in Figure 5C\n\nand 5D. This complex was abundant in the brain; it was also\n\nfound at very low levels in a few HPT samples (Figure 5C).\n\nReducing SDS-PAGE revealed that AST2, PlBMAL1 and\n\nPlRACK1 were components of this approximately 200 kDa\n\ncomplex (Figure 5C) (the native mass of these three proteins are\n\n14, 74 and 36 kDa, respectively). During the light period, this high\n\nmolecular weight complex could not be detected; instead, a\n\nsmaller complex of AST2-PlRACK1 was identified (Figure 5D).\n\nThe CLK protein is detected as a component of the 400-\nkDa complex\n\nTo determine whether CLK (JQ670885) forms a complex with\n\nBMAL1, crayfish brain lysates were prepared, immunoprecipitat-\n\ned with antibodies against BMAL1 and probed for CLK. The\n\nCLK protein with a molecular mass of 95 kDa clearly coimmu-\n\nnoprecipitated with endogenous PlBMAL1 (Figure 6A), indicating\n\nthat CLK is one protein component of this large approximately\n\n400 kDa complex. Confirmation of complex formation was\n\naccomplished by switching the antibodies used for immunopre-\n\ncipitation and for western blot detection, respectively (Figure 6A).\n\nWe then monitored the CLK protein levels in the brain during the\n\nday and night by western blotting. As shown in Figure 6B, the\n\nCLK protein level oscillated in a circadian rhythm, and its\n\nexpression peaked in the light period (Figure 6F). Furthermore, the\n\napproximately 400 kDa CLK-PlBMAL1 complex was barely\n\ndetectable at night and reached maximal levels in the morning\n\n(Figure 6B and 6C). More interestingly, the lowest level of the\n\nCLK-PlBMAL1 complex in brain lysates coincided with the time\n\nbars = control.

Thus, these data indicate that\n\nAST2 is an important regulator of circadian rhythm by interfering\n\nwith formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex.\n\nThe effect of melatonin injection during the light period\nBecause we detected a clear stimulatory effect of melatonin on\n\nthe expression of AST2 (Figure 2C), we decided to further confirm\n\nthis putative role of AST2 by determining the presence, in vivo, of\n\nthe approximately 400 kDa CLK-PlBMAL1 and approximately\n\n200 kDa AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complexes, respectively,\n\nafter melatonin injection during the light period. Six hours after\n\nmelatonin injection, the approximately 200 kDa complex was\n\ndetected in the crayfish brains, but not in the HPT (Figure 6G–6I).\n\nConversely, the amount of the approximately 400 kDa complex\n\ncontaining CLK-PlBMAL1 was reduced post-melatonin injection\n\n(Figure 6G and 6H).

Thus,\n\nthis experiment further confirms that AST2 is required to interfere\n\nwith the formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1 heterodimer, and that\n\nhigh AST2 levels at night cause lower amounts of CLK-PlBMAL1\n\nheterodimer formation during the dark period (Figure 7C–7G).\n\nAST2 gene knockdown induces CLK/BMAL1 E-box\nbinding in the dark\n\nSince knockdown of AST2 resulted in more CLK-PlBMAL1\n\ncomplex formation during the dark period, we decided to test\n\nwhether AST2 also had an effect on CLK-PlBMAL1 E-box\n\nbinding. We assayed the CLK-PlBMAL1 E-box binding by a\n\nDNA-protein binding assay. As expected, we could demonstrate\n\nCLK-PlBMAL1 specific E-box binding during the night in AST2\n\nsilenced animals, whereas the control group (dsGFP) did not show\n\nany E-box binding in the dark (Figure 8A–8B). A super shift of this\n\nE-box binding was induced after incubation with anti-CLK\n\nantibodies (Figure 8A), and controls using mutated or unlabelled\n\nE-box oligonucleotides did not show any binding (Figure 8B and\n\nFigure S8A–S8B). In contrast, melatonin injection during the day\n\n(which leads to enhanced levels of AST2, Figure 2A) reduced the\n\nDNA binding activity of CLK-PlBMAL1 compared to other\n\ngroups (Figure S8B). The complex formation of CLK-PlBMAL1\n\nor AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 was followed by western blotting\n\nafter knockdown of AST2 expression by dsRNA or increasing\n\nAST2 by addition of melatonin (Figure 8C–8E). These results\n\nreveal that AST2 is an important regulator of the E-box binding\n\nactivity of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex.\n\nDiscussion\n\nVarious proteins are regulated by the circadian rhythm, and\n\nthere are a growing number of examples of circadian regulation of\n\nstem cell activities, such as the proliferation and recruitment of\n\nhematopoietic progenitor cells [33,35]. We have recently shown\n\nthat the hematopoietic cytokine AST1 is regulated by light and that\n\nthis regulation has an impact on hemocyte synthesis [26]. AST1\n\ncontains a prokineticin domain (pfam06607) and shares similarities\n\nwith vertebrate PROK2, which is regulated by light at the\n\ntranscriptional level by core clock genes [22]. Apart from\n\nfunctioning in circadian clocks, vertebrate PROKs have document-\n\ned roles in the regulation of intestinal muscle contractility,\n\nneurogenesis, pain perception, food uptake, and appetite regulation\n\n[36,37]. In similarity with invertebrate astakines the vertebrate\n\nPROKs also play roles in hematopoiesis and proinflammatory\n\nimmune responses. Therefore, the structural and functional\n\nsimilarities between astakines and the vertebrate PROKs point to\n\nan ancient similar role for these proteins [38].\n\nThe oscillation in PROK2 transcription in mice occurs in the\n\nSCN, and it acts as an output molecule, signaling the rhythm to\n\nother cells and tissues and thereby changing circadian behavior\n\n[39]. Signal transduction from vertebrate PROK’s are mediated\n\nby two closely related G-protein coupled receptors, and the AVIT\n\nmotif has been shown to be crucial to this receptor binding and the\n\nactivity of the PROK’s [40]. An analysis of the gene structure for\n\nhuman PROK2 reveals that exon 2–4 share similarities to crayfish\n\nAST2, while the first exon encodes the signal peptide and the\n\nAVIT motif [41,42]. Thus, all invertebrate astakines found so far,\n\ndiffer from the vertebrates PROKs in their N-terminal and lack of\n\nthe AVIT-motif [25] a fact that indicates different receptor\n\nbinding properties for this invertebrate group of PROK domain\n\ncontaining proteins. Similar to PROK2, AST1 is a secreted\n\nmolecule with circadian expression, and these data indicate a\n\nconserved role for this domain throughout evolution, from\n\narthropods to humans [25,26]. In this study, we report a more\n\ndirect role for another crayfish prokineticin, namely AST2, as an\n\nintracellular regulator of the heterodimeric transcription factors\n\nCLK and PlBMAL1. The expression of AST2 does not exhibit a\n\nlight-dependent pattern that is similar to that of AST1 or PROK2\n\nin mice; instead, we detected high levels of AST2 expression in the\n\nHPT and brain during the dark period when melatonin levels are\n\nhigh. We also showed that melatonin administration clearly\n\nincreased the expression of AST2 at both the mRNA and protein\n\nlevels.\n\nIt is well established that the neurohormone melatonin has an\n\nimportant function in the SCN in regulating the feedback loop of\n\nthe core clock genes and also functions as an output signal that has\n\nan effect on peripheral cells [43]. Melatonin is mainly produced\n\nwithin the eyestalks of crayfish, and its production is elevated\n\nduring the dark period [27]. Melatonin is known to influence\n\nnumerous physiological processes in crayfish [18,33,44], although\n\nthe molecular mechanism by which melatonin exerts its effect has\n\nnot been fully clarified. However, AST2 is an intracellular protein\n\nthat is present in several crustaceans and insect species [25]. Here,\n\nfor the first time, we identify a direct role for AST2 in the\n\nregulation of the circadian clock and show that the protein acts as\n\na link between melatonin and the heterodimeric transcriptional\n\nactivator CLK-PlBMAL1. Intracellular PlRACK1 was identified\n\nas an AST2-binding protein, and in the brain, the binding of\n\nPlBMAL1 to this complex mediated a decrease in the formation of\n\nthe CLK-PlBMAL1 heterodimer. This process may be very\n\nimportant in all animals that have AST2 molecules i.e., spiders,\n\nticks, crustaceans, scorpions, several insect groups such as\n\nHymenoptera, Hemiptera, Blattodea but not Diptera and\n\nColeoptera. If any vertebrate PROK is performing the same\n\nfunction still remains to be demonstrated.\n\nRecently, RACK1 and protein kinase Ca (PKCa) were shown\nto interact with BMAL1 in a circadian manner, resulting in\n\nsuppressed CLK-BMAL1 activity [9]. This result is consistent with\n\nour observation of the PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 interaction in the\n\ncrayfish brain. At night, we detected an approximately 200 kDa\n\ncomplex in the crayfish brain and found that the components of\n\nthis complex consisted of AST2, PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1.\n\nand 8; GST pull-down of His-Trx. B) The protein-protein interaction of PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1 was analyzed by far western blotting. C) Binding of AST2\nand PlBMAL1 to GST-PlRACK1. GST-PlRACK1 (0, 5, 50 or 500 ng) was bound to Glutathione Sepharose beads and incubated with 500 ng His-Trx-\nPlBMAL1 and 500 ng His-Trx-AST2. Bound proteins were eluted and immunoblotted for PlBMAL1 and AST2 using an anti-His antibody and for\nPlRACK1 with an anti-GST antibody.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003361.g004\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 8 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 9 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\nConversely, this complex disappeared during the light period due\n\nto lower levels of AST2 during the day. Thus, our results show that\n\nAST2 acts as a regulator of the CLK-PlBMAL1 complex by\n\nbinding to PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 in an oscillatory manner that is\n\ninduced by changes in the level of melatonin.\n\nInterestingly, enhancement of the approximately 400 kDa\n\ncomplex consisting of PlBMAL1 and CLK was detected when the\n\nlevel of the approximately 200 kDa complex was decreased either\n\nduring the light period or by knockdown of AST2 expression. A\n\nsimilar high-molecular-weight complex of PlBMAL1 and CLK\n\n(approximately 400 kDa) was also recently detected in mice [9].\n\nThe formation of the approximately 400 kDa crayfish complex is\n\ndependent on the expression of CLK. The expression of mamma-\n\nlian CLK is not rhythmic [45,46], while zebrafish CLK shows\n\nrobust rhythmic expression, as was the case for crayfish CLK in our\n\nstudy [47,48,49]. As with zebrafish and Drosophila, the CLK of\n\ncrayfish is directly regulated by light [50,51]. Unlike those in\n\nmammals, the protein products of PER and TIM (or CRY in\n\nmammals) in Drosophila act to inhibit the transcriptional activity of\n\nthe CLK-CYC complex (CLK-BMAL1) by interacting with CLK\n\nor a CLK-containing complex during the night but not during most\n\nof the day [52]. In our experiments, the AST2-PlRACK1-\n\nPlBMAL1 complex (approximately 200 kDa) competes for binding\n\nto PlBMAL1 to interfere with the formation of the CLK-PlBMAL1\n\nheterodimer during the dark period. Further it is clear from our\n\nDNA mobility shift assay that AST2 can inhibit the transcriptional\n\nactivation activity of CLK-PlBMAL1. This 200 kDa AST2-\n\ncontaining complex directly interacts with different proteins and is\n\nclearly induced by melatonin. Therefore, our findings reveal an\n\nancient evolutionary role for a prokineticin superfamily protein that\n\nlinks melatonin to direct regulation of the core clock gene feedback\n\nloops, as indicated in the model (Figure 9).\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCrayfish\nHealthy intermolt freshwater crayfish (P. leniusculus) were\n\nobtained from Lake Hjälmaren, Sweden and were maintained in\n\naerated tap water at 10uC.\n\nCloning and sequence analysis of full-length P.\nleniusculus RACK1 (PlRACK1) and PlBMAL1 cDNAs\n\nTotal RNA was isolated from crayfish brains using TRIzol LS\n\n(Invitrogen) followed by RNase-free DNase I (Ambion) treatment.\n\ncDNA synthesis was accomplished with an oligo (dT) primer and\n\nThermoScript RT-PCR (Invitrogen) according to the manufac-\n\nturer’s protocol. A partial sequence of PlRACK1 was amplified\n\nusing primers that were designed based on the shrimp (P. monodon)\n\nPmRACK1 sequence (GenBank accession no. EF569136), where-\n\nas PlBMAL1 primers were based on the cDNA sequences from\n\nseveral organisms (listed in Table S2). To obtain the full-length\n\ncDNAs of the PlRACK1 and PlBMAL1 genes, 59 and 39 rapid\n\namplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technology was performed\n\nusing the SMARTer RACE cDNA Amplification Kit (Clontech)\n\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. The complete\n\nPlRACK1 cDNA sequence was amplified using gene-specific\n\nprimers for PlRACK1 (Table S2) and the SMART Universal\n\nPrimer A. The PCR products were then cloned into the TOPO\n\nTA cloning vector and sequenced. The deduced amino acid\n\nsequence of the PlRACK1 gene was searched against the\n\nGenBank database with the BLAST program (http://www.ncbi.\n\nnlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Sequence alignment of PlRACK1 was\n\ngenerated by ClustalW, and the protein domains were analyzed\n\nwith the SMART program (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/).\n\nTissue distribution analysis\nTotal RNAs were isolated from different crayfish tissues using\n\nTRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) followed by RNase-free DNase I\n\n(Ambion) treatment. For reverse transcription, 1 mg of total RNA\nwas reverse transcribed to produce cDNA using ThermoScrip RT-\n\nPCR (Invitrogen). To amplify and visualize the cDNAs of PlRACK1\n\nand PlBMAL1, two sets of primers were used: the forward and\n\nreverse primers listed in Table S2. The PCR cycles were as follows: 1\n\ncycle (95uC for 2 min); 28 cycles (95uC, 30 s; 55uC, 30 s; 72uC, 40 s)\nfollowed by an extension step (72uC for 5 min). The transcription of\nthe 40S ribosomal protein was used as an internal control. All PCR\n\nproducts were analyzed on 1% GelRed-stained agarose gels.\n\nCrayfish HPT cell culture and maintenance\nThe hematopoietic tissue was dissected, washed with CPBS\n\n(crayfish phosphate buffered saline (pH 6.8), 10 mM Na2HPO4,\n\n10 mM KH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM\nMnCl2,) and incubated in 600 ml of 0.1% collagenase (types I and\nIV) (Sigma) in CPBS at room temperature for 45 min to separate\n\nthe HPT cells. The separated cells were washed twice with CPBS\n\nby centrifugation at 8006g for 5 min at room temperature. The\ncell pellet was re-suspended in modified L-15 medium, and cells\n\nwere then seeded at a density of 2.56106 cells/150 ml in 96-well\nplates. The HPT cells were supplemented with partially purified\n\nplasma as a source of AST1 after 1 h of attachment at room\n\ntemperature. The culture plates were incubated at 16uC, and 1/3\nof the medium was changed at 48 h intervals.\n\nMelatonin treatment\nFor the in vivo experiments, 100 ml of a melatonin solution\n\n(Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol and diluted in crayfish saline (to a\n\nfinal ethanol concentration of 1%). This solution was injected into\n\nthe base of a walking leg such that the amount of injected\n\nmelatonin was 4.3 nmol/g fresh weight. Control crayfish received\n\n100 ml of saline with 1% ethanol. The hemolymph, brain, and\nHPT of these crayfish were collected at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 h post-\n\ninjection for the extraction of total RNA, whereas samples for total\n\nprotein extraction were dissected at 3 h post-injection. All\n\ninjections were performed during the day.\n\nFigure 5. PlRACK1, PlBMAL1, and AST2 form an approximately 200-kDa protein complex during the dark period.

The first\n\nand second groups were injected with 300 mg of GFP control\ndsRNA and 300 mg of dsAST2, respectively, at the base of the\nfourth walking leg. Twenty-four hours after the first dsRNA\n\ninjection, four drops of crayfish hemolymph were bled for total\n\nRNA isolation to test the efficiency of the RNAi. Then, dsRNA\n\nwas injected a second time into both groups as described above.\n\nTwenty-four hours after the second dsRNA injection, the brains\n\nwere dissected at 06:00, 12:00, 21:00, and 03:00 to determine\n\ncomplex formation by western blotting.\n\nPlasmid constructs\nPlRACK1 was amplified using the synthesized forward primer\n\nRACK1_F1 and reverse primer RACK1_R1 (Table S2) by PCR.\n\nThe conditions for the PCR reactions were essentially identical to\n\nthose described in the manufacturer’s protocol for the vector.

Identification of the protein\n\nwas based on raw MS/MS data, and ions search using the Mascot\n\nprogram (http://www.matrixscience.com).\n\nThe interaction between GST-PlRACK1and HisTrx-AST2\n\nwas examined by incubating purified GST-PlRACK1or the GST\n\ncontrol with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (50 ml a 50% bed\nslurry) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were washed three\n\ntimes with PBS, purified HisTrx-AST2 or the His-Trx control\n\n(5 mg) was added, and incubated for another 2 h at room\ntemperature in PBS buffer. After washing with PBS, the\n\nprecipitated proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer.\n\nTo determine the formation of a PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complex,\n\n5 mg purified His-Trx-PlBMAL1 protein was incubated with 5 mg\npurified GST-PlRACK1 protein bound to Glutathione Sepharose\n\n4B beads. The beads were then washed five times, and the\n\nremaining proteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer.\n\nTo explore whether AST2 can bind to PlRACK1 together with\n\nPlBMAL1, purified His-Trx-PlBMAL1 (500 ng) and His-Trx-\n\nAST2 (500 ng) were incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B-\n\nbound GST-PlRACK1 (0, 5, 50, 500 ng) in PBS buffer at 25uC for\n2 h. The protein-bead complexes were washed, and the bound\n\nproteins were eluted with SDS-sample buffer. All protein samples\n\nwere resolved by SDS-PAGE and were analyzed by western blot.\n\nBlot overlay assays\nIn addition to an in vitro GST pull-down assay, a far western\n\noverlay assay was used to identify any putative AST2 binding\n\nprotein. The protein was extracted from crayfish HPT and then\n\nsubjected to 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PDVF membranes,\n\nand blocked with 10% skim milk in TBST buffer (10 mM Tris-\n\nHCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20) at room\n\ntemperature. After three washes with TBST, the membranes were\n\nincubated with 25 mM GST-AST2 or GST alone in 10 ml TBST\n\nbuffer at room temperature. The blots were washed twice and\n\nincubated for 1 h with 1:2,000 dilution of anti GST antibody and\n\nthen washed twice, incubated for 1 h with 1:1,000 dilution of anti\n\nmouse antibody for 1 h, and washed three times before detection\n\nwith an ECL western blotting reagent kit. The control reaction\n\nwas incubated with GST instead of GST-AST2.\n\nPurified GST-PlRACK1 protein was cleaved by incubation with\n\nthrombin (GE Healthcare, 1 ml thrombin per 100 mg recombinant\nprotein) at 22uC overnight to remove the GST fusion tag. Free\nPlRACK1was eluted with PBS from the Glutathione Sepharose 4B\n\nbeads. PlRACK1 was run on 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to\n\nPDVF membranes and incubated at 4uC overnight with purified\nGST-PlBMAL1 or GST alone (7 mg) in 10 ml TBST buffer. The\nblot was washed three times (10 min each) in TBST containing\n\n0.05% Tween 20. Protein interactions were detected by western\n\nblotting using an anti-GST antibody. Blot overlay assays were also\n\nused to confirm the binding of AST2. Preparation of total crayfish\n\nbrain homogenates and gel overlays with recombinant GST-AST2\n\n(far western blots) were performed as described above.\n\nwas used as a control (white).

Cell extracts for western\n\nblotting and immunoprecipitation were prepared by suspending\n\nthe PBS-washed cells in NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0),\n\n150 mM NaCl, and 1.0% NP-40) with protease inhibitor cocktail\n\ntablets (Roche). Following incubation on ice for 30 min, non-\n\nextractable material was removed by centrifugation at\n\n13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4uC. Cleared supernatants were used\nfor immunoprecipitation, whereas whole homogenized cells were\n\nmixed with 1X SDS loading buffer with and without DTT,\n\nfollowed by western analysis. Cell extracts analyzed directly by\n\nELISA were homogenized in bicarbonate/carbonate coating\n\nbuffer (pH 9.6).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nProtein samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and\n\ntransferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, America) in electro-\n\nblotting buffer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 20% methanol) for\n\n120 min. After rinsing with TBST buffer, the membranes were\n\nimmersed in blocking buffer (5% skim milk powder in TBST) at\n\n4uC, overnight, followed by incubation with primary antibody for\n1 h (anti-GST or anti-His diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST).\n\nSubsequently, the membranes were incubated in HRP-conjugated\n\nrabbit anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare) for 1 h and visualized by\n\nthe enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham\n\nBiosciences). The X-ray images from western blotting were\n\nanalyzed according to the Quantity One user guide. Briefly, the\n\nwestern blotting films were scanned and saved as digital images as\n\na quantity-one file (or .1sc) by GS-800 calibrated imaging\n\nE-box was used as control. C) Western blot showing the effect of AST2 knock down or melatonin treatment on the protein levels of CLK/PlBMAL1,\nAST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complexes (upper panel), and AST2 level (middle panel).

In three independent experiments, proteins were visualized by western blotting and quantitated using the\nQuantity One software. These results are shown in graph D and E.

Molecular model of the circadian regulation by CLK, PlBMAL1, PlRACK1, and AST2. The protein level of CLK is enhanced during\nthe light period, and a CLK-PlBMAL1 complex is formed that acts as a transcriptional activator. During the dark period melatonin secretion causes an\nupregulation of AST2 and this high AST2 level results in the formation of a complex between PlBMAL1 and PlRACK1. Then AST2 binds to PlRACK 1 in\nthe PlBMAL-PlRACK1 complex and forms the AST2-PlRACK1-PlBMAL1 complex and this interferes with the formation and activity of the CLK-PlBMAL1\nheterodimer.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1003361.g009\n\nAST2 Links Melatonin to Circadian Rhythm\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 16 March 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e1003361\n\n\n\ndensitometer. These quantity-one files were used for protein\n\nanalysis. Protein bands in all scanned images (.1sc file) were\n\nquantified and the values of the band intensities were calculated by\n\nusing the Volume and Match tools (Quantity One software version\n\n4.6.0; Bio-Rad Laboratories). These values were used to perform\n\nstatistical analysis as described in the ‘‘Statistical analysis’’ part\n\nbelow.\n\nImmunoprecipitation\nImmunoprecipitations were performed by first incubating cell\n\nlysates from brain or HPT with the indicated primary antibodies\n\novernight at 4uC. Immune complexes were then precipitated by\nincubating reactions for an additional 2 h at 4uC with either\nSepharose-conjugated protein A or agarose-conjugated protein G.\n\nThe immunoprecipitates were washed four times with 1% Triton\n\nX-100 lysis buffer and were resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample\n\nbuffer for western blotting.\n\nTranscription analysis\nThe transcript levels of AST1 and AST2 were detected by\n\nquantitative RT-PCR using QuantiTect SYBR green PCR kit\n\n(QIAGEN). The relative expression was normalized to the\n\nexpression of the mRNA encoding the crayfish ribosomal protein\n\ngene (R40s) for each sample. The primers used are shown in Table\n\nS2. The qPCR reactions contained 5 ml of 1:10 diluted cDNA\ntemplate, 1xQuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix (QIA-\n\nGEN) and 5 mM forward and reverse primers in a 25 ml reaction\nvolume. The following amplification profile was used: 95uC for\n15 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94uC for 15 s, 58uC for 30 s, and\n72uC for 30 s. All qPCR reactions were performed in triplicates.\nThe hemocytes, HPTs and brains from a least three crayfish were\n\nused for each time point. The statistical comparisons were\n\nperformed as shown below (Statistical analysis).\n\nELISA\nCell extracts, containing protein at 20 mg/ml were coated in\n\nwells and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by\n\nincubation with blocking solution (1% BSA in PBS). Following\n\nthree careful washes with PBS, the different proteins were detected\n\nwith the corresponding primary antibody (1:1000) followed by\n\nHRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000). After the addition\n\nof 100 ml tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma) and\nincubation for 20 min, the reaction was terminated by 100 ml of\nstop solution (0.5 M sulfuric acid) and the absorbance of the\n\nresulting color was measured at 450 nm. All samples were\n\nperformed in triplicates and each experiment was repeated three\n\ntimes.\n\nAntibodies\nPolyclonal antibodies against recombinant crayfish AST1 and\n\nAST2 were raised in rabbit as have been described earlier [31]. A\n\ngoat polyclonal antibody to human BMAL1 (N-5: SC-8550) and\n\ngoat polyclonal antibody to mouse CLK (S-19: SC-6927) were\n\nobtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. A goat polyclonal\n\nantibody to RACK1 (GNB2L1: Orb22484) was obtained from\n\nBiorbyt. A goat polyclonal antibody against actin (C-11: SC-1615)\n\nwas used as internal control. The specificity of each antibody was\n\ntested by western blots, and all were found to be specific for each\n\nprotein.\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)\nMobility shift assays were performed according to reference\n\n[53]. Briefly, a synthetic fluorophore labeled oligonucleotide probe\n\nincluding an E-box element (CACGTG) was used as a substrate in\n\nthis assay. To generate an E-box containing double-stranded DNA\n\nfragment, the two fluorophore labeled E-box oligonucleotides\n\ndescribed below were annealed. A 30 mL EMSA reaction mixture\ncontained ,100 mM KCl, 50 ng of crude crayfish brain lysates,\n1 mg poly (dI-dC), and 10 fmol of labeled probe. For control\n10 fmol of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide or mutant E-box\n\noligonucleotide were incubated as control. After incubation for\n\n1 hour on ice, antibodies against CLK protein was added and\n\nincubated another 20 minutes on ice. Protein-DNA complexes\n\nwere resolved by 5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specific\n\nDNA-protein and antibody-supershifted complexes were observed\n\nas retarded bands in the gel.

When two treatments were compared, a Student’s\n\npaired t-test was used. Differences were considered statistically\n\nsignificant at P,0.05 and/or P,0.01. The results are expressed as\n\nthe mean 6 standard deviation (SD).\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 A) The specific binding of AST1 and AST2\n\nantibodies was detected by western blotting of a hemocyte lysate.\n\nB) AST2 protein was detected only inside the cell, whereas the\n\nAST1 could be detected in both plasma and cytoplasm of the\n\nhemocytes.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S2 Amino acid sequence alignment of PlRACK1 with\n\nother RACK1 sequences from other species: mouse-RACK1 (Mus\n\nmusculus, BAE40059.1), human-RACK1 (Homo sapiens,\n\nBAD96208.1), Zebrafish (Danio rerio, NP571519.1), shrimp-\n\nRACK1 (P. monodon, ABU49887.1), crayfish-RACK1 (P. leniusculus)\n\nand fruit fly-RACK1 (D. melanogaster, NP477269.1).
