Previous reports have\ncorrelated the level of UEV1A expression with tumorigenesis; however, the detailed molecular events leading to\ntumors particularly breast cancer and metastasis are unclear. This study is to investigate roles of different UEV1 splicing\nvariants, and its close homolog MMS2, in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis in breast cancer cells.\n\nMethods: We experimentally manipulated the UEV1 and MMS2 levels in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and\nmonitored their effects on cell invasion and migration, as well as tumor formation and metastasis in xenograft mice.\nThe underlying molecular mechanisms leading to metastasis were also examined.\n\nResults: It was found that overexpression of UEV1A alone, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is sufficient to induce cell invasion\nin vitro and metastasis in vivo. This process is mediated by NF-κB activation and requires functional Ubc13. Our\nexperimental data establish that among NF-κB target genes, UEV1A-regulated matrix metalloproteinase-1\n(MMP1) expression plays a critical role in cell invasion and metastasis. Interestingly, experimental depletion of UEV1 in\nMDA-MB-231 cells reduces MMP1 expression and prevents tumor formation and metastasis in a xenograft mouse\nmodel, while overexpression of MMP1 overrides the metastasis effects in UEV1-depleted cells.\n\nConclusions: These results identify UEV1A as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of metastasic breast\ncancers.\nIntroduction\nUEV1, also known as CROC1 [1] or CIR1 [2], encodes a\nubiquitin (Ub)-conjugating enzyme variant (Uev) [3]. It was\nalso identified as a mammalian homolog of yeast MMS2 [4]\nand as a co-factor of Ubc13 [5]. Indeed, a Uev (Uev1A or\nMms2) is absolutely required for Ubc13-mediated Lys(K)\n63-linked polyubiquitin chain assembly [5-9]. Despite their\nshared biochemical activity, Mms2 and Uev1A appear to\nfunction differently in mammalian cells: Ubc13-Mms2 is\nrequired for DNA-damage responses whereas Ubc13-\nUev1A is involved in nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation\n[10]. Previous studies implicate UEV1 as a potential proto-\n* Correspondence: wei.xiao@usask.ca\n1College of Life Sciences, Capital Normal University, Beijing, China 100048\n2Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Saskatchewan,\nSaskatoon, SK S7N 5E5, Canada\n\n© 2014 Wu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd\nCommons Attribution License (http://creativec\nreproduction in any medium, provided the or\nDedication waiver (http://creativecommons.or\nunless otherwise stated.\noncogene. UEV1 was initially identified as a transactivator\nof the c-fos promoter [1]. It is downregulated when HT29-\nM6 colon cancer cells undergo chemical-induced differenti-\nation, and upregulated when Simian virus 40-transformed\nhuman embryonic kidney cells become immortal [2]. Fur-\nthermore, UEV1 is variably upregulated in all tumor cell\nlines examined [4], and maps to chromosome 20q13.2 [3],\na region where DNA amplification is frequently reported in\nbreast cancers [11-14] and other tumors [15], as well as in\nvirus-transformed immortal cells [16].\nUbc13-Uev1A is involved in NF-κB activation\n\n[10,17,18] and inhibits stress-induced apoptosis in\nHepG2 cells [19]. Very recently, it was reported that a\nsmall-molecule inhibitor of Ubc13-Uev1A interaction\ncan inhibit proliferation and survival of diffuse large B-\ncell lymphoma cells [20].

It regulates a panel of genes that collectively play\npro-survival and anti-apoptotic roles [26,27]. It also controls\nthe expression of genes linked with invasion, angiogenesis,\nand metastasis of cancer, including the matrix metallopro-\nteinase (MMP) family [28,29] and chemokine (C-X-C motif)\nligand (CXCL) family genes [30,31]. Activation of NF-κB is\na tightly regulated event. In normal cells, NF-κB becomes\nactivated only after the appropriate stimulation, and then it\nupregulates the transcription of its target genes [24]. NF-κB\nis activated by many divergent stimuli, including proinflam-\nmatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1b, epidermal growth\nfactor (EGF), T- and B-cell mitogens and bacterial lipopoly-\nsaccharides (LPS) [32]. Previous studies reported that the\nUev1A-Ubc13 heterodimer is involved in TNF receptor-\nassociated factor 6 (TRAF6) [17,33] and TRAF2-mediated\n[34] activation of NF-κB, in which Ubc13-Uev1A probably\nserves as a unique Ubc/E2 along with TRAF proteins to\npolyubiquitinate NF-κB essential modulator/inhibitor of κB\nproteinkinase (NEMO/IKKγ) [18,35] and/or Rieske iron-\nsulfur polypeptide 1(RIP1) [36] to activate IκB kinase (IKK).\nActivated IKK leads to the phosphorylation and degradation\nof IκBα, resulting in the release of NF-κB RelA (p65) sub-\nunits to translocate into the nucleus [37].\nIn this study we demonstrate that in MDA-MB-231 breast\n\ncancer cells, the UEV1A transcript level is moderately ele-\nvated compared to normal breast cells. Overexpression\nof UEV1A alone in MDA-MB-231 cells is sufficient to\nactivate NF-кB, which in turn upregulates the MMP1\nexpression to enhance breast cancer cell metastasis. More\nimportantly, experimental depletion of Uev1 in MDA-MB-\n231 cells reduces MMP1 expression and reduces their abil-\nity to grow tumors and metastasize in a xenograft mouse\nmodel. These observations provide the experimental and\ntheoretical cornerstone for therapeutic targeting of Uev1A\nin the treatment of metastatic breast cancers.\n\nMethods\nCell culture\nHuman breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231, MCF7,\nMDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-453, MDA-MB-\n436 and SK-BRIII were obtained from the American Type\nCulture Collection (ATCC, Manassan, VA, USA). The cells\nwere cultured in Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium\n(DMEM) (Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada) supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicil-\nlin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2\natmosphere at 37°C. The MCF10A immortalized human\nmammary epithelial cells were obtained from ATCC and\ncultured in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10%\nhorse serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml strepto-\nmycin (Invitrogen), 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO,\nUSA), 100 ng/ml choleratoxin (Sigma), 0.5 mg/ml hydro-\ncortisone (Sigma), and 20 ng/ml EGF (Peprotech). MDA-\nMB-231-TR stable cell lines were created by transfecting\nMDA-MB-231 cell lines with pLenti6-TR-lentivirus (Invi-\ntrogen) and selecting with 10 μg/ml blasticidin (Invitrogen).\n\nPlasmids and pLentivirus vector preparation\nHuman MMS2, UEV1A, and UEV1C open reading frames\n(ORFs) were PCR-amplified as KpnI-XhoI fragments and\ncloned into the pcDNA4.0/TO/HA(+) plasmid vector.\nThe 1.9-kb human MMP1 promoter sequence [GenBank:\nAJ002550.1] was PCR-amplified as a KpnI-HindIII fragment\nand then cloned into the same sites of pGL4.2 (Invitrogen).\nThe NF-кB target site was subsequently mutated by site-\ndirected mutagenesis using a quick-exchange method\n(Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The sense primer for creat-\ning the NF-кB binding site mutation is 5′-AAAGG CAGAA\nGGGAA CCTCA AGAGG TTTTG AAGAG CCACC\nGTAAA GTGAG-3′ (mutated sequence italicized). The\nmutated Ubc13-binding site (F38E) in Uev1A was designed\nbased on a previous study with Mms2-F13E [9]. The modi-\nfied sequence for UEV1 small hairpin RNA (shRNA)\ndelivered by lentiviral particles was from Santa Cruz Bio-\ntechnology, Inc (Dallas, Texas, USA). The lentiviral particle\ninfection of breast cancer cells was performed following in-\nstructions of the supplier. The MMP1 and MMP9 small\ninterfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Gene-\npharma Co Ltd (Shanghai, China). The sequence for MMP1\nsiRNA is 5′- GCGUGUGACAGUAAGCUAATT-3′ and\nthat for MMP9 siRNA is 5′-CGCUCAUGUACCC\nUAUGUATT-3′.\n\nRNA preparation and real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)\nTotal RNA was prepared from cultured breast cancer cells\nby using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). First-strand cDNA was\nsynthesized from total RNA with SuperScript (Invitrogen)\naccording to manufacturer’s instructions. The human\nbreast cancer cDNAs TissueScan™ cancer qPCR Arrays\n(#BCRT102) were purchased from Origene (Beijing,\nChina). The clinical information is shown on the website\n[38] and Additional file 1. qRT-PCR analysis was per-\nformed on the iQ5 cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).\nThe specific primer sets were as follows: GADPH, 5′-\nGAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ and 5′- GAAGATGG\nTGATGGGATTTC-3′; UEV1, 5′- TCTCCACAGCAATC\nCTATGAGGTTGA-3′ and 5′- CCAACAGTCGGAAAT\nTGCGAGGG-3′; UEV1A, 5′- GAGAGGTTCAAGCGT\nCTTACCTGAA-3′ and 5′-ACTGTGCCATCTCCTACT\nCCTTTCT -3′; UEV1C, 5′-GCAGCCACCACGGGC\n\n\n\nWu et al.

Briefly, luciferase reporter gene constructs (400 ng),\npcDNA-Uevs plasmids (400 ng) and the pRL-SV40\nRenilla luciferase construct (5 ng) (for normalization)\nwere co-transfected into the wells. Cell extracts were pre-\npared 48 hr after transfection and the luciferase activity\nwas measured using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay\nsystem (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).\n\nWestern blot analysis\nCells were grown to log phase and lysed in Dulbecco’s PBS\n(150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 10 mM NaH2PO4,\npH 7.4) with 1% SDS and the protease inhibitor cocktail for\nmammalian cells (Sigma-Aldrich). Total protein concentra-\ntion was determined by the Bradford method using a com-\nmercial reagent from Bio-Rad. Cell extracts or purified\nproteins were electrophoresed in 10% or 15% SDS-\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gels, transferred\nto polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and incubated\nwith specific primary antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies\n(mAbs) LN2B (anti-Uev1) and 4E11 (anti-Ubc13) were\nfrom the laboratory stock [10,39]. Primary antibodies\nagainst HA (sc-7392), MMP1 (sc-30069), NF-κB (sc-372),\nLamin B (sc-166729), β-tublin (sc-6216), and secondary\ngoat anti-mouse antibody IgG-horseradish peroxidase\n(HRP) (sc-2005) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP (sc-2004)\nantibody were from Santa Cruz. The P-IκBα antibody\n(#2859S) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Whitby,\nON, Canada), while an anti-MMP9 antibody (ab38898)\nwas from Abcam (Toronto, ON, Canada) and β-actin anti-\nbody (BM0627) was from Boster (Wunah, China).\n\nImmunoprecipitation\nWe immunoprecipitated 1 mg of protein samples in a total\nvolume of 1 ml with 2 μg of antibody and 20 μl of Protein-\nA beads (for rabbit polyclonal antibodies) or Protein-G\nbeads (for mouse monoclonal antibodies). The samples were\nrotated at 4°C overnight. The beads were washed 4 times\nwith 1 ml of cold NP40 lysis buffer containing protease in-\nhibitors. The beads were then boiled for 10 minutes in the\npresence of 25 μl 2 × sample buffer and the released proteins\nfractionated by SDS-PAGE in 12% or 15% gels. Proteins\nwere detected by immunoblotting as described above.\n\nCell invasion and migration assays\nIn vitro invasion assays were conducted using Transwells\n(Costar, Cambridge, MA, USA) with 8-μm-pore-size poly-\ncarbonate membrane filters in 24-well culture plates. The\nupper surface of the filter was coated with Matrigel\n(Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA, USA) in a volume of\n12.5 μl per filter. The Matrigel was dried and reconstituted\nat 37°C into a solid gel on the filter surface. The lower\nsurface of the filter was coated in fibronectin (20 μg/ml),\nvitronectin (10 μg/ml), collagen IV (50 μg/ml), or 10%\n(BSA)-DMEM as chemoattractants. After starving in BSA-\nfree DMEM overnight, 2 × 104 cells were seeded in the\nupper chamber. The cells were allowed to invade for 48 hr.\nCells that invaded the lower surface of the filter were\ncounted in five random fields under a light-microscope at\nhigh magnification. Experiments were conducted at least\nin triplicate. The in vitro cell migration ability was detected\nby wound healing assay or transwell assay without Matrigel\ncoating. The wound healing assay was performed by seed-\ning 2 × 105 cells onto 96-well plates. Confluent monolayers\nwere wounded using a pipette tip. After 48 hr the cell mi-\ngration distance was measured under a light-microscope at\nhigh magnification in at least three random fields. The\ntranswell assay without Matrigel was conducted using\nTranswells with 8-μm-pore-size polycarbonate membrane\nfilters in 24-well culture plates. The lower surface of the fil-\nter was coated with 10% BSA-DMEM as chemoattractants.\nAfter starving in a BSA-free DMEM medium overnight,\n5 × 104 cells were seeded in the upper chamber. Cells were\nallowed to invade for 6 to 36 hr and those migrated to the\nlower surface of the filter were counted in five random\nfields under a light-microscope at high magnification. Ex-\nperiments were conducted at least in triplicate.\n\nMetastasis assay in a xenograft mouse model\nThe experimental mouse work followed the animal care\nprotocol CNUAREB-2012002 approved by the Capital Nor-\nmal University Animal Research Ethics Board and was con-\nducted at the Peking University Health Science Center,\nChina. For the tumorigenesis assays, 5 × 106 breast cancer\ncells were injected subcutaneously into the lateral flanks of\n4- to 5-week-old BALB/c female nude mice. The palpable\ntumor diameters were measured once per week. Tumor\nlength (L) and width (W) were measured with a caliper, and\nthe volume (V) was calculated by the following equation:\n\nV ¼ L�W2\n� �\n\n=2:\n\nThe mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after cell injection. For\nexperimental metastasis assays by intravenous (i.v.) injection,\n2 × 105 breast cancer cells were injected into the tail veins of\n\n\n\nWu et al. Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 4 of 15\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75\nthe 4- to 5-week-old female BALB/c nude mice. Endpoint\nassays were conducted 5 weeks after injection. Metastatic\nlung nodules 0.5 mm in diameter were counted. Analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical analyses. To\nensure representative sampling of lung tumor nodules,\nfour sections were made per lung at various depths along\nthe coronal plane of the lung. The nodules per lung (four\nsections) were counted under a light-microscope.\n\nHistopathology\nFormalin-fixed lungs were paraffin-embedded, and tissue\nsections derived from tumor nodules or other tissues were\nstained with H&E to evaluate the morphology and inva-\nsiveness of breast cancer cells. Metastatic tumor nodules\nwere counted throughout the entire lung section at all\nthree depths under a light-microscope. Anti-Uev1A (LN1),\nanti-MMP1 (sc-30069) and NF-κB p65 (sc-372) primary\nantibodies from Santa Cruz were used for immunohisto-\nchemistry (IHC). TissueFocus™ breast cancer tissue micro-\narrays (CT565863) for IHC were obtained from Origene\n(Beijing, China). Microscopic images were captured by a\nSPOT digital camera mounted in a light-microscope.\n\nPreparation of nuclear fraction\nHeLa cells were treated with 40 ng/ml TNF-α for 2 hr.\nCells were washed, scraped with PBS, and centrifuged at\n3,000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was suspended in 10 mM\nTris (pH 8.0) with 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol,\nand 0.1% NP-40, and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Nu-\nclei were separated from cytosol by centrifugation at\n12,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 minutes. The cytosolic superna-\ntants were removed and the precipitated pellets were sus-\npended in 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) containing 100 mM NaCl\nand stored on ice for 30 minutes. After agitation for 30 mi-\nnutes at 4°C, the lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for\n15 minutes at 4°C, and the supernatant was collected.\n\nElectrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)\nThe secquence of biotin-labelled sense NF-κB probe for\nEMSA is 5′-GAACCTCAGAGAACCCCGAAGAGCC-\n3′. The cold probe is the same NF-κB sequence without\nbiotin label. The sequence of biotin-labelled mutated\nsense NF-κB probe is 5′-GAA CCTCA AGAGGTTTTG\nAAGAGCC-3′ (mutated sequence underlined): 1 ng of\nthe probe was incubated together with 10 to 20 μg of\ncell extracts or 5 to 10 μg of nuclear extracts for 30 mi-\nnutes at 25°C in a final volume of 20 μl. The binding\nreaction was subsequently separated on a 5.5-7% poly-\nacrylamide gel in 1x Tris-Borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer (90 mM\nTris, 90 mM boric acid).\n\nStatistical analysis\nThe statistical significance of differential findings between\nthe experimental and control groups was determined by\nStudent’s t-test as implemented by Microsoft Excel 2010\n(*P <0.05, **P <0.01 and ***P <0.001).\n\nResults\nAlternative UEV1 transcript levels in breast cancer cell\nlines and samples\nTwo major human UEV1 transcripts (UEV1A and UEV1B)\nwere previously reported [1]. It was determined that only\nUev1A, but not Uev1B, is able to physically interact with\nUbc13 and promote K63-linked polyubiquitination [10]. It\nturns out that Uev1B is excluded from the nucleus and in-\nvolved in endosomal trafficking [40]. Interestingly, data-\nbase analyses also indicate another splicing variant that\nwould encode a 147-amino acid Uev1 core domain, which\nwe name Uev1C (Figure 1A), the cellular function of which\nis currently unknown.\nWestern blot analysis of endogenous Uev1s using a\n\nUev1-specific monoclonal antibody LN2B [39] could only\ndetect Uev1C in several breast cancer cell lines including\nMDA-MB-231 and MCF7, and MCF10A, an immortalized\nnormal mammary epithelial cell line (Figure 1B). qRT-\nPCT analysis revealed that the relative transcript level\nof UEV1C is approximately 100-fold higher than that of\nUEV1A in the above cell lines (Figure 1C), consistent with\nobservations in other cell lines including HeLa and U2OS\n(data not shown).\nWe next examined relative transcript levels of UEV1A\n\nand UEV1C in breast cancer lines using MCF10A as a\nreference. Interestingly, the UEV1A transcript level is ele-\nvated in all breast cancer cell lines examined (Figure 1D),\nwith no significant upregulation of UEV1C (Figure 1E) or\nMMS2 (Additional file 2: Figure S1A) in these lines. It has\nbeen previously reported that the UEV1A level may be el-\nevated when normal cells undergo immortalization [2]. To\nfurther assess relative UEV1A expression in normal versus\nbreast tumor tissues, we measured the UEV1A tran-\nscript level in five normal human breast samples and 43\nbreast cancer samples from TissueScan microarrays.\nCompared with the five normal human breast samples,\n33/43 or 77% of breast cancer samples display UEV1A\nexpression above the highest UEV1A level in normal\nsamples, or at least 1.7-fold higher than the average level\namong the five normal samples (Additional file 2: Figure\nS1B), suggesting that Uev1A may play a role in promoting\nbreast tumorigenesis.\n\nOverexpression of UEV1A promotes breast cancer cell\ninvasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft model\nTo ask whether an elevated UEV1A level is indeed suffi-\ncient to promote breast cancer, UEV1A, UEV1C or MMS2\ngenes were cloned into a pcDNA4.0/TO/HA(+) vector\nand then transfected into MDA-MB-231-TR cells to con-\nstruct stable cell lines, and the level of ecotopic gene ex-\npression after 10 μg/ml doxycycline (Dox) treatment was\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (UEV)1A is overexpressed in breast cancer cell lines and tumor samples.

The effects of ecotopic genes on breast cancer\ncell migration and invasion were then measured. The\nwound-healing experimental data show that the over-\nexpression of UEV1A doubles the mobility compared\nwith the same cells without ecotopic UEV1A expression\nor vector-transfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells with Dox\ntreatment, while overexpression of UEV1C or MMS2 does\nnot affect cell mobility compared with uninduced cells\n(Figure 2B, C and Additional file 2: Figure S4). In a trans-\nwell assay, the invasiveness of UEV1A transfectants after\ninduction was approximately 2.3-fold higher than the\n\n\n\nFigure 2 UEV1A overexpression promotes breast cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft model.

Breast Cancer Research 2014, 16:R75 Page 6 of 15\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/16/1/R75\n\n\n\nWu et al.

These results suggest that UEV1A regulates breast\ncancer cell migration and invasion in vitro.\nAs an increased ability of cancer cells to migrate and\n\ninvade in vitro is a faithful indicator of cell metastasis, to\nfurther confirm the correlation between UEV1A expres-\nsion and breast cancer metastasis, we assessed the effects\nof UEV1A on metastasis using an in vivo xenograft mouse\nmodel. Stably-transfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells were\ninjected into the lateral flanks of 4- to 5-week-old BALB/c\nfemale nude mice and Dox (625 mg/kg) was added in\nfeed as soon as the cells were injected. Tumor growth\nand metastasis were then monitored. All mice (10/10)\ninjected with the UEV1A-expressing cells had massively\nenlarged lymph nodes containing invasive breast cancer\ncells (Figure 2F). In contrast, there were no tumor metas-\ntasis foci in lymph nodes of mice injected with vector\ncontrol or UEV1C-expressing cells, although some lymph\nnodes were enlarged (data not shown). Furthermore, over-\nexpression of UEV1A but not UEV1C accelerated tumor\ngrowth compared to vector-transfected cells (Figure 2G).\nIn the tail-vein injection groups, compared with UEV1C\nor vector control, overexpression of UEV1A significantly\npromoted lung metastasis colony fomation (Figure 2H,\nand I). These observations collectively demonstrate that\nelevated expression of UEV1A alone is sufficient to pro-\nmote tumor growth and metastasis.\n\nDepletion of Uev1 prevents breast cancer cell invasion\nin vitro and metastasis in nude mice\nCompared with MCF-10A cells, there was a 2.7-fold in-\ncrease in the UEV1A expression in MDA-MB-231 cells\n(Figure 1D). To ask whether this moderate overexpression\nof UEV1A contributes to breast cancer metastasis, the en-\ndogenous UEV1A expression in MDA-MB-231 cells was\nsuppressed using an shRNA (shUEV1) delivered by lenti-\nviral particles. It was found that two independent shUEV1\nconstructs, shUEV1-1 and shUEV1-2, reduced UEV1A ex-\npression to 40% and 55% of control shRNA-treated cells,\nrespectively (Figure 3A). As expected, the cellular UEV1C\nmRNA and protein levels were also reduced but MMS2\nremained unaffected (Additional file 2: Figure S5A-C).\nMoreover, partial depletion of Uev1 reduced cell migra-\ntion (Figure 3B and Additional file 2: Figure S5D) and in-\nvasion (Figure 3C and Additional file 2: Figure S5E). The\nabove findings were further extended by using a xenograft\nlung metastasis model, in which depletion of Uev1 limited\ntumor growth to the extent that no tumor was found in\nnude mice injected with MDA-MB-231 cells in which the\nUev1 level was reduced by shUEV1-2 (Figure 3D and\nAdditional file 2: Figure S5F). Furthermore, depletion of\nUev1 in MDA-MB-231 cells significantly reduced the\nnumber of lung nodules formed in mice and completely\nabolished metastasis in lung, even with moderate deple-\ntion of Uev1 (Figure 3E, shUEV1-1, middle panel). These\nresults clearly indicate that the elevated UEV1A expres-\nsion in MDA-MB-231 cells plays a critical role in breast\ntumorigenesis and metastasis.\n\nOverexpression of UEV1A activates NF-κB in MDA-MB-231\ncells in a Ubc13-dependent manner\nTo understand the mechanism by which Uev1A promotes\nmetastasis in breast cancer cells, we took into account that\nUev1A has been reported to activate NF-κB in HepG2\n[19], and that NF-κB regulates the expression of a large\nnumber of genes critical for tumorigenesis, inflammation\nand metastasis [41]. As a hallmark of NF-κB activation is\nits translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, we\ntransfected MDA-MB-231-TR cells with a variety of con-\nstructs, induced the target gene expression by adding Dox,\nfractionated cells and then measured the subcellular distri-\nbution of the p65 subunit of NF-κB. As seen in Figure 4A,\nonly overexpression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2,\nwas able to increase the phosphorylation of the NF-κB\ninhibitor IκBα (presumably in the cytoplasm) and en-\nrich p65 in the nucleus. Consistently, depletion of Uev1\nby shRNA reduced IκBα phosphorylation and p65 nuclear\ntranslocation (Figure 4B).\nIt has been previously reported that Uev1A is a cofactor\n\nof Ubc13 in the NF-κB signaling pathway [10,17]. To ask\nwhether the above Uev1A function is indeed dependent\non Ubc13, we created a Uev1A-F38E mutation as the cor-\nresponding Mms2-F12E mutation (Figure 1A) absolutely\nabolishes its interaction with Ubc13 and its ability to pro-\nmote Ubc13-mediated K63 polyubiquitination [9]. Indeed\nwe confirmed that the Uev1A-F38E substitution does not\naffect its expression (Additional file 2: Figure S2F) but\nabolishes its interaction with Ubc13 in vivo (Figure 4C).\nAs expected, overexpression of UEV1A-F38E failed to ac-\ntivate NF-κB, as judged by a lack of IκBα phosphorylation\nand p65 nucleaar translocation (Figure 4D).\n\nMMP1 and MMP9 are tightly regulated by UEV1\nAs NF-κB is a transcriptional factor that regulates the\nexpression of a large number of genes including those\ninvolved in metastasis, we measured the transcription of\nmany established or putative NF-κB target genes thought\nto be involved in metastasis such as COX2 [42], VEGF\n[43] and MMP family genes, among which MMP1 and\nMMP9 transcripts were elevated by 4.6- and 3.9-fold, re-\nspectively, in UEV1A-overexpression cells, but not in UEV1C\nor MMS2 overexpression cells (Figure 5A,B), with corre-\nsponding elevation at proteins levels (Figure 5C). The\nobserved increase is completely dependent on Ubc13,\nas overexpression of UEV1A-F38E failed to induce\nMMP1 or MMP9 (Figure 5B). Similarly, depletion of\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Depletion of ubiquitin conjugating enzyme variant (Uev)1 reduces cell invasion in vitro and metastasis in a xenograft mouse\nmodel.

Similarly, MMP1 depletion in UEV1A-\noverexpressed MDA-MB-231 cells (Additional file 2:\nFigure S6B) also decreased invasiveness (Additional file 2:\nFigure S6C and D). To ask whether overexpression of\nMMP1 is indeed sufficient to dictate MDA-MB-231 cell\ninvasion, we constructed an MMP1-expression plasmid\nand transfected it to MDA-MB-231 cells, which re-\nsulted in a 2.6-fold increase in the MMP1 transcript level\n(Additional file 2: Figure S6E) and a similar increase at the\nprotein level (Additional file 2: Figure S6F), as well as a\n2.3-fold increase in invasion (Figure 6C and Additional\nfile 2: Figure S6G). We then restored MMP1 level in\nUEV1-depleted cells to that of control cells (Figure 6D\nand E), which was sufficient to rescue the invasiveness in\nboth UEV1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cell lines (Figure 6F).\nAs MMP1 is an important cancer cell metastasis factor\n[44-46], the above findings allow us to conclude that\nUEV1A regulates metastasis through tightly controlling\nMMP1 expression.\n\nUevA-Ubc13 control MMP1 expression by regulating NF-κB\nTo ask whether Uev1A regulates MMP1 through NF-κB,\nwe cloned the 1.8-kb human MMP1 promoter sequence\n(Figure 7A) into pGL4.2 and co-transfected it with plas-\nmids expressing UEV1A, UEV1A-F38E or an empty vector\ninto MDA-MB-231 cells. A luciferase assay showed that\nUEV1A expression activates the MMP1 promoter and that\nthis activation relies on its interaction with Ubc13, as the\nUev1A-F38E substitution completely abolished the activa-\ntion (Figure 7B). The predicted NF-κB binding site (−1133\nto approximately −1125) in the MMP1 promoter was then\nmutated (Figure 7A) and the mutated reporter was used\nto co-transfect with plasmids expressing UEV1A, UEV1C,\nMMS2 or the empty vector into MDA-MB-231 cells.

To gain direct evidence that the predicted\nNF-κB binding site indeed interacts with NF-κB, an EMSA\nwas performed using nuclear lysates from TNFα-treated\nand untreated cells (Figure 7D). A biotin-labeled synthetic\nMMP1 promoter probe containing the putative NF-κB-\nbinding sequence was able to interact with the nuclear\nlysate and this interaction was enhanced when cells were\npretreated with TNF-α, which induced nuclear transloca-\ntion of p65 (Figure 7E, lanes 4 and 5).

It has been puzzling us that Uev1A and\nMms2 have different molecular weights and migrate\ndifferently; however, a monoclonal antibody capable of\nrecognizing both purified Uev1A and Mms2 only detects\na single band in western blot analysis, and siRNA deple-\ntion of either Mms2 or Uev1 only partially reduced the in-\ntensity of this band. A careful examination in this study\nreveals that in addition to the previously reported two\nUEV1 splicing variants UEV1A and UEV1B [1], cultured\n\n\n\nWu et al.

The resulting 147-residue protein would co-\nmigrate with Mms2 during electrophoresis. It turns out\nthat the UEV1C transcript is much more abundant than\nUEV1A, and a Uev1-specific monoclonal antibody can de-\ntect cellular Uev1C but not Uev1A, unless the latter is ex-\nperimentally overexpressed.\nThe current study investigates roles of UEV1A, UEV1C\n\nand MMS2 in tumorigenesis using a breast cancer model.\nWith comparable levels of ectopic expression, it was\nfound that only UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is able\nto promote cell migration and invasion. Similarly, overex-\npression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C promotes tumor\ngrowth and metastasis in a xenograft mouse model. The\nabove results are highly reliable, as the target gene expres-\nsion is under tight regulation of a Tet-on promoter, and\nthe phenotypes were only observed under Dox-induced\nconditions. In a reverse experiment, depletion of Uev1 in\ncultured breast cancer cells significantly reduces cell mi-\ngration and invasion, as well as tumor growth and metas-\ntasis in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that the\ncellular Uev1 (presumbly Uev1A) level plays a critical role\nin breast tumorigenesis and metastasis.\nTo understand the molecular mechanism by which\n\nUev1A promotes tumorigenesis, we demonstrated that\noverexpression of UEV1A, but not UEV1C or MMS2, is\nable to promote IκBα phorsphorylation and NF-κB trans-\nlocation into the nucleus, and that this effect absolutely re-\nlies on its physical interaction with Ubc13. It is conceivable\nthat as previously reported, the Ubc13-Uev1A heteromider\nserves as an E2 to assemble K63-linked poly-Ub chains\nalong with cognate really interesting new gene (RING)-\nfinger E3s like TRAF2 and/or TRAF6 [17,34], which\nrecruit K63 polyUb-binding proteins like NEMO [18]\nand TAB2/3 [47,48] to phorsphorylate and subsequently\ndegrade IκBα, leading to NF-κB activation.\nNF-κB activation promotes the transcription of many\n\ndownstream genes in the signaling cascade [41]. However,\nthe moderate level of NF-κB activation by UEV1A overex-\npression does not appear to induce all NF-κB targeting\ngenes. To understand how overexpression of UEV1A leads\nto tumorigenesis and particularly metastasis in breast can-\ncer cells, we surveyed NF-κB and metastasis-related genes\nand focused on two candidate genes, MMP1 and MMP9,\nboth of which are highly induced upon UEV1A overex-\npression. Experimental results as presented in this report\nindicate that both genes are tightly regulatd by cellular\nUev1 levels; however, depletion of MMP9 was not as ef-\nfective as that of MMP1 on cell migration and invasion.\nAs ecotopic expression of MMP1 to restore the wild-type\nlevel in Uev1-depleted cells also restored wild-type level\nof invasiveness, it is plausible to conclude that MMP1\nis the critical downstream effector of UEV1A-induced\nbreast cancer metastasis, although this study does not rule\nout the contributions of MMP9 and possibly other genes.\nThe signal transduction cascade of Uev1A→NF-κB→\nMMP1→metastasis is further confirmed by showing that\nUev1A-induced MMP1 expression is dependent on both\nUbc13 and the predicted NF-κB binding site located in\nthe MMP1 promoter. Although this report only presents\ndata from one human breast cancer line, we have obtained\ncomparable results with a different breast cancer cell line\nMCF7 (data not shown), indicating that the tumorigenic\nand metastatic effects of Uev1A is a general phenomenon\nin breast cancers.\nWhile the experimental evidence as shown in this report\n\nclearly indicates that UEV1A can function as a proto-\noncogene, the clinical relevance of this finding awaits fu-\nture investigation. Nevertheless, our limited TissueScan\nmicroarray data indicate a low (less than 2-fold) variation\nin UEV1A transcript levels among five normal human\nbreast samples, compared with an increase of up to 20-\nfold in some breast cancer samples. As NF-κB activation is\ncommonly observed in breast cancers [24,25,49] and\nUEV1 upregulation is also frequently observed in breast\ncancer samples [12-14] and in cultured tumor cell lines\n[4], and is found to be correlated to tumorigenic indicators\n[2,3], it is conceivable that a certain percentage of breast\ncancer samples with NF-κB activation is due to elevated\nUEV1A expression.\nThis study demonstrated that the N-terminal region of\n\nUev1A is the molecular determinant of its cellular func-\ntion(s) in the NF-κB signaling pathway. Although the\nexact cellular function of Uev1C remains a mystery, our\nprevious studies [10] have shown that truncated Uev1A\nmissing the N-terminal 30 amino acids behaves like\nMms2 in terms of subcellular localization and promo-\ntion of K63-linked di-Ub versus poly-Ub chains in vitro,\nsuggesting that Uev1C may play an Mms2-related role.\nGiven the importance of Uev1 in signaling and tumori-\n\ngenesis, small-molecule inhibitors against Uev1 have been\nisolated [20,50] based on their interference with the Ubc13-\nUev1A interaction, and one appears to be able to inhibit\nproliferation and survival of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma\ncells. It is unclear whether these inhibitors also interfere\nwith the Ubc13-Mms2 interaction, as critical residues\nresponaible for the heterdimer formation are conserved be-\ntween Uev1 and Mms2 [9]. Furthermore, this study pro-\nvides evidence that a desired inhibitor should target the\nN-terminal region of Uev1A instead of the Ubc13-Uev1\ninterface. Hence, this report provides an experimental and\ntheoretical cornerstone for future diagnosis and therapy\nby targeting Uev1A for the cure of breast cancer.\n\nConclusions\nAmong three Uev gene products, only Uev1A promotes\nbreast tumor metastasis, which is primarily through\n\n\n\nWu et al.
