Transcript profiling has suggested that Candida\nalbicans, a major pathogen of humans, regulates its carbon assimilation in an analogous fashion to the model yeast Saccharomy-\nces cerevisiae, repressing metabolic pathways required for the use of alterative nonpreferred carbon sources when sugars are\navailable. However, we show that there is significant dislocation between the proteome and transcriptome in C. albicans. Glu-\ncose triggers the degradation of the ICL1 and PCK1 transcripts in C. albicans, yet isocitrate lyase (Icl1) and phosphoenolpyru-\nvate carboxykinase (Pck1) are stable and are retained. Indeed, numerous enzymes required for the assimilation of carboxylic and\nfatty acids are not degraded in response to glucose. However, when expressed in C. albicans, S. cerevisiae Icl1 (ScIcl1) is sub-\njected to glucose-accelerated degradation, indicating that like S. cerevisiae, this pathogen has the molecular apparatus required\nto execute ubiquitin-dependent catabolite inactivation. C. albicans Icl1 (CaIcl1) lacks analogous ubiquitination sites and is sta-\nble under these conditions, but the addition of a ubiquitination site programs glucose-accelerated degradation of CaIcl1. Also,\ncatabolite inactivation is slowed in C. albicans ubi4 cells. Ubiquitination sites are present in gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle\nenzymes from S. cerevisiae but absent from their C. albicans homologues. We conclude that evolutionary rewiring of ubiquiti-\nnation targets has meant that following glucose exposure, C. albicans retains key metabolic functions, allowing it to continue to\nassimilate alternative carbon sources. This metabolic flexibility may be critical during infection, facilitating the rapid coloniza-\ntion of dynamic host niches containing complex arrays of nutrients.\n\nIMPORTANCE Pathogenic microbes must assimilate a range of carbon sources to grow and colonize their hosts. Current views\nabout carbon assimilation in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans are strongly influenced by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae par-\nadigm in which cells faced with choices of nutrients first use energetically favorable sugars, degrading enzymes required for the\nassimilation of less favorable alternative carbon sources. We show that this is not the case in C. albicans because there has been\nsignificant evolutionary rewiring of the molecular signals that promote enzyme degradation in response to glucose. As a result,\nthis major pathogen of humans retains enzymes required for the utilization of physiologically relevant carbon sources such as\nlactic acid and fatty acids, allowing it to continue to use these host nutrients even when glucose is available. This phenomenon\nprobably enhances efficient colonization of host niches where sugars are only transiently available.\n\nReceived 5 November 2012 Accepted 13 November 2012 Published 11 December 2012\n\nCitation Sandai D, et al. 2012.

P. Brown, al.brown@abdn.ac.uk.\n\nCarbon assimilation is fundamentally important for all organ-isms. When faced with choices of carbon source, microbes\noften assimilate preferred carbon sources to support the first\nphase of growth and then, having exhausted these carbon sources,\nturn to alternative energetically less favorable carbon sources to\ndrive subsequent phases of diauxic growth. This selective carbon\nutilization is reflected in the differential regulation of genes and\nenzymes that support the uptake and catabolism of specific carbon\nsources. The Escherichia coli lac operon provides a classic example\nof this, mediating lactose utilization only after the preferred car-\nbon source, glucose, is exhausted (1, 2). In Saccharomyces cerevi-\n\nsiae, glucose limits the assimilation of alternative carbon sources\nand represses respiration under aerobic conditions, promoting\nfermentative metabolism (the Crabtree effect [3, 4]).\n\nS. cerevisiae is exquisitely sensitive to sugars: even glucose con-\ncentrations as low as 0.01% trigger the major redirection of cellu-\nlar resources (5, 6). Glucose exerts its dramatic effects upon\nS. cerevisiae physiology via signaling pathways that include the\nglucose repression (Snf1 AMP kinase) pathway, cyclic AMP\n(cAMP)-protein kinase A signaling, and the sugar receptor repres-\nsor (Snf3-Rgt2) pathway (for reviews, see references 7 to 12). The\ncAMP-protein kinase A pathway activates ribosome biogenesis\n\nRESEARCH ARTICLE\n\nNovember/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12 ® mbio.asm.org 1\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nand downregulates stress responses in response to glucose (13–\n16). The sugar receptor repressor pathway modulates the expres-\nsion of hexose transporters (9, 17, 18). Meanwhile, the glucose\nrepression pathway represses the transcription of genes involved\nin the assimilation of alternative carbon sources, such as galactose,\nethanol, and fatty acids (7, 8).\n\nThese sugar signaling mechanisms comprise an interlinked\nnetwork rather than parallel signaling pathways (8, 10, 12, 18, 19).\nFurthermore, glucose regulation is imposed at multiple levels in\nS. cerevisiae. They include transcriptional (7–9), posttranscrip-\ntional (5, 6, 20, 21), translational (22), and posttranslational\nmechanisms (23–28). For example, glucose represses the tran-\nscription of genes encoding the gluconeogenic enzymes fructose\n1,6-bisphosphatase (FBP1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxyki-\nnase (PCK1) (29, 30) and triggers the accelerated degradation of\nthe FBP1 and PCK1 mRNAs (5, 20). Furthermore, glucose triggers\nthe phosphorylation and inactivation of fructose 1,6-\nbisphosphatase (Fbp1) as well as its proteolytic degradation (31).\nThe accelerated degradation of Fbp1 is mediated by vacuolar and\nubiquitin-dependent mechanisms (28). Following glucose addi-\ntion, Fbp1 is ubiquitinated and degraded via the proteasome (25,\n28, 32). Like Fbp1, the glyoxylate cycle enzyme, isocitrate lyase\n(Icl1) is also subject to catabolite inactivation in S. cerevisiae (24).\nThis tight control of central carbon metabolism is thought to re-\nflect the evolution of this model yeast under conditions of “feast or\nfamine” and to enhance the competitiveness of S. cerevisiae in\nsugar-rich niches containing complex microflora (9).\n\nS. cerevisiae is often viewed as a paradigm for other yeasts (33).\nHowever, yeast species inhabit diverse niches and have evolved\nunder contrasting selective pressures leading to differing strategies\nof carbon utilization (34). For example, the major systemic fungal\npathogen of humans, Candida albicans, inhabits niches that con-\ntain complex mixtures of carbon sources. During commensalism\nand mucosal infection, C. albicans colonizes the oral cavity and the\ngastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and during systemic infec-\ntion, this pathogen can thrive in the bloodstream and most inter-\nnal organs (35, 36). Few of these niches are rich in sugar. Blood\nglucose levels range from 4 to 7 mM (0.07 to 0.13%), whereas\nconcentrations of about 111 mM (2%) are often used to impose\nglucose repression in in vitro experiments. Many niches are rich in\nalternative carbon sources, such as lactate, fatty acids, and amino\nacids. For example, lactic acid is found in ingested foods, is pro-\nduced by host metabolic activity and by lactic acid bacteria in the\ngastrointestinal and urogenital tracts (37), and is essential for the\nproliferation of Candida glabrata in the intestinal tract (38). Also,\nglyoxylate cycle and fatty acid �-oxidation genes are expressed in\nthe host and are required for the full virulence of C. albicans dur-\ning systemic infections (39–42).\n\nAlthough C. albicans occupies contrasting niches from\nS. cerevisiae, analogous sugar signaling pathways are thought to\nexist in these yeasts (33). Although there has been considerable\nrewiring of the regulatory circuitry that controls carbon metabo-\nlism (43–45), microarray experiments have revealed that C. albi-\ncans genes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon\nsources are exquisitely sensitive to low concentrations of glucose\n(46, 47), like their orthologs in S. cerevisiae (6). However, unlike\nS. cerevisiae, C. albicans continues to respire in the presence of\nglucose, leading to its classification as a Crabtree-negative yeast\n(48).\n\nThese observations create an interesting conundrum relating\n\nto the carbon assimilation and pathogenicity of C. albicans: how\ncan this yeast rapidly colonize niches that contain small amounts\nof glucose if many of the metabolic genes required for efficient\ngrowth in these niches are repressed by glucose? Could glucose\nregulation be relaxed at a posttranscriptional level in C. albicans,\nthereby facilitating simultaneous assimilation of sugars and alter-\nnative carbon sources in vivo? We have addressed these questions\nfirst by performing proteomic screens to identify proteins that are\nregulated in response to physiologically relevant carbon sources,\nrevealing that gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes remain\nat high levels hours after glucose exposure. We then showed that\nC. albicans Pck1 and Icl1 are not destabilized by glucose, in con-\ntrast to S. cerevisiae Pck1 and Icl1, even though C. albicans has\nretained the molecular apparatus to program the accelerated,\nubiquitin-mediated degradation of target proteins following glu-\ncose exposure. C. albicans Icl1 escapes degradation following glu-\ncose addition, because this enzyme lacks key ubiquitination sites\nrequired to target it for accelerated degradation. Our data show\nthat there has been significant posttranscriptional rewiring during\nthe evolution of this pathogen, thereby allowing C. albicans to\ncontinue to assimilate alternative carbon sources in the presence\nof glucose.\n\nRESULTS\nCarbon source has a major impact on the C. albicans proteome.\nMicroarray studies have shown that the C. albicans transcriptome\nis exquisitely sensitive to glucose and that genes involved in the\nassimilation of alternative carbon sources are subject to glucose\nrepression (46, 47). Our first aim was to establish whether this\ntranscriptional regulation was reflected in the C. albicans pro-\nteome. To test this, we grew prototrophic C. albicans NGY152 cells\n(see Table S1 in the supplemental material) for 20 h in minimal\nmedium containing glucose, lactate, oleate, or amino acids as the\nsole carbon source, harvested them in mid-exponential phase,\nprepared protein extracts, and subjected them to two-\ndimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis (Materials and Methods).\nPrincipal component analysis confirmed the reproducibility of\nthe 2D gels from the independent replicate experiments and\nshowed that the carbon source had a significant impact upon the\nC. albicans proteome (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material).\nProteins that displayed statistically significant changes in level on\nthe basis of three independent experiments (Fig. 1A) were identi-\nfied by tryptic digestion and matrix-assisted laser desorption ion-\nization–time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry. Positive\nidentifications were obtained for 206 2D gel features, representing\n152 different C. albicans proteins, some distinct features repre-\nsenting isoforms of the same protein. The list of C. albicans pro-\nteins identified is presented in Table S2 and submitted to the\nPRIDE (proteomics identifications database) proteomic data re-\npository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) (accession numbers 3186\nto 3192).\n\nThe network of proteins that displayed statistically significant\nchanges in response to carbon source mainly comprised metabolic\nenzymes (Fig. 1B). Significant overlap was observed between the\nsets of proteins that were regulated in response to growth on lac-\ntate, oleate, or amino acids compared to the glucose condition.\nDuring growth on these organic acids, glycolytic enzymes were\ndownregulated, and enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis, the\nglycoxylate cycle, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and pathways\ninvolved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources were\n\nSandai et al.\n\n2 ® mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12\n\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nupregulated (Fig. 1B and 2B; see Fig. S2 in the supplemental ma-\nterial). For example, gluconeogenic (Pck1 and Fbp1) and tricar-\nboxylic acid cycle enzymes (Aco1, Kgd1, and Mdh11) displayed\nreduced levels, and the glycolysis-specific enzyme pyruvate kinase\n(Cdc19) was at elevated levels (see Fig. S2 and Table S2 in the\nsupplemental material) during growth on glucose compared to\nlactate-, oleic acid-, and amino acid-grown cells. During growth\n\non oleate, fatty acid �-oxidation (Faa21/23/24, Fox2, Pot11, Pox4,\nand Tes1), glyoxylate cycle (Icl1), and additional TCA cycle en-\nzymes (Cit1 and Fum11) were present at elevated levels compared\nto the levels in glucose-grown cells (Fig. 2; Table S2). Enzymes on\nmany amino acid biosynthetic pathways were downregulated dur-\ning growth on amino acids (Arg5,6, Bat21, Cpa2, His1, Hom6,\nIlv5, Lys12, and Met6/14/15), and this was also the case during\n\nFIG 1 Impact of carbon source on the C. albicans proteome.

(B) Network of C. albicans proteins regulated in response to carbon source. Nodes are connected\nby edges to the one or more conditions under which it was identified: upregulated �2-fold relative to growth on glucose (upward arrowhead); downregulated\n�2-fold (downward arrowhead). Functions that were differentially regulated on different carbon sources (rounded rectangle) have color-coded connecting lines:\ngreen for upregulated and red for downregulated. Functions regulated under all three conditions lie in three blocks in the center of the network interactions.\n\nRegulation of Carbon Utilization in C. albicans\n\nNovember/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12 ® mbio.asm.org 3\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\ngrowth on lactate (Arg5,6, Bat21, His1, and Met6) or oleic acid\n(Arg5,6, Bat21, His1, and Met6) (Fig. 1; Table S2). These data\nlargely confirmed expectations based on our understanding of\nmetabolism in other yeasts and the limited experimental data on\nC. albicans metabolic regulation (35, 49). The observed changes in\nPck1 and Icl1 levels were validated by Western blot analysis of\nthese proteins following Myc tagging in C. albicans (Fig. 2A). Note\nthat Icl1 levels were below the limits of detection in the lactate\nproteome (Table S2).\n\nThe levels of other types of protein were modulated in response\nto carbon source. These proteins included proteins involved in\n\ngrowth and cell polarity (Arp2, Cap2, Pfy1, Cof1, Crn1, and\nRbp1), nuclear transport (Ntf2), DNA repair (Rad23), and pro-\ntein folding (Pdi1 and Cyp51) (see Table S2 in the supplemental\nmaterial). Interestingly, proteins involved in drug resistance\n(Pdr13 and Erg13) were also affected by carbon source, which is\nconsistent with the recent finding that carbon source affects the\nantifungal drug resistance of C. albicans (50). Also, a number of\nstress functions were affected by carbon source (Table S2). The\nlevels of Hsp70 family members (Hsp70/Ssa4, Ssa1, and Kar2)\nwere differentially regulated in response to carbon source. The\nTrx1 thioredoxin was also dramatically upregulated during\n\nFIG 2 Effect of carbon source on central carbon metabolic enzymes in C. albicans.

(B) Effects of growth on oleic acid versus glucose on the levels of enzymes\ninvolved in central carbon metabolism. All enzymes shown were identified on the 2D gels. The effects of growth on oleic acid versus glucose on the levels of\nenzymes are indicated as follows: white, no significant change in the levels of glucose- and oleic acid-grown cells; red, protein level significantly elevated in oleic\nacid-grown cells; cyan, protein level significantly elevated in glucose-grown cells.

The levels of catalase glutathione peroxidize (Gpx1)\nwere also upregulated on lactate. These data were consistent with\nthe observation that host carbon source affects stress resistance in\nC. albicans (50).\n\nTranscript profiling data are available for the effects of glucose\non lactate-grown C. albicans cells (47). We found the correlation\nbetween these transcript profiling data and our proteomic data for\nlactate- and glucose-grown cells to be modest at best (correlation\ncoefficient � 0.25) (Fig. 3A). No doubt differential protein stabil-\nities, alterations in posttranslational modifications, and the exis-\ntence of multiple 2D gel features for some proteins contributed to\nthis. Nevertheless, this was consistent with other comparisons of\ntranscriptomic and proteomic data sets, which vary considerably\nin their degree of correlation (51–54).\n\nDifferential effects of glucose on the C. albicans proteome in\nthe short term and longer term. Having tested the impact on the\nC. albicans proteome of growth on different carbon sources, we\nexamined the effects of glucose addition to cells growing on alter-\n\nnative carbon sources. A similar experimental approach was taken\nexcept that C. albicans NGY152 cells were grown for 20 h to mid-\nexponential phase on lactate, oleate, or amino acids as the sole\ncarbon source, and then 2% glucose was added 2 h before the cells\nwere harvested for proteomic analyses. Once again, proteins that\ndisplayed statistically significant changes across three indepen-\ndent experiments (Fig. 1A) were identified by mass spectrometry\n(see Table S2 in the supplemental material; PRIDE accession\nnumbers 3186 to 3192). Principal component analysis indicated\nthat glucose addition exerted significant effects on the lactate,\noleate, and amino acid proteomes and that these effects were dis-\ntinct from long-term growth on glucose (Fig. 1B), although sim-\nilar subsets of proteins were affected (Table S2).\n\nWe compared the short- and longer-term effects of glucose on\nthe C. albicans proteome (Fig. 3B; see Fig. S1 in the supplemental\nmaterial). Interestingly, the extent of correlation between the\nshort- and long-term changes differed for different sets of func-\ntionally related proteins. Glycolytic enzymes showed a strong cor-\nrelation, generally displaying glucose induction in both the short\nand longer terms (Fig. 3B). In contrast, gluconeogenic, glycoxylate\ncycle, TCA cycle, and fatty acid �-oxidation enzymes displayed a\npoor correlation. The levels of many of these enzymes were gen-\nerally lower in glucose-grown cells, and their levels did not decline\nsignificantly after exposure to glucose for 2 h (Fig. S1).\n\nIcl1 and Pck1 are not subject to catabolite inactivation in\nC. albicans. The apparent stability of gluconeogenic and glyoxy-\nlate cycle enzymes following glucose exposure in C. albicans con-\ntrasted with observations in S. cerevisiae where glucose triggers\ncatabolite inactivation of these enzymes (23–25, 31). Therefore,\nwe examined the impact of glucose on the stability of C. albicans\nIcl1 and Pck1 by Western blotting of Myc-tagged versions of these\nproteins (Fig. 4). C. albicans CA1395 (ICL1-Myc3) and CA1431\n(PCK1-Myc3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) were\ngrown to mid-exponential phase in medium containing lactate as\nthe sole carbon source, and then 2% glucose was added. Protein\nextracts were prepared at various times thereafter and subjected to\nWestern blotting, revealing that Icl1 and Pck1 were stable follow-\ning glucose addition (Fig. 4B). Similar observations were made in\noleic acid-grown cells exposed to glucose (see Fig. S3 in the sup-\nplemental material). These data were consistent with our obser-\nvation that Icl1 and Pck1 are retained at high levels in C. albicans\ncells 2 h after glucose addition (Table S2).\n\nWe then measured the stability of the corresponding mRNAs\nunder equivalent growth conditions by quantitative reverse\ntranscription-PCR (qRT-PCR) relative to the internal ACT1\nmRNA control. The ICL1 and PCK1 mRNAs were rapidly de-\ngraded following glucose addition to lactate-grown cells (Fig. 4B),\nand similar data were obtained for oleic acid-grown cells (see\nFig. S3 in the supplemental material). These observations were\nentirely consistent with the results of previous microarray exper-\niments, suggesting that these transcripts are strongly repressed by\nglucose in C. albicans (46, 47). Therefore, ICL1 and PCK1 tran-\nscription is strongly regulated by glucose, but this regulation is not\nreflected in the proteome.\n\nThese experiments were replicated in S. cerevisiae to exclude\nthe possibility that the lack of catabolite inactivation in C. albicans\nwas an experimental artifact. S. cerevisiae DS1-W10 (ICL1-Myc9)\nand DS1-W20 (PCK1-HA6) (see Table S1 in the supplemental\nmaterial) were grown on lactate and exposed to 2% glucose, and at\nvarious times thereafter, Icl1 and Pck1 levels were examined by\n\nFIG 3 Comparisons of the C. albicans transcriptome and proteome. (A) The\nC. albicans transcriptome and proteome display limited correlation with re-\nspect to the observed log fold changes between cells grown on glucose or lactic\nacid.

The Icl1 and Pck1 enzymes were stable\nin S. cerevisiae in the absence of glucose but were destabilized\nfollowing glucose addition. Similar data were obtained for oleic\nacid-grown S. cerevisiae cells (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental ma-\n\nterial). These data recapitulate earlier observations (23, 24) and\nconfirm that these gluconeogenic and glyoxylate cycle enzymes\nare subject to catabolite inactivation in S. cerevisiae. Furthermore,\nthe ICL1 and PCK1 transcripts were rapidly degraded in S. cerevi-\nsiae following glucose addition (Fig. 4C), confirming earlier re-\nports to this effect (5, 6, 20). Therefore, C. albicans differs signifi-\ncantly from S. cerevisiae in that Icl1 and Pck1 are not subject to\ncatabolite inactivation in response to glucose in the pathogenic\nyeast.\n\nC. albicans has retained the apparatus for catabolite inacti-\nvation. In principle, the lack of glucose-accelerated degradation of\nIcl1 and Pck1 in C. albicans could have been due to the evolution-\nary loss of the catabolite inactivation apparatus in this pathogen.\nTo test this, we asked whether S. cerevisiae Icl1 is subject to\nglucose-accelerated degradation in C. albicans.\n\nC. albicans strains were constructed in which the S. cerevisiae\nICL1 (ScICL1) open reading frame (ORF) was expressed from the\nC. albicans ICL1 (CaICL1) promoter at the native ICL1 locus. The\nfunctionality of three-Myc (Myc3)-tagged S. cerevisiae Icl1\n(ScIcl1) in C. albicans was first confirmed in DSCO2 cells (icl1/\nScICL1) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material), the ScICL1-\nMyc3 gene suppressing the growth defect of C. albicans icl1 cells on\nlactate, oleic acid, pyruvate, and acetate as the sole carbon source\n(Fig. 5A). The stability of the Myc3-tagged ScIcl1 was then exam-\nined in lactate-grown C. albicans DSCO1 cells (ICL1/ScICL1-\nMyc3). ScIcl1 was stable in C. albicans in the absence of glucose but\nwas rapidly degraded following glucose addition (Fig. 5B). These\nobservations were reproducible, and analogous observations were\nmade in oleic acid-grown C. albicans DSCO1 cells (see Fig. S4 in\nthe supplemental material). We conclude that ScIcl1 is subject to\nglucose-accelerated degradation in C. albicans, and hence that\nduring evolution C. albicans has retained the apparatus for catab-\nolite inactivation.\n\nIn this case, has CaIcl1 lost the signal that triggers glucose-\naccelerated degradation? The stability of the CaIcl1-Myc3 protein\nwas assayed in the S. cerevisiae strain DS4-Y40 in which the Myc3-\ntagged CaICL1 open reading frame was expressed from the ScICL1\npromoter at the native ICL1/YDR477w locus (see Table S1 in the\nsupplemental material). The CaIcl1-Myc3 protein was stable in\nlactate-grown DS4-Y40 cells and was not destabilized by glucose\naddition relative to internal loading controls (Fig. 6). Once again,\nthese observations were reproducible, and analogous observations\nwere made for oleic acid-grown S. cerevisiae DS4-Y40 cells (see\nFig. S4 in the supplemental material). Therefore, CaIcl1 appears to\nhave lost the signal that triggers glucose-accelerated degradation.\n\nUbiquitination contributes to glucose-accelerated protein\ndegradation in C. albicans. Ubiquitination contributes to\nglucose-mediated protein destabilization in S. cerevisiae (28, 32).\nTherefore, we tested whether ubiquitination contributes to\nglucose-accelerated degradation of ScIcl1 in C. albicans. The\nScICL1-Myc3 cassette was integrated at the native ICL1 locus in a\nC. albicans ubi4 mutant that lacks polyubiquitin. Ubiquitination is\nsignificantly reduced in this ubi4 mutant, residual ubiquitin being\nexpressed only from the UBI3 locus (55). The stability of the\nScIcl1-Myc3 protein in these C. albicans DSCO3 cells (ubi4/ubi4\nICL1/ScICL1-Myc3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material])\nwas compared to ScIcl1-Myc3 stability in DSCO1 cells (UBI4/\nUBI4 ICL1/ScICL1-Myc3) and the stability of the CaIcl1-Myc3\nprotein in CA1395 cells (UBI4/UBI4 ICL1/ICL1-Myc3). ScIcl1-\nMyc3 and CaIcl1-Myc3 were stable in these strains during growth\n\nFIG 4 Icl1 and Pck1 protein stability and ICL1 and PCK1 mRNA turnover in\nC. albicans and S. cerevisiae following the addition of glucose. (A) CaIcl1-Myc\nand CaPck1-Myc protein levels were measured by Western blotting at various\ntimes after the addition of glucose to C. albicans cells grown on lactate. (B)\nCaIcl1-Myc and CaPck1-Myc were quantified by Western blotting relative to\nthe Act1 internal control following glucose addition. Also CaICL1 and\nCaPCK1 mRNA levels were assayed in the same cultures by qRT-PCR and\ncompared to the level in the ACT1 mRNA internal control after glucose addi-\ntion. The relative levels of these mRNAs and proteins were expressed as a\npercentage of their abundance at time zero, which was set at 100%.

Similar data were obtained from two independent replicate\nexperiments.\n\nSandai et al.\n\n6 ® mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12\n\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\non lactate in the absence of glucose (not shown). Once again,\nScIcl1-Myc3 was destabilized following glucose addition to wild-\ntype DSCO1 cells (Fig. 7). However, ScIcl1-Myc3 was partially\nstabilized in the polyubiquitin mutant, suggesting that glucose-\naccelerated degradation of ScIcl1 in C. albicans is at least partially\ndependent upon ubiquitination. This observation was reproduc-\nible in independent experiments, and furthermore, similar obser-\nvations were made when the same strains were grown on oleic acid\nrather than lactate (see Fig. S5 in the supplemental material). The\nresidual ScIcl1-Myc3 destabilization observed in lactate- or oleic\nacid-grown ubi4 cells could have been due either to the involve-\nment of a second degradation pathway in this response (28) or to\nthe residual ubiquitination that is observed in the C. albicans\npolyubiquitin mutant (55). We conclude that ubiquitination con-\ntributes to glucose-accelerated protein degradation in C. albicans.\n\nFIG 5 ScIcl1 is functional in C. albicans and rapidly degraded in response to\nglucose.

Why does CaIcl1 es-\ncape glucose-accelerated ubiquitin-mediated protein degrada-\ntion? We screened for consensus ubiquitination target sites in Ca-\nIcl1 and ScIcl1 using UbPred (predictor of protein ubiquitination\nsites) (http://www.ubpred.org/index.html) (56). The UbPred\nsoftware, which was trained on 272 ubiquitination sites in\nS. cerevisiae, predicts ubiquitination sites based on numerous\nproperties of the target amino acid sequence, including the net\nand total charge, aromatic content, charge/hydrophobicity ratio,\nsequence complexity, flexibility, amphipathic moment, and in-\ntrinsic disorder (56). The ScIcl1 and CaIcl1 proteins display strong\namino acid sequence similarity (78% similarity and 67% identity).\nYet while ScIcl1 contains two strong consensus ubiquitination\nsites at residues 158 and 551 according to UbPred, CaIcl1 carries\nno high-confidence ubiquitination targets (Fig. 8A). Therefore,\nwe reasoned that the lack of such a ubiquitination site protected\nCaIcl1 from glucose-accelerated degradation.\n\nTo test this, we fused the carboxy-terminal ubiquitination site\nfrom ScIcl1 onto the carboxy terminus of CaIcl1 along with a\n\nMyc3 epitope tag and then compared the stability of this CaIcl1-\nUbi-Myc3 protein with control CaIcl1-Myc3 and ScIcl1-Myc3\nproteins in C. albicans. The stabilities of these proteins were first\nmeasured in mid-exponential C. albicans CA1395 (ICL1/ICL1-\nMyc3), DSCO1 (ICL1/ScICL1-Myc3), and DSCO4 (ICL1/ICL1-\nUbi-Myc3) cells grown on lactate. All of the proteins were stable\nunder these conditions (not shown). Once again, ScIcl1-Myc3 was\ndestabilized following glucose addition, whereas CaIcl1-Myc3 re-\nmained stable (Fig. 8B). Interestingly, the CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc3 pro-\ntein was reproducibly destabilized following glucose addition.\nFurthermore, analogous observations were made in C. albicans\nCA1395, DSCO1, and DSCO4 cells grown on oleic acid (see Fig. S6\nin the supplemental material). Therefore, the addition of a ubiq-\nuitination site was sufficient to trigger glucose-accelerated degra-\ndation of the normally stable CaIcl1-Myc3 protein in C. albicans.\nThese observations reinforced the view that C. albicans has re-\ntained the apparatus for glucose-accelerated protein degradation\nand suggested that the lack of an appropriate ubiquitination site in\nCaIcl1 prevents this protein from entering this degradation path-\nway.\n\nC. albicans continues to assimilate alternative carbon\nsources following glucose exposure. Is this evolutionary rewiring\nof ubiquitination targets between C. albicans and S. cerevisiae re-\nflected in the metabolic activities of these yeasts? To test this, we\ncompared [14C]lactate assimilation by mid-exponential C. albi-\ncans RM1000 and S. cerevisiae W303-1B cells that were grown on\nlactate in the presence and absence of glucose (Fig. 9). As expected,\nthe presence of glucose inhibited the assimilation of [14C]lactate\nby S. cerevisiae. However, glucose did not inhibit [14C]lactate by\nC. albicans over the 4-h period examined, which was consistent\nwith the retention by this pathogen of glyoxylate cycle and gluco-\nneogenic enzymes after glucose addition. These reproducible ob-\nservations were reinforced by analogous data on oleic acid assim-\nilation by oleic acid-grown C. albicans and S. cerevisiae cells.\nGlucose inhibited [3H]oleic acid assimilation in S. cerevisiae\nW303-1B cells, but not in C. albicans RM1000 cells (see Fig. S7 in\nthe supplemental material). These data indicate that, unlike\nS. cerevisiae, C. albicans continues to assimilate alternative carbon\nsources after exposure to glucose.\n\nFIG 8 Addition of a consensus ubiquitin site stimulates glucose-accelerated\ndegradation of CaICl1 in C. albicans. (A) Schematic representation illustrating\nthe existence of high-confidence ubiquitination sites in ScIcl1 and the lack of\nsuch sites in CaIcl1 as predicted by UbPred (http://www.ubpred.org/index\n.html) (56). (B) The carboxy-terminal ubiquitination site from ScIcl1 was\nfused to CaIcl1 to create CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc in C. albicans DSCO4 (see Table S1\nin the supplemental material). These cells were grown on lactate, and the levels\nof CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc were assayed by Western blotting after the addition of\nglucose. For controls, the stabilities of CaIcl1-Myc (CA1395) and ScIcl1-Myc\n(DSCO1) (gray squares) in C. albicans were compared under equivalent con-\nditions. CaIcl1-Ubi-Myc, ScIcl1-Myc, and CaIcl1-Myc levels are expressed as a\npercentage of their abundance at time zero (which was set at 100%). Similar\ndata were obtained from two independent replicate experiments.\n\nFIG 9 Glucose does not inhibit lactate assimilation by C. albicans. Exponen-\ntial C. albicans RM1000 and S. cerevisiae W303-1B cells (see Table S1 in the\nsupplemental material) grown on lactate were suspended in fresh medium\ncontaining [14C]lactate and 2% glucose (gray bars) or with no glucose (black\nbars). The assimilation of radiolabeled lactate by cells was assayed at various\ntimes thereafter (Materials and Methods). Similar data were obtained from\ntwo independent replicate experiments.\n\nSandai et al.\n\n8 ® mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12\n\nhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.html\nhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.html\nhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.html\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe prevailing view is that C. albicans fits the S. cerevisiae para-\ndigm with regard to the impact of glucose upon central carbon\nmetabolism. This influences current thinking about nutrient ad-\naptation during infection and host-fungus interactions (46, 47,\n57). However, this view does not resonate well with the evolution\nof these yeasts in contrasting niches that differ significantly with\nregard to carbon source availability (40) and with an early report\nthat C. albicans is a Crabtree-negative yeast (48). We now show\nthat, despite the similar effects that glucose exerts on the C. albi-\ncans and S. cerevisiae transcriptomes (46, 47), these yeasts display\nfundamental differences in the effects of glucose on central meta-\nbolic functions and carbon assimilation. The levels of many glu-\nconeogenic, glyoxylate cycle, and fatty acid �-oxidation enzymes\ndo decline in C. albicans after protracted growth on glucose, and\nthe changes in the proteomic network (Fig. 1) reflect those ob-\nserved previously during a comprehensive comparison of\nexponential- and stationary-phase C. albicans cells (58). However,\nthese enzymes are stable during short-term exposure to glucose\n(Fig. 2 and 4; see Table S2 in the supplemental material), and this\nallows C. albicans cells to continue to assimilate alternative carbon\nsources even in the presence of glucose, unlike S. cerevisiae (Fig. 9).\n\nOur analyses of Icl1 and Pck1 turnover have suggested that\nenzymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources\nare retained in C. albicans following glucose addition because\nthese enzymes remain stable while their transcripts are degraded\n(Fig. 4). We show that this contrasts with S. cerevisiae cells that\ndegrade these enzymes following glucose addition and their tran-\nscripts (Fig. 4). It is conceivable that carboxy-terminal tagging of\nCaIcl1 and ScIcl1 affected their localization and stability. Never-\ntheless, our data were consistent with the study of López-Boado et\nal. (24) who reported that Icl1 is subject to catabolite inactivation\nin S. cerevisiae. We then showed that, although CaIcl1 and CaPck1\nare not subjected to glucose-accelerated protein degradation in\nC. albicans, this pathogen has retained the molecular apparatus to\nexecute this function, as ScIcl1 is degraded following glucose ad-\ndition when expressed as a functional enzyme in C. albicans\n(Fig. 5). Rather, CaIcl1 lacks the signal that triggers glucose-\naccelerated protein degradation in S. cerevisiae (Fig. 6).\n\nUbiquitin-dependent mechanisms contribute to the catabolite\ninactivation of Fbp1 in S. cerevisiae (28), and protein ubiquitina-\ntion is known to be important for nutrient adaptation as well as\ngrowth, morphogenesis, and stress responses in C. albicans (55,\n59–64). Therefore, we reasoned that ubiquitination might also\ncontribute to glucose-accelerated protein degradation in C. albi-\ncans and that CaIcl1 might lack critical ubiquitination sites re-\nquired to target this protein for catabolite inactivation. Three ob-\nservations support this hypothesis. First, the inactivation of\npolyubiquitin (Ubi4) lowered the rate of ScIcl1 degradation in\nC. albicans (Fig. 7). ScIcl1 degradation was not completely blocked\nbecause the UBI3 gene would provide residual ubiquitin in C. al-\nbicans ubi4 cells (55, 65). Second, in silico analyses of the ScIcl1 and\nCaIcl1 sequences revealed that while ScIcl1 contains two high-\nconfidence ubiquitination sites, CaIcl1 contains none (Fig. 8A)\ndespite these proteins displaying a high degree of overall sequence\nidentity (67%). Third, the addition of a carboxy-terminal ubiq-\nuitination site to the CaIcl1 protein was sufficient to program this\nprotein for glucose-accelerated protein degradation in C. albicans\n(Fig. 8). Therefore, during the evolution of C. albicans, this patho-\n\ngen has retained the molecular apparatus that mediates glucose-\naccelerated protein degradation, and CaIcl1 has evolved to escape\nthis process.\n\nOur proteomic analyses indicate that other C. albicans en-\nzymes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources\nlack ubiquitination sites are retained following glucose exposure\n(Fig. 3B; see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Furthermore,\nour in silico comparisons have suggested that enzymes specific for\ngluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle lack the requisite ubiq-\nuitination sites required for glucose-accelerated protein degrada-\ntion. S. cerevisiae malate synthase (ScMls1) contains three low-\nconfidence ubiquitination sites according to UbPred (http://www\n.ubpred.org/index.html) (56), whereas CaMls1 contains no\nputative ubiquitination sites. UbPred also predicts that both\nScFbp1 and ScPck1 contain high-confidence ubiquitination sites,\nwhereas CaFbp1 and CaPck1 do not. This was consistent with our\nobservation that, following glucose addition, ScPck1 is degraded\nin S. cerevisiae, but CaPck1 is not degraded in C. albicans (Fig. 4).\nMeanwhile, our previous work has indicated that a number of\nglycolytic enzymes are ubiquitinated in C. albicans (55). There-\nfore, significant evolutionary rewiring of ubiquitination targets\nappears to have occurred in this pathogen, allowing it to assimilate\nalternative carbon sources in the presence of glucose, unlike\nS. cerevisiae (Fig. 9).\n\nThese observations have several important implications for\nour understanding of C. albicans as a pathogen. First, our data\nindicate that under some conditions there is significant disloca-\ntion between the transcriptome and proteome. Microarray studies\nhave contributed significantly to our understanding of C. albicans\npathobiology (43, 44, 46, 66–68), and it is frequently presumed\nthat changes in the transcriptome are reflected in corresponding\nchanges in the C. albicans proteome and physiology. In some\ncases, there is a good correlation between the transcriptome and\nproteome, for example with regard to the induction of glycolytic\nenzymes in response to glucose (Fig. 3) and during amino acid\nstarvation (54). However, this is not always the case (69), and this\nstudy demonstrates clearly that caution is required in making pre-\nsumptions about the proteome based on the transcriptome. In-\ndeed, this explains the conundrum as to why C. albicans is a\nCrabtree-negative yeast (48) even though its transcriptome is ex-\nquisitely sensitive to glucose (47). Thankfully, many studies pro-\nvide experimental confirmation of working hypotheses on the ba-\nsis of their microarray observations.\n\nThe second important implication relates to fungal nutrient\nassimilation during colonization and disease progression. C. albi-\ncans occupies dynamic host niches that contain complex mixtures\nof carbon sources that change over time through a combination of\nhost and fungal metabolic activities. Many niches contain mini-\nmal sugar concentrations (e.g., the urogenital tract), while in oth-\ners, C. albicans is transiently exposed to sugars (e.g., the oral cavity\nand gastrointestinal tract). This opportunistic pathogen probably\nevolved in niches such as these. Also, the evidence suggests that a\nproportion of C. albicans cells that infect internal organs actively\nassimilate alternative carbon sources rather than sugars (40, 70).\nFurthermore, lactate assimilation is essential for the proliferation\nof C. glabrata in the intestine (38). Our data now suggest that\ntransient exposure to sugar does not prejudice the assimilation of\nalternative carbon sources and, as a result, the growth of the fun-\ngus in these niches. This explains why both gluconeogenic and\nglycolytic functions can be expressed in C. albicans cells infecting\n\nRegulation of Carbon Utilization in C. albicans\n\nNovember/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12 ® mbio.asm.org 9\n\nhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.html\nhttp://www.ubpred.org/index.html\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nthe kidney (40) and why mutations that block gluconeogenesis or\nthe glyoxylate cycle partially attenuate the virulence of C. albicans\n(39–42). Clearly, C. albicans does not conform to the S. cerevisiae\nparadigm of glucose regulation, and this is important for the\npathogenicity of this yeast.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrains and growth conditions. C. albicans and S. cerevisiae strains (see\nTable S1 in the supplemental material) were grown at 30°C in minimal\nmedium (0.67% yeast nitrogen base) containing glucose (2%) (SD), lactic\nacid (2%), oleic acid (0.2%), or mixed amino acids (2%) as the sole carbon\nsource (71).\n\nStrain construction. C. albicans strains expressing Icl1-Myc3\n(CA1395) or Pck1-Myc3 (CA1431) were made by PCR amplification of a\nMyc3-URA3 cassette and transforming these products into C. albicans\nRM1000 (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). Insertion at the\ncorrect locus was confirmed by diagnostic PCR, and expression of Icl1-\nMyc3 and Pck1-Myc3 was confirmed by Western blotting. Analogous con-\ntrols were performed for all the following strain constructions.\n\nTo replace a CaICL1 allele in C. albicans with a Myc3-tagged ScICL1\nopen reading frame (ORF) from S. cerevisiae, the ScICL1 locus was first\nMyc3 tagged by PCR amplifying the Myc3-URA3 cassette with primers\nDS_3F (F stands for forward) and DS_3R (R stands for reverse) (see Ta-\nble S3 in the supplemental material) and transforming this cassette into\nS. cerevisiae BY4743 to create strain DS3-Y30 (Table S1). The new ScICL1-\nMyc3-URA3 locus was then PCR amplified using primers DS_5F and\nDS_5R, and this CaICL1p-ScICL1-MYC3-URA3 cassette was then trans-\nformed into C. albicans RM1000 to create strain DSCO1 (CaICL1/\nCaICL1p-ScICL1-MYC3-URA3) (Table S1) and also transformed into\nC. albicans CA510 to create strain DSCO1 (Caicl1/CaICL1p-ScICL1-\nMYC3-URA3) (Table S1).\n\nTo introduce the CaICl1-ScICL1-Myc3-URA3 allele into the C. albi-\ncans ubi4/ubi4 background (55), the CaICl1-ScICL1-Myc3-URA3 cassette\nwas PCR amplified using the DS_5F and DS_5R primers (see Table S3 in\nthe supplemental material) and transformed into C. albicans DSCO to\ncreate strain DSCO3 (ubi4/ubi4 CaICL1/CaICl1-ScICL1-Myc3-URA3)\n(Table S1).\n\nC. albicans DSCO4 expresses CaIcl1 with the carboxy-terminal ubiq-\nuitination site from ScIcl1 at its carboxy terminus (CaICL1/CaICl1-Ubi-\nMyc3-URA3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). This was\nachieved by PCR amplifying the 3= end of the ScICL1 ORF along with the\nconjoined MYC3-URA3 sequences from S. cerevisiae DSCO3 cells using\nthe DS_6F and DS_6Rprimers (Table S3) and transforming this CaICl1-\nUbi-Myc3-URA3 cassette into C. albicans RM1000.\n\nThe ScICL1 and ScPCK1 loci were epitope tagged in S. cerevisiae.\nScICL1 was tagged with Myc9 at its 3= end by PCR amplification of the\nMYC9-NAT cassette in pYM21 (72) with primers DS_1F and DS_1R (see\nTable S3 in the supplemental material) and transformation of S. cerevisiae\nW303-1B to generate strain DS1-W10 (ScICL1-MYC9-NAT) (Table S1).\nScPCK1 was tagged with hemagglutinin (a six-hemagglutinin tag [HA6])\nby PCR amplification of the HA6-KlTRP1 (KlTRP1 stands for Kluyvero-\nmyces lactis TRP1) cassette in pYM3 (73) with primers DS_2F and DS_2R\n(Table S3) and transformation of S. cerevisiae W303-1B to create strain\nDS1-W20 (ScPCK1-HA6-KlTRP1) (Table S1).\n\nThe ScICl1 ORF in S. cerevisiae BY4743 was replaced with CaICL1-\nMyc3 to create the S. cerevisiae strain DS4-Y40 (ScICl1-CaICL1-Myc3-\nURA3) (see Table S1 in the supplemental material). The CaICL1-Myc3-\nURA3 ORF was PCR amplified from C. albicans CA1395 (Table S1) using\nthe DS_4F and DS_4R primers (Table S3).\n\nProteomics. Replicate cultures of C. albicans NGY152 (CAI4 contain-\ning CIp10 [74]) were grown in minimal medium containing glucose\n(2%), lactic acid (2%), oleic acid (0.2%), or mixed amino acids (2%) as\nthe sole carbon source. Samples from the cultures were taken, then sub-\ncultured in the same medium, grown for a further 20 h, and harvested in\nexponential phase (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] of 0.8). Glucose\n\n(2%) was added to some cultures, and the cells were harvested after 2 h.\nProtein extracts were prepared, subjected to 2D gel electrophoresis, and\nstained with Coomassie blue as described previously (54). Independent\ntriplicate experiments were done for each growth condition. Gel features\nwere compared using Phoretix 2D Expression (Nonlinear Dynamics,\nNewcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) and GeneSpring (Silicon Genet-\nics, San Carlos, CA). Principal component analysis scores were plotted in\n3D (SIMCA-P version 11.0: Umetrics AB, Sweden). Proteins displaying\nstatistically significant differences in mean spot volume (P � 0.05) were\nidentified by MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry of tryptic peptides (54) us-\ning MS-Fit and MASCOT (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). Protein anno-\ntations were from the Candida Genome Database (http://www\n.candidagenome.org/). The proteomic data set is available in the\nsupplemental material (see Table S2 in the supplemental material) and at\nthe PRIDE proteomic data repository (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) (ac-\ncession numbers 3186 to 3192). The carbon source network was con-\nstructed using Cytoscape version (http://www.cytoscape.org/) (75).\n\nWestern blotting. Protein extracts were subjected to Western blotting\nas described previously (76). Membranes were probed with a mouse anti-\nMyc antibody (diluted 1:10,000) (Sigma). The secondary antibody was\nperoxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Signals were detected with\nan enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting kit (Amersham,\nUnited Kingdom) and quantified using a Fuji FLA-3000 imager.\n\nRNA analyses. RNA was prepared (77, 78), yields were quantified\nusing an RNA 6000 Nano assay, and RNA integrity was assessed using an\nAgilent 2100 bioanalyzer (79). ICL1 and PCK1 transcript levels were\nquantified to the internal ACT1 mRNA by qRT-PCR using primers (see\nTable S3 in the supplemental material). RNA samples (2 �g) were incu-\nbated in 20-�l reactions with DNase I (1.5 �l), RNase OUT (1.5 �l), and\nDNase I buffer (2 �l) (Invitrogen, United Kingdom) at room temperature\nfor 15 min. cDNA was then made with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase\n(Invitrogen, United Kingdom) following the manufacturer’s protocols.\nReal-time RT-PCR SYBR green (Roche, United Kingdom) was performed\nusing the manufacturer’s instructions with a LightCycler 480 real-time\nPCR system (Roche).\n\nLactate and oleic acid assimilation. Lactate and oleic acid assimila-\ntion was assayed by measuring the incorporation by C. albicans and\nS. cerevisiae of [14C]lactate and [3H]oleic acid into trichloroacetic acid-\nprecipitable material. Yeast cells were grown on YPLactate (2% Bacto\npeptone and 1% yeast extract containing 2% lactate) or YPOleic acid (2%\nBacto peptone and 1% yeast extract containing 0.2% oleic acid) at 30°C to\nan OD600 of 1, harvested, and resuspended in 1 ml fresh prewarmed YP-\nLactate or YPOleic acid. Glucose (2%) was added to half of the cells, and\nno glucose was added to control cells. Then, 1.85 MBq of [14C]lactic acid\nor 37 MBq of [3H]oleic acid was added at time zero, and samples were\ntaken at various times thereafter. The samples were precipitated in 5%\ntrichloroacetic acid at 0°C, washed at 0°C in a series of solutions [(i) fresh\n5% trichloroacetic acid containing 0.1% SDS, (ii) 50% ethanol, and (iii)\n100% ethanol], dried, and subjected to scintillation counting (Packard\nBioScience). The results are means and standard deviations from tripli-\ncate assays. Similar results were obtained in triplicate independent exper-\niments.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL\nSupplemental material for this article may be found at http://mbio.asm.org\n/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00495-12/-/DCSupplemental.\n\nFigure S1, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S3, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S4, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S5, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S6, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nFigure S7, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nTable S1, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nTable S2, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\nTable S3, PDF file, 0.1 MB.\n\nSandai et al.\n\n10 ® mbio.asm.org November/December 2012 Volume 3 Issue 6 e00495-12\n\nhttp://www.candidagenome.org/\nhttp://www.candidagenome.org/\nhttp://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/\nhttp://www.cytoscape.org/\nhttp://mbio.asm.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00495-12/-/DCSupplemental\nhttp://mbio.asm.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1128/mBio.00495-12/-/DCSupplemental\nmbio.asm.org\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Esperanza Lopez-Franco for help with the construction of C. al-\nbicans Pck1-Myc and Icl1-Myc strains.
