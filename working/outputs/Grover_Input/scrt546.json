Studies have shown that iPSC-derived\nmesenchymal stem cells (iMSCs) possess powerful proliferation, differentiation, and therapeutic effects. Recently,\nmost studies indicate that stem cells exert their therapeutic effect mainly through a paracrine mechanism other\nthan transdifferentiation, and exosomes have emerged as an important paracrine factor for stem cells to reprogram\ninjured cells. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether exosomes derived from iMSCs (iMSCs-Exo) possess\nthe ability to attenuate limb ischemia and promote angiogenesis after transplantation into limbs of mice with femoral\nartery excision.\n\nMethods: Human iPSCs (iPS-S-01, C1P33, and PCKDSF001C1) were used to differentiate into iMSCs in a modified\none-step method. iMSCs were characterized by flow cytometry and multipotent differentiation potential analysis.\nUltrafiltration combined with a purification method was used to isolate iMSCs-Exo, and transmission electron\nmicroscopy and Western blotting were used to identify iMSCs-Exo. After establishment of mouse hind-limb ischemia\nwith excision of femoral artery and iMSCs-Exo injection, blood perfusion was monitored at days 0, 7, 14, and 21;\nmicrovessel density in ischemic muscle was also analyzed. In vitro migration, proliferation, and tube formation\nexperiments were used to analyze the ability of pro-angiogenesis in iMSCs-Exo, and quantitative reverse-transcriptase\npolymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to identify expression levels of\nangiogenesis-related molecules in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) after being cultured with iMSCs-Exo.\n\nResults: iPSCs were efficiently induced into iMSC- with MSC-positive and -negative surface antigens and osteogenesis,\nadipogenesis, and chondrogenesis differentiation potential. iMSCs-Exo with a diameter of 57 ± 11 nm and expressed\nCD63, CD81, and CD9. Intramuscular injection of iMSCs-Exo markedly enhanced microvessel density and blood\nperfusion in mouse ischemic limbs, consistent with an attenuation of ischemic injury. In addition, iMSCs-Exo could\nactivate angiogenesis-related molecule expression and promote HUVEC migration, proliferation, and tube formation.\n\nConclusion: Implanted iMSCs-Exo was able to protect limbs from ischemic injury via the promotion of angiogenesis,\nwhich indicated that iMSCs-Exo may be a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of ischemic diseases.\n* Correspondence: wangy63cn@126.com; dengzf63@126.com\n†Equal contributors\n3Institute of Microsurgery on Extremities, Shanghai Jiaotong University\nAffiliated Sixth People’s Hospital, 600 Yishan Road, Shanghai 200233, China\n1Department of Neurosurgery, Shanghai Jiaotong University Affiliated Sixth\nPeople’s Hospital, 600 Yishan Road, Shanghai 200233, China\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n© 2015 Hu et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2015, 6:10 Page 2 of 15\nhttp://stemcellres.com/content/6/1/10\nIntroduction\nStem cells are undifferentiated cells that are present in\nthe embryonic, fetal, and adult stages of life and are de-\nfined by their ability to self-renew and differentiate into\nmultiple lineages [1,2]. Stem cells have unique character-\nistics of high proliferation, specific migration, and the\npotential to differentiate into many different reparative\nor replacement cell types. Within the last few years, the\nimportant role of stem cells in the field of cell therapy\nhas begun to be recognized, and remarkable progress in\nboth basic research and clinical studies has confirmed\nthat stem cells exert positive therapeutic effects in alleviat-\ning tissue injury after ischemia, including myocardial in-\nfarction [3,4], brain ischemia [5,6], and limb ischemia [7,8].\nIt has been well established that bone marrow-derived\n\nmesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are an ideal cell\nsource for autologous cell-based therapy because of their\nhighly proliferative and self-regenerative capability,\npowerful plasticity, and low immunogenicity [9,10].\nHowever, several disadvantages restrict BMSC clinical\napplications in autologous transplantation: because they\nare adult somatic cells, the proliferation and differenti-\nation capability of BMSCs decrease after a number of\npassages in culture. In addition, their proliferation and\ndifferentiation potential decline significantly with in-\ncreasing age- and aging-related disorders. In addition,\nonly a limited number of BMSCs can be obtained ini-\ntially from a single donor, limiting their further applica-\ntion [11,12]. Recent advances in stem cell technology\nhave enabled the generation of patient-specific induced\npluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from adult somatic cells,\nand these iPSCs are able to differentiate into expandable\nprogenitor cells and mature cells [13]. iPSCs exhibit\nsimilar properties with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in\nself-renewal and differentiation capacity; one distinct\nadvantage over ESCs is that they are patient-specific\nand thus theoretically can overcome the need for im-\nmunosuppression in the recipient. It has been reported\nthat iPSCs can generate unlimited amounts of early-\npassage patient-specific MSCs with consistent quality.\nInduced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal\nstem cells (iMSCs) are a promising cell source for au-\ntologous cell therapies in regenerative medicine be-\ncause of their more powerful therapeutic function\ncompared with BMSCs [14,15].\nAlthough it has been demonstrated that MSCs exhibit\n\nadvantages in cell therapy, one potential challenge is the\nacquisition of genetic and epigenetic alterations. After\nlong-term culture, MSCs become immortalized and spon-\ntaneously transform on account of enhanced chromosome\ninstability that is associated with the dysregulation of telo-\nmere activity and cell cycle-related genes, which can result\nin tumorigenesis when injected in multiple organs [16]. In\naddition, Jeong et al. found that the transplantation of\nshort-term MSCs cultured into mice can form malignant\ntumors [17]. Thus, how to fully use the advantages of\nMSCs while avoiding disadvantages such as tumor forma-\ntion is an important step toward applying them to clinical\ntherapy for diseases.\nRecently, accumulating evidence has indicated that\n\nstem cells exert their therapeutic action mainly via se-\ncreting molecules, such as growth factors, cytokines,\nchemokines, and extracellular microvesicles, into their\nsurroundings via a paracrine mechanism [18]. Among\nthese paracrine molecules, exosomes show unique func-\ntions in disease diagnosis and therapy [19]. Exosomes\nare endosomal-origin small-membrane vesicles with a\ndiameter of 40 to 100 nm and are formed in multivesi-\ncular bodies (MVBs) by invagination of the endosomal\nmembrane and then released into the extracellular space\nwhen MVBs fuse with the plasma membrane [20]. Re-\ncent studies have indicated that exosomes derived from\nBMSCs can promote angiogenesis in ischemic tissue and\nattenuate tissue injury after an ischemic injury [21-23].\nIn addition, it has been confirmed that exosomes derived\nfrom MSCs are immune-tolerant, an important property\nfor clinical applications [24]. Thus, we hypothesized that\nexosomes derived from iMSCs (iMSCs-Exo) may also\nexhibit similar functions in reducing tissue injury after\nischemia.\nIn the present study, we investigated the therapeutic\n\neffects of iMSCs-Exo in a mouse hind-limb ischemic\nmodel. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that\niMSCs-Exo could significantly attenuate limb ischemia.\nWe further observed a remarkable microvessel density\nincrease and blood perfusion recovery in the mice ische-\nmic limb, which indicated that pro-angiogenesis may be\none reason for iMSCs-Exo to alleviate ischemic diseases.\nAn in vitro study demonstrated that iMSCs-Exo can pro-\nmote human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) mi-\ngration, proliferation, and tube formation. Furthermore,\niMSCs-Exo can promote angiogenesis-related gene ex-\npression and protein secretion in HUVECs. To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study to suggest that\niMSCs-Exo also exhibit a pro-angiogenesis function,\nwhich indicates that iMSCs-Exo can become a novel regu-\nlator in iMSC-based ischemic injury therapy.\n\nMethods\nThe use of human iPSCs in this study was approved\nby the local ethics committee of Nanchang University\n(2 October 2011).\n\nGeneration of mesenchymal stem cells from human\ninduced pluripotent stem cells\nThree human iPSC lines were used in the generation of\nMSCs. The first human iPSC line (iPS-S-01) was pro-\nvided by the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology\n\n\n\nHu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2015, 6:10 Page 3 of 15\nhttp://stemcellres.com/content/6/1/10\nof the Chinese Academy of Sciences in agreement with\nLiao and Xiao [25]. Two additional iPSC lines—iPSCs\n(C1P33) and iPSCs (PCKDSF001C1)—were provided by\nthe South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and\nRegenerative Medicine Group of the Chinese Academy\nof Sciences in agreement with Duan-qing Pei [26]. The\niPSCs were routinely cultured and expanded on human\nESC-Qualified BD Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Sparks,\nMD, USA) in six-well plates in mTESR1 (StemCell\nTechnologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) [27]. When iPSCs\nwere 90% confluent, mTESR1 was replaced with MSC\nmedium, which contained Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s\nmedium (DMEM)-low glucose (Corning, Tewksbury,\nMA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 2 mM\nL-Glutamine [28]. The MSC medium was changed\nevery 2 days. After 14 days in culture, the cells were\ntrypsinized (0.25% trypsin/1 mM EDTA; Gibco) and serially\nreseeded thereafter in 0.1% gelatin-coated 25- and 75-cm2\n\ncell culture flasks (Corning) at a density of 1 × 105/mL in\nMSC medium. When cells were confluent in 75-cm2 cell\nculture flasks, they were considered passage 1. Usually, at\npassage 4, the cells demonstrated a morphology similar to\nthat of fibroblast-like cells and were used to analyze iMSC\nphenotypic characteristics, differentiation potential, and\nfurther experiments.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis\niPSC and iMSC surface antigens were analyzed by using\nflow cytometry. In total, 5 × 105 cells were incubated\nwith 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Gibco) for 30 mi-\nnutes to block non-specific antigens. The following con-\njugated monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences) were\nused at the concentration recommended by the manu-\nfacturer: CD29-PE, CD34-APC, CD44-FITC, CD45-\nFITC, CD73-PE, CD90-PE. CD105-FITC, CD133-PE,\nCD146-PE, and HLA-DR-PE. Non-specific fluorescence\nwas determined by incubation of similar cell aliquots\nwith isotype-matched mouse monoclonal antibodies\n(BD Biosciences). After two washes in 1% BSA, the cells\nwere resuspended in 200 μL of 1% BSA and analyzed by\nusing the guava easyCyte™ system (Millipore, Billerica,\nMA, USA).\n\nMultipotent differentiation potential of induced\npluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells\nOsteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis were\nexamined to determine the iMSC multipotent differenti-\nation potential. For osteogenic induction, 5 × 104 iMSCs\nwere seeded in 24-well plates until 90% confluence and\nreplaced with osteogenesis medium (Gibco). The cells\ncultured in MSC medium served as control. After\n21 days, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde\nand stained with Alizarin Red to detect areas of\nmineralized calcium. For adipogenic induction, 5 × 104\n\niMSCs were seeded in 24-well plates until complete con-\nfluence, and differentiation was induced by adipogenesis\nmedium (Gibco). The cells cultured in MSC medium\nserved as the control. After 21 days, the cells were fixed\nwith 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with Oil Red O.\nFor chondrogenic induction, 1 × 106 cells were centri-\nfuged in a 15-mL polypropylene falcon tube to obtain a\npellet, and chondrogenic medium (Gibco) was gently\nadded to the pellet. After 21 days, the pellet was fixed\nwith 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in optimum\ncutting temperature compound (OCT) (Thermo Fisher,\nWaltham, MA, USA). Cryosections were stained with\nToluidine Blue to detect the presence of proteoglycans.\nAll stained cells were observed under an optical micro-\nscope (Leica, Solms, Germany).\n\nIn vitro culture of human umbilical vein endothelial cells\nIn this study, HUVECs were isolated from human um-\nbilical cords, which were obtained with informed con-\nsent and local ethics approval [29]. Briefly, the cords\nwere washed twice with warmed phosphate-buffered sa-\nline (PBS) to flush out blood and clots among other fac-\ntors; HUVECs were digested with 0.5 mg/mL type II\ncollagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for\n30 minutes at 37°C and drawn out from the vessel wall\nby medium 200 (M200) (Gibco) containing 10% FBS;\nafter centrifugation at 1,000 revolutions per minute for\n5 minutes at room temperature, HUVECs were seeded\nonto 1% gelatin-coated 25-cm2 cell culture flasks in\nM200 + 10% FBS. Once HUVECs reached 90% conflu-\nence, they were further trypsinized and reseeded into\n25-cm2 cell culture flasks and maintained in M200 sup-\nplemented with 2% low serum growth supplement\n(M200 + LSGS) (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR, USA).\nHUVECs at passage 2 were used in the experiments as\ndescribed below.\n\nIsolation and purification of iMSCs-Exo\nExosomes were isolated from iMSC supernatant as pre-\nviously described [30,31]. Briefly, 80% confluent iMSCs\nwere rinsed three times with PBS and cultured for\n48 hours in a chemically defined medium (MesenGro\nhMSC medium; stemRD, San Francisco, CA, USA). The\nmedium was obtained and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 mi-\nnutes and at 2,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and the cell\nsupernatant was filtered by using a 0.22-μm filter\nsterilize Steritop™ (Millipore) to remove whole cells and\ncellular debris. Afterwards, the supernatant was trans-\nferred to the upper compartment of an Amicon Ultra-15\nCentrifugal Filter Units (Millipore) and centrifuged at\n4,000 g at 4°C until the volume in the upper compart-\nment was reduced to approximately 200 μL. The ultrafil-\ntration liquid was washed twice with PBS and re-\n\n\n\nHu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2015, 6:10 Page 4 of 15\nhttp://stemcellres.com/content/6/1/10\nultrafiltrated to 200 μL. For exosome purification, the li-\nquid was laid on top of 30% sucrose/D2O cushion in a\nsterile Ultra-Clear™ tube (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA,\nUSA) and centrifuged at 100,000 g for 60 minutes at 4°C\n(Sorvall, Avanti J-26XP, fixed angle rotor; Beckman\nCoulter). The fraction containing iMSCs-Exo was recov-\nered by using an 18-G needle and diluted in PBS and\nwas centrifuged at 4,000 g at 4°C in centrifugal filter\nunits until the final volume reached 200 μL. Exosomes\nwere stored at −80°C or used for downstream experi-\nments. In addition, an equal volume of serum-free\nmedium without culturing cells was obtained in the\nsame method of iMSCs-Exo and was centrifuged to\n200 μL, which referred to the ‘control medium’. iMSCs-\nExo protein content was determined by using the\nbicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Fisher) as previously\ndescribed [32]. BSA ranged from 2 mg/mL to 25 μg/mL\nto generate a calibration curve. The absorbance was read\nat 562 nm by using a Microplate Reader (Bio-Rad La-\nboratories, Berkeley, CA, USA).\n\nTransmission electron microscopy\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to\nidentify the morphology of iMSCs-Exo. Briefly, iMSCs-\nExo were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde for 2 hours and\nwashed with PBS two times. iMSCs-Exo were negatively\nstained with 2% uranyl acetate for 30 seconds and ap-\nplied to a continuous carbon grid. iMSCs-Exo were visu-\nalized on a Hitachi H-7650 transmission electron\nmicroscope (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), and images were\ncaptured by using a digital camera (Olympus, Tokyo,\nJapan).\n\nWestern blotting analysis\nWestern blotting was used to identify iMSCs-Exo\nmarkers CD63, CD81, and CD9 [33]. Briefly, 5 × protein-\nloading buffer was added directly to the iMSCs-Exo\nsample and heated at 95°C for 5 minutes. Next, iMSCs-\nExo protein was loaded and resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE\npolyacrylamide gels. The protein sample was run at\n120 V for 45 minutes and transferred onto nitrocellulose\nmembranes (Whatman, Maidstone, Kent, UK) for\n1.5 hours at 100 mA. The presence of CD63, CD81, and\nCD9 was assessed by exposing the membranes to pri-\nmary rabbit polyclonal anti-CD63 (1:1,000), anti-CD81\n(1:1,000), and anti-CD9 (1:1,000) (Abcam, Cambridge,\nUK). The membranes were washed three times in 1 ×\nTris-buffered saline with tween (TBST) for 5 minutes\nand incubated for 1 hour in TBST containing horserad-\nish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary\nantibody (Abcam). Proteins were detected by using en-\nhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo Fisher) and imaged\nby using an Image Quant LAS 4000 mini bio-molecular\nimager (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden).\nMouse hind-limb ischemia model and iMSCs-Exo injection\nAnimal study protocols were approved by the Institu-\ntional Animal Care and Use Committee at Shanghai\nJiaotong University. Unilateral hind-limb ischemia was\nproduced by excising the common left iliac-femoral ar-\ntery, from which the femoral artery merges from the\nproximal origin to the distal point where it bifurcates\ninto the saphenous and popliteal arteries, and the\ncontralateral limb was used as internal control. One day\nafter femoral artery excision, mice (n = 20 for each\ngroup) were randomly treated with multiple intramuscu-\nlar injections (four injections in the quadriceps muscle)\nin the ischemic leg, with the iMSCs-Exo group (200 μg\nof iMSCs-Exo dissolved in PBS to final volume of\n200 μL) or control group (the same volume of control\nmedium dissolved in PBS to 200 μL). To control the ef-\nfect of the surgery, 20 mice received a sham operation at\nthe same position, in which the femoral artery was ex-\nposed but not excised.\n\nBlood flow measurements and the functional scores\nLaser-Doppler Perfusion Imaging (Moor Instruments,\nDevon, UK) was performed to monitor blood flow re-\ncovery in response to femoral artery excision at days 0,\n7, 14, and 21 post-injection. The digital color-coded im-\nages were analyzed by comparing the blood flow ratio of\nthe ischemic (left) to the intact (right) leg expressed as\npercentage perfusion. Severity of the ischemia was\nscored by assessment of ambulatory impairment and tis-\nsue damage as previously described [34]. Limb function\nof all mice was scored at the same time as blood flow\nmeasurements prior to sedation.\n\nHistological and immunocytochemical analysis\nWe performed immunohistochemistry staining and im-\nmunocytochemical staining in accordance with the\nprotocol of the manufacturer. For immunocytochemical\nstaining, the mice were anesthetized and sacrificed by in-\ntraperitoneally injecting an overdose of chloral hydrate\nat days 7, 14, and 21 post-injection. The quadriceps\nmuscle was carefully separated and fixed with 4% para-\nformaldehyde overnight at 4°C and embedded in OCT.\nTissue sections were pre-incubated with sodium borohy-\ndride (1 mg/mL in PBS) to reduce autofluorescence, in-\ncubated overnight in 4°C with antibodies against CD31\n(1:100; Abcam) and CD34 (1:100; Abcam), and incu-\nbated for 1 hour with secondary antibody conjugated to\nAlexa Fluor 594 (1:200; Abcam) and Alexa Fluor 488\n(1:200; Abcam), respectively. Nuclei were stained with 4,\n6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (0.5 μg/mL; Invitro-\ngen, Grand Island, NY, USA). Isotype control antibodies\nwere used as negative controls. Tissues were mounted,\nand the images were obtained by using a fluorescence\nmicroscope (Leica). For immunohistochemistry staining,\n\n\n\nHu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2015, 6:10 Page 5 of 15\nhttp://stemcellres.com/content/6/1/10\nthe quadriceps muscle was harvested at day 21 and fixed\nwith paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin, and the\nsections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and ex-\namined under a light microscope (Leica) by two patholo-\ngists who were blinded to the grouping conditions.\n\nEndothelial cell migration assay\nThe real-time cell analyzer (RTCA) migration assay and\nscratched wound assay were used to analyze the migra-\ntion effect of iMSCs-Exo to HUVECs. The xCELLigence\nsystem (Roche Applied Sciences, Basel, Switzerland)\nused impedance as a readout and can continuously\nmonitor the cellular responses of biologically active\nsmall-molecule compounds, producing time-dependent\ncellular response profiles. The electronic readout of cell-\nsensor impedance is displayed in real-time as CI, a value\ndirectly influenced by cell attachment, spreading, or cell\nproliferation or a combination of these. The CI value at\neach time point is defined as Rn-Rb/Rb, where Rn is the\ncell-electrode impedance of the well with the cells and\nRb is the background impedance of the well with only\nmedium [35]. HUVECs (4 × 104 cells per well) were\nseeded into the upper chamber, and M200 containing\n100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo or control medium was added\ninto the lower chamber. The cells were incubated at 37°C\nin 5% CO2 and monitored for 24 hours. For the scratched\nwound assay, 2 × 105 cells were seeded into 12-well plates\nand maintained at 37°C to permit cell adhesion and the\nformation of a confluent monolayer. Next, these confluent\nmonolayers were ‘scratch’-wounded by using the tip of a\np200 pipet tip. The medium was removed and rinsed once\nwith PBS to remove the debris and smooth the edge of the\nscratch and then replaced with fresh M200 + LSGS\nmedium containing 100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo or control\nmedium. Wound closure was monitored by collecting\ndigital images at 0-, 12-, and 24-hour intervals after the\nscratch, and digital images were captured by using an\ninverted microscope (Leica). The images were obtained at\nthe same position before and after incubation. The experi-\nment was repeated three times. The level of wound clos-\nure was assessed by the ratio of closure area to initial\nwound (0 hours) as follows:\n\nRn ¼ A0‐Anð Þ\nA0\n\n� 100%;\n\nwhere Rn represents the percentage of wound closure,\nAn represents the residual area of wound at the meter-\ning point (nh), and A0 represents the area of initial\nwound (0 hours) [36].\n\nEndothelial cell proliferation assay\nA Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay (Dojindo, Kyushu\nIsland, Japan) was performed to assess cell proliferation.\nBriefly, HUVECs were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/mL\n(100 μL/well) in a 96-well plate. After quiescence for\n12 hours, cells were treated with M200 + LSGS contain-\ning different doses of iMSCs-Exo (0, 12.5, 25, 50, and\n100 μg/mL) or control medium. At days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5,\nCCK-8 solution (10 μL) was added into medium and in-\ncubated for 3 hours at 37°C. The amount of formazan\ndye generated by cellular dehydrogenase activity was\nmeasured for absorbance at 450 nm by using a micro-\nplate reader. The optical density values of each well rep-\nresented the survival/proliferation of HUVECs. All of\nthese experiments were performed in triplicate and re-\npeated at least three times.\n\nEndothelial cell capillary-like tube formation assay\nIn vitro capillary-like tube formation was evaluated on\ngrowth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). At\nleast 30 minutes before the experiment, 96-well plates\nwere coated with Matrigel. Next, 2 × 104 HUVECs were\nseeded onto the plated Matrigel in M200 with control\nmedium, M200 + LSGS, M200 with 50 μg/mL iMSCs-\nExo, and M200 with 100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo. Tube for-\nmation was quantified at 4, 6, and 18 hours. At each\ntime point, the capillary-like structures were imaged\nfrom five random microscopic fields by using an\ninverted microscope (Leica). Tube formations—(1) total\ntube length per image and (2) total branch numbers per\nimage—were measured in a blind manner by an inde-\npendent observer.\n\nQuantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain\nreaction\nQuantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain re-\naction (qRT-PCR) for human-specific repeat sequences\nwas performed as previously described [37]. To identify\nthe expression level of Nanog, Oct4, and Msx1, total\nRNA of iPSCs, induced iPSCs (at days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12,\nand 14), and iMSCs was extracted by using Trizol re-\nagent (Invitrogen). To test gene expression of HUVECs\nafter treatment with iMSCs-Exo, 8 × 105 HUVECs were\nseeded onto six-well plates and cultured with M200 +\nLSGS containing 50 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo, or\ncontrol medium for 24 and 48 hours, and total RNA was\nalso extracted by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen).

Each qRT-PCR\nwas performed in triplicate for yield validation.\n\nEnzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\nTo determine the level of angiogenic trophic factors se-\ncreted by HUVECs, 8 × 105 cells were seeded onto six-\nwell plates and cultured with M200 + LSGS containing\n50 μg/mL, 100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo, or control medium\nfor 24 and 48 hours. At the predetermined time points,\nthe cell supernatant was collected and centrifuged to re-\nmove cells and then stored at −80°C. VEGF, TGF-B1,\nand Angiogenin secreted by HUVECs were quantified by\nusing specific VEGF, TGF-B1, and Angiogenin enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (all from\nWestang Bio-tech, Shanghai, China) in accordance with\nthe instructions of the manufacturer.\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll of the experiments were performed at least three\ntimes. The data were shown as the mean ± standard\nerror of the mean. Unpaired Student’s t test was used for\nstatistical comparison of the data. P values of less than\n0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\nDifferentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells into\nmesenchymal stem cells\nUsing a modified one-step induction protocol [28], we\nsuccessfully induced iMSCs from three different iPSCs.\nPrior to induction, iPSCs tended to form packed clones\nwith a high nucleus/cytoplasm ratio (Figure 1A, i). How-\never, the iPSCs began to lose their typical morphology\nand formed a monolayer with a larger spindle-shaped\nmorphology at the border of the colonies after culture in\nMSC medium for a few days (Figure 1A, ii). After being\npassaged three times, the cells exhibited a uniform\nfibroblastic-like morphology that resembled BMSCs\n(Figure 1A, iii). qRT-PCR results showed that the tran-\nscript level of pluripotency-associated genes Nanog and\nOct4 were generally reduced during differentiation but\nthat the mesoderm gene Msx1 increased rapidly to a\nhigh level (Figure 1B, i). The expression levels of Nanog\nand Oct4 in iMSCs were approximately 103–5-fold below\nthat in iPSCs (Figure 1B, ii).\nSurface antigen profiling of iMSCs using fluorescence-\n\nactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis revealed a surface\nantigen profile that was qualitatively similar to that\nfound in BMSCs, which was positive for CD29, CD44,\nCD73, CD90, CD105, and CD146 but negative for\nCD34, CD45, CD133, and HLA-DR (Figure 1C). Besides,\niPSCs cultured with mTESR1 before induction were\npositive for CD90, weakly positive for CD29 and CD34,\nand negative for CD44, CD45, CD73, CD105, CD133,\nCD146, and HLA-DR (Additional file 1: Figure S1).\nThe differentiation potential of iMSCs was examined by\n\nculturing in appropriate induction medium and determined\nby corresponding staining. Osteogenic differentiation was\nhighly efficient: more than 90% of cells demonstrated posi-\ntive staining with Alizarin Red (Figure 1D, i). After iMSCs\nwere induced with adipogenesis induction medium for\n21 days, oil droplets were observed in more than 80% of\nthe cells (Figure 1D, ii). Chondrogenesis was also efficient:\nmore than 90% of cells produced proteoglycans in the\nextracellular matrix as detected by using Toluidine Blue\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Efficient differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and characterization of\niMSCs-Exo.

These results\nindicated that iMSCs were capable of multipotent\ndifferentiation.\n\nCharacterization of iMSCs-Exo\nWe performed TEM to observe the morphology of\niMSCs-Exo, which were isolated by using ultrafiltration\ncombined with the purification method. TEM clearly re-\nvealed that iMSCs-Exo exhibited a cup- or round-shaped\nmorphology with a size of 57 ± 11 nm (Figure 1E). Western\nblotting (Figure 1F) confirmed the expression of exosomal\nmarkers CD63, CD81, and CD9 in iMSCs-Exo.\niMSCs-Exo promote blood perfusion and attenuate severe\nhind-limb ischemia\nTo investigate the biological functions of iMSCs-Exo, we\nused a mouse hind-limb ischemia model by performing\nan excision of the left femoral artery and injected\niMSCs-Exo directly into the left quadriceps muscle. The\ncontrol group was injected with control medium. After\n21 days, we observed robust differences in the ischemic\nlimb physiological status when compared with the iMSCs-\nExo group, control group, and sham group (Figure 2A,B).\nOf the 20 mice in the control group, 14 (70%) had limb\nloss and four (20%) demonstrated limb necrosis, with gan-\ngrenous tissue in the thigh and calf; and limb salvage was\n\n\n\nFigure 2 (See legend on next page.)\n\nHu et al.

(A) Examples of the potential clinical outcomes\nafter femoral artery excision: no necrosis (i), necrosis of the phalanges (ii), necrosis above the ankle joint (iii), and complete necrosis of the limb\n(iv). (B) At day 21 post-injection, the 3-group comparison showed a significant difference in the physiological status of the ischemic limb rated in\nthree levels: limb salvage, foot necrosis, and limb loss (n = 20 per group). (C) Laser Doppler flow imaging showed dynamic changes in blood\nperfusion in limb ischemia of the 3-group at days 0, 7, 14, and 21 post-injection. (D) The ratio of blood flow in the left limb (ischemic) to right\nlimb (non-ischemic) was gradually recovered in iMSCs-Exo transplanted mice at day 21 (#P <0.05, day 0 versus 21); compared with the control\ngroup, there was significantly improvement in the ratio of blood flow at day 21 (*P <0.05, iMSCs-Exo group versus control group). (E) At day 21\npost-injection, hematoxylin-and-eosin staining for ischemic muscle showed that muscle had structural integrity in the sham group (i), whereas in\nthe control group, muscle had massive degeneration (ii); however, in the iMSCs-Exo group, muscle degeneration of the ischemic limb was largely\nprotected (iii). (F, G) In the iMSCs-Exo group, compared with the control group, the scores of ambulatory impairment and tissue damage were\nsignificantly decreased at day 21 (*P <0.05, iMSCs-Exo group versus control group). iMSCs-Exo, exosomes derived from induced pluripotent stem\ncell-derived mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nHu et al.

In contrast, of the 20 mice\nthat received an iMSCs-Exo injection, two (10%) suffered\nfrom limb loss and five (25%) demonstrated limb necrosis\nin the calf and foot, and limb salvage was observed in 13\n(65%). In the sham group, 20 mice recovered well with no\nloss or necrosis (Figure 2B).\nTissue blood perfusion and flow rate were measured\n\nby using laser Doppler at days 0, 7, 14, and 21 post-\ninjection (Figure 2C). Repeated-measure analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) of blood perfusion in the 3-group\ncomparison revealed that iMSCs-Exo promoted blood\nperfusion in the ischemic limb. At day 0, the iMSCs-Exo\ngroup and control group similarly demonstrated low\nlevels of blood perfusion, and the sham group demon-\nstrated almost the same level compared with the normal\nlimb. At days 7 and 14, blood perfusion in the iMSCs-\nExo group was gradually recovered, whereas in the con-\ntrol group, it was at a poor recovery level. At day 21, the\ndifference in blood perfusion in the 3-group was prom-\ninent; blood perfusion in the iMSCs-Exo group recov-\nered nearly the same as the normal limb, whereas blood\nperfusion in the control group remained at a low level.\nBlood perfusion in the iMSCs-Exo group was signifi-\ncantly improved compared with that in the control\ngroup (P <0.05; Figure 2D).\nHematoxylin-and-eosin staining for quadriceps muscle\n\nrevealed a significant difference in muscle integrity in\nthe 3-group analyses. Muscle in the sham group showed\nstructural integrity (Figure 2E, i). However, extensive\nmuscle degeneration was observed in the control group\nwhen compared with the sham group (Figure 2E, ii). In\nthe iMSCs-Exo group, in contrast with the control\ngroup, there was remarkably less muscle degeneration\n(Figure 2E, iii).\nLimb ambulatory impairment and tissue damage score\n\nwere used to evaluate ischemic limb function. Repeated-\nmeasure ANOVA analysis demonstrated that scores of\nambulatory impairment and tissue damage were signifi-\ncantly different between the iMSCs-Exo group and con-\ntrol group (Figure 2F,G). At day 3, there was a similar\ndramatic limb function reduction in both the iMSCs-\nExo group and control group, but limb function in the\nsham group was less injured. At day 7, limb function in the\nsham group recovered to a normal level, and limb function\nreduction in the control group was more severe compared\nwith that in the iMSCs-Exo group (P <0.05). Next, we ob-\nserved that limb function gradually improved in the\niMSCs-Exo group after 7 days. In the iMSCs-Exo group,\ncompared with the control group, the ambulatory impair-\nment and tissue damage score were significantly reduced\nat day 21 (P <0.05). These data indicated that iMSCs-Exo\ncan promote ischemic limb functional recovery.\n\niMSCs-Exo promote angiogenesis in the ischemic limb\nMuscle recovery after ischemia is predominantly\ndependent on angiogenesis because neovascularization\nprovides an exchange of nutrients and oxygen. Thus, in\nthis study, we used a morphometric analysis of immuno-\nhistochemical staining for the endothelial markers CD31\nand CD34 to determine whether iMSCs-Exo can stimu-\nlate angiogenesis in ischemic muscle. As shown in\nFigure 3A and B, representative images of CD31 staining\nin the quadriceps muscle demonstrated that iMSCs-Exo\nsignificantly increased the average microvessel density\n(the number of microvessels per square millimeter of\narea) compared with the control group (3.11-, 3.14-, and\n3.46-fold increase relative to the control group on days\n7, 14, and 21, respectively; P <0.05). Representative im-\nages of CD34 staining also show an increase in average\nmicrovessel density compared with the control group\n(2.56-, 2.64-, and 3.01-fold increase relative to the con-\ntrol group on days 7, 14, and 21, respectively; P <0.05).\nIn addition, after injection of iMSCs-Exo, the average\nmicrovessel density was increased in a time-dependent\nmanner (P <0.05). These results suggested that trans-\nplantation of iMSCs-Exo can stimulate angiogenesis in\nthe ischemic muscle.\n\niMSCs-Exo promote endothelial cell migration,\nproliferation, and tube formation\nWe further investigated whether iMSCs-Exo can affect\nHUVEC migration, proliferation, and tube formation.\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Transplantation of iMSCs-Exo stimulated angiogenesis in the ischemic limb. (A) Mouse endothelial cells were stained red for surface\nmarker CD31 and green for surface marker CD34. Nuclei (blue) were stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Compared with the\ncontrol group, the iMSCs-Exo group had a significant microvessel density improvement at days 7, 14, and 21 (3.11-, 3.14-, and 3.46-fold increase\nrelative to the control group on days 7, 14, and 21 for CD31 staining, and 2.56-, 2.64-, and 3.01-fold increase relative to the control group on days\n7, 14, and 21 for CD34 staining, respectively; *P <0.05). (B) Microvessel density in the control group rarely increased; however, in the iMSCs-Exo\ngroup, there was a significant increase at days 7, 14, and 21 (*P <0.05). iMSCs-Exo, exosomes derived from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived\nmesenchymal stem cells.\n\nHu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2015, 6:10 Page 10 of 15\nhttp://stemcellres.com/content/6/1/10\nThe RTCA assay showed that iMSCs-Exo can signifi-\ncantly enhance the motility of HUVECs (P <0.05,\nFigure 4A, i and ii). This result was confirmed by the\nscratch wound assay (P <0.05, Figure 4B, i and ii). As\nshown in Figure 4C, iMSCs-Exo stimulated endothelial\ncell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. HUVECs\ncultured with iMSCs-Exo showed a more enhanced\nproliferation ability compared with HUVECs cultured\nwith LSGS or control medium (P <0.05). Furthermore,\nwe employed a three-dimensional Matrigel assay to\nexamine the potential effects of iMSCs-Exo on tube for-\nmation (Figure 4D, i to iii). Compared with the 4-group,\nHUVECs cultured in LSGS and iMSCs-Exo formed\ncapillary-like structures, whereas HUVECs cultured in\nthe control medium rarely formed tube structures.\nMoreover, there were no significant differences in tube\nlength and branch numbers in the LSGS group and\niMSCs-Exo group at 4 or 6 hours (P >0.05). However,\nafter 18 hours of culture, capillary-like structures in the\niMSCs-Exo group remained, whereas in the LSGS group,\nthe tube structures degraded. The tube length and\nbranch numbers in the 100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo group were\nsignificantly higher compared with the 50 μg/mL\niMSCs-Exo group or LSGS group (P <0.05). Because\nendothelial cell migration, proliferation, and tube forma-\ntion are key processes in angiogenesis, these results\ndemonstrated that iMSCs-Exo had the potential to pro-\nmote angiogenesis.\n\n\n\nFigure 4 iMSCs-Exo regulated human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration, proliferation, and tube formation. Migration of HUVECs was\nmeasured by using Real-Time Cell Analyzer (A, i, curve graph of RTCA; ii, Quantitative analysis of cell index at 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h, 24 h for i.) and\nscratched wound assay (B, i, optical micrographs of scratched wound assay; ii, quantitative analysis of migration index at 12 h and 24 h for i.). Compared\nwith the control group, iMSCs-Exo could improve the migration level of HUVECs (*P <0.05). Proliferation was measured by using the Cell Counting Kit-8\n(CCK-8) (C). iMSCs-Exo can significantly stimulate HUVEC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (*P <0.05). Tube formation test was performed on\ngrowth factor-reduced Matrigel (D, i, optical micrographs of tube formation assay; ii, quantitative analysis of total tube length at 4 h, 6 h, 18 h for i; iii, quantitative\nanalysis of total branch points at 4 h, 6 h, 18 h for i.). There was no significant difference in branch number and total tube length of the capillary-like structures\nfor HUVECs cultured in low serum growth supplement (LSGS), 50 μg/mL, or 100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo at 4 and 6 hours (P >0.05). However, after being cultured\nfor 18 hours, HUVECs cultured in 100 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo formed more capillary-like branches (*P <0.05), and the total tube length of the capillary-like\nstructures was much longer than that cultured in LSGS or 50 μg/mL iMSCs-Exo (*P <0.05). HUVECs cultured in control medium hardly formed capillary-like\nstructures. iMSCs-Exo, exosomes derived from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells; M200, Medium 200.\n\nHu et al.

Taken together, these results\ndemonstrated that iMSCs-Exo can promote angiogenesis-\nrelated gene expression and then protein secretion in a\ndose-dependent manner.\n\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that\ntransplantation of iMSCs-Exo could attenuate limb injury in\na mouse hind-limb ischemic model. We found that iMSCs-\nExo can robustly promote angiogenesis in ischemic muscle\nand improve blood perfusion in the ischemic limb, which\nwere necessary for limb functional recovery. Furthermore,\nwe demonstrated that iMSCs-Exo can stimulate HUVEC\nmigration, proliferation, and tube formation. Moreover,\niMSCs-Exo can activate the expression of angiogenesis-\nrelated molecules in HUVECs. Taken together, these\nresults suggested that iMSCs-Exo can attenuate hind-limb\nischemic injury by promoting angiogenesis.\nWith the development of regenerative medicine, stem\n\ncell transplantation is considered to have great potential\nin treating ischemic diseases. Many studies have demon-\nstrated that transplanting isolated primary stem cells\nhave positive therapeutic effects in clinical studies and\nexperimental ischemic models [38,39]. In the stem cell\ntherapeutic field, adult MSCs have been largely studied\nwith regard to their high self-renewal capacity, differenti-\nation capacity, and low immunogenicity. Among all mul-\ntipotent MSCs, those derived from bone marrow have\nrecently emerged as an attractive cell type for the treat-\nment of ischemic diseases [40,41]. However, large-scale\napplication of autologous BMSCs still presents chal-\nlenges because patients can offer only a limited number\nof BMSCs. In addition, BMSC proliferation and differen-\ntiation potential significantly decline with the increasing\n\n\n\nHu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2015, 6:10 Page 13 of 15\nhttp://stemcellres.com/content/6/1/10\nage- and aging-related disorders [11,12]. Over the past\nfew years, remarkable progress has been made in the\ngeneration of clinically compliant and safer human\niPSCs by using virus- or vector-free methods or both\n[42,43]. iPSCs become a promising cell source for clin-\nical application because they can be generated from the\npatients’ somatic cells, which avoid the ethical issues and\nimmune rejection. Moreover, previous study has shown\nthat MSCs derived from iPSCs exhibited greater prolifer-\native capacity than primary cultures of BMSCs [15]. In\nthe present study, we adopted a modified one-step\nmethod to induce iPSCs into iMSCs, which displayed\ntypical mesenchymal characteristics. In contrast to iPSCs\nand ESCs, iMSCs expressed no pluripotency genes, such\nas Nanog and Oct4, which are thought to be essential\nfor maintaining the function of iPSCs and ESCs [44].\nCurrently, an increasing number of studies have re-\n\nported that improvement of tissue damage by stem cells\ncannot be attributed to the differentiation of the deliv-\nered stem cells to replace injured cells. Their results in-\ndicated that the beneficial effects of stem cell therapies\noccur via secretory molecules in addition to cell replace-\nment, a process known as the paracrine effect [18].\nStem cells release growth factors, cytokines, chemokines,\nand extracellular microvesicles into their surroundings,\nwhich subsequently benefit cell regeneration or angio-\ngenesis [45]. Exosomes secreted by stem cells become an\nimportant active component in the ‘paracrine hypothesis’\nfor their unique characteristics and positive effects in\nthe treatment of ischemic injury [19,46].\nMany studies have shown that exosomes derived from\n\nBMSCs can alleviate tissue damage and promote func-\ntional recovery after ischemic injury [21,23]. Because\niMSCs have been demonstrated to have a strong thera-\npeutic function, we proposed that iMSCs-Exo may also\nhave a powerful function in attenuating injury after\nischemia. We performed in vivo and in vitro experiments\nto prove our hypothesis. Firstly, we used ultrafiltration\ncombined with a purification method to isolate iMSCs-\nExo. These iMSCs-Exo with a diameter of no more than\n100 nm (57 ± 11 nm) expressed the exosome-specific\nsurface markers CD63, CD81, and CD9. Secondly, we\nadministered an intramuscular injection of iMSCs-Exo\ninto mice with ischemic limb to examine their thera-\npeutic function. Consistent with our hypothesis, mice in\nthe iMSCs-Exo-treated group showed more limb salvage\nand a slightly lesser degree of necrosis compared with\nthe control group. In addition, the ischemic limb treated\nwith iMSCs-Exo presented more abundant blood perfu-\nsion, with higher microvessel density in ischemic muscle,\nwhich indicated that iMSCs-Exo can promote angiogenesis\nto attenuate limb injury. Thirdly, iMSCs-Exo promoted\nHUVEC migration, proliferation, and tube formation as\ndemonstrated in vitro angiogenesis experiments, which\nfurther confirmed the function of iMSCs-Exo in promoting\nangiogenesis.\nExosomes are an integral part of the intercellular\n\nmicroenvironment and act as regulators of cell-to-cell\ncommunication. They can stimulate specific receptors in\nrecipient cells directly or deliver proteins and genetic in-\nformation into recipient cells after being internalized.\nThese proteins or miRNAs can alter the bioactivity of\nrecipient cells via the activation of different signaling\npathways and regulation of protein translation [47].\nMany reports have shown that exosomes derived from\nMSCs contain various proteins and miRNAs. Proteomic\nanalysis showed that exosomes derived from MSCs har-\nbor growth factors, cytokines, signaling molecules, and\nadhesion molecules, such as VEGF, TGFB1, and\ninterleukin-8 (IL-8), which have been proven to contrib-\nute to the pro-angiogenic activity [48]. miRNA micro-\narray results also showed that exosomes derived from\nMSCs contain many miRNAs, including miR210,\nmiR126, miR132, and miR21, which have been proven to\nplay important roles in angiogenesis [49]. Umezu et al.\ndemonstrated that exosomes derived from multiple\nmyeloma cells can transfer miR135b to endothelial\ncells to directly suppress factor-inhibiting hypoxia-\ninducible factor 1 (FIH-1), and activate HIF-1α via\nthe HIF-FIH signaling pathway, leading to the over-\nproduction of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF,\nangiopoietin-1, and osteopontin, therefore resulted in\nendothelial cell migration, proliferation, and angio-\ngenesis [50]. Tadokoro et al. reported that exosomes\nderived from hypoxic K562 cells transfer miR210 into\nendothelial cells to downregulate Ephrin-A3 (EFNA3)\ngene expression and thereby enhance tube formation\nof endothelial cells [51]. A recent study by Sheldon\net al. has shown that endothelial exosomes transfer\nDelta-like ligand 4 (Dll4) protein to neighboring endo-\nthelial cells, leading to an inhibition of Notch signaling\nand an increased capillary-like structure formation\nin vitro and in vivo [52]. Therefore, these results\nindicate that angiogenesis-related proteins and miRNAs\nmay be the main components in exosomes to exert their\npro-angiogenesis function.\nIn our experiment, we found that iMSCs-Exo can\n\nstimulate angiogenesis-related gene expression and pro-\ntein secretion. After being cultured with iMSCs-Exo,\nHUVECs expressed higher levels of PGF, HIF-1α,\nTGFB1, VEGFA, VEGFB, Angiogenin, bFGF, KDR, and\nbFGFR and secreted more VEGF, TGFB1, and Angio-\ngenin. These data indicated that iMSCs-Exo can activate\nan array of angiogenesis-related gene expression and\nprotein secretion after their uptake by HUVECs. It has\nbeen well demonstrated that simultaneous delivery of\nmultiple angiogenic factors is more effective than the de-\nlivery of a single angiogenic factor in enhancing vessel\n\n\n\nHu et al. Stem Cell Research & Therapy 2015, 6:10 Page 14 of 15\nhttp://stemcellres.com/content/6/1/10\ndensity and maturity [53], which suggests that iMSCs-\nExo may play a more powerful pro-angiogenesis function\nthan that of a single recombinant angiogenic factor\nsupplement.\n\nConclusions\nThe present study demonstrated that iMSCs-Exo trans-\nplantation can protect against ischemic injury in an experi-\nmental mouse hind-limb ischemic model. One potential\nmechanism for exerting the protective function of iMSCs-\nExo was the stimulation of angiogenesis in ischemic\nmuscle. Overall, the application of iMSCs-Exo may be a\nnovel therapeutic approach in the treatment of ischemic\ndisease.\n\nAdditional file\n\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1.
