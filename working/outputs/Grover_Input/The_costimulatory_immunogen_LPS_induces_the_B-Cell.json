Lerner, February 14, 2012 (sent for review January 6, 2012)\n\nThemechanism of chronic rejection of transplanted human kidneys\nis unknown. An understanding of this process is important be-\ncause, chronic rejection ultimately leads to loss of the kidney allo-\ngraft in most transplants. One feature of chronic rejection is the\ninfiltration of ectopic B-cell clusters that are clonal into the trans-\nplanted kidney. We now show that the antibodies produced by\nthese B-cells react strongly with the core carbohydrate region of\nLPS. Since LPS is a costimulatory immunogen that can react with\nboth the B-cell receptor (BCR) and the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4),\nthese results suggest a mechanism for the selective pressure that\nleads to clonality of these B-cell clusters and opens the possibility\nthat infection and the attendant exposure to LPS plays a role in\nthe chronic rejection of human kidney transplants. If confirmed\nby clinical studies, these results suggest that treating patients with\nsigns of chronic rejection with antibiotics may improve kidney\nallograft survival.\n\nanti-LPS antibody ∣ antibody library ∣ immunochemistry ∣ kidney rejection ∣\ntransplantation\n\nKidney transplantation is considered to be the treatment ofchoice for patients with end stage renal disease. However,\nin spite of improvements in treating acute rejection, the incidence\nof chronic rejection remains largely unchanged and most kidney\nallografts are ultimately lost (1). While the mechanism of chronic\nkidney rejection is far from certain, recent studies have suggested\nthat a large set of genes that encode proteins of the innate and\nadaptive immune system are expressed in the host during rejec-\ntion (2). Another interesting immunological feature of trans-\nplanted kidneys is the appearance of highly organized ectopic\nB-cell clusters in the transplant (3–14).\n\nRecently we prepared combinatorial antibody libraries from\nthese infiltrating B-cell clusters and showed that they are clonal.\nHowever, the nature of the selective antigenic pressure(s) that led\nto the clonality of these B-cell clusters is not known. We now re-\nport that the antibodies produced by the B-cells within these clus-\nters, as well as those in the serum of patients who were rejecting\ntransplants, react strongly with the core carbohydrate epitopes of\nbacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is an immunogen that\ncan react with both the B-cell receptor (BCR) and the Toll-like\nreceptor 4 (TLR4). This combined engagement of the BCR and\nthe TLR4 can lead to selective replication of members of the\nB-cell repertoire and ultimately to clonality (15–25). These re-\nsults raise the possibility that bacterial infection may play a role\nin chronic allograft rejection.\n\nResults\nSearch for the Immunogen. The search for antigens and immuno-\ngens after one encounters an interesting antibody can be difficult.\nFor example, we have known about the presence of oligoclonal\nantibodies in the spinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis for\nalmost fifty years, yet the nature of the antigen(s) with which the\nantibodies react remains unproven (26). Also, with only a few ex-\n\nceptions, the antigen, if any, that reacts with the clonal immuno-\nglobulins produced by lymphomas and myelomas is not known.\n\nIn the case of transplanted human kidneys, a search for the\nantigen(s) that drives the replication of the B-cells that have in-\nfiltrated the allograft should be simpler because one knows the\nperturbations that initiated the process. These include the intro-\nduction of a foreign organ with a revised anatomy and a mechani-\ncally compromised urinary tract into an immunosuppressed\npatient. Given that the most obvious perturbation was the place-\nment of a foreign organ into a patient, we felt initially that the\nimmunogen was likely an alloantigen. However, our early studies\nwith HLA and MICA alloantigens suggested that this was not the\ncase and we turned our attention to infectious agents. We utilized\nthe H.Pylori. induced MALT lymphomas as a precedent because\nstudies of their pathogenesis has taught us that the sustained\ninteraction between bacteria and/or their products and immuno-\ncompent cells in a confined space can lead to clonal proliferation\nof B-cells and even malignancy. In most cases of MALT lympho-\nmas the malignancy disappears when the inciting H.Pylori. infec-\ntion is cured by antibiotics (27–30). By analogy, in the trans-\nplanted kidney there is the potential for continuous exposure\nto bacterial antigens by a urinary reflux mechanism in the setting\nof induced immunosupression.\n\nTo determine whether antibodies produced by the ectopic\nB-cell clones react with bacterial antigens, we prepared single\nchain and Fab components of the antibody molecules encoded\nby the genes that we determined to be expressed by the clonal\ninfiltrates. We tested the ability of these antibody constructs to\nbind to molecules in the total cellular extracts of continuously\ngrowing human lymphocytes (Wil2), yeast (Saccharomyces cerevi-\nsiae), and Escherichia coli (K12) cells as well as BSA by Western\nblot analysis (Fig. 1A). The ponceau red protein staining is shown\nin panel 5. Remarkably, these experiments showed that the anti-\nbodies reacted with a ladder of molecules present in the E. coli\ncytoplasmic extracts, but did not react specifically with the human\nor yeast cell extracts. The reactive antigens in the E. coli extracts\nhad molecular sizes ranging between 10 to 150 kD relative to\nthe protein markers. In addition, these antibodies also reacted\nwith a low molecular weight molecule that is present in the set\nof commercial E. coli derived protein molecular weight markers\n(Fig. S1). No reaction was observed with control unrelated ScFv\nantibodies (panel 3) or the secondary antiflag tag antibody (panel\n4). Importantly, antibodies from two distinct B-cell clones from\ndifferent patients that used different germ line genes (VH 1-69\n\nAuthor contributions: R.K.G., J.C., Y.P., T.M.J., D.I.R., R.J.U., J.I.G., E.A.D., D.R.S., and R.A.L.\ndesigned research; R.K.G., J.C., Y.P., T.M.J., D.I.R., D.R.S., and R.A.L. performed research;\nR.K.G., D.R.S., and R.A.L. contributed new reagents/analytic tools; R.K.G., J.C., Y.P., T.M.J.,\nD.I.R., R.J.U., J.I.G., E.A.D., D.R.S., and R.A.L. analyzed data; and R.K.G., D.R.S., and R.A.L.\nwrote the paper.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

These experiments constrained the antigen hunt\nto molecules that are unique to E. coli. Such molecules could\noccur either because of a common posttranslational modification\nof multiple distinct proteins or because the molecule itself occurs\nas a set of subspecies. To determine whether the antigen was a\nprotein or a nonpeptide entity, we determined its alkali sensitivity\nunder conditions that did not disrupt amide bonds. When the E.\ncoli extracts were treated with sodium hydroxide (0.05 N) prior to\nperforming the Western blot analysis, the reactivity of the anti-\nbodies from the kidney was totally abrogated (Fig. 1B) (panels\n1–4). This result strongly suggested that the interacting antigen\nwas not a protein but rather was a molecule present in E. coli\nthat was susceptible to ester hydrolysis. Studies on the alkali sen-\nsitivity of antigens are usually designed to determine whether cer-\ntain types of chemical bonds are present in the antigen. However,\nwhen such studies are combined with gel electrophoresis and\nWestern blotting, there are two different mechanisms by which\nthe apparent binding may be lost. In one case the actual epitope\nis destroyed by alkaline hydrolysis of a sensitive bond; alterna-\ntively the migration of the target molecule can change, causing\nit to be lost or appear at a different position on the gel. In either\ncase, alkali sensitivity yields some information about the chemical\nnature of the target molecule, but determining which mechanism\nis operative is important for the analysis of the fine specificity of\nantibody binding. We were able to determine which of the two\nmechanisms were operative by treating the actual Western blots\npost migration with alkali. Under these conditions the reactivity\nwith antibody is retained, indicating that the alkali sensitive por-\ntion of the molecule while present in the parent structure, is not\npart of the actual epitope.\n\nThere are two prominent alkaline sensitive molecules that are\nuniquely present in bacteria that present a laddered pattern on\ngel electrophoresis either because of an intrinsic property of\n\nthe molecule itself or because they occur as a posttranslational\nmodification of multiple distinct proteins. These are the Braun\n(Pam3Cys) modification of lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide\n(LPS) (Fig. 1C). To determine whether the (Pam3Cys) molecule\nwas the antigen, we studied by Western blot analysis the E. coli\nlipoprotein Lip12 (M.W 14 kD) (Fig. S2) that carries the\nPam3Cys modification and a mutant of Lip12 that lacks the\nBraun modification (Fig. 2A) (31). The VH169 antibody from\nthe kidney again reacted strongly and selectively with an antigen\npresent in the protein markers (marker lane), the E. coli cell ex-\ntract (lane 3), and a band that did not stain with ponceau red that\nwas present in both the wild type Lip12-Pam3cys and mutant\nLip12 preparations (lanes 5 and 6) but not with yeast or Wil2 cell\nextracts or with BSA (lane 1, 2 and 4). The reactive bands did not\ncorrespond to the Lip 12 proteins at approximately 14 kD (pon-\nceau red panel 2) and appeared to contain molecules that copur-\nified with the affinity selected Lip 12 proteins or the E. coli\nderived marker proteins. The reactive antigens had molecular\nsizes of approximately 10 and 35 kD relative to the protein mar-\nkers (Fig. 2A). Thus, affinity chromatography turned out to be a\nconvenient method to enrich for the immunoreactive molecule\nthat copurifies with either Lip 12 or the marker proteins.\n\nSince, the Pam3Cys functionality was not the antigen, we\nturned our attention to LPS. To confirm the molecular identity of\nthe reactive antigen, Western blot analysis of SDS gels of E. coli\nextracts and highly purified Kdo2-lipid A were used to compare\nthe reactivity of the antibodies produced in the kidney to that of a\ncommercial monoclonal anti-LPS antibody (Fig. 2B). The gels\nwere also stained with zinc imidazole which is relatively specific\nfor LPS (Fig. S3). The commercial anti-LPS antibody reacted\nwith a band on the gel that stained with zinc imidazole and ap-\npeared identical to that recognized by the antibodies produced by\nthe clonal B-cells that had infiltrated the transplanted kidneys\n(Fig. 2B). This low molecular weight band corresponds in size\n\nFig. 1.

Control antibodies were an unrelated ScFv antibody against the IL1-RA protein and the secondary antiflag antibody (Sigma) alone. E. coli and yeast cells\nwere grown in appropriate media and after centrifugation the cells were lysed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using lysis buffer from Sigma Aldrich.\nNucleic acids were degraded by treatment with DNAase and RNAase.

No binding was observed with purified Kdo2-lipid A\n(C110H214N6O39P2), indicating that the lipid A moiety plus the\n2-keto-2-deoxyoctulosonic acid (KDO) sugars did not constitute\nthe complete epitope (Fig. 2B). When the affinity-purified pre-\nparations were passed over an ion exchange column to remove\nLPS, the reactive antigen was eliminated (Fig. 2B). Neither our\nantibody nor the commercial anti-LPS monoclonal antibody re-\nacted with a mixture of glycoprotein standards (Life Technologies)\nindicating that their reactivity with carbohydrate antigens is not\npromiscuous (Fig. 2B). Although the lipid A plus core sugar com-\nponent of LPS has an approximate molecular weight of 2,300 Dal-\ntons, it migrates on SDS gels as an approximately 10 kD molecule\nrelative to protein markers. Since it is known that the core region\nof LPS is synthesized separately and transported to the outer sur-\nface of the bacterial inner membrane where it is enzymatically\njoined to the O-antigen polymer, the low molecular weight com-\nponent can be considered to be a precursor to the complete LPS\nmolecule. In total, our results suggest that the antibodies recognize\nthe core oligosaccharides of an approximately 2.3 Kd adduct.\n\nTo more precisely determine the chemical composition of the\nminimal epitope that the antibodies reacted with, we took advan-\ntage of an elegant series of E. coli mutants studied by the late\nChristian R. Raetz and his colleagues (32, 33). Essentially, the\nbiosynthetic pathway of LPS requires sequential activation of var-\nious α-glycosyltranferases and mutations in these enzymes leads\nto accumulation of truncated core oligosaccharides of defined\nstructure (Fig. S3). Analysis of these mutants by Western blots\nshowed that the minimal carbohydrate epitope that reacts with\nthe antibodies consists of two Kdo (3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulo-\nsonic acid) sugars in a 1 to 5 linkage to a single L-glycero-D-man-\nno-heptose (Hep) (mutant WaaC) (Fig. S4). However, the\naddition of two Hep residues (WaaQ) and one each glucose (Glc)\nand galactose (Gal) sugars to the core (WaaB) seems to form a\nmore complete epitope because the antibody reacts more strongly\nwith mutants WaaQ and WaaB than mutant WaaC.\n\nTo confirm these results, an orthogonal chemical approach was\nused to isolate the LPS from mutants WaaB and WaaC. LPS was\nextracted from E. coli into a chloroform∶methanol mixture (2∶1)\nand the isolated material was analyzed by thin layer chromatogra-\nphy (TLC), mass spectroscopy and Western blots. A band that\ncomigrated with authentic Kdo2-lipid A was observed in the\nTLC plates (Fig. S5). Western blot analysis revealed that the trun-\ncated form of LPS partitioned into the organic phase and, as for\nthe cell extracts, the anti-LPS and the kidney-derived antibodies\n(VH1-69) showed stronger reactivity with the more complete\nepitope present in mutant WaaB versus the minimal epitope\nof mutant WaaC (Fig. 3C). Mass spectroscopy analysis confirmed\nthat the organic extracts of WaaB andWaaC contained molecular\nion peaks corresponding to the expected signature of LPS\n(Fig. S6). No binding with control antibodies or interaction with\nstandard growth media was observed. The analysis of the growth\nmedia was included to ensure that the reactive molecule did not\noriginate from some cross-reactive material present in the media\nused to grow E. coli.\n\nTransplant Patients have Anti-LPS Antibodies in their Plasma. We\nwould not expect antibodies to LPS in renal transplant patients\nto be confined to the ectopic B-cell clusters that infiltrate the kid-\nney allograft. Accordingly, we studied the sera of patients that\nhad received a kidney transplant for the presence of LPS specific\nantibodies in their sera by ELISA analysis. We studied 20 patients\neach with chronic and acute allograft rejection as well as those\nwith well-functioning allografts. As controls, we studied 20 nor-\nmal individuals and 20 patients with multiple myeloma. The latter\ngroup was included because, although they are imunosuppresed,\nthey do not have the same exposure to E. coli as the kidney trans-\nplant patients. Patients who were rejecting their transplants had\ntiters of anti-LPS antibodies than were between 2.5 and 15 times\nhigher than that observed in either the control group or in\npatients with multiple myeloma (Student’s t-test, p ≤ 0.05)\n(Fig. 4A). Although more patients needs to be studied, TX Vs\nCAN titers showed a fold change of 1.25 (25% increase) with a\n\nFig. 2.

Cellular extracts from E. coli cells were prepared\nthat were expressing either the wild type Lip12 pro-\ntein that has the Pam3cys modification or a mutant\nwhere the cysteine residue to which the Pam3cys mo-\nlecule is removed and therefore the mutant lacks the\nBraun modification (31).

Most patients with well-func-\ntioning allografts and those experiencing acute rejection had anti-\nLPS titers that were similar to those of normal individuals, but two\npatients in the latter two cohorts had higher titers. These studies\nare in agreement with the work of others that showed that, while\nsome “normal” individuals have antibodies to LPS, the titers are\ngenerally much lower then those seen in patients with known in-\nfections (35). The patients with multiple myeloma were interesting\nbecause, for reasons that are presently obscure, none of them had\ndetectable antibodies to LPS. These ELISA results were confirmed\nby Western blot analysis using cytoplasmic extracts of E. coli, hu-\nman Wil2, and yeast cells as antigens. Again, as with the purified\nimmunoglobulins from the infiltrating B-cell clones, the antibodies\nfrom the plasma of patients with acute rejection and chronic allo-\ngraft nephropathy showed strong and selective binding to the low\nmolecular weight E. coli band (Fig. 4B). As reported by others,\nsome normal individuals have antibodies that react with a “ladder”\nof LPS adducts. Unlike what we observed in the transplant pa-\ntients, we also observed this “laddered” pattern of reactivity in\nsome of our normal individuals, thereby indicating that our Wes-\ntern blot gel system would allow identification of this pattern of\nreactivity if it was present (Fig. S7).\n\nThe Antibodies Produced by the B-cell Clusters Neutralize LPS. The\nantibodies produced by the B-cell clones that infiltrate trans-\nplanted kidneys could simply bind to LPS or they could both bind\nand neutralize its immunostimulatory activity. To determine\nwhether the kidney-derived antibodies were functional, they were\ntested for their ability to block the LPS mediated stimulation of\nTLR4 HEK cells expressing TLR4 (Fig. 5, Fig. S8). On addition\nof antibody LPS stimulation of the cells was inhibited, suggesting\nthat the antibody is able to block the interaction of the lipid com-\n\nponent of LPS with the TLR4 binding pocket. Apparently, anti-\nbody binding to the core sugars of LPS is sufficient to neutralize\nits function, presumably by steric effects.\n\nDiscussion\nThe most important aspect of the present study is the finding that\nthe special circumstances that surround human kidney transplan-\ntation may have opened a window into the consequences of a\nsustained interaction between the microbiome and the immune\nrepertoire in man. The unique features of the transplant patient\ninclude the presence of a foreign organ, a mechanically com-\npromised urogenital tract, immunosupression, and chronic in-\nflammation. We expect that there may be other as yet unrecog-\nnized situations where encounters between the microbiome and\nmembers of the immune repertoire lead to proliferation of clonal\npopulations of immune-competent cells and even malignancies.\nThus, these findings may relate to the pathogenesis of the clonal\nproliferation of B-cells in other diseases such as lymphomas and\nmyelomas where the driving forces may not be as transparent\nbecause the interactions are taking place in a less confined space.\nIndeed, we already know that MALT lymphomas arise because of\nthe interaction between H. Pylori and certain B-cells in a situa-\ntion not too dissimilar from that of human transplantation in\nterms of anatomical confinement and mechanisms that allow\nfor enrichment of the bacterial pathogen (27–30). While many\nmore clones from infiltrating B-cells will have to be studied to\ngeneralize these findings, our results from the serum already sug-\ngest that antibody reactivity with LPS in transplant patients may\nbe a very common phenomena.\n\nIn terms of antigenic specificity, the reactivity of the kidney-\nderived antibodies are in agreement with the studies of Pollack\net al., who demonstrated that human monoclonal antibodies re-\nact with the core oligosaccharides in a low molecular weight ad-\n\nFig. 3.

Finally, the structural studies of\nBrooks et al. showed that murine monoclonal antibodies to LPS\ncould achieve reasonable binding energy (KD ∼ 3.0 × 108 M) by\nrecognizing only a limited number of core sugars (39). In these\nstudies and ours, the likely reason that the antibodies are selective\nfor the lower molecular weight species is because the appended O\nantigen irrespective of serotype may sterically hinder reactivity\nwith the core portion of LPS.\n\nThe identification of LPS as the immunogen immediately sug-\ngests a mechanism for the observed clonality of the B-cell clusters\nthat infiltrate kidney transplants. The B-cells in these clusters\nmay become clonal because they have a selective advantage\nfor replication in that LPS can engage both the BCR and Toll-\n4 receptors and is, thus, capable of costimulation of cells bearing\nboth receptors (15–25). In this model, one starts with a popula-\ntion of B-cells where all cells have Toll-4 like receptors on their\ncellular surface for which LPS is the ligand, but only a very few\nhave BCRs that react with LPS. In the simplest case, the BCR and\nTLRs react with different regions of the LPS and are, thus, simul-\ntaneously engaged. Such costimulation will lead to the production\nof lymphokines and cytokines that give selectable growth advan-\n\ntage to the cells that produce them. Indeed, this costimulation\nmechanism has been recently studied and discussed by others,\nboth in the context of immune responses to LPS and systemic\nautoimmunity (15–25).\n\nThe clinical course of chronic kidney rejection seems to be\nevent driven. Thus, in the face of no obvious change in the status\nof the alloantigen or immunosuppressive therapy, the rejection\nprocess accelerates. Our study suggests that stochastic infection\nand exposure to LPS or an antigenically related molecule might\nbe one of the events that drives the chronic rejection process. Ur-\ninary tract infection is common in transplant patients and animal\nstudies of pyelonephritis have shown that morphological changes\nin the kidney are associated with antibodies against lipid A (40–\n42). Also, Misselwitz et al. and Mattsby-Baltzer et al. showed that\nchildren with urinary tract infections had antibodies against lipid\nA and patients with the highest titers had an increased risk of\nrenal scarring (42, 43). We do not know which strain of E. coli\ninduced the clonal B-cell infiltration of the kidney transplants\nthat we studied. Since the antibodies are to the more conserved\ncore region of LPS, the range of bacterial strains that could\ninduce the response is much larger than if the antibodies were\ndirected to the more variable O-antigen. Nevertheless, some stu-\ndies have suggested that certain uropathogenic E. coli strains are\noverrepresented as the risk factor for renal transplant patient\npopulation (44, 45).\n\nThe determination of the antigen with which the antibodies\nproduced by the infiltrating B-cells reacts is the in situ equivalent\nof classical serology that informs about the nature of an infectious\nprocess irrespective of whether the antibody itself is pathogenic.\nThus, although one can debate the pathophysiologic conse-\nquences of the appearance of the B-cell clusters themselves in\nthe kidney, the infectious process that initiates their homing and\nproliferation is very likely to be harmful by a variety of mechan-\nisms including production of proinflammatory cytokines and che-\nmokines when the TLR is activated (46). While much study will\nbe necessary to validate the role, if any, of infection in chronic\nkidney rejection, such confirmation would be important because\n\nFig. 4.
