Recent studies on stem cells\nindicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of noncoding small RNAs that participate in the regulation of gene expression,\nmay play a key role in stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Distinct sets of miRNAs are specifically expressed in\npluripotent stem cells but not in adult tissues, suggesting a role for miRNAs in stem cell self-renewal. We compared miRNA\nexpression profiles of ARPCs with that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and renal proximal tubular cells (RPTECs) finding\ndistinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed in ARPCs. In particular, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p regulated the\nexpression of important markers of renal progenitors, such as CD133 and PAX2, and important genes involved in the repair\nmechanisms of ARPCs, such as TLR2. We demonstrated that the expression of both the renal stem cell markers CD133 and\nPAX2 depends on lower miR-1915 levels and that the increase of miR-1915 levels improved capacity of ARPCs to\ndifferentiate into adipocyte-like and epithelial-like cells. Finally, we found that the low levels of miR-1225-5p were\nresponsible for high TLR2 expression in ARPCs. Therefore, together, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p seem to regulate important\ntraits of renal progenitors: the stemness and the repair capacity.\n\nCitation: Sallustio F, Serino G, Costantino V, Curci C, Cox SN, et al.

This trend was observed within various medical segments,\n\nincluding nephrology [1–3]. In particular many researchers\n\nfocused their attention on the possibility of using adult renal\n\nstem/progenitor cells (ARPCs) for regenerative purposes. These\n\ncells exhibited multipotent differentiation ability by generating\n\ntubular epithelial-like, osteogenic-like, adipocyte-like, and neuro-\n\nnal-like cells. When injected into mice with glycerol-induced acute\n\nrenal injury, these CD133+/CD24+ ARPCs contributed to\ntubular regeneration [1,4–6].\n\nARPCs, first identified in the renal interstitium and then in\n\nBowman’s capsule, are positive for PAX2, CD133 and CD24\n\n[4,5,6–8]. Their expression profiles and their phenotypical\n\ncharacteristics are very similar [7] but some specific properties\n\nas the inclination of tubular cells to proliferate upon tubular injury\n\nin patients with acute or chronic tubular damage were different\n\n[6,7,9]. Moreover, markers allowing distinction between glomer-\n\nular and tubular progenitor subpopulations have been recently\n\nidentified [6].\n\nRecent studies have indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs), a\n\nclass of noncoding small RNAs that participate in the regulation of\n\ngene expression, may play a key role in stem cell self-renewal and\n\ndifferentiation [10]. MicroRNAs are specifically attractive candi-\n\ndates for regulating stem cell identity, which includes self-renewal\n\nand cell fate decisions, as their ability to simultaneously regulate\n\nmany targets provides a means for coordinated control of gene\n\naction. Although direct evidence for a functional role for miRNAs\n\nin stem cell biology is just emerging, exciting hints regarding their\n\ninvolvement based on expression patterns, predicted targets, and\n\nover-expression studies suggest that miRNAs may be one of the\n\nkey regulators [11]. Distinct sets of miRNAs are specifically\n\nexpressed in pluripotent stem cells but not in adult tissues,\n\nsuggesting a role for miRNAs in stem cell self-renewal [12,13].\n\nExpression level of several miRNAs has been correlated to the\n\ntime of stem cell differentiation, suggesting that these miRNAs\n\ncould be used as markers to monitor stem cell identity and\n\ndifferentiation [12–14]. Furthermore, discovery of both stem cell\n\ndifferentiation-related miRNAs and their potential target mRNA\n\ngenes may provide further insights about their functional roles in\n\nstem cell maintenance and differentiation. To date, relatively little\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296\n\n\n\nis known about functions of miRNAs in the kidney and in\n\nparticular in ARPCs.\n\nIn this study we compared miRNA expression profiles of renal\n\nprogenitors with that of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and of\n\nrenal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs) and found\n\ndistinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed in ARPCs.\n\nIn particular, miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p regulated the expres-\n\nsion of important markers of renal progenitors, such as CD133\n\nand PAX2, and important genes involved in the repair mecha-\n\nnisms of ARPCs, such as TLR2.\n\nResults\n\nIsolation and Characterization of ARPCs\nCD133-positive ARPCs were isolated, by magnetic sorting,\n\nfrom glomerular and tubular fractions of healthy cortex of kidney\n\nremoved for renal carcinoma. Both ARPCs isolated from\n\nglomeruli (gARPCs) and from tubular compartment (tARPCs)\n\nwere positive for CD133, CD24, PAX2, BMI-1, Oct-4 and CD44\n\n(Figure 1A–F, J–L), previously described as markers of adult renal\n\nprogenitors [3–5,6,15]. However, gARPCs were positive for the\n\nCD106 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1, VCAM1) expression\n\n(Figure 1M), whereas tARPCs did not express the CD106 marker\n\n(Figure 1N). However, CD34, CD105, and CD45 membrane\n\nproteins were not detectable (data not shown).\n\nIdentification of Differentially Expressed miRNAs in\ntARPCs, gARPCs and MSCs Compared to RPTECs\n\nTo identify miRNAs typically expressed in ARPCs, we analyzed\n\ntheir global expression profile in 5 different tARPC and gARPC\n\nclones by microarray technology and compared them with\n\nRPTEC and MSC global miRNA expression. Among 1205\n\nhuman miRNAs represented on the microarrays, we found 327\n\nmiRNAs that resulted expressed between different cell types. The\n\n2-D hierarchical clustering and the principal component analysis\n\nshowed that miRNA expression profile was different among\n\nMSCs, RPTECs and ARPCs, whereas it was very similar between\n\ngARPCs and tARPCs (Figure 2A and 2B), even if statistical\n\nanalysis identified some little differences. In fact, applying the\n\nBenjamini-Hochberg statistical method and selecting genes\n\nmodulated with a fold change of 2, we identified 21 miRNAs\n\ndiscriminating tARPCs from RPTECs, 41 miRNAs discriminating\n\ngARPCs from RPTECs, 24 miRNAs discriminating tARPCs from\n\nMSCs, 31 miRNAs discriminating gARPCs from MSCs and 30\n\nmiRNAs discriminating MSCs from RPTECs (Table 1). When we\n\ncompared miRNAs modulated in tARPCs and gARPCs in respect\n\nto RPTECs with a fold change of 2, we found 14 miRNAs that\n\nwere jointly modulated. However, 7 miRNAs were specifically\n\nmodulated in tARPCs and 27 in gARPCs (Table 2). Moreover,\n\ncomparing miRNA expression of MSCs with that of tARPCs and\n\ngARPCs, we found 5 miRNAs varying in ARPCs in comparison to\n\nRPTECs that were also modulated in MSCs; 6 miRNAs were in\n\ncommon between gARPCs and MSCs and 19 miRNAs were\n\nexclusively modulated in MSCs (Figure S1 in File S1).\n\nIdentification of miRNA Targets\nTo study the molecular mechanisms in which miRNAs are\n\ninvolved, we performed a bioinformatic analysis to predict target\n\ngenes of the modulated miRNAs. To reduce the number of false\n\npositives, we used 4 different algorithms and potential targets were\n\nselected overlapping results and selecting gene targets predicted by\n\nat least 2 of them. Based on the results of bioinformatics analysis\n\nwe found several genes, of great interest for the stem cell biology,\n\nthat were potentially targeted by some of modulated miRNAs. In\n\nparticular, among miRNAs modulated respect to RPTECs, we\n\nfound miR-1225-5p and miR-1915 that were down-regulated in\n\ntARPCs and gARPCs and predicted to regulate genes involved in\n\nthe stemness property of ARPCs, as CD133 and renal embryonic\n\ntranscription factors PAX2 and PAX8, that are markers of adult\n\nrenal progenitors, the hyaluronic acid receptor CD44, the toll-like\n\nreceptor 2 (TLR2), IL-8, HOXA1, some WNT genes and other\n\nchemokines and growth factors (Figure 3, Table S1). All these\n\ngenes have been previously found upregulated in ARPCs and have\n\nan important role in specific biological function and stemness\n\ncharacteristics of ARPCs [1,4–5,7–9,16].\n\nValidation of miRNA Expression and in silico Analysis of\nmiRNA Targets\n\nTo validate expression results of miRNAs whose putative target\n\ngenes were more connected with stem cell biology, we performed\n\nreal-time PCR (q-RT-PCR) for miR-1225-5p, miR-1915, miR-371-\n\n5p and miR-196a on miRNAs isolated from ARPCs of an\n\nindependent set of 5 tARPCs, 5 gARPCs clones and 3 RPTEC\n\nlines. The expression of all analyzed miRNAs was significantly\n\nlower in stem/progenitor cell lines, confirming microarray results\n\n(Figure 4).\n\nTo deepen the biological interaction among miRNAs and\n\namong genes targeted by miRNAs that were found modulated in\n\nARPCs, we performed a new bioinformatics analysis on pathways\n\nand biological processes in which target genes of miRNAs were\n\ninvolved. We considered target genes of miRNAs that were jointly\n\nmodulated in tARPCs and gARPCs respect to RPTECs and\n\ngenes-miRNA pairs with inverse expression relationships. Among\n\nsignificant canonical pathways we found WNT/b-catenin signal-\nling, ERK5 signalling, growth hormone signalling and glutamate\n\nmetabolism (Figure S2A in File S1), however among significant\n\nbiological processes we found cellular growth proliferation, cellular\n\nand organismal development, cell morphology and cell-to-cell\n\nsignalling and interaction (Figure S2B in File S1). Moreover,\n\nmerging miRNAs with ARPC modulated genes resulting from the\n\ngene expression profile published in our previous work [7] (GEO\n\nSeries Accession Number GSE8611), we found that miRNAs were\n\nstrongly interconnected with the expressed mRNAs with an\n\ninverse pairs expression relationships (Table S2) and two specific\n\nsignificant networks, involving the WNT/B-catenin and Frizzled\n\nsignalling, were identified (Figure S3 and S4 in File S1). Then, we\n\nstudied the biological interaction among miRNAs modulated in\n\nMSCs and genes targeted by miRNAs, again taking advantage of\n\nour previous gene expression data. We considered only genes-\n\nmiRNA pairs with inverse expression relationships. Among\n\nsignificant canonical pathways we found Inhibition of matrix\n\nmetalloproteases, WNT/b-catenin signalling, PTEN signalling,\nregulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Figure S5A in\n\nFile S1). Among significant biological processes we found cellular\n\nmovement, cellular growth proliferation, cell death and survival,\n\ncellular and organismal development, cell morphology and cell-to-\n\ncell signalling and interaction (Figure S5B in File S1). miRNAs and\n\ngenes more contributing to these biological processes formed two\n\nsignificant networks represented in Figure S6 and S7 in File S1.\n\nmiR-1915 Regulates both the CD133 and PAX2\nExpression in tARPCs\n\nThe CD133 is known as the most important marker of renal\n\nprogenitor cells, however the genetic basis of its expression in stem\n\ncells are unknown. Our in silico analysis showed that the miR-1915\n\ndownregulation in ARPCs in respect to differentiated renal tubular\n\ncells could be the cause of the CD133 overexpression. To confirm\n\nmiRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296\n\n\n\nmiRNAs Involved in Adult Renal Progenitor Cells\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e68296\n\n\n\nthat the miR-1915 was able to modulate the expression of the\n\nCD133 mRNA, we performed transient transfection experiments\n\nusing an independent group tARPC clones. We increased the\n\namount of the endogenous miR-1915 within cells, transfecting\n\nshort RNA sequences that mimic the action of the miRNA, in\n\norder to simulate the situation found in RPTECs, that have higher\n\nlevels of miR-1915. tARPCs, transfected with 25 nM miR-1915\n\nmimic, showed a 1.5 fold reduction of endogenous CD133 mRNA\n\nlevels (p,0.01, Figure 5A). Since the same miRNA was found by\n\nbioinfomatic analysis to target also PAX2 mRNA, we checked\n\nwhether miR-1915 mimic lowered also its levels and found that\n\ntransfection with 50 nM miR-1915 mimic caused a 1.5 fold PAX2\n\nmRNA levels reduction too (p,0.0003, Figure 5B). Moreover,\n\ntransfecting tARPCs with the 50 nM miR-1915 mimic twice at a\n\ndistance of three days, on the sixth day from the first transfection\n\nwe obtained a large reduction of CD133 protein surface\n\nexpression (8% vs 96% of mock transfection control, Figure 5C).\n\nThe transiently transfection of renal progenitors with 100 nM\n\nmiR-1915 mimic led also to strong decrease of endogenous PAX2\n\nprotein expression (2 fold, p,0.02 Figure 5D) on the sixth day\n\nfollowing miRNA mimic induction. All together our results\n\nshowed that miR-1915 regulated the expression of both CD133\n\nand PAX2, the two most important stemness markers of ARPCs.\n\nmiR-1915 Upregulation Favors tARPC Differentiation\nTo study whether miR-1915, affecting CD133 and PAX2\n\nexpression, influenced also renal progenitor differentiation capac-\n\nFigure 1.

However, no significant difference was found in ZO-1 marker\n\nexpression between mimic-transfected and mock-transfected\n\ntARPCs after 20 days of culture in epithelial differentiation\n\nmedium (Figure 6L, N,O and Figure S8B in File S1). Nevertheless,\n\nwe found an increase of both ZO-1 and CK-19 expression in\n\ntARPCs transfected with the miR-1915 mimic and cultured for 20\n\ndays in maintenance medium respect to mock transfected cells\n\n(Figure 6F, H, J and 6K, M, O, respectively and Figure S8 in File\n\nS1). Moreover, we found also increased levels of aquaporin 1 and\n\naminopeptidase A transcripts in mimic-transfected tARPCs\n\nfollowing epithelial differentiation (Figure S9 in File S1).\n\nmiR-1225-5p Regulates TLR2 Expression in tARPCs\nOur bioinformatics analysis identified a putative miR-1225-5p\n\nbinding element in the 39 UTR of TLR2 transcript, a key gene of\n\ndamage signalling found up-regulated in ARPCs and that can give\n\nrise to repair processes in acute renal tubular damage [7,16]. To\n\nexamine whether miR-1225-5p downregulation led to TLR2\n\noverexpression in tARPCs, we increased the miRNA levels\n\ntransfecting renal progenitors with the miR-1225-5p mimic to\n\nsimulate the higher levels of this miRNA in RPTECs. We found\n\nthat the transfection with 25 nM miR-1225-5p mimic led, after 24\n\nhours, to a reduction of 1.3 fold of the TLR2 mRNA expression\n\n(p,0.01, Figure 7A). Moreover, the increase of the miR-1225-5p\n\nlevels (50 nM) completely prevented the TLR2 protein expression,\n\ncompared to mock-transfected cells, 3 days after transfection\n\n(Figure 7B–C). All together these results show that, in tARPCs,\n\nTLR2 mRNA is regulated by miR-1225-5p.\n\nDiscussion\n\nmiRNAs may be one of the key regulators of the stem cell\n\nidentity, including self-renewal and cell fate decisions, thanks to\n\ntheir ability to simultaneously regulate many targets that provides\n\na means for coordinated control of gene action [10–14]. Here we\n\nfound distinct sets of miRNAs that were specifically expressed both\n\nin tARPCs and gARPCs. Among them, we found some miRNAs\n\nwhose target genes overlapped with genes that were modulated in\n\ncomparison to RPTECs in our previous works and whose\n\nexpression resulted inverse respect to modulated genes [7–8,16].\n\nSome of these miRNAs were predicted to target genes involved in\n\nthe regulation of WNT/B-catenin signals, such as FZD5,\n\nSLC6A6, and HOXA9 (Figure S2 and S3 in File S1).\n\nIn stem cells WNT signals are transduced to the canonical\n\npathway for cell fate determination and to the noncanonical\n\npathway for control of cell movement and tissue polarity. Target\n\ngenes of WNT signaling cascades are determined in a context-\n\ndependent manner due to expression profile of transcription\n\nfactors and epigenetic status [17–18]. Canonical WNT signals are\n\ntransduced through Frizzled family receptors and LRP5/LRP6\n\ncoreceptor to the b-catenin signaling cascade. WNT, fibroblast\ngrowth factor (FGF), Notch, Hedgehog, and transforming growth\n\nfactor b/bone morphogenetic protein signaling networks are\nimplicated in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis by regulating\n\nself-renewal of normal stem cells as well as proliferation or\n\ndifferentiation of progenitor (transit-amplifying) cells, regulating\n\nthe balance between stem and progenitor cells [17–18]. Specifi-\n\ncally, Fzd5 can regulate WNTs, interpreting WNT signals during\n\nembryonic mesoderm and neural induction [19–20]. Moreover, it\n\nis known that HOXA9 shows positive regulation of genes in the\n\nWnt pathway important for hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal\n\n[21].\n\nAmong many miRNAs modulated in ARPCs, we focused in\n\nparticular on two of them, the miR-1915 and miR-1225-5p, that\n\nwere interesting since together were predicted to target several\n\nmarkers typical ARPCs, such as CD133, PAX2, PAX-8, CD44\n\n[1,4–5,7] and several genes found over-expressed in ARPCs, such\n\nas TLR2, inhibin, cyclin D1, BMP receptor 2, IL-8 and MCP-1\n\n[7–8,16]. We demonstrated that in renal progenitors the\n\nexpression of both the stem cell markers CD133 and PAX2\n\ndepends, at least in part, on lower miR-1915 levels.\n\nCD133, a pentaspan membrane glycoprotein, is a marker for\n\nadult stem cells in various tissues and tumor types. Stem cell\n\nspecificity is maintained by tight regulation of CD133 expression\n\nat both transcriptional and post-translational levels but very little is\n\nknown about its regulation and its molecular function [22–24].\n\nHowever, PAX2, a transcription factor critical for kidney\n\ndevelopment [25] is another important marker of ARPCs that is\n\nalso re-expressed in tubular cells damaged by renal toxins [26–27].\n\nMoreover it has been shown that Activin/Inhibin A signaling\n\ncan regulate the expression of PAX2 and can induce an immature\n\nphenotype in tubular cells [28].\n\nWe found that the increase of levels of miR-1915 improved\n\ncapacity of tARPCs to differentiate into adipocyte-like and\n\nepithelial-like cells, suggesting that the down-regulation of\n\nCD133 and PAX2 expression led renal progenitors to be more\n\nprone to differentiation.\n\nAnother important key gene of ARPCs is TLR2 since the\n\nengagement of the receptor that it codifies can activate renal\n\nprogenitors leading to increase secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1\n\nchemokines and enhancing differentiation capacity of renal stem/\n\nprogenitor cells [7]. Moreover, the TLR2 plays an important role\n\nin the acute tubular cell injury: it can work as a sensor of the\n\nFigure 3.

We showed that the low levels of miR-1225-5p in\n\ntARPCs were responsible for high TLR2 expression and found\n\nthat the same miRNA was predicted to regulate other important\n\ngenes found overexpressed in ARPCs, such as PAX-8, IL-8,\n\nBMPR2, IGF1, Inhibin-A, CyclinD1 and WNT1 [7–8,16].\n\nTherefore, together, the miR-1915 and the miR-1225-5p seem\n\nto regulate important traits of ARPCs: the stemness and the repair\n\ncapacity. Their relevance was supported by the bioinformatic\n\nanalyses showing that these two miRNAs have multiple target\n\ngenes that are all highly interconnected and that were all found\n\nup-regulated in renal progenitors.\n\nFurther studies will be necessary to determine whether the\n\nmodulation of these two miRNAs could enhance, in vivo, the\n\nregenerative capacity of ARPCs for therapeutic purposes.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nRenal Tissue-derived Primary Cell Cultures\nFresh human renal cortical tissue was harvested from patients\n\ndiagnosed with renal carcinoma. All patients gave signed consent\n\nfor the use of their tissue for research purposes at the time of\n\nradical nephrectomy. The study was carried out according to the\n\nprinciples of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by our\n\ninstitutional ethics review board (Independent Ethical Committee\n\nof Policlinic Hospital of Bari). Portions of normal-appearing cortex\n\nwere isolated surgically and examined histologically to exclude\n\npresence of carcinoma. Isolation of renal fractions was achieved as\n\nreported elsewhere [7–8,15–16], recovering both glomerular and\n\ntubular fractions. Briefly, cortex renal fractions were dissected by\n\nthe passage through a graded series of meshes steel sieves to\n\nremove the fibrous component. The cellular fraction was then\n\npassed through a 120-mesh sieve to isolate the capsulated\n\nglomeruli from the tubular fraction. After several washes, the\n\ntwo isolated fractions were cultured separately in EGM-MV\n\nmedium (Lonza) supplemented with 20% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nAfter 4–5 days, cultures were washed twice with Hanks’ buffer to\n\nremove non-adherent cells and after about 1 week in culture, cell\n\nviability and number were checked. CD133-positive cells were\n\nthen isolated by magnetic cell separation technology (MACS) by\n\nmeans of CD133Ab-conjugated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi\n\nBiotec). The eluted cells were resuspended and maintained in\n\nEGM-MV medium supplemented with 20% FBS and incubated at\n\n37uC with 5.0% CO2.

Probe sets were sorted after\n\nsignificant P-value and were adjusted to account for multiple\n\ntesting using the FDR method of Benjamini-Hochberg. To\n\ndetermine the features that were differentially expressed between\n\ntwo types of cells with a stronger statistic, we applied a filter with\n\nFDR,0.01 and a fold change .2. Two-dimensional hierarchical\n\nclustering and PCA were performed using Genespring software\n\n(Agilent Technologies). To assess biological relationships among\n\ngenes, we used the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA,\n\nIngenuity System; http://www.ingenuity. com). IPA computes a\n\nscore for each network according to the fit of the set of supplied\n\nfocus miRNAs/genes. These scores indicate the likelihood of focus\n\ngenes to belong to a network versus those obtained by chance. In\n\nIPA, the Expression Pairing tool was then applied to display the\n\nmicroRNA-mRNA pairs, and to filter down the pairs with inverse\n\nexpression relationships.\n\nmiRNA targets were predicted by means of miRBase 17.0\n\n(http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk) [29], TargetScan 5.2 (http://www.\n\ntargetscan.org/) [30], PicTar (http://pictar.org) [31] and RNA22\n\n1.0 (http://cm.jefferson.edu/rna22v1.0) [32] algorithms. The\n\nalgorithms interrogated the databases by searching for the\n\npresence of conserved 8mer and 7mer sites that match the seed\n\nregion of each miRNA at 3’-UTR, 5’-UTR or coding sequences.\n\nThe scanning algorithms were based on sequence complementar-\n\nity between the mature miRNA and the target site, binding energy\n\nof the miRNA–target duplex, and evolutionary conservation of the\n\ntarget site sequence and target position in aligned homologous\n\ngenes. Potential targets were chosen overlapping results from the\n\nfour algorithms and selecting gene targets predicted by at least 2 of\n\nthem and based on a score cutoff computed by a weighted sum of\n\na number of sequence and context features of the predicted\n\nmiRNA:mRNA duplex. Bioinformatic analysis to study the\n\npotential binding sites of miRNAs in CD133 target mRNA was\n\ncarried out by the RNAhybrid (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-\n\nbielefeld.de) [33]. In general, the program finds the energetically\n\nmost favorable hybridizations of a small RNA to a large RNA by a\n\nthorough statistical analysis of minimum free energies (MFEs).\n\nWe evaluated statistical significance with the Student’s t test for\n\ncomparisons between 2 mean values. Pearson’s correlation test was\n\nused to study continuous variables. All values were expressed as\n\nthe mean6SD of data obtained from at least three independent\n\nexperiments. Results were considered statistically significant at\n\np,0.05.\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR\nTotal RNA, including small RNA fractions, was reverse\n\ntranscribed with miScript Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen)\n\nfollowing the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nThe real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction\n\n(RT PCR) for the quantification of miRNAs was carried out with\n\nmiScript Primer Assays and miScript SYBR Green PCR Kit from\n\nQiagen. Real-time PCR amplification reactions were performed in\n\ntriplicate in 25 ml of final volume via SYBR Green chemistry on\niCycler (Bio-Rad).\n\nNormalization was performed with a small nucleolar RNA U6\n\nendogenous control. Comparative real-time PCR was performed\n\nin triplicate, including no-template controls. Relative expression\n\nwas calculated using the 2\n2DCt\n\nmethod.\n\nFor CD133, PAX2 and TLR2 expression analysis, total RNA\n\nwas reverse transcribed with QuantiTect Reverse Transcription\n\nKit (Qiagen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantita-\n\ntive RT-PCR amplification reactions were performed in triplicate\n\nin 25 ml final volumes using SYBR Green chemistry on an iCycler.\nQuantitative RT-PCR was performed using the QuantiTect\n\nPrimer Assay and the QuantiFast SYBR Green PCR mix\n\n(Qiagen). Genes were amplified according to the manufacturer’s\n\ndirections. The b-actin gene amplification was used as a reference\nstandard to normalize the target signal. Relative expression was\n\ncalculated using the 2\n2DCt\n\nmethod.\n\nmiR-1915 and miR-1225-5p Mimic Transfection\nFor each transfection, tARPCs and gARPCs were cultured at\n\n1*10\n5\n\ncells per well in a 6-well plate with EGM-MV with 20%\n\nFBS at 37uC in 5% CO2. The transfection of miRNA mimic was\ncarried out using TransIT-TKO Transfection Reagent (Mirus) in\n\naccordance with manufacturer’s procedure. All miRNA mimics\n\nwere purchased from Dharmacon (Thermo Fisher Scientific). In\n\ntransfection experiments a mock-transfection control was per-\n\nformed by putting cells through the transfection procedure without\n\nadding miRNA. The validated nonsilencing siRNA sequence\n\nAllStars Negative Control siRNA (50 nM, Qiagen) and the Syn-\n\nhsa-miR-1 miScript miRNA Mimic (25 nM, Qiagen) were used as\n\nnegative control and positive control, respectively, for the setup of\n\nmiRNA mimic transfections. Each transfection experiment was\n\ndone in triplicate. After transfection, cells were incubated for 24\n\nhours for total RNA extraction. For the protein analysis, cells were\n\ntransfected twice at a distance if 3 days and the protein expression\n\nwas assayed 6 days after the first transfection.\n\nFlow Cytometric Analysis\nThe CD133 protein surface expression, after transfection, was\n\ndetermined by flow cytometric analysis. ARPCs were washed and\n\nresuspended in FACS buffer and incubated with PE-conjugated\n\nanti-CD133/2 (293C3) (Miltenyi Biotec). Non-specific sites were\n\nblocked with the FcR blocking reagent (Miltenyi Biotec). Cells\n\nwere analyzed on a ‘‘EPICS XL’’ Flow Cytometer (Beckman\n\nCoulter). The area of positivity was determined using an isotype-\n\nmatched mAb, a total of 10\n4\n\nevents for each sample were acquired.\n\nWestern Blot Analysis\nThe amount of PAX2, after transfection, was determined by\n\nWestern blotting analysis. Total protein extracts were prepared\n\nwith RIPA lysis buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-\n\nHCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 1.5% NonidetP-40, 1 mM sodium\n\northovanadate, plus proteinase inhibitors. The protein concentra-\n\ntion was determined by the Bradford assay (BioRad). 80 mg of\neach protein lysate was separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE and\n\ntransferred to polyvinyldene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Milli-\n\npore). The membranes were incubated in 5% non-fat milk powder\n\ndiluted in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (T-PBS) for 2 h at\n\nroom temperature (RT) and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti–\n\nPAX2 antibody (Novus Biologicals) in blocking buffer overnight at\n\n4uC. Finally, membranes were incubated with secondary antibody\nof horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Santa\n\nCruz). Immunocomplexes were detected with ECL method (GE\n\nHealthcare). The same membranes were stripped and reprobed\n\nwith anti- b-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma).\nImages of autoradiography were acquired using a scanner\n\nEPSON Perfection 2580 Photo (EPSON) and quantified by Image\n\nJ 1.34 Software (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/).

The immune complexes were identified\nafter the incubation of the cells with the specific secondary\n\nantibodies (Alexa Flour 488 and Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse\n\nIgG, respectively) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were\n\nwashed in PBS after each step, counterstained with To-pro-3\n\n(Molecular Probes), mounted in Gel/Mount (Biomeda), and sealed\n\nwith nail varnish. Negative controls were obtained by incubating\n\ncells with the blocking solution and then omitting the primary\n\nantibody. The stained cells were viewed under the Leica TCS SP2\n\n(Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) confocal laser-scanning microscope\n\nusing x40 and x63 objective lenses. Fluorescence levels were\n\nquantified and expressed as area fraction (%).\n\nDifferentiation\nTo evaluate the effects of the miR-1915 on ARPCs differen-\n\ntiation, the ARPCs were transfected with 50 nM miR-1915 mimic\n\n(Dharmacon) at the first day of differentiation and every 7 days.\n\nThe undifferentiated and untransfected cells were used as negative\n\ncontrols.\n\nThe extrarenal differentiation experiments were performed\n\nusing the adipogenic induction/maintenance medium and osteo-\n\ngenic differentiation medium (Lonza), according to the manufac-\n\nturer’s instructions. For adipogenic differentiation, 3 cycles of\n\ninduction/maintenance were performed. Each cycle consisted of\n\nculturing ARPCs in induction medium for 3 d and in maintenance\n\nmedium for 1–3 d. After 3 complete cycles, the cells were cultured\n\nfor seven more days in adipogenic maintenance medium,\n\nreplacing the medium every 2–3 d. At the end of the treatment\n\nthe lipid vacuoles were stained with Oil red-O (Sigma). Briefly,\n\ncells were washed with PBS, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde\n\nfor 15 min, rinsed with PBS and incubated with Oil red-O for\n\n30 min.\n\nEpithelial differentiation was obtained by culturing ARPCs in\n\ncommercially available REGM medium (Lonza) supplemented\n\nwith 50 ng/ml hepatocyte growth factor (Sigma) for 20 days.\n\nTubular cells were identified by the expression of CK-19 and ZO-\n\n1 in immunofluorescence using rabbit anti-human ZO-1 poly-\n\nclonal Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rabbit anti-human CK-\n\n19 mAb (Novus Biologicals).\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFile S1 Figure S1.
