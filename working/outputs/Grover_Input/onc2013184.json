In this study, we report that lack of\nosteopontin (OPN) suppresses melanoma growth in opn� /� mice and macrophages are the crucial component responsible for\nOPN-regulated melanoma growth. In tumor microenvironment, OPN activates macrophages and influences angiogenesis by\nenhancing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in an autocrine manner. Furthermore, we\nidentify a9b1 integrin as a functional receptor for OPN that mediates its effect and activates ERK and p38 signaling, which\nultimately leads to COX-2 expression in macrophages. The major role played by OPN and PGE2 in angiogenesis are further amplified\nby upregulation of MMP-9. OPN-activated macrophages promote the migration of endothelial and cancer cells via PGE2. These\nfindings provide evidence that TAMs serve as source of key components such as OPN and COX-2-derived PGE2 and MMP-9 in\nmelanoma microenvironment. Clinical specimens analyses revealed that increased infiltration of OPN-positive TAMs correlate with\nmelanoma growth and angiogenesis. These data provide compelling evidence that OPN and COX-2 expressing macrophages are\nobligatory factors in melanoma growth. We conclude that OPN signaling is involved in macrophage recruitment into tumor, and\nour results emphasize the potential role of macrophage in modulation of tumor microenvironment via secretion of OPN, PGE2 and\nMMP-9, which trigger angiogenesis and melanoma growth. Thus, blockade of OPN and its regulated signaling network provides\nunique strategy to eradicate melanoma by manipulating TAMs.\n\nOncogene (2014) 33, 2295–2306; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.184; published online 3 June 2013\n\nKeywords: osteopontin; tumor-associated macrophages; COX-2 and melanoma growth\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMalignant melanoma is one of the leading causes of death among\nall the cancer worldwide. During melanoma growth, there is a fine\ntuned interaction between cancer and stromal cells, which\nproduce a unique microenvironment permissive for tumor growth,\nmetastasis and angiogenesis by secreting a wide array of growth\nfactors, chemokines and proteases.1–3 Recent reports suggest that\ntargeting stromal cells can reverse tumor progression.4,5 Studying\nstroma–tumor interaction may solve many unanswered questions,\nwhich might aid to design anti-cancer therapy.\nAccumulated evidences suggest that inflammatory cells are\n\nclearly not innocent bystanders in cancer, but rather have an active\nrole in tumor progression. Among all inflammatory cells in stroma,\nthe most prominent subpopulation is the tumor-associated\nmacrophages (TAMs). Upon activation, macrophages can release\nvarious cytokines, proteolytic enzymes, angiogenic factors and\ninflammatory mediators which profoundly affect many cells in\ntumor microenvironment that in turn support tumor growth and\ninvasion.6–8 Although multiple studies have focused on elucidating\nthe role of infiltrating macrophages in angiogenesis and tumor\ngrowth, there has been least characterization of soluble mediators\nreleased by macrophages that initiate the phenotypic switch and\nits potential impact in modulating tumor microenvironment.\n\nOsteopontin (OPN) is secreted non-collagenous, sialic acid rich,\nchemokine-like phosphoglycoprotein with pleiotropic function.9 It\nis widely expressed in various cell types including activated\nimmune cells such as T cells and macrophages.10 It acts as a ligand\nfor integrins (avb3, avb5, avb1, a9b1 and a4b1) and CD44\nvariants.11,12 OPN is overexpressed in various cancers and growing\nline of evidence suggests that it has crucial role in all the stages of\ncancer.13–16 The role of tumor-derived OPN in cancer progression\nand metastasis is extensively studied, whereas the function of\nstromal OPN in this process is not well defined.\nCyclooxygenase (COX) is a key rate limiting enzyme involved in\n\nregulation of prostaglandin synthesis. Among all the isoforms of\nCOX, COX-2 is constitutively expressed in various cancers,\npredominantly by stromal cells thereby promoting tumor growth\nand metastasis.17,18 Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), an important\ndownstream mediator of COX-2, stimulates angiogenesis-specific\ngenes and suppresses the immune system, which cooperatively\nresults in cancer progression.19,20\n\nIn this study, using both in vitro and in vivo models, we\ndemonstrate the signaling mechanism by which OPN regulates\nmacrophage activation that further controls melanoma growth\nand angiogenesis. Our findings suggest that OPN via a9 integrin\nactivates p38 and ERK signaling, which ultimately augments\n\n1Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Angiogenesis and Nanomedicine Research, National Center for Cell Science, Pune, India and 2Department of Pathology, YCM Hospital, Pune, India.\nCorrespondence: Dr GC Kundu, Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Angiogenesis and Nanomedicine Research, National Center for Cell Science, NCCS Complex, Ganeshkhind, Pune\n411007, India.\nE-mail: kundu@nccs.res.in\nReceived 27 November 2012; revised 28 March 2013; accepted 12 April 2013; published online 3 June 2013\n\nOncogene (2014) 33, 2295–2306\n& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved 0950-9232/14\n\nwww.nature.com/onc\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2013.184\nmailto:kundu@nccs.res.in\nhttp://www.nature.com/onc\n\n\nCOX-2 and MMP-9 expression in macrophages that modulate\nangiogenesis and melanoma growth.\n\nRESULTS\nLack of expression of OPN reduces microvessel as well as\nmacrophage density thereby attenuates melanoma growth\nTo elucidate whether OPN signaling on the host side is involved in\nmelanoma growth, we have developed melanoma isograft in\nOpnþ /þ and Opn knockout (Opn� /� ) mice models. B16F10 cells\nwere injected s.c. into Opnþ /þ and Opn� /� mice. The results\nindicated that tumor growth was significantly reduced in Opn� /�\n\nmice as compared with Opnþ /þ (Figure 1A, left and right panels).\nThe results provide genetic evidence that lack of host-derived Opn\nsuppresses melanoma growth. To elucidate whether suppression\nof tumor growth is due to decrease in angiogenesis, we\ninvestigated the level of angiogenesis in tumor tissue by\nimmunohistochemical staining with CD31. The numbers of\nCD31þ cells in tumor tissues were markedly reduced in Opn� /�\n\nmice (Figures 1B, a and b), suggesting the role of stromal OPN in\nregulating melanoma angiogenesis. Accumulating evidences\n\nsuggested the positive correlation between increased infiltration\nof TAMs and high vascular grades of many tumor types.21–26 OPN\nis expressed in tumor cells as well as in macrophages.27,28 Thus,\nwe examined macrophage infiltration in melanoma tissues\nderived from Opnþ /þ and Opn� /� mice by immuno-\nhistochemical staining using anti-F4/80 and anti-CD11b\nantibodies. The infiltration of macrophages into tumor tissues\nwas strikingly suppressed in Opn� /� mice (Figures 1B, c–f).\nHowever, no significant difference in number of macrophages was\nobserved in normal tissues of Opnþ /þ and Opn� /� mice\n(Supplementary Figure S3a). The histopathological analyses of\ntumor tissues revealed that tumor generated in Opnþ /þmice\nexhibit increased immune cell infiltration, higher nuclear poly-\nmorphism, mitotic count and enhanced vessel formation as\ncompared with Opn� /� mice (Supplementary Figures S1A, B and\nTable 1). Bianchini et al.18 have shown that melanoma contained\nhigh percentage of COX-2-positive TAMs that can act as an\neffective biomarker of melanoma growth. Accordingly, tumor\nsections were analyzed and it was observed that infiltration of\nCOX-2-positive macrophages (F4/80 positive) was remarkably\nsuppressed in tumor tissue of Opn� /� mice as compared with\n\nFigure 1. Lack of expression of OPN suppresses tumor growth and reduces microvessel density by attenuating the infiltration of COX-2-\npositive macrophages.

As PGE2 is downstream effector of\nCOX-2, we further examined the serum level of PGE2 from tumor\nbearing Opnþ /þ and Opn� /� mice by EIA (Figure 1E, left panel).\nSerum level of PGE2 in Opn\n\nþ /þ mice was significantly higher than\nOpn� /� suggesting the involvement of COX-2 and PGE2 in\nmelanoma growth and angiogenesis.\nTo further elucidate the role of COX-2 in melanoma, we studied\n\nthe effect of COX-2 inhibitor (etoricoxib) on melanoma growth.\nSignificant differences in tumor growth between control\n(Opnþ /þ ) and etoricoxib-treated group indicated that inhibition\nof COX-2 significantly suppresses tumor growth (Figure 1C, left\nand right panels). The level of angiogenesis was investigated in\ntumor tissue by immunohistochemistry using anti-CD31 antibody.\nMicrovessel density in tumor tissues were markedly reduced in\nmice supplemented with etoricoxib (Figures 1D, a and b). The\ninfiltration of macrophages into tumor tissues was strikingly\nsuppressed in mice treated with etoricoxib as compared with\ncontrol (Figures 1D, c–f). Also, serum level of PGE2 was significantly\nreduced in etoricoxib-treated mice as compared with control\n(Figure 1E, right panel). Moreover, the histopathological analysis\nshowed less immune cell infiltration, vessel formation and mitotic\nfeature in tumor tissue of etoricoxib-treated mice as compared\nwith control (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table 2), suggesting\nthat COX-2 has critical role in melanoma growth and angiogenesis.\n\nOPN and COX-2 have crucial role in regulation of macrophages-\nmelanoma interaction in vitro\nTo further understand the involvement of OPN and COX-2 in\nmelanoma growth, we carried out in vitro co-culture experiments.\nAccordingly, macrophage (RAW264.7) cells were supplemented\nwith conditioned media (CM) of melanoma (B16F10 or A375) for\n24 h. The expressions of OPN and COX-2 were analyzed by\nwestern blot and the data revealed significant increase in\nexpressions of OPN and COX-2 in macrophages supplemented\nwith CM of melanoma (Figure 2a, upper and lower panels).\nEnhanced expressions of OPN and COX-2 were also detected in\nperitoneal macrophages (pMac) when co-cultured with melanoma\nunder similar condition (Supplementary Figure S3b, upper and\nlower panels). The PGE2 level in RAW264.7 supplemented with CM\nof melanoma was measured by PGE2 EIA. The results indicated\nthat CM of melanoma induces PGE2 production in macrophages\n(Figure 2a, right panel). Increased level of PGE2 was also detected\nin pMac (Supplementary Figure S3b, right panel). However, CM of\nRAW264.7 does not influence the expression of OPN and COX-2 in\nB16F10 cells (Figure 2b). Furthermore, we found that melanoma\nCM had no effect on COX-2 expression in fibroblasts\n(Supplementary Figure S3e, lower panel). These data suggested\nthat melanoma-derived factor(s) upon interaction with macro-\nphages augments COX-2 expression and PGE2 production.\nOur in vivo experimental data indicated that there was increase\n\nin migration of macrophages in melanoma, whereas COX-2\n\ninhibitor reduced the infiltration of macrophages. Further to\nunderstand the mechanism involved in macrophage infiltration in\nmelanoma, we have used in vitro model system involving\nco-migration of macrophages (RAW264.7) with CM of melanoma.\nThe results revealed that CM of melanoma induces macrophage\nmigration and macrophages transfected with OPN or COX-2 cDNA\nshowed enhanced migration, whereas cells transfected with small\ninterfering RNA (siRNA) specific to OPN or COX-2 significantly lost\ntheir ability to migrate (Figure 2c, left panel). These data were\nanalyzed and represented in the form of bar graph (Figure 2c,\nright panel). The expressions of OPN and COX-2 in these\ntransfected cells were analyzed by western blot (Figure 2d, left\nand right panels). The soluble mediator(s) derived from melanoma\nupregulates OPN and COX-2 expression, which in turn enhanced\nthe infiltration of macrophage towards melanoma.\n\nOPN augments COX-2 expression in macrophages\nOur in vivo and in vitro experimental data suggested that there\nmight be inter-regulatory loop between OPN and COX-2 that\ncontrols macrophage–melanoma interaction. Therefore, we\nsought to determine whether OPN present in CM of melanoma\nis involved in upregulation of COX-2 in macrophages. Accordingly,\nRAW264.7 cells were supplemented with CM of B16F10 or A375\neither alone or CM pre-incubated with OPN neutralizing antibody.\nIn separate experiments, RAW264.7 cells were supplemented with\nCM of OPNi transfected B16F10 or A375 cells. The expression of\nCOX-2 was analyzed by western blot and the data revealed that\nCM of melanoma enhances COX-2 expression in macrophage and\nthe enhanced COX-2 expression may not be solely regulated by\nOPN present in melanoma but by other soluble factor (Figure 3a,\nupper and lower panels). To further examine the source of OPN\nthat regulates COX-2 expression, RAW264.7 cells were transiently\ntransfected with OPN siRNA and then supplemented with CM of\nB16F10 and level of COX-2 was analyzed. The data indicated that\nsilencing OPN in macrophages attenuate COX-2 expression upon\ninteraction with melanoma cells (Figure 3b, upper panel). To\nfurther confirm the specificity of OPN in COX-2 regulation,\nperitoneal macrophages (pMac, ^) were isolated from Opnþ /þ\n\nand Opn� /� mice and supplemented with CM of B16F10 cells.\nThe western blot analysis of COX-2 expression indicated that CM\nof melanoma induces COX-2 expression substantially higher in\nmacrophage isolated from Opnþ /þ mice as compared with\nOpn� /� , suggesting the role of macrophage-derived OPN in\nCOX-2 upregulation (Figure 3b, lower panel).\nWe next sought to determine whether exogenous OPN would\n\nbe sufficient to increase COX-2 expression in macrophages instead\nof melanoma CM. Accordingly, RAW264.7, pMac or IC21 cells were\nsubjected to exogenous OPN in a dose (0–1 mM) and time (0–24 h)-\ndependent manner. The results revealed that OPN induces COX-2\nexpression in macrophage cells, as did melanoma CM (Figure 3c,\nSupplementary Figure S3c, upper and lower panels). The OPN-\ninduced COX-2 expression in RAW264.7 and pMac was further\nconfirmed by immunofluorescence (Supplementary Figure S3d).\n\nTable 1.

The\ndata showed that OPN cDNA enhanced whereas OPN siRNA\nsuppressed COX-2 expression in these cells (Figure 3d, left panel).\nThe level of PGE2 from the CM of OPN-treated RAW264.7 was\ndetected by EIA and significant induction of PGE2 production by\nOPN was observed in these cells (Figure 3d, right panel). We have\nfurther demonstrated that OPN specifically induced COX-2\nexpression in macrophages but has no effect in melanoma or\nfibroblast cells (Supplementary Figure S3e, upper and lower\npanels).\nWe then examine the receptor involved in OPN-induced COX-2\n\nexpression in macrophage cells. The results revealed that OPN\ninduces COX-2 expression through a9b1 integrin but not via CD44\nand avb3 integrin in a RGD-independent manner (Figure 3e,\nupper panel, Supplementary Figures S4a and b). The a9 integrin\nand CD44 expression in siRNA-transfected cells were analyzed by\nwestern blot (Figure 3e, lower panel, Supplementary Figure S4b,\nright panel). To assess whether the melanoma microenvironment\nfacilitates the effect of OPN and its receptor, RAW264.7 cells were\n\nco-cultured with CM of B16F10 and the expression of a9 integrin\nwas detected by immunofluorescence. We found that there was\nincreased expression of a9 integrin (Supplementary Figure S4c).\n\nOPN-activated macrophages enhance endothelial cell migration\nand angiogenesis via COX-2 in ICAM-dependent manner\nTo explore the role of OPN-activated macrophages in angio-\ngenesis, we performed co-migration of endothelial cells with\nOPN-activated macrophages. The migrated cells were counted,\nanalyzed and represented in bar graph. The results indicated that\nOPN-activated macrophages stimulate whereas macrophages\npretreated with COX-2 inhibitors (NS-398 or Etoricoxib) reduced\nendothelial cell migration (Figure 4a, left and right panels).\nIncreased expression of ICAM either in tumor or endothelial\n\ncells correlates with tumor progression and angiogenesis.16,29 To\ninvestigate whether OPN-activated macrophages induce ICAM\nexpression and role of ICAM on endothelial cell migration and\nangiogenesis, we have performed co-culture and tube formation\nexperiments using RAW264.7 and human umbilical vein\nendothelial cell (HUVEC) cells. The results revealed that\n\nFigure 2. Co-culture and co-migration of macrophages (RAW264.7) with melanoma (B16F10 and A375) cells upregulate OPN and COX-2\nexpression.

To further examine whether PGE2 regulates ICAM\nexpression, we have treated HUVEC cells with PGE2 and level of\nICAM was examined. The results show that PGE2 enhances ICAM\nexpression (Figure 4b, lower panel). We further delineate the role\nof PGE2 regulated ICAM on HUVEC cell migration and the data\nindicated that blocking of ICAM significantly suppressed PGE2-\ninduced HUVEC migration (Figure 4c, Supplementary Figure S4d).\nThe tube formation results suggested that OPN-activated macro-\nphages enhanced and COX-2 inhibitors blocked angiogenic\nresponse in HUVEC cells demonstrating the role of OPN and\nCOX-2 in this process (Figure 4d, Supplementary Figure S4e). PGE2\nwas used as positive control.\n\nOPN-activated macrophages augment angiogenesis in\nchorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay\nEnhanced angiogenic response by OPN-activated macrophages\nwas further validated by CAM assay. The length and size of\nblood vessels were measured, analyzed and quantified by\n\nAngioquant software (Angioquant freeware;www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/\ncsb/angioquant). The results indicated that CM of OPN-activated\nmacrophages trigger the angiogenic activity as compared with\ncontrol, whereas CM of RAW264.7-treated with OPN along with\nCOX-2 inhibitor abolished this effect (Figures 5a–c). The data\nsuggested that OPN triggers the pro-angiogenic activity in\nmacrophages. VEGF is potent angiogenic molecule reportedly\ninvolved in various cancer progressions. Previously, we have\nreported that OPN-induced VEGF expression and VEGF-depen-\ndent angiogenesis in breast cancer model.15 Surprisingly, co-\nculture with RAW264.7 and B16F10 cells or vice-versa have no\neffect of VEGF expression (Supplementary Figure S5a, upper and\nlower panels). Furthermore, OPN has no direct effect on VEGF\nexpression either in B16F10 or RAW264.7 cells (Supplementary\nFigure S5b, upper and lower panels). Moreover, VEGF is not\ninvolved in OPN-induced COX-2 expression in RAW264.7 cells\n(Supplementary Figure S5c). We also examined whether OPN has\nany role in M2-specific receptor, CD206 expression. Accordingly,\nRAW264.7 cells were treated with OPN and the results indicate\nthat OPN does not induce CD206 expression in these cells\n(Figure 6a).\n\nFigure 3.

The\nresults indicated that OPN induces phosphorylation of ERK and\np38 in these cells (Figure 6b and Supplementary Figure S5d). To\ndecipher the signaling mechanism involved in OPN-induced COX-\n2 expression, cells were treated with inhibitors of ERK (PD98059),\np38 (SB203580), JNK (SP600125) and Akt (LY294002 and\nWortmannin) and the results revealed that OPN induces COX-2\nexpression through ERK and p38 but not by JNK- and Akt-\ndependent pathway (Supplementary Figure S5e). Furthermore,\nOPN-induced COX-2 expression was drastically inhibited by\ncombination of ERK and p38 inhibitor (Figure 6c, upper panel).\nThe data indicate that both ERK and p38 are involved in OPN-\n\ninduced COX-2 expression. Moreover, inhibitors of ERK, p38 and\nCOX-2 dramatically suppressed OPN-induced PGE2 production in\nRAW264.7 cells (Figure 6c, lower panel).\nTo delineate the role of AP-1 and its component in OPN-\n\ninduced COX-2 expression in macrophages, RAW264.7 cells were\ntreated with OPN and levels of c-Fos and c-Jun were detected by\nwestern blot. The results revealed that OPN enhances expression\nof c-Fos but not c-Jun (Figure 6d). The OPN-induced c-Fos nuclear\nlocalization was confirmed by immunofluorescence (Figure 6e).\nFurther we investigate the role of ERK and p38 in OPN-induced\nc-Fos expression and data showed that PD98059 or SB203580\nsuppressed OPN-induced c-Fos expression as shown by immuno-\nfluorescence (Figure 6f, left panel). To delineate the role of AP-1 in\nOPN-induced COX-2 expression, RAW264.7 cells were transfected\nwith Wt c-Jun, DN c-Jun or A-Fos cDNA and then treated with\nOPN.

The data indicate that ERK, p38 and COX-2 have\nsignificant role in OPN-induced MMP-9 expression in these cells\n(Figure 6g, left and right panels).

Human melanoma tissues were sectioned,\nstained with H&E and graded as malignant with the help of expert\nhistopathologist. Melanoma specimens were stained with anti-\nbodies against OPN, COX-2, CD31 and CD68 (marker of TAMs). The\ndata revealed that there was increased infiltration of macrophages\nin malignant melanoma as compared with peripheral normal\nspecimens (Figures 7B, c and d). Immunofluorescence double\nstaining confirmed the colocalization of OPN and COX-2 with\nCD68 and demonstrated that majority of TAMs express OPN and\nCOX-2 (Figures 7B and C, e and f). Expression of CD31 was also\nanalyzed by immunohistochemistry and the results showed\nincreased infiltration of OPN- and COX-2-positive macrophage\ncorrelates with enhanced angiogenesis in malignant tumor\n(Figures 7B, g and h). Moreover, OPN was overexpressed in\ninfiltrating macrophages (macrophages within tumor mass) of\nmalignant melanoma. Very few OPNþ TAMs were observed\n\nFigure 5.

Our study delineates the\nnovel mechanism where tumor-educated macrophages over-\nexpress OPN that not only favor macrophages infiltration but\nalso drives these cells toward an angiogenic phenotype that\nfacilitates melanoma growth. Further, we demonstrate that OPN\n\nvia a9 integrin activates p38 and ERK signaling pathways which\nultimately leads to COX-2 expression and PGE2 production. The\nOPN-activated macrophage promotes angiogenesis via PGE2 and\naugments MMP-9 expression. The clinical data suggested the\nincreased infiltration of OPN and COX-2-positive TAMs correlate\nwith enhanced tumor growth and angiogenesis. In summary, our\nresults highlight the crucial role of OPN-activated macrophage in\nmelanoma growth and further suggested that OPN-regulated\nsignaling in TAMs may provide novel therapeutic strategy for the\ntreatment of malignant melanoma.\nThe increased infiltration of TAMs in melanoma correlates with\n\nenhanced angiogenesis, which ultimately modulates tumor\ngrowth. Here, we have observed that melanoma growth was\n\nFigure 6. OPN induces ERK1/2- and p38-dependent AP-1-mediated COX-2 expression and COX-2-dependent MMP-9 expression in\nmacrophages.

All data are representation of three experiments exhibiting similar results.\n\nOPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma growth and angiogenesis\nS Kale et al\n\n2302\n\nOncogene (2014) 2295 – 2306 & 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited\n\n\n\ndrastically suppressed in Opn� /� mice as compared with Opnþ /þ .\nIn this study, we found that increased infiltration of OPN and COX-\n2-positive macrophages correlate with increased angiogenesis\nand melanoma growth. Bachmann et al.33 have shown that in\nmelanoma, tumor necrosis is closely associated with increased\ntumor thickness and angiogenesis. Leek et al.21 have\ndemonstrated that increased infiltration of TAMs in necrotic area\nof breast cancer correlate with angiogenesis and poor prognosis.\nHere, we observed enhanced tumor necrosis in melanoma tissue\nof Opnþ /þ mice. Moreover, our data also revealed that increased\ninfiltration of TAMs in melanoma correlate with necrosis and other\naggressive phenotype of tumor. Moreover, in clinical specimens,\nwe observed that infiltrating macrophages in necrotic area (hot-\nspot TAMs) exhibits high level of OPN expression which correlates\nwith enhanced angiogenesis. Taken together, the results suggest\nthat rapidly growing melanoma generates necrosis which in turn\nrecruits macrophages and these tumor-educated macrophages\ncontributes to angiogenesis.\nRole of tumor-derived OPN in various cancer progressions is\n\nwell documented but the function of macrophage-derived OPN\n\nis paradoxical as it participates in both tumorigenesis and\ntumoricidal activities.34–36 Recent reports indicate that Opn is one\nof the highly upregulated gene in TAMs in various cancer.37–40\n\nRecently, it has been reported that OPN is overexpressed in\nmacrophages upon co-culture with breast cancer cells.41\n\nFurthermore, Cheng et al.42 have reported that macrophage-\nderived OPN restore the metastatic potential of OPN-knockdown\ntumor cells. Here, we observed that OPN is overexpressed in\nmacrophages upon co-culture with melanoma cells. Moreover, we\nfound that expression of OPN and COX-2 in macrophages\nwas significantly higher as compared with tumor cells indicating\nthat TAMs may serve as major source of OPN and COX-2 in\ntumor microenvironment. In this study, we found that OPN\ninduces COX-2 expression via a9b1 integrin in RGD-independent\nmanner.\nTumor-educated macrophages regulate angiogenesis in tumor\n\nmicroenvironment by secreting a wide range of factors.43 Our\nresults indicated that OPN-activated RAW264.7 cells augment the\nsecretion of PGE2 which in turn induce endothelial cell migration\nand tube formation. Furthermore, CAM assay validate this finding.\n\nFigure 7. OPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma cell migration.

(D) Schematic representation of tumor-educated OPN-activated macrophages via a9 integrin regulates ERK- and\np38-dependent AP-1 activation leading to enhanced COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, which in turn upregulates melanoma growth\nand angiogenesis.\n\nOPN-activated macrophages induce melanoma growth and angiogenesis\nS Kale et al\n\n2303\n\n& 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene (2014) 2295 – 2306\n\n\n\nIn this study, the increased expression of COX-2,\nMMP-9 and elevated level of PGE2 revealed that OPN-activated\nmacrophages trigger the angiogenic phenotype of macrophages.\nRecently, Nakanishi et al.44 have shown that COX-2 inhibition\naltered TAMs phenotypes by redirecting TAMs toward M1\nphenotype. Moreover, Heusinkveld et al.45 have demonstrated\nthat tumor-derived PGE2 is responsible for differentiation of\nmonocytes to M2 macrophages. Enhanced COX-2 expression and\nPGE2 production in OPN-activated macrophages further support\nthe notion that increased expression of OPN in tumor-educated\nmacrophages redirects the TAMs towards M2 phenotype.\nPhenotypic hallmark of M2 macrophages is due to increased\nexpression of mannose receptor (CD206). We have checked the\neffect of OPN on CD206 and the result indicates that OPN has no\neffect on CD206 expression.\nIn this study, we have shown that soluble mediator derived\n\nfrom melanoma cells induces OPN and COX-2 expression thereby\npromoting macrophages migration. The further characterization of\nsoluble factor(s) secreted by tumor cells that induced OPN\nexpression in macrophage is in progress. Green et al.46 have\nshown that RAW264.7 macrophages promote the migration and\ninvasion of colon carcinoma cells. Here, we found that OPN\nactivates ERK and p38 pathway, which leads to COX-2-dependent\nPGE2 production and melanoma cell migration. TAMs express a\nwide array of angiogenesis modulating enzymes including\nMMP-9.30,31 TAMs-derived MMP-9 has been shown to be crucial\nfor angiogenesis in cervical carcinogenesis.32 Here, we found that\nOPN induces COX-2-dependent MMP-9 expression in\nmacrophages suggesting that OPN-activated macrophage has\ncrucial role in tumor angiogenesis.\nIn conclusion, we herein provide direct evidence that tumor-\n\neducated macrophages modulate melanoma microenvironment\nvia secretion of OPN, PGE2 and MMP-9, which effectively regulates\nmelanoma growth and angiogenesis. Our data indicate that\nmacrophage-derived OPN educates macrophages towards cancer\npromoting phenotype through upregulation of COX-2. These data\nsuggested that disrupting the communication between TAMs and\ncancer cells may redirect the macrophages function and blockade\nof OPN-regulated signaling may provide means of targeting tumor\ngrowth and angiogenesis (Figure 7D).\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell lines and transfections\nThe mouse macrophage (RAW264.7, IC21) and melanoma (B16F10), human\nmelanoma (A375) cells were obtained from American Type Culture\nCollection (Manassas, VA, USA).
