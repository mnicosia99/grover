To date, MTORC10s and PLK10s functions are mostly studied separately, and\nreports on their mutual crosstalk are scarce. Here, we identify PLK1 as a physical MTORC1 interactor in\nhuman cancer cells. PLK1 inhibition enhances MTORC1 activity under nutrient sufficiency and in starved\ncells, and PLK1 directly phosphorylates the MTORC1 component RPTOR/RAPTOR in vitro. PLK1 and\nMTORC1 reside together at lysosomes, the subcellular site where MTORC1 is active. Consistent with an\ninhibitory role of PLK1 toward MTORC1, PLK1 overexpression inhibits lysosomal association of the PLK1-\nMTORC1 complex, whereas PLK1 inhibition promotes lysosomal localization of MTOR. PLK1-MTORC1\nbinding is enhanced by amino acid starvation, a condition known to increase autophagy. MTORC1\ninhibition is an important step in autophagy activation. Consistently, PLK1 inhibition mitigates autophagy\nin cancer cells both under nutrient starvation and sufficiency, and a role of PLK1 in autophagy is also\nobserved in the invertebrate model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. In summary, PLK1 inhibits MTORC1\nand thereby positively contributes to autophagy. Since autophagy is increasingly recognized to contribute\nto tumor cell survival and growth, we propose that cautious monitoring of MTORC1 and autophagy\nreadouts in clinical trials with PLK1 inhibitors is needed to develop strategies for optimized (combinatorial)\ncancer therapies targeting MTORC1, PLK1, and autophagy.\n\nKEYWORDS\namino acid; BI2536; insulin;\ninterphase; lysosome; MTOR;\nMTORC1; PLK1; RPTOR;\nstarvation\n\nIntroduction\n\nPLK1 (polo like kinase 1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threo-\nnine protein kinase, which is widely recognized as an oncogene\nthat drives cellular proliferation by promoting mitosis and cytoki-\nnesis.1-3 The 5 polo like kinase (PLK) family members PLK1 to 5\nall contain a polo-box domain that regulates their kinase activity\nand subcellular localization.1-3 PLK1 is the best-described PLK\nprotein, and is frequently used as a tumor marker, as high PLK1\nexpression correlates with poor prognosis in cancer.4 PLK1 inhib-\nitors, such as BI2536, compete with adenosine triphosphate\n(ATP) for its binding to the catalytic domain of PLK1.5 Long-\n\nterm PLK1 inhibition arrests cells in prometaphase, and thus\nPLK1 inhibitors are investigated as antimitotic agents for cancer\ntreatment.1,6,7 MTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is\nanother serine/threonine protein kinase that promotes cellular\ngrowth and is also often targeted in cancer therapy.8,9 Although\nboth PLK12,3 and MTOR10 are conserved in invertebrates and\nmammals, little is known about their crosstalk andmutual regula-\ntion of common downstream processes, as well as the implica-\ntions thereof for cancer therapies.\n\nThe nutrient sensor MTOR is activated by metabolic stimuli,\nincluding amino acids, growth factors (e.g., insulin), and energy\n\nCONTACT Kathrin Thedieck k.thedieck@umcg.nl; kathrin.thedieck@uni-oldenburg.de Lab for Metabolic Signaling, European Medical School Oldenburg-Gro-\nningen; Department of Pediatrics, Systems Medicine of Metabolism & Signaling, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), Antonius Deusin-\nglaan 1, 9713 AV Groningen, The Netherlands; Department for Neuroscience, Faculty VI - School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Carl von Ossietzky University Oldenburg,\nCarl-von-Ossietzky Strasse 9-11, 26129 Oldenburg, Germany.\n\nColor versions of one or more of the figures in the article can be found online at www.tandfonline.com/kaup.\nSupplemental data for this article can be accessed on the publisher’s website.\n\n© 2017 Stefanie Ruf, Alexander Martin Heberle, Miriam Langelaar-Makkinje, Sara Gelino, Deepti Wilkinson, Carolin Gerbeth, Jennifer Jasmin Schwarz, Birgit Holzwarth, Bettina Warscheid, Chris\nMeisinger, Marcel A.

Consistently, MTORC1 is dysregulated in many\ncancer types,8 and several compounds for pharmacological\nMTORC1 inhibition are investigated as cancer therapeutics.8,9\n\nThe MTORC1-specific allosteric inhibitor rapamycin and its\nanalogs (rapalogs) are already approved for the treatment of\nseveral tumor entities.9 The more recently developed ATP-ana-\nlog MTOR inhibitors, such as Torin113 and its derivatives, are\ncurrently tested in clinical studies.9 They target both MTOR\ncomplexes, and also inhibit MTORC1 functions which are\ninsensitive to rapamycin.13 Amino acid- and growth factor-\ninduced signaling pathways converge at the lysosomes to syner-\ngistically activate MTORC1.11 MTORC1 activation by amino\nacids requires RAG GTPase-mediated MTORC1 translocation\nto lysosomes.11,14,15 Conversely, loss of lysosomal MTORC1\nassociation mediates MTORC1 inhibition upon amino acid\nwithdrawal.16 At the lysosome, MTORC1 encounters the small\nGTPase Ras homolog enriched in brain (RHEB),11,17 which\nactivates MTORC1 downstream of the INSR (insulin recep-\ntor)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT signaling axis.10,11,18\n\nRHEB is inhibited by the heteromeric TSC1-TSC2 (tuberous\nsclerosis 1 and 2) complex, which acts as a GTPase-activating\nprotein (GAP) on RHEB. MTORC1 phosphorylates several\nsubstrates19 that mediate its anabolic outcomes. Among them\nis RPS6KB (p70)/p70-S6K (ribosomal protein S6 kinase B\n70 kDa) which is phosphorylated at threonine 389 (T389) by\nMTORC1.10,18,20 In turn, RPS6KB (p70) activates protein syn-\nthesis by promoting expression of ribosomal components,21\n\nand by phosphorylating translation initiation factors and com-\nponents of the ribosomal machinery, including RPS6 (ribo-\nsomal protein S6).19 Little is known about PLK10s role in the\nMTORC1 pathway. Even though several studies correlate PLK1\ninhibition with either decreased22-25 or increased26 RPS6KB\n(p70) or RPS6 phosphorylation, a clear functional interaction\nbetween PLK1 and MTORC1 has so far not been reported.\nThus, it is unknown whether PLK1 regulates phosphorylation\nof MTORC1 substrates indirectly or directly, i.e., by physically\nacting on MTORC1.\n\nMTORC1 promotes cellular growth by inducing anabolic\nprocesses including protein synthesis, and by inhibiting cata-\nbolic processes.10,19 Conversely, MTORC1 inhibition dere-\npresses catabolic processes to promote cellular survival, e.g.,\nwhen nutrients are scarce.10 The best-described catabolic pro-\ncess inhibited by MTORC1 is autophagy, and this MTORC1\nfunction is conserved from yeast and invertebrates such as Cae-\nnorhabditis elegans27 (C. elegans) to mammals.28 Autophagy is\ntightly balanced to maintain cellular homeostasis and fuel cells\nwith nutrients and metabolite intermediates under nutrient suf-\nficiency and deprivation29 via degradation of proteins, lipids,\nand organelles in the lysosomes.28,30 Macroautophagy (from\nhere on referred to as autophagy) is to date the best-character-\nized type of autophagy.30 During autophagy, double-membrane\nvesicles called autophagosomes are formed which fuse with late\nendosomes or lysosomes to form autolysosomes, in which the\ndegradation of the sequestered material takes place.30,31 In the\n\ncontext of cancer, autophagy gains growing attention as auto-\nphagy contributes to the elimination of tumor cells, but also\npromotes tumor survival.32-34 Consequently, both autophagy\ninhibitors, such as chloroquine,35 and autophagy activators,\ne.g., proteasome and MTORC1 inhibitors,33,34 are currently\ninvestigated in clinical trials. Of note, ATP-analog MTOR\ninhibitors such as Torin1 enhance autophagy more effectively\nthan rapalogs, as ATP analogs block autophagy-inhibiting\nMTORC1 functions that are rapamycin resistant.13 Autophagy\nis also regulated by multiple MTORC1-independent cues.28 For\nexample, during mitosis autophagy is inhibited in an\nMTORC1-independent manner.36,37 Links of PLK1 with auto-\nphagy are poorly explored. PLK1 is known to localize to centro-\nsomes, kinetochores, and the mitotic spindle,2 and PLK1\nexpression is increased during mitosis.38 During this cell cycle\nphase PLK1 has been suggested to contribute to autophagy\ninhibition.39,40 As PLK1 research mostly focuses on mitotic\ncells, it is unknown whether PLK1 affects autophagy in inter-\nphase cells and which signaling networks might mediate such\neffects. Such knowledge would broaden the range of application\nof PLK1 inhibitors specifically to tumors that display low\nmitotic rates,41 and/or require autophagy for cellular growth\nand survival.42 It would also reveal potential effects of PLK1\ninhibitors on MTOR and autophagy networks that may be rele-\nvant for therapy outcome. Therefore, we analyzed in the pres-\nent study whether and what type of crosstalk exists between\nPLK1, MTORC1, and autophagy in nonmitotic cancer cells.\n\nWe describe here a novel nonmitotic function of PLK1. We\nidentify PLK1 as a physical interactor of MTORC1, whose scaffold\ncomponent RPTOR is a direct PLK1 substrate in vitro. We find\nthat PLK1 inhibition leads to hyperphosphorylation of the\nMTORC1 substrate RPS6KB (p70). PLK1 resides with MTORC1\nat lysosomes, a localization hitherto unknown for PLK1; and the\nPLK1-MTORC1 complex colocalizes with and physically binds\nLAMP2 (lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2). Consistent\nwith an inhibitory function of PLK1 towardMTORC1, overexpres-\nsion of active PLK1 detaches the PLK1-MTORC1 complex from\nthe lysosomes, and PLK1 inhibition increases MTOR localization\nat lysosomes. In keeping with this, PLK1 inhibition mitigates auto-\nphagy in both the invertebrate model organism C. elegans, and in\nmammalian cells, where autophagy is regulated in an MTORC1-\ndependent manner. In conclusion, PLK1 positively contributes to\nautophagy via inhibition of MTORC1 under nutrient sufficiency\nand starvation. Our findings highlight the importance of carefully\nmonitoring PLK1-, MTOR-, and autophagy- activities in clinical\nstudies, to identify leads for cancer therapy design.\n\nResults\n\nPLK1 physically interacts with MTOR and RPTOR\n\nWe have recently analyzed the MTOR interactome by quantita-\ntive proteomics.43 In this study,43 we purified endogenous\nMTOR kinase by immunoprecipitation (IP) from the cervical\ncancer cell line HeLa, and analyzed MTOR IPs versus mock\nIPs, conducted with a nonspecific control IgG. We reanalyzed\nthose data here, and found that PLK1 was specifically identified\nby tandem mass spectrometry in MTOR IPs for 2 out of 3 bio-\nlogical replicates (Schwarz et al, Table S443) with 6 peptides\n\nAUTOPHAGY 487\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

RUF ET AL.\n\n\n\nand a sequence coverage of 11% (Fig. S1A). Annotated MS1\nand fragment spectra for one of the PLK1 peptides are shown\nin Fig. S1B and S1C. Physical interaction of PLK1 with MTOR\nhas not been reported previously. To validate this finding, we\nperformed PLK1 and mock IPs and analyzed them by immuno-\nblotting (Fig. 1A, S1D). TSC2 and the MTORC2 component\nRICTOR (RPTOR-independent companion of MTOR complex\n2) were specifically detected in PLK1 IPs, serving as positive\ncontrols, as interaction of TSC2 and RICTOR with PLK1 has\nbeen shown earlier.23,44 Of note, we also specifically detected\nMTOR and the MTORC1 component RPTOR in the PLK1 IP,\nbut not in the mock IP (Fig. 1A). To test if RPTOR is required\nfor PLK1-MTORC1 binding, we immunoprecipitated PLK1\nfrom lysates of stably transduced HeLa cells with doxycycline-\ninducible expression constructs for short hairpin RNAs target-\ning RPTOR (shRPTOR),45 or harboring a nontargeting\nsequence (shControl). PLK1 bound MTOR to the same extent\nin shRPTOR or shControl knockdown cells (Fig. S1E, S1F), sug-\ngesting that PLK1 physically binds MTORC1 via MTOR.\n\nPLK1 inhibits MTORC1 in nonmitotic cells\n\nNext, we investigated whether PLK1 influences MTORC1 activ-\nity. We tested this first upon MTORC1 activation with amino\nacids and insulin. To inhibit PLK1, we treated HeLa cells for\n30 min with the ATP-competitive PLK1 inhibitor BI2536.5 We\ncombined the PLK1 inhibitor treatment with amino acid and\ninsulin stimulation, and analyzed phosphorylation of RPS6KB\n(p70) at T389 as a bona fide readout for MTORC1 activity. As\nexpected, immunoblotting showed that amino acid and insulin\nstimulation increased RPS6KB (p70) T389 phosphorylation, con-\nsistent with MTORC1 activation (Fig. 1B, first vs third lane).\nTreatment with the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 further enhanced\nRPS6KB (p70) T389 phosphorylation significantly (Fig. 1B, third\nvs fourth lane; 1C). Thus, PLK1 inhibition leads to RPS6KB (p70)\nhyperphosphorylation at T389 upon stimulation with amino\nacids and insulin, suggesting that PLK1 inhibits MTORC1.\n\nTo confirm this result by another mode of PLK1 inhibition\nand to control for possible off-target effects of the PLK1 inhibi-\ntor BI2536, we next inhibited PLK1 by RNA interference\n(RNAi). To this end, we stably transduced HeLa cells with\ndoxycycline-inducible expression constructs for shRNAs tar-\ngeting PLK1 (shPLK1), or a nontargeting sequence (shControl).\nKnockdown was induced by doxycycline treatment for 2 d. Sur-\nprisingly, we observed no change in RPS6KB (p70) T389 phos-\nphorylation in shPLK1 as compared with shControl cells\n(Fig. 1D, E). This seemed contradictory to the increase in\nRPS6KB (p70) phosphorylation at T389 that we observed upon\nBI2536 treatment (Fig. 1B, C).\n\nA main difference between BI2536- versus shPLK1-treated\ncells was that the treatment with the inhibitor was done for a\nbrief interval (i.e., 30 min), whereas shPLK1 treatment was per-\nformed for 2 d, which was required to achieve efficient PLK1\nknockdown. During these 2 d, we observed an increasing\namount of rounded and detached cells, probably due to elevated\nnumbers of mitotic cells, as long-term PLK1 inhibition leads to\nmitotic arrest.46,47 We thus hypothesized that the difference in\nRPS6KB (p70) T389 phosphorylation in shPLK1- versus\nBI2536-treated cells could result from a larger fraction of\n\nmitotic cells in shPLK1 cultures, or from differing (off-target)\neffects during shPLK1 or BI2536 treatment. To test the first\npossibility directly, we analyzed if mitotic markers were\nincreased in shPLK1- and/or BI2536-treated cells. In shPLK1-\ntreated cells, we observed increased phosphorylation of the\nmitotic marker H3F3/histone H3 (H3 histone family member\n3) at serine 10 (S10), and decreased levels of the G1/S phase\nmarker CCNE1 (cyclin E1), indicative of an increased mitotic\ncell fraction in shPLK1 cultures (Fig. 1D). In contrast, short-\nterm treatment with the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 did not lead to\nan apparent increase in H3F3 S10 phosphorylation (Fig. S2A).\nAs a positive control, the H3F3 phospho-(S10) antibody was in\nparallel used to detect a cell lysate of mitotic cells (Fig. S2A),\nand showed a strong signal. In agreement with earlier stud-\nies,3,46,47 long-term overnight BI2536 treatment enhanced H3F3\nphosphorylation at S10 (Fig. S2B). Thus, we conclude that\nshort-term BI2536 treatment failed to cause a detectable shift in\ncell cycle distribution, whereas long-term shPLK1 induction\ndid. This may be the reason for the observed differences in\nMTORC1 signaling between these 2 experimental setups.\n\nTo further test this, we aimed to separate effects directly\nmediated by PLK1 from its indirect, mitotic arrest-related\neffects. For this purpose, we first analyzed RPS6KB (p70) phos-\nphorylation in mitotic versus asynchronous cell cultures, with\nor without MTORC1 inhibition by shRPTOR (Fig. 1F). We\narrested cells in prometaphase by nocodazole treatment, fol-\nlowed by a mitotic shake-off to enrich for mitotic cells. Immu-\nnoblot analysis showed that PLK1 levels were increased in\nnocodazole plus shake-off-treated cells, indicative of a mitotic\narrest.38 Phosphorylation of the p70 isoform RPS6KB (p70) at\nT389 was observed in asynchronous cells, but not in cells with\nmitotic arrest, indicating that MTORC1 is inactive in mitotic\ncells (Fig. 1F). Interestingly, phosphorylation of the p85 iso-\nform RPS6KB (p85) at T41248 [RPS6KB (p85) phospho-\n(T412), which is detected by the same antibody as RPS6KB\n(p70) phospho-(T389) and thus appears at a higher molecular\nweight in the same blot] was enhanced in mitotically arrested\ncells compared with nonarrested cells (Fig. 1F, first vs. second\nlane). This induction of phospho-RPS6KB (p85) at T412 possi-\nbly explains earlier reports on MTORC1 activation in mitosis.49\n\nIn contrast, T412 phosphorylation of RPS6KB (p85) in nocoda-\nzole-arrested cells was not inhibited by shRNA-mediated\nknockdown of the MTORC1 component RPTOR (Fig. 1F,\nfourth vs second lane), indicating that a kinase other than\nMTOR as member of MTORC1 mediates this event. In con-\ntrast, shRPTOR did reduce the signal for phospho-RPS6KB\n(p70) at T389 in asynchronous cells (Fig. 1F, first vs third lane).\nThus, the absence of phospho-RPS6KB (p70) signal at T389 in\nprometaphase-arrested cells suggests that MTORC1 is inhibited\nin mitosis (Fig. 1F, second and fourth lane), which is in line\nwith previous findings.50 This supports our hypothesis that an\nincrease in the amount of mitotic cells in a culture, as observed\nafter PLK1 knockdown, may mask MTORC1 activation in the\nnonmitotic cell fraction in the same culture.\n\nTo test this, we combined PLK1 knockdown with removal of\nmitotic cells by shake-off. The removal of the mitotic cells was effi-\ncient, as evidenced by the decline in H3F3 S10 phosphorylation in\ncultures after shake-off, compared with those without shake-off\n(Fig. S2C, fourth vs. third lane). In the nonmitotic cells that\n\nAUTOPHAGY 489\n\n\n\nremained in the culture after shake-off, PLK1 knockdown did sig-\nnificantly increase RPS6KB (p70) phosphorylation at T389 in\nresponse to amino acid and insulin stimulation (Fig. 1G, H) to a\nsimilar extent as BI2536 (Fig. 1B, C). Thus, both BI2536 and\nshPLK1 treatments in nonmitotic cells yielded qualitatively and\nquantitatively similar results, namely RPS6KB (p70) phospho-\n(T389) induction. This suggests that PLK1 acts to inhibit\nMTORC1 in nonmitotic cells. To test whether enhanced RPS6KB\n(p70) phospho-(T389) in PLK1-inhibited cells is consistent with\nMTORC1 activation, we combined PLK1 inhibition by BI2536\nwith MTOR inhibition by Torin1.13 Torin1 reduced RPS6KB\n(p70) T389 phosphorylation both in control and BI2536-treated\ncells (Fig. 1I, J), consistent with the notion that increased RPS6KB\n(p70) phosphorylation at T389 in PLK1-inhibited cells is mediated\nbyMTOR.\n\nTaken together, RPS6KB (p70) was hyperphosphorylated at\nT389 when PLK1 was blocked pharmacologically or through\nshRNA in nonmitotic cells. This suggests that PLK1 inhibits\nMTORC1 and limits the extent of RPS6KB (p70) T389 phosphory-\nlation in response to nutrients and insulin in interphase cells.\n\nPLK1 phosphorylates the MTORC1 component\nRPTOR in vitro\n\nWe found that PLK1 physically interacts with MTOR and its\nspecific binding partner RPTOR (Fig. 1A), and that PLK1 inhi-\nbition activates MTORC1 in amino acid- and insulin-stimu-\nlated cells (Fig. 1B, G). Therefore, we next tested whether\nMTORC1 can function as a direct PLK1 substrate in vitro. The\nMTORC1 component RPTOR acts as a scaffold for the binding\nof MTORC1’s substrates10 and is required for MTORC1 activ-\nity.51,52 RPTOR is targeted by several kinases that signal to\nMTORC1,10 for example, AMPK (AMP-activated protein\nkinase)10 and RPS6KA1/RSK (ribosomal protein S6 kinase\nA1).53 To test whether PLK1 is also capable of phosphorylating\nRPTOR, we overexpressed and immunopurified HA-tagged\nRPTOR from HeLa cells and used it as a substrate for in vitro\nkinase assays with recombinant PLK1 and 33P-labeled ATP\n(Fig. 1K). We detected incorporation of 33P at the molecular\nweight of HA-RPTOR, and this signal was reduced by the\nPLK1 inhibitor BI2536 (Fig. 1K, L). Thus, the observed HA-\nRPTOR phosphorylation was PLK1-specific. The MTOR inhib-\nitor Torin1 did not significantly reduce the radioactive HA-\nRPTOR signal (Fig. 1K, L), suggesting that MTOR background\nactivity does not contribute to the signal. As a negative control\nwe omitted either PLK1 or HA-RPTOR from the in vitro kinase\nreaction. In both cases, no radioactive signal was detected at the\nmolecular weight of HA-RPTOR (Fig. 1K, first and third lane),\nshowing that the signal is RPTOR specific and requires the\npresence of PLK1. Thus, we conclude that PLK1 can directly\nphosphorylate RPTOR in vitro.\n\nPLK1 resides with MTORC1 at lysosomes, and active PLK1\ndecreases lysosomal association of the PLK1-MTORC1\ncomplex\n\nSince PLK1 binds and can directly phosphorylate MTORC1, at\nleast in vitro, we next asked in which common subcellular\n\ncompartment they reside. In line with its function as a mitotic\nregulator, PLK1 localizes to multiple mitosis-specific structures,\nincluding centrosomes, kinetochores, and the spindle mid-\nzone,2,3 but also to the Golgi.54 Lysosomal localization is well\ndescribed to be required for MTORC1 activation by amino\nacids and insulin,14,15 although MTOR localizes also to various\nother compartments.17,55,56 Localization of PLK1 to the lyso-\nsome has to the best of our knowledge so far not been reported.\nTo test whether in nonmitotic cells PLK1 resides with\nMTORC1 at lysosomes, we first analyzed the localization of\nPLK1, MTOR and the lysosomal marker LAMP2 by immuno-\nfluorescence (IF) in unsynchronized HeLa cells (Fig. 2A, B).\nConsistent with MTOR’s known localization at lysosomes,14\n\nthere was a strong overlap of MTOR and LAMP2 staining\n(Fig. 2A). In addition, PLK1 and MTOR colocalized with each\nother in a lysosomal pattern (Fig. 2B), suggesting that they\nreside together at a common subcellular site. We tested the\nspecificity of the PLK1 antibody in mitotic metaphase and ana-\nphase cells, where it detected PLK1 at the mitotic spindle, as\nreported57 (Fig. 2C). It was not experimentally possible to per-\nform PLK1 and LAMP2 costaining as the antibodies against\nboth PLK1 and LAMP2 were raised in mice and antibodies\nsuitable for IF from other species were not available. To further\ntest whether PLK1 localizes to lysosomes, we used sucrose gra-\ndients to fractionate cell lysates from unsynchronized HeLa cell\ncultures. The mitotic marker H3F3 phospho-(S10) was unde-\ntectable in these cultures, as compared with lysates from mitoti-\ncally arrested HeLa cells (Fig. 2D), suggesting that mitotic cells\nin the unsynchronized cultures were below the detection\nthreshold. As expected, distribution of endogenous PLK1 par-\ntially overlapped with fractions that contained the nuclear\nmarkers LMNA (lamin A/C) and H3F3. However, much stron-\nger signals for PLK1 were found in fractions that were positive\nfor the lysosomal marker LAMP2, MTOR, and RPTOR\n(Fig. 2E, F). Thus, PLK1 coresided with MTOR and RPTOR in\nthe lysosomal fractions, suggesting that PLK1 may bind to lyso-\nsomes. To test whether PLK1 indeed physically interacts with\nlysosomal components, we analyzed PLK1 IPs with a LAMP2\nantibody. Indeed, the lysosomal marker LAMP2 and the\nMTORC1 component RPTOR (positive control, see also\nFig. 1A) were specifically detected in PLK1 IPs, but not in\nmock IPs (Fig. 2G), suggesting that PLK1 resides together with\nMTORC1 at lysosomes.\n\nAs our previous data (Fig. 1B, C, G to J) suggested that PLK1\ninhibits MTORC1, and lysosomal relocalization is an important\nmode of MTORC1 regulation,14-16,58 we next tested whether\nPLK1 induction alters LAMP2-association of the PLK1-\nMTORC1 complex. To this end, we transfected cells with\nMYC-tagged, wild-type PLK1 [MYC-PLK1 (WT)]38 or an\nempty-control vector, performed PLK1 IPs, and detected\nLAMP2, MTOR and RPTOR by immunoblotting (Fig. 2H).\nMYC-PLK1 (WT) overexpression did not alter the endogenous\nMTOR, RPTOR, or LAMP2 levels in the lysates. Of note,\nMYC-PLK1 (WT) overexpression strongly enhanced MTOR\nand RPTOR signals in PLK1 IPs, whereas the LAMP2 signal\nwas strongly decreased (Fig. 2H). As endogenous MTOR and\nRPTOR levels were unaltered in the lysates (Fig. 2H), our data\nsuggest that there is an increase in the amount of PLK1-\nMTORC1 complexes upon MYC-PLK1 (WT) expression, and\n\n490 S. RUF ET AL.\n\n\n\nthese complexes do not physically bind the lysosomal marker\nLAMP2. Thus, our data are consistent with a model in which\nactive PLK1 dissociates MTORC1 from lysosomes. To test\nwhether its kinase activity is required for overexpressed PLK1\nto detach MTORC1 from LAMP2, we transfected cells either\nwith MYC-PLK1 (WT), or with a dominant-negative lysine 82\nto arginine mutated PLK1 variant (MYC-PLK1K82R),59 and per-\nformed PLK1 IPs (Fig. 2I). Endogenous MTOR, RPTOR, and\n\nLAMP2 levels were similar in lysates from MYC-PLK1 (WT)\nor MYC-PLK1K82R transfected cells. In PLK1 IPs, the amounts\nof coimmunoprecipitated MTOR and RPTOR were similar for\noverexpression of MYC-PLK1 (WT) or dominant-negative\nMYC-PLK1K82R. In contrast, LAMP2 signals were stronger in\nPLK1 IPs from cells overexpressing dominant negative MYC-\nPLK1K82R, as compared with MYC-PLK1 (WT)(Fig. 2I). This\nsuggests that inactive MYC-PLK1K82R binds MTORC1 and the\n\nFigure 2. (For figure legend, see next page.)\n\nAUTOPHAGY 491\n\n\n\nlysosomal protein LAMP2. Active MYC-PLK1 (WT) loses\nLAMP2 association while it binds MTORC1 with the same effi-\nciency as inactive MYC-PLK1K82R (Fig. 2I). In summary, these\ndata are consistent with the notion that PLK1 binds MTORC1\nat lysosomes, and that active PLK1 dissociates the PLK1-\nMTORC1 complex from the lysosomes, thereby mediating\nMTORC1 inhibition. If this was the case, a decrease in\nMTORC1 activity would be expected following overexpression\nof wild type PLK1 as compared with inactive PLK1. To test\nthis, we analyzed RPS6KB (p70) T389 phosphorylation in\nstarved or amino acid- and insulin-stimulated cells that were\ntransfected with MYC-PLK1 (WT) or inactive MYC-PLK1K82R\n\n(Fig. 2J). Consistent with an inhibitory function of active PLK1\ntoward MTORC1, RPS6KB (p70) phospho-(T389) induction\nby amino acids plus insulin was lower in MYC-PLK1 (WT)-\ntransfected cells compared with MYC-PLK1K82R transfected\ncells. Thus, we conclude that active MYC-PLK1 (WT) reduces\nlysosomal association of the PLK1-MTORC1 complex, which\ncorrelates with decreased RPS6KB (p70) T389 phosphorylation.\nThis indicates that decreased lysosomal association contributes\nto MTORC1 inhibition by PLK1.\n\nPLK1 inhibition reduces autophagy in an MTORC1-\ndependent manner in interphase cells\n\nAs amino acid starvation is a condition that inhibits MTORC1\nand increases autophagy, we used this condition to test if PLK1\ninhibition activates MTORC1 and thereby inhibits autophagy.\nWe first analyzed whether PLK1 contributes to MTORC1 inhi-\nbition upon amino acid starvation. To this end, HeLa cells were\nstarved for amino acids, with or without PLK1 inhibition by\nshort-term (30 min) BI2536 treatment. The cells were har-\nvested at 5 to 30 min after onset of amino acid starvation\n(Fig. 3A). Consistent with MTORC1 inhibition, RPS6KB (p70)\nphospho-(T389) declined over time and was fully inhibited at\n30 min after onset of amino acid starvation. Notably, RPS6KB\n(p70) T389 phosphorylation remained higher when PLK1 was\ninhibited by BI2536, as compared with the control cells\n(Fig. 3A, B). As the inhibitory effect of PLK1 toward MTORC1\nis restricted to interphase cells, we analyzed phosphorylation of\nthe mitotic marker H3F3 at S10 in amino acid-starved and\nBI2536-treated cells (Fig. S2A). H3F3 phosphorylation was\n\nhigh in mitotic control cells but not detectable in amino acid-\nstarved and BI2536-treated cells, suggesting that these cultures\nwere nonsynchronized. Thus, PLK1 inhibition led to RPS6KB\n(p70) T389 hyperphosphorylation in amino acid-starved inter-\nphase cells. This suggests that PLK1 restricts MTORC1 activity\nnot only upon amino acid and insulin stimulation (Fig. 1B),\nbut also contributes to MTORC1 inhibition in response to\namino acid starvation (Fig. 3A, B).\n\nAs our data suggested that PLK1 inhibits MTORC1 by\nreducing its lysosomal binding (Fig. 2H, I), we next tested if\nPLK1 inhibition altered MTOR colocalization with the lyso-\nsomal marker LAMP2 in amino acid-starved cells. Indeed, IF\nanalysis showed that PLK1 inhibition by BI2536 significantly\nincreased MTOR and LAMP2 colocalization (Fig. 3C) as tested\nby the Pearson correlation coefficient (r MTOR and LAMP2, control\nD 0.33, SEM D 0.02; r MTOR and LAMP2, BI2536 D 0.47, SEM D\n0.04; P MTOR and LAMP2, control, BI2536 D 0.006. A nonparametric\n2-tailed Student t test was applied.) (Fig. 3D). Localization of\nRRAGC/RAGC (Ras related GTP binding C), a known media-\ntor of lysosomal MTOR localization,14 was not altered by\nBI2536 treatment (Fig. 3E,F; r RRAGC and LAMP2, control D 0.53,\nSEM D 0.06; r RRAGC and LAMP2, BI2536 D 0.49, SEM D 0.04; P\nRRAGC and LAMP2, control, BI2536 D 0.72). This is in agreement with\nearlier reports that RRAGC localization remains unaltered\nupon changes in extracellular amino acid concentrations.14\n\nThus, PLK1 inhibition aberrantly enhanced MTOR colocaliza-\ntion with LAMP2 in amino acid-starved cells, suggesting that\nPLK1 inhibits MTORC1 by decreasing its association with\nRRAGC-positive lysosomes.\n\nAs our earlier data indicated that MYC-PLK1 (WT) overex-\npression inhibits MTORC1 (Fig. 2I to J), and the extent of\ninteraction between them may contribute to PLK1-mediated\nMTORC1 inhibition, we next tested whether endogenous\nPLK1-MTORC1 binding was altered by amino acid starvation.\nTherefore, we performed PLK1 IPs from amino acid-starved or\nfull medium-cultivated cells. We found that the signals for both\nMTOR (Fig. 3G, H) and RPTOR (Fig. 3I, J) were increased in\nPLK1 IPs from amino acid-starved cells. We consistently\nimmunoprecipitated less PLK1 from amino acid-starved cells,\nwhich led to a decrease in PLK1 signals (Fig. 3G, I). Neverthe-\nless, the signals for coimmunoprecipitated MTOR and RPTOR\nwere stronger for PLK1 IPs from amino acid-starved cells as\n\nFigure 2.

RUF ET AL.\n\n\n\ncompared with full medium-cultivated cells (Fig. 3G, I), indi-\ncating an increase in PLK1-MTOR and -RPTOR binding under\namino acid starvation. To quantify the relative amount of\nRPTOR or MTOR bound to PLK1 in nonstarved versus amino\nacid-starved cells, we normalized the RPTOR and MTOR sig-\nnals to the PLK1 levels in each respective IP. We found that\nphysical PLK1 interaction with RPTOR and MTOR\n\nsignificantly increased upon amino acid withdrawal (Fig. 3H,\nJ). We conclude that increased MTORC1-PLK1 binding occurs\nwhen MTORC1 is inhibited by amino acid starvation. This is\nconsistent with our earlier finding that overexpression of active\nPLK1 led to increased PLK1-MTORC1 binding and reduced\nlysosomal association of the PLK1-MTORC1 complex, corre-\nlating with reduced MTORC1 activity (Fig. 2H to J). As amino\n\nFigure 3. (For figure legend, see next page.)\n\nAUTOPHAGY 493\n\n\n\nacid deprivation inhibits MTORC1, we tested if MTOR inhibi-\ntion by Torin1 could phenocopy the observed increase in\nPLK1-MTOR binding in amino acid-starved cells (Fig. 4A, B).\nTherefore, we performed MTOR IPs from HeLa cells cultivated\nin full medium and treated for 30 min with Torin1 or carrier\n(Fig. 4A, B). Torin1 inhibited RPS6KB (p70) T389 phosphory-\nlation but did not alter PLK1-MTOR binding, suggesting that\nMTORC1 kinase activity does not control its own binding to\nPLK1. Next we tested if PLK1 activity affected the induction of\nPLK1-MTOR binding by amino acid starvation. Therefore, we\nperformed PLK1 IPs from HeLa cells that were treated with the\nPLK1 inhibitor BI2536 or carrier, and starved for amino acids\nor cultivated in full medium. Amino acid withdrawal enhanced\nendogenous PLK1-MTOR binding 4-fold to the same extent in\nthe presence or absence of BI2536 (Fig. 4C, D), suggesting that\nPLK1 kinase activity does not mediate enhanced PLK1-MTOR\nbinding upon amino acid deprivation. Thus, amino acid depri-\nvation may represent an input that is separate from MTORC1\nand PLK1, as inhibition of MTOR or PLK1 did not alter\nincreased PLK1-MTOR binding in amino acid-starved cells. Of\nnote, we observed that acute amino acid starvation not only sig-\nnificantly enhanced PLK1-MTOR binding (Fig. 4E, F) but also\ncytoplasmic colocalization of PLK1 and MTOR (Fig. 4G, H).\nThis suggests that enhanced PLK1-MTOR association in amino\nacid-deprived cells may contribute to MTORC1 inhibition, via\nPLK1-mediated MTORC1 localization away from lysosomes.\n\nAs MTORC1 inhibition derepresses autophagy,10 we next\ntested if PLK1 via MTORC1 inhibition enhances autophagy.\nTo this end, we inhibited PLK1 by BI2536 in amino acid-\nstarved and control cells and detected MAP1LC3A/LC3\n(microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 a)35 which is a\nwidely used autophagy marker.35,60 Unprocessed LC3 (LC3-I)\nis soluble and resides in the cytoplasm. Upon autophagy induc-\ntion, LC3-I is processed at its C terminus and conjugated to\nphoshatidylethanolamine (referred to as LC3-II). LC3-II associ-\nates with autophagosomal inner and outer membranes,60 and\nbecomes degraded upon fusion with lysosomes.28,30 Yet, dual\nprocessing of LC3 renders the interpretation of LC3-II signals\nchallenging.35 On the one hand, LC3 is lipidated and integrated\ninto the phagophore membrane (the precursor to the autopha-\ngosome), leading to an increase in LC3-II signal in\n\nimmunoblots. On the other hand, LC3-II is degraded by lyso-\nsomal proteases upon autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion,\ndecreasing the LC3-II signal. Thus, LC3-II degradation can\nmask the increase in LC3-II upon autophagy induction. To pre-\nvent LC3-II degradation and enable detection of LC3-II accu-\nmulation, we supplemented all media for autophagy assays\nwith the v-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 (BafA). BafA\ninhibits autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion, a late step in the\nautophagy process. Thus, LC3-II can still be integrated into the\nphagophore membrane, but it is no longer degraded by lyso-\nsomal proteases, and LC3-II accumulation can be reliably\ndetected. In keeping with this, BafA strongly induced LC3-II\nlevels in HeLa cells (Fig. S2D).\n\nUpon amino acid starvation for 30 min, we observed that\nPLK1 inhibition by BI2536 caused a significant decrease in\nLC3-II levels (Fig. 5A, B), indicating that PLK1 plays a positive\nrole in autophagy. Next, we tested whether LC3-II reduction by\nPLK1 inhibition required MTOR activity. To this end, we com-\nbined PLK1 inhibition by BI2536 with MTOR inhibition by\nTorin1, and starved cells for amino acids (Fig. 5C, D). Whereas\nPLK1 inhibition by BI2536 significantly reduced LC3-II levels,\nBI2536 had no significant effect on LC3-II levels when com-\nbined with the MTOR inhibitor Torin1 (Fig. 5C, D). We also\nanalyzed LC3-II levels in shControl and shPLK1 knockdown\ncells, without and with Torin1 treatment. In these experiments,\nmitotic cells were removed by shake off. PLK1 knockdown sig-\nnificantly reduced LC3-II, and this effect was suppressed by\nTorin1 treatment (Fig. 5E, F). Thus, LC3-II reduction by PLK1\ninhibition or knockdown required MTOR activity, suggesting\nthat PLK1 positively contributes to autophagy by inhibiting\nMTORC1.\n\nTo further validate a role for PLK1 in autophagy regulation, we\nused a tandem mRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter,35,60,61 which is a stan-\ndard tool to monitor the status of the autophagy process. GFP\n(green fluorescent protein) displays higher sensitivity to low pH\nthan mRFP61 (monomeric red fluorescent protein). Therefore,\nthe tandemmRFP-GFP-LC3 reporter allows tracking of acidifica-\ntion of autolysosomes by providing a readout for autophagosome\nand autolysosome numbers.35,60,61 HeLa cells were transiently\ntransfected with the reporter construct in combination with PLK1\nor control siRNA knockdown, and subjected to full-medium\n\nFigure 3.

As expected, starvation increased the percentage of\nautolysosomes consistent with enhanced autophagy. PLK1\nknockdown reduced the percentage of autolysosomes under full\nmedium conditions and upon amino acid starvation (Fig. 6B).\nThis is in agreement with the decline in LC3-II levels upon PLK1\ninhibition detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A to F).\n\nWe further consolidated this finding by analyzing the auto-\nphagy substrate SQSTM1/p62 (sequestosome 1). SQSTM1 is\nrecruited by LC3 into autophagosomes, and thus SQSTM1\npunctate structures represent LC3-positive autophagosome-\nassociating SQSTM1. When autophagy is blocked, SQSTM1\nfoci accumulate due to inefficient autophagosome turnover.35\n\nWe detected SQSTM1 foci by IF in amino acid-starved cells\n\nthat were treated with the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 or carrier\n(Fig. 6C, D). In agreement with the reduced LC3-II levels\n(Fig. 5A to F) and decreased percentage of autolysosomes\n(Fig. 6B), we found that SQSTM1 foci numbers were signifi-\ncantly increased in PLK1 inhibited cells, compared with the\ncontrol cells, thus providing further evidence that PLK1 is a\npositive regulator of autophagy.\n\nThe autophagy analyses reported above were performed in\ninterphase cells. However, we could not rule out that PLK1\nmay regulate autophagy in mitotic cells as well. To test this,\nwe analyzed LC3-II during mitosis. We arrested cells in\nmitosis by a consecutive aphidicolin-nocodazole block,\nreleased them for different times as indicated (Fig. S2E), and\ndetected cell cycle markers and LC3-II by immunoblotting.\nConsistent with an increased amount of mitotic cells in the\nculture, we observed increased phosphorylation of H3F3 at\n\nFigure 5.

RUF ET AL.\n\n\n\nserine 10 and decreased levels of the G1/S phase marker\nCCNE1. Autophagy, as monitored by LC3-II levels, was low\nin mitotic cells as compared with control cells from an asyn-\nchronous culture (Fig. S2E), which is consistent with previ-\nous reports.36,37 Thus, we conclude that mitotic cells display\n\nlow autophagy, suggesting that PLK1 may promote auto-\nphagy primarily in nonmitotic cells. This is also in agree-\nment with our finding that autophagic control by PLK1\ndepends on MTOR activity (Fig. 5C to F), which is inhibited\nduring mitosis (Fig. 1F).\n\nFigure 6. (For figure legend, see next page.)\n\nAUTOPHAGY 497\n\n\n\nWe next aimed to determine whether PLK1s role in autophagy\nin nonmitotic cells is conserved from invertebrates to mammals.\nFor this purpose, we used the genetic model organism C. elegans.\nWe analyzed the role of plk-1, the C. elegans PLK1 ortholog, in\ndauer larvae, a developmentally arrested stage of C. elegans in\nwhich the animals display cell cycle quiescence and therefore con-\nsist of nonmitotic cells. Dauer entry and G1 cell cycle arrest in\nC. elegans larvae occur in response to environmental stresses,\nincluding starvation.63 Specifically, we used animals carrying a\nthermosensitive, mutant allele for the INSR-IGF1R homolog\nDAF-2, daf-2(e1370), and stably expressing the transgene\nGFP::LGG-164 (orthologous to mammalian LC3; scheme of the\nexperimental setup provided in Fig. S2F). daf-2(e1370) mutants\nenter the dauer stage upon shift to the restrictive temperature\n(25�C), during which markers of autophagy are increased.65\n\nMoreover, RNAi knockdown of genes involved in the autophagic\nprocess changes the subcellular localization of GFP::LGG-1 in\nhypodermal cells of daf-2(e1370) mutants, while causing an\nenhanced GFP::LGG-1 signal in these cells.65 Consistent with\nthese observations, we found a 3-fold increase in GFP::LGG-1\nintensity in the body of daf-2(e1370) dauers subjected to RNAi-\nmediated inhibition of the autophagy WIPI protein atg-18,66\n\ncompared with control RNAi (Fig. 6E, F). This indicates that inhi-\nbition of autophagy causes increased GFP::LGG-1 levels in daf-2\ndauer larvae. When we quantified GFP::LGG-1 intensity in daf-2\ndauers subjected to plk-1 RNAi, we observed that inhibition of\nplk-1, like inhibition of atg-18, significantly increased GFP::LGG-\n1 levels compared with dauers subjected to control RNAi (Fig. 6E,\nF). Thus, plk-1 RNAi, similar to inhibition of PLK1 in mamma-\nlian cells, appeared to cause a block of autophagy, suggesting that\nPLK1/PLK-1 is a conserved regulator of autophagy. As C. elegans\ndauer larvae consist of G1/S interphase cells,\n\n63 our data further\nsuggest that, similarly to mammalian cells, C. elegans PLK-1 posi-\ntively regulates autophagy in nonmitotic cells.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present study, we show that PLK1 physically binds and\nphosphorylates MTORC1. In interphase cells, inhibition of\nPLK1 increases MTORC1 activity, as measured by RPS6KB\n(p70) phosphorylation at T389. Consistently, MTORC10s lyso-\nsomal association (Fig. 2I) and activity (Fig. 2J) are decreased\nin cells overexpressing active PLK1, as compared with the inac-\ntive protein. In line with this, PLK1 inhibition mitigates auto-\nphagy in an MTOR-dependent manner (Fig. 5C to F). Positive\nregulation of autophagy by PLK1/PLK-1 occurs in C. elegans\n\nand mammalian cells, suggesting that this PLK1 function is\nevolutionary conserved.\n\nPLK1 is mainly perceived as a regulator of mitotic progres-\nsion.2,3 Here we describe a novel function of PLK1 in inter-\nphase cells where it inhibits MTORC1 and activates autophagy\nunder nutrient sufficiency and amino acid deprivation. Our\ndata suggest that the functions of PLK1 in mitotic and inter-\nphase cells are mediated by distinct mechanisms since (i) PLK1\ninhibition increases MTORC1 activity in interphase cells\n(Fig. 1G, H) but not in mitotic cells (Fig. 1D, E); (ii) PLK1 inhi-\nbition reduces autophagy in interphase cells (Figs. 5 and 6). In\ncontrast, mitotic cells display high PLK1 levels46,47 (Fig. 1F) but\nlow autophagy (Fig. S2E), suggesting that PLK1 promotes auto-\nphagy primarily in nonmitotic cells; (iii) autophagy inhibition\nby PLK1 inhibition depends on MTOR activity (Fig. 5C to F).\nMTORC1 in mitotic cells is inhibited (Fig. 1F) and cannot be\nactivated by PLK1 inhibition (Fig. 1D, E). Thus, we conclude\nthat PLK1 inhibits MTORC1 and activates autophagy in inter-\nphase but not in mitotic cells. Which mechanisms may coordi-\nnate PLK1’s mitotic and interphase functions is currently\nunknown and will require further investigation.\n\nOur finding that PLK1 inhibits MTORC1 in interphase but\nnot in mitotic cells helps to resolve seemingly contradictory\nreports on the effects of PLK1 inhibition on MTORC1. For\nexample, our findings are in agreement with Spart�a et al.26 who\nreport that the PLK1 inhibitor BI6727 increases RPS6KB (p70)\nand RPS6 phosphorylation. Yet, this has been so far debatable\nas 4 other studies22-25 reported that PLK1 inhibition suppresses\nthe phosphorylation of MTORC1 substrates. At first glance this\nseems to be at odds with our findings and those of Spart�a\net al.26 However, Renner et al.22 Astrinidis et al.,23 Zhang\net al.24 and Li et al.25 use long-term treatments with PLK1\ninhibitors or siRNA, increasing the amounts of mitotic cells in\nthe cultures. In some studies, long-term PLK1 inhibition is\neven combined with a mitotic block.22,23 Thus, the reduced\nMTORC1 activity reported in those studies is measured in\nmitotic cells. In agreement with those data, we also show that\nMTORC1 is inhibited in mitotic cells (Fig. 1F). However, after\nremoval of mitotic cells, our data reveal that PLK1 inhibition\nactivates MTORC1 in interphase cells (Fig. 1G), which corre-\nsponds with data from Spart�a et al.26 Thus, our findings resolve\nand unify earlier—seemingly paradoxical—findings on PLK1\ninhibitor effects on the MTORC1 substrate RPS6KB (p70).\n\nOur results also complement previous studies on PLK1 inhib-\nitor effects on autophagy. We observed here that PLK1 inhibition\ncauses a decline in autophagy in interphase cells, as determined\n\nFigure 6.

RUF ET AL.\n\n\n\nby the reduction in LC3-II accumulation and autolysosome\nnumbers (Fig. 5, Fig. 6A, 6B). In agreement, Valianou et al.39\n\nshow in TSC1- or TSC2-deficient lymphangioleiomyomatosis\npatient derived cells that BI2536 moderately inhibits autophagy.\nOur finding that PLK1 regulates MTORC1 adds to the interpre-\ntation of these data. As loss of TSC1 or TSC2 leads to massive\nMTORC1 hyperactivation, MTORC1 can most probably not be\nmuch further activated by PLK1 inhibition in a TSC1- or TSC2-\ndeficient background. This may explain the only moderate effect\nof BI2536 on autophagy observed in that study. Another study\nin LNCaP cells reports that long-term treatment with BI2536 for\n5 d leads to mitotic arrest and necroptosis, correlating with cell\ndeath related autophagy activation.40 In our hands, autophagy\nwas decreased in HeLa cells upon a 38 h mitotic block\n(Fig. S2E). Thus, autophagic activity during mitosis may vary\ndepending on the length of cell cycle arrest and the cell type\nstudied.\n\nWe find here that the MTORC1 component RPTOR is\ndirectly phosphorylated in vitro by PLK1. Which RPTOR resi-\ndues may be PLK1 substrate sites? We analyzed the RPTOR\nsequence for known consensus phosphorylation motifs of\nPLK1,67 but did not find any. Thus, PLK1 substrate sites in\nRPTOR cannot be theoretically predicted. Three RPTOR phos-\nphorylation sites at S722, S863, and S877 have been previously\nidentified by 2 studies,68,69 which report on PLK1-dependent\nmitotic phosphoproteomes. We did not observe changes in\nphosphorylation of RPTOR at S722 and S863 upon BI2536\ntreatment in nonmitotic cells (Fig. S2G). For RPTOR phospho-\n(S877), we did not detect a specific signal with the available\nantibody (data not shown). Also other reported RPTOR phos-\nphorylation sites70 at S859 and T706 remained unchanged by\nBI2536 (Fig. S2G). Thus, further studies are needed to gain\ninsight into RPTOR residues that are phosphorylated by PLK1\nin interphase cells. Likewise, discovery proteomic studies are\nrequired to identify other interphase substrates and thereby\nmore generally delineate the interphase response of the PLK1\nphosphoproteome to changes in nutrient supply.\n\nThe central platform for MTORC1 signaling is the lysosome,\nwhich is also the essential compartment for autophagy. Consis-\ntent with a role for PLK1 in MTORC1 regulation and auto-\nphagy, we report that PLK1 colocalizes with MTOR in a\nlysosomal pattern (Fig. 2A, B) and the lysosomal marker\nLAMP2 coimmunoprecipitates with PLK1 (Fig. 2G). Further-\nmore, in sucrose gradients PLK1 is detected in the lysosomal\nfraction, jointly with MTOR and RPTOR, and the MTORC1\nregulator TSC2 (Fig. 2E, F). This finding is intriguing as there\nis so far no other report on lysosomal targeting of PLK1. Con-\nsistent with PLK1s lysosomal association reported here, PLK1\ncontains a GY motif which is a lysosomal targeting signal.71\n\nUnder which physiological conditions and in response to\nwhich stimuli does PLK1 inhibit MTORC1? We find here that\nPLK1 inhibition increases MTORC1 activity both under nutri-\nent sufficiency (Fig. 1B, C, G to J) and amino acid withdrawal\n(Fig. 3A, B), and the extent of induction of RPS6KB (p70) T389\nphosphorylation by PLK1 inhibition is equally strong in nutri-\nent-induced (Fig. 1C, H) and starved cells (Fig. 3B). This sug-\ngests that PLK1 is active and inhibits MTORC1 in both\nconditions. Of note, short- and long-term starvation enhances\nbinding of endogenous PLK1 with MTORC1 (Fig. 3G to J, 4E,\n\nF), and this is independent of MTORC1 or PLK1 kinase activity\n(Fig. 4A to D). This suggests that amino acid starvation regu-\nlates upstream cues, which cause enhanced PLK1-MTOR asso-\nciation. The molecular mediators that control starvation-\ninduced PLK1-MTOR binding remain to be determined.\nWhereas PLK1 kinase activity does not affect starvation-\ninduced PLK1-MTOR binding (Fig. 4C, D), PLK1 inhibition\ndoes lead to aberrant lysosomal localization of the PLK1-\nMTOR complex (Fig. 3C, D). This suggests that the increased\nPLK1-MTOR interaction in response to amino acid starvation\ndoes not happen at the lysosome, but another localization, e.g.,\nin the cytoplasm. This is in agreement with the enhanced cyto-\nplasmic colocalization of MTOR and PLK1 upon amino acid\nstarvation (Fig. 4G, H). This implies that enhanced PLK1-\nMTOR binding in starved cells is a separate mechanism that\nindirectly adds to PLK1s inhibitory effect on MTORC1 via\nlocalization away from lysosomes (scheme on the 2 separate\nmechanisms provided in Fig. S2H).\n\nSimilar to MTORC1 activity, its localization as well as\nautophagy are altered by PLK1 inhibition both under nutri-\nent starvation and sufficiency. Increased lysosomal localiza-\ntion or binding of MTOR upon PLK1 inactivation can be\ndetected in starved (Fig. 3C, D) and full medium cultivated\ncells (Fig. 2I). Hence, PLK1 contributes under both condi-\ntions to MTOR relocalization away from lysosomes. In\nkeeping with this, PLK1 inhibition mitigates autophagy\nboth under full medium conditions and in starved cells\n(Fig. 6A, B). We conclude that MTORC1 inhibition by\nPLK1 is a general mechanism, which is not restricted to\nstarved cells only, and consequently PLK1 positively con-\ntributes to autophagy both under starvation and nutrient-\nreplete conditions (see scheme Fig. S2H). Of note, auto-\nphagy does not only occur in starved cells, but is also a crit-\nical housekeeping and prosurvival pathway under nutrient\nsufficiency. Basal autophagy maintains, for example, protein\nhomeostasis by removing misfolded proteins, and mobilizes\ncellular energy and nutrient stores to maintain a stable pool\nof metabolite intermediates (reviewed by Kaur et al29).\n\nOur finding that PLK1, next to mitotic progression, pro-\nmotes autophagy in interphase cells suggests that for therapies\nof low grade tumors, which typically contain only 5% to 10%\nmitotic cells, PLK1 inhibitors may perform better than other\npurely antimitotic agents. As novel therapeutics are often tested\nfirst in advanced tumors, this point may have been missed so\nfar, and clinical studies are needed to address performance of\nPLK1 inhibitors vs other antimitotics such as paclitaxel in low\ngrade tumors. Beyond this, our findings suggest that combina-\ntorial targeting of MTORC1 and PLK1 may hold promise for\ncancer treatment. PLK11,4,72 and MTOR8,9 are common drug\ntargets in cancer therapy, but combinatorial treatments are\nrarely tested even in preclinical studies. It seems promising that\ncombination of the dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase-MTOR\ninhibitor BEZ235 and the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 in xenograft\nmodels of colorectal cancer shows that either inhibitor alone\nfails to enhance apoptosis, but combinatorial treatment inhibits\nMTORC1 readouts and leads to massive tumor cell death.73\n\nWe show here that PLK1 inhibition can activate MTORC1 and\nsuppress autophagy. As this may affect tumor cell survival and\ngrowth, we advocate cautious monitoring of MTORC1 and\n\nAUTOPHAGY 499\n\n\n\nautophagy readouts in clinical trials with PLK1 inhibitors. Cor-\nrelation of such data with clinical outcome may allow develop-\nment of strategies for optimized (combinatorial) cancer\ntherapies, to simultaneously target PLK1 and MTOR in tumors\nwhere MTORC1 is activated by PLK1 inhibition.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nNomenclature\n\nGenes and proteins are designated according to the recommen-\ndations of the HUGO gene nomenclature committee (HGNC).\n\nCell culture and cell treatments\n\nHeLa a Kyoto cells were cultivated in full medium Dulbec-\nco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; PAN Biotech, P04–\n03600) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA,\nA15–102, Lot A10208–0991), 3 mM L-glutamine (Gibco,\nLife Technologies, 25030–024) at 37�C, 7.5% CO2. For stim-\nulation with amino acids and insulin, cells were cultivated\nin DMEM, supplemented with 3 mM L-glutamine and\n100 nM insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, I1882), for the indicated\ntime points. Prior to starvation experiments, cells were\nwashed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; PAN\nBiotech, P04–36500). Starvation was either performed for\namino acids and growth factors in Hank’s balanced salt\nsolution (HBSS; PAN Biotech, P04–32505), or for amino\nacids in amino acid-free DMEM (PAN Biotech, P04–01507)\nsupplemented with 4.5 g/l glucose (Sigma-Aldrich, G7021)\nand 100 nM insulin, as indicated. Mitotic shake-off was\nperformed where indicated to remove the mitotic cells.\nPrior to the mitotic shake-off, cells were starved 16 h for\namino acids and growth factors in HBSS. Nocodazole or\nconsecutive aphidicolin-nocodazole treatment were per-\nformed as described before.74 In brief, for consecutive aphi-\ndicolin-nocodazole treatment cells were treated 16 h with\n1.6 mg/mL aphidicolin (Sigma-Aldrich, A0781), followed by\na release into the cell cycle using full medium for 7 h and\nsubsequently treated with 100 ng/mL nocodazole (Sigma-\nAldrich, M1404) for 15 h, followed by release for the indi-\ncated times.\n\nsiRNA knockdown of PLK1 was induced using ON-TAR-\nGET plus SMARTpool siRNA, final concentration 10 nM\n(Dharmacon, L-003290–00). siRNA transfection was per-\nformed using Lipofectamine 2000, (Life Technologies, 11668–\n019) and DNA transfection was performed with JetPEI (Poly-\nPlus, 101–40) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\n\nOverexpression of PLK1 was performed using the following\nconstructs: empty vector pRcCMV (Invitrogen V75020),\npRcCMV MYC-PLK1K82R (Addgene plasmid 41157, deposited\nby Erich Nigg),59 and pRcCMV MYC-PLK1 (WT) (Addgene\nplasmid 41160, deposited by Erich Nigg).38 The medium was\nexchanged 6 h post transfection. Cells were harvested after\nremoval of the mitotic cells by mitotic shake-off 24 h or 48 h\npost transfection, with similar results.\n\nThe shPLK1 HeLa cell line was generated using the pTRIPZ\nsystem (Dharmacon). For virus generation HEK293T cells were\ncotransfected using jetPEI with the PLK1 shRNA construct,\n(target sequence shPLK1: CTGTCTGAAGCATCTTCTG;\n\nDharmacon, RHS4740-EG5347) or a nontargeting control\nsequence, respectively, with the Trans-Lentiviral shRNA Pack-\naging system. The virus supernatant was harvested 72 h after\ntransfection. HeLa cells were seeded in the morning and the\ninfection with the virus supernatant was performed for 16 h.\nThe transduction step was repeated twice. Selection of success-\nfully transduced cells was achieved by adding puromycin (final\nconcentration 2 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, P8833). A stably trans-\nduced doxycycline-inducible HeLa shRPTOR cell line and a\ncontrol cell line (shControl) harboring a nontargeting control\nsequence were described previously.45 Knockdown was induced\nwith doxycyline for 3 d (final concentration 2 mg/mL; Sigma-\nAldrich, D3447).

For immu-\nnofluorescence experiments, the RRAGC/RAGC (9480) and\nMTOR (2983) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling\nTechnology, Inc., LAMP2 (sc-18822) and PLK1 (sc-17783)\nwere bought from Santa Cruz, Biotechnology, Inc. The\nSQSTM1/p62 antibody was obtained from Progen Biotechnik\n(GP62-C). All secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence\nexperiments were bought from Thermo Fisher Scientific: Goat\nanti-guinea pig IgG (HCL), Alexa Fluor� 568 conjugate (A-\n11075), goat anti-rabbit IgG (HCL), Alexa Fluor� 568 conju-\ngate (A-11036), goat anti-rabbit IgG (HCL), Alexa Fluor� 488\nconjugate (A-11008), goat anti-mouse IgG (HCL), Alexa Flu-\nor� 488 conjugate (A-11001), and goat anti-mouse IgG (HCL),\nAlexa Fluor� 568 (A-11004). Bafilomycin A1 was bought at\nTebu-Bio (BIA-B1012) and throughout the study used at a final\nconcentration of 100 nM. PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 (Axon Med-\nchem, 1129) was used at 100 nM final concentration and added\n30 min before lysis throughout the study unless otherwise\nstated and MTOR inhibitor Torin1 (Axon MedChem, 1833),\n\n500 S. RUF ET AL.\n\n\n\nwas used at 250 nM and added 30 min before stimulation with\namino acids and insulin.\n\nCell lysis and immunoblotting\n\nHeLa cells were washed twice with PBS before lysis in RIPA\nlysis buffer (1% NP40 [Sigma-Aldrich, I8896], 0.1% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate [Sigma-Aldrich, 71725], 0.5% sodium deoxy-\ncholate [Sigma-Aldrich, 30970] in PBS) supplemented with\nComplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche, 11836145001),\nPhosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma-Aldrich, P5726) and\nCocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, P0044).\n\nAdjustment of the protein concentration, SDS PAGE and\nimmunoblot were performed as described previously.45 Pierce\nECL western blotting substrate (32209) or SuperSignal West\nFEMTO (34095), both from Thermo Scientific Pierce, were\nused to detect chemiluminescence using a LAS-4000 mini cam-\nera system (Fujifilm Life Science Systems, Tokyo, JP) or a LAS-\n4000 mini camera system (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).\n\nQuantification of raw image files was performed using\nImageQuant TL Version 8.1, GE Healthcare. Background sub-\ntraction was performed using the rolling ball method with a\ndefined radius of 200 for all images.\n\nFor graphical representation, raw images from the Fujifilm\ncamera were exported as Color TIFF files using the Fujifilm\nsoftware Multi Gauge version 3.0, Fujifilm Life Science Systems,\nand further processed with Adobe Photoshop version CS2. Raw\nimages taken with the LAS-4000 mini, GE Healthcare system\nwere exported as RGB color TIFF files using ImageJ, and fur-\nther processed with Adobe Photoshop version CS5.1.\n\nImmunoprecipitation (IP)\n\nHeLa cells were washed 3x with ice-cold PBS and harvested in IP\nlysis buffer (40 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl and 0.3% CHAPS\n[Sigma-Aldrich, 000000010810118001], pH 7.5) supplemented\nwith Complete (Roche, 11836145001), Phosphatase Inhibitor\nCocktail 2 and Cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich, P5726, P0044). Lysates\nwere precleaned by adding 10 mL/mL magnetic Dynabeads�\n\nProtein G (Life Technologies, 10009D), prewashed in lysis buffer,\nfor 30 min at 4�C with end-over-end rotation. A lysate sample\nwas taken up in 5x SDS sample buffer (50% glycerol, 5% b-mer-\ncaptoethanol, 0.3 M SDS, 0.03 M Tris, pH 6.8, 0.2 mM bromo-\nphenol blue) for subsequent analysis by immunoblot. IP was\nperformed by adding 7.5 mg of a specific antibody or control\nIgG (“mock,” negative control) per mL lysate for 30 min at 4�C.\nSubsequently, 37.5 mL prewashed Dynabeads� Protein G per\nmL lysate were added to the IP reactions for 1.5 h at 4�C. Beads\nwere washed 3 times briefly and twice for 10 min in IP lysis\nbuffer and resuspended in 1x SDS sample buffer.\n\nPLK1 kinase assay\n\nHeLa cells were transfected with pRK5-HA-RPTOR (Addgene\nplasmid 8513,52 gift from David Sabatini) 48 h before the experi-\nment. HA-RPTOR was immunopurified using an HA antibody. A\ncontrol (mock) IP was performed with rat IgG. The immunopreci-\npitates were dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase (10 U;\nThermo Scientific, EF0652) for 1 h at 37�C, and washed with IP\n\nlysis buffer, followed by a washing step with kinase assay buffer\n(20 mM HEPES, pH 7,4, 150 mM KCl, 10 mMMgCl2). Recombi-\nnant PLK1 (0.1 mg; Enzo Life Sciences, BML-SE466–0005) was\nadded to RPTOR and mock IPs as indicated. The kinase-substrate\nmixture was preincubated on ice for 15min with BI2536 (100 nM),\nTorin1 (250 nM) or carrier, respectively. An ATP mix with 1 mM\ncold ATP (GE Healthcare, 27–1006–01) and 5 to 10 mCi [g-33P]\nATP (PerkinElmer, NEG302H250UC) was added and incubated\nfor 30 min at 30�Cwith gentle shaking. Samples were washed once\nwith kinase assay buffer before resuspension in 1x SDS sample\nbuffer and heated for 15 min at 68�C. Samples were separated by\nSDS-PAGE and phosphorylation was analyzed by autoradiogra-\nphy. For quantification the signal that was measured for the condi-\ntion without PLK1 was considered as background and thus\nsubtracted. For nonradioactive assay the same protocol was per-\nformed, 0.4 mM cold ATP was added and samples were analyzed\nby immunoblotting.\n\nSucrose gradient\n\nHeLa cells were treated as indicated and lysed in homogeniza-\ntion buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose [Sigma-\nAldrich, S2395], 25 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 3 mM imidazole),\nsupplemented with Complete (Roche, 11836145001) and Phos-\nphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 and Cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich,\nP5726, P0044). Plates were incubated for 30 min on a rocking\nplatform at 4�C. Subsequently, cells were scraped and centri-\nfuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4�C. The supernatant was trans-\nferred to a new tube and the protein concentration was\ndetermined using Bradford assay. Protein (1.5 mg) was loaded\non a sucrose gradient. A continuous gradient was prepared\nfrom 10% to 40% sucrose using an ultracentrifuge tube with a\ntotal volume of 4 mL. Lysates were distributed in the sucrose\ngradient using ultracentrifugation (194,000 g, at least 16 h,\nBeckman SW55 Ti rotor, Brea, California, USA). After centrifu-\ngation, each sample was divided into 12 fractions and taken up\nin 5x loading buffer. Samples were analyzed by immunoblot.\nQuantification was performed by determination of the relative\nintensities of PLK1 positive signals. The percentage of PLK1 in\na certain fraction was calculated by determining the ratio\nbetween the relative intensity in a single lane and the relative\nintensity of the sum of all PLK1-positive signals. The percent-\nage of PLK1 in either the lysosomal or the nuclear fraction was\ncalculated by addition of normalized PLK1 in LAMP2 or H3F3\nand LMNA positive lanes, respectively.\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\n\nFor all immunofluorescence experiments, cells were washed in\nPBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at\nroom temperature. After washing the cells 3 times with PBS,\npermeabilization was performed as indicated. Cells were\nwashed in PBS and blocked with 0.3% bovine serum albumin\n(Carl Roth, 8076.5) or 0.3% FCS in PBS, as indicated. Hoechst\n33342 (end concentration 1 mg/mL; Invitrogen, H3570) was\nadded and incubated for 30 min in the dark at room tempera-\nture. Cells were mounted with Mowiol 4–88 (Carl Roth, 07131)\nsolution, which was prepared according to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions including DABCO (1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane;\n\nAUTOPHAGY 501\n\n\n\nSigma-Aldrich, D27802) supplemented with 10% n-propyl-gal-\nlate (NPG; VWR International, 8.205.990.100), and analyzed\nusing fluorescence microscopy.\n\nFor colocalization analysis of MTOR-LAMP2, MTOR-PLK1,\nand RRAGC-LAMP2 permeabilization was performed with 0.1%\nTriton X-100 (Sigma Aldrich, 93443) in PBS for 1 min and cells\nwere blocked with 0.3% FCS in PBS. Z stack images were taken\nwith an AxioObserver Z1 compound microscope (Carl Zeiss,\nOberkochen, Germany) with an Apotome, 63x objective (Carl\nZeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and anAxioCamMRm3CCD cam-\nera (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For quantitative analysis, 4 or 5\nrepresentative fields of view were captured for each condition with\nidentical exposure times and the same magnification. The Pearson\ncorrelation coefficient was calculated across raw files, without any\nimage processing, using the colocalization module of the Zen soft-\nware (Zen2012 blue edition software, Zeiss) after automatically set-\nting the threshold with the Costes method. For presentation in\nfigures, single layers of representative raw Z stacks were exported\nas TIFF with no compression using Zen2012 blue edition software\n(Zeiss) and brightness or contrast were adjusted, for better visibil-\nity. Brightness or contrast adjustment was not performed before\nquantification, and thus did not influence image quantification.\n\nPLK1 staining in mitotic cells was performed after prometa-\nphase arrest and a release of 30 min in full medium. Mitotic\ncells were collected by centrifugation (500 g, 4 min). PFA-fixed\ncells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for\n1 min and cells were blocked with 0.3% FCS in PBS.\n\nTo monitor autophagosomes and autolysosomes an mRFP-\nGPF-LC3 tandem construct61 (Addgene, plasmid 21074, gift\nfrom Tamotsu Yoshimori). Cells were grown on coverslips, and\ntransfected with the mRFP-GFP-LC3 plasmid. After 48 h cells\nwere fixed as described above. Permeabilization was performed\nwith 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 to 45 s and 0.3% bovine\nserum albumin was used for blocking. Images were taken with\nan AxioImager Z1 compound microscope from Zeiss, 63x\nobjective and an AxioCam MRm3 CCD camera. Prior to quan-\ntification images were deconvoluted using Huygens software,\nHuygens remote manager v3.0.3 (Scientific Volume Imaging).\nFor image parameters a pixel size of 60 nm was assumed. For\nprocessing parameters the classic maximum likelihood estima-\ntion deconvolution algorithm was chosen and the signal/noise\nratio was set to 90 for all channels. The number of green and\nred puncta was counted using the spot detection function of\nImaris Version 7.7.2 (BITPLANE AG). The background sub-\ntraction was ticked. As filter type, quality above threshold was\nchosen. Within one experiment the threshold and the estimated\nxy diameter were kept equal for all analyzed images. To deter-\nmine the percentage of autolysosomes per cell, we counted red\nand green puncta, and subsequently calculated the difference\nbetween mRFP and GFP puncta, which we expressed as the\npercentage of all red puncta per cell. At least 25 nonmitotic\ncells, as judged by Hoechst staining, were counted per condi-\ntion. For presentation in figures, representative raw images\nwere exported as TIFF with no compression using Zen2012\nblue edition software (Zeiss) and brightness or contrast were\nadjusted, for better visibility. Images are shown without prior\ndeconvolution. Brightness or contrast adjustment was not per-\nformed before quantification, and thus did not alter the num-\nbers of quantified green and red puncta.\n\nFor the SQSTM1 staining, permeabilization was performed\nwith 1% saponin (Sigma Aldrich, 47036) for 15 min and cells\nwere blocked with 0.3% FCS in PBS. Z stack images were taken\nwith an AxioObserver Z1 compound microscope with Apo-\ntome from Zeiss, 63x objective, AxioCam MRm3 CCD camera.\nFor quantitative analysis, at least 5 representative fields of view\nwere captured for each condition with identical exposure times\nand the same magnification. The total area of SQSTM1/p62\npositive foci was calculated using ImageJ 1.47v. The threshold\nwas set manually and kept identical for comparative analysis\nbefore applying the “Analyze Particles” function. The total area\nwas normalized to the number of nuclei.\n\nFor presentation in figures, maximum intensity projections\nof representative raw images were exported as TIFF with no\ncompression using Zen2012 blue edition software (Zeiss) and\nbrightness or contrast were adjusted, for better visibility.\nBrightness or contrast adjustment was not performed before\nquantification, and thus did not influence image quantification.\n\nC. elegans experiments\n\nThe C. elegans strain MAH14 (daf-2(e1370); adIs2122[lgg-1p::\ngfp::lgg-1 Crol-6]64) was used for this study. The strain was\nmaintained at 20�C and raised on NGM plates seeded with\nEscherichia coli strain OP50 as described previously.75 To inves-\ntigate autophagy, eggs from MAH14 animals were transferred\nto RNAi plates (atg-18 RNAi clone was from the Vidal\nlibrary,76 and plk-1 RNAi clone was from the Ahringer\nlibrary77) and incubated at 25�C to induce dauers. Following\nincubation for 6 d, dauers were anesthetized with sodium azide,\narranged vertically on agar plates and imaged using an AxioIm-\nager Z1 compound microscope fitted with an AxioCam MRm3\nCCD camera. GFP intensity was quantified using Image J soft-\nware and normalized to the size of the animals.\n\nStatistics\n\nQuantifications of experiments were displayed and statistically\nanalyzed using GraphPad Prism Version 5.00. For all experi-\nments in human cells, the mean and the standard error of the\nmean (SEM) were plotted. For quantification of GFP::LGG-1\nfluorescence in C. elegans the mean and the standard deviation\n(s. d.) were plotted. Two groups were compared using a non-\nparametric 2-tailed Student t test assuming unequal variances.\nFor comparison of multiple groups, a one-way ANOVA fol-\nlowed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison test was used. P\nvalues below 0.05 were considered significant.\n\nAbbreviations\n\naa amino acids\nAMPK AMP-activated protein kinase\nATG autophagy-related\nATP adenosine triphosphate\nBafA bafilomycin A1\nBSA bovine serum albumin\nCCNE1 cyclin E1\nC. elegans Caenorhabditis elegans\nCID collision-induced dissociation\n\n502 S.
