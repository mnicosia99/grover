Essentially, the control bands for α-tubulin had been duplicated  across from Fig. 2A to Fig. 2B, and from Fig. 2D to Fig. 2E   [the experiments showing treatment of the cells with  (A) manumycin A, (B) U0126, (D) 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine  (DAC) and (E) trichostatin A (TSA)], respectively. After  having re-examined our original data, we realize that the  figure was compiled incorrectly, and have returned to our  source data. A corrected version of Fig. 2 is presented here,  showing the correct control α-tubulin data for Fig. 2A and E,  as they ought to have appeared. This error did not overall  affect the conclusions reported in the study. We sincerely  apologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our article  who drew this matter to our attention. Furthermore, we regret  any inconvenience this mistake has caused.   Figure 2. TPm1 mRNA expression and protein expression in huCCT1 cells. (A) huCCT1 cells were treated with 5 and 10 µmol/l manumycin A for 24 h.  (B) huCCT1 cells were treated with 5 and 10 µmol/l U0126 for 24 h. (C) huCCT1 cells were treated with 20 and 50 µmol/l LY294002 for 24 h. (D) huCCT1  cells were treated with 1 and 5 µmol/l DAC for 24 h. (E) HuCCT1 cells were treated with 0.1 and 0.25 μmol/l TSA for 24 h. *P<0.05. TPm1, tropomyosin 1;  DAC, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine; TSA, trichostatin A.   '}
