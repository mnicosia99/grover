After \nhaving re-examined our original data, we realize that the \nfigure was compiled incorrectly, and have returned to our \nsource data. A corrected version of Fig. 2 is presented here, \nshowing the correct control α-tubulin data for Fig. 2A and E, \nas they ought to have appeared. This error did not overall \naffect the conclusions reported in the study. We sincerely \napologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our article \nwho drew this matter to our attention. Furthermore, we regret \nany inconvenience this mistake has caused. \n\nFigure 2. TPm1 mRNA expression and protein expression in huCCT1 cells. (A) huCCT1 cells were treated with 5 and 10 µmol/l manumycin A for 24 h. \n(B) huCCT1 cells were treated with 5 and 10 µmol/l U0126 for 24 h. (C) huCCT1 cells were treated with 20 and 50 µmol/l LY294002 for 24 h. (D) huCCT1 \ncells were treated with 1 and 5 µmol/l DAC for 24 h. (E) HuCCT1 cells were treated with 0.1 and 0.25 μmol/l TSA for 24 h. *P<0.05. TPm1, tropomyosin 1; \nDAC, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine; TSA, trichostatin A.\n\n\n'}
