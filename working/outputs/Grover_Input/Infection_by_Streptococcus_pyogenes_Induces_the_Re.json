All Rights Reserved.\n\nInfection by Streptococcus pyogenes Induces the Receptor Activator of\nNF-�B Ligand Expression in Mouse Osteoblastic Cells\n\nNobuo Okahashi,1,2* Atsuo Sakurai,1,3 Ichiro Nakagawa,1 Taku Fujiwara,3\nShigetada Kawabata,1,4 Atsuo Amano,2 and Shigeyuki Hamada1\n\nDepartments of Oral and Molecular Microbiology,1 Oral Frontier Biology,2 and Pediatric Dentistry,3 Osaka University\nGraduate School of Dentistry, 1-8 Yamadaoka, Suita-Osaka 565-0871, and PRESTO, Japan Science and\n\nTechnology Corporation, Kawaguchi-Saitama 332-0012,4 Japan\n\nReceived 19 August 2002/Returned for modification 10 October 2002/Accepted 31 October 2002\n\nGroup A Streptococcus pyogenes is known to induce nongonococcal septic arthritis in addition to pharyngitis,\nscarlet fever, and poststreptococcal sequelae. However, little is known about the interaction between S. pyogenes\nand bone cells. We report here that S. pyogenes strain JRS4 (M6) attached to and invaded mouse primary\nosteoblasts. Reverse transcription-PCR demonstrated that S. pyogenes infection of osteoblasts stimulated\nexpression of mRNA for the receptor activator of NF-�B ligand (RANKL). Western blot analysis followed by\nligand precipitation with the receptor activator of NF-�B receptor showed that there was an increase in\nRANKL protein in infected osteoblasts. Production of interleukin-6 was also stimulated, but no production of\ninterleukin-1� or tumor necrosis factor alpha was observed. Stimulation of RANKL production was not\nobserved in osteoblasts stimulated with heat-inactivated S. pyogenes, suggesting that an active interaction of S.\npyogenes with osteoblasts is essential for this phenomenon. A Western blot analysis performed with antibodies\nspecific for phosphorylated signal transduction proteins demonstrated that S. pyogenes infection induces\nphosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. A specific inhibitor of this kinase, SB203580, inhib-\nited RANKL production by infected osteoblasts. These results suggest that infection of osteoblasts by S.\npyogenes stimulates RANKL production and may trigger bone destruction in infected bone tissue.\n\nBacterial arthritis is a rapidly progressive and highly destruc-\ntive joint disease in humans. Staphylococcus aureus is the most\nfrequently isolated bacterial pathogen associated with non-\ngonococcal bacterial arthritis (12); however, beta-hemolytic\nstreptococci are the second-most-frequently associated bacte-\nria and account for 14 to 15% of the cases of nongonococcal\nbacterial arthritis (26). Serotype classification studies of strep-\ntococcal bacterial arthritis have revealed that the most com-\nmon agent is group A Streptococcus pyogenes, followed by\ngroup B, group C, and group G (26). In addition, S. pyogenes\noften causes poststreptococcal reactive arthritis (3, 12). This\ntype of arthritis is not associated with carditis or other major\nmanifestations of acute rheumatic fever. Several investigators\nhave recommended that patients with poststreptococcal reac-\ntive arthritis should receive prophylactic antimicrobial agents\nfor years (3, 12).\n\nS. pyogenes (group A streptococci [GAS]) is a pathogen that\nis responsible for human diseases whose severities vary, rang-\ning from nonsuppurative infections of the pharynx and skin to\ntoxic shock syndrome, necrotizing fasciitis, and sepsis (9). Al-\nthough bacterial arthritis caused by S. aureus (30) and group B\nStreptococcus agalactiae (31, 32) has been studied, little is\nknown about S. pyogenes-induced bacterial arthritis. Very re-\ncently, we have found that intravenous injection of S. pyogenes\ninto mice causes bacterial arthritis (submitted for publication).\nMice inoculated with an S. pyogenes strain manifested clinical\n\narthritis characterized by early onset of acute exudative syno-\nvitis, permanent lesions with irreversible joint damage, and\nankylosis. This may be a good animal model to study bacterial\narthritis caused by S. pyogenes and may also be a useful model\nto study poststreptococcal reactive arthritis. A number of S.\npyogenes cells were recovered from the arthritic joints of in-\nfected mice, suggesting that S. pyogenes colonizes the joint\ntissues.\n\nIt has been reported that S. pyogenes efficiently invades ep-\nithelial cells (15, 20, 21, 24). S. pyogenes has fibronectin-binding\nproteins, such as proteins F1 and Fba, which are considered to\nbe an adhesin and an invasin (13, 21, 24). It has also been\nreported that S. pyogenes triggers activation of cell death path-\nways and induces cellular apoptosis of epithelial cells. How-\never, the effects of S. pyogenes infection on bone cells, such as\nosteoblasts, remain unknown.\n\nPrevious investigations of the bacterial arthritis induced by\nS. aureus and S. agalactiae suggested that several cytokines,\nsuch as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�), interleukin-1�\n(IL-1�), and IL-6, are involved in the pathogenesis of bacterial\narthritis (30, 32). However, these studies did not consider the\npossible role of receptor activator of NF-�B ligand (RANKL)\nin bacterial arthritis. RANKL, also called TRANCE (2),\nOPGL (18), and ODF (34), is a recently discovered transmem-\nbrane molecule belonging to the TNF ligand superfamily that\nis expressed in lymphoid tissues and trabecular bone (17, 27,\n34). RANKL is thought to be the essential and final common\nsignal required both in vitro and in vivo for full osteoclastic\ndifferentiation from multipotential hematopoietic precursor\ncells into mature multinucleated bone-resorptive osteoclasts in\nthe presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (17, 18,\n\n* Corresponding author.

(19) reported that an increased\nconcentration of RANKL is detected in synovial fluid from\npatients with rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that RANKL\nplays an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid\narthritis. RANKL is expressed on activated osteoblasts, as well\nas on activated T cells (2, 17, 19, 27, 28, 34). The role of\nRANKL on activated osteoblasts in osteoclastogenesis is\nwidely recognized, whereas the significance of RANKL on T\ncells is controversial because activated T cells produce gamma\ninterferon, which strongly inhibits osteoclastogenesis (17, 28).\n\nIn this study, we investigated adherence of and invasion by S.\npyogenes with mouse osteoblastic cells. We found that infection\nby S. pyogenes triggers expression of RANKL and other proin-\nflammatory cytokines in osteoblasts. The production of these\ncytokines may contribute to bone destruction in the bacterial\narthritis caused by group A S. pyogenes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nMice and reagents. Female ddY mice were obtained from Japan SLC\n(Hamamatsu, Japan). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and SB203580 were purchased\nfrom Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). Phospho-specific antibodies against\nmouse extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), mouse c-Jun N-ter-\nminal kinase (JNK), and mouse p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\nwere purchased from Cell Signaling Tech (Beverly, Mass.). A recombinant\nmouse receptor activator of NF-�B/Fc (RANK/Fc) chimera protein and anti-\nmouse RANKL antibodies were obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,\nMinn.).\n\nBacterial strains, culture conditions, and preparation of heat-inactivated bac-\nterial cells and bacterial supernatant. Group A S. pyogenes strain JRS4 (M6�\n\nF1�) and the isogenic mutant strains JRS145 (M6� F1�) and SAM1 (M6� F1�)\nwere provided by E. Hanski (The Hebrew University, Hadassah Medical School,\nJerusalem, Israel) (13); these organisms were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth (BBL,\nCockeysville, Md.) supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (THY) and were used\nin the infection assay. JRS145 is an isogenic M6-deficient mutant of JRS4,\nwhereas SAM1 is deficient in protein F1, a fibronectin-binding protein. JRS4 (1\n� 1010 CFU/ml) was heat inactivated by incubating it at 60°C for 30 min. To\nprepare bacterial supernatant, S. pyogenes JRS4 was cultured for 18 h at 37°C in\na dialysate medium consisting of THY broth. Solid (NH4)2SO4 was added to a\ncentrifuged supernatant solution at 50% saturation. The precipitate was col-\nlected by centrifugation and dissolved in a small volume of phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS) (pH 7.2). The concentrated bacterial supernatant was extensively\ndialyzed against PBS and used as an extracellular protein of S. pyogenes.\n\nPrimary mouse osteoblasts. Primary mouse osteoblasts were isolated from\n1-day-old mouse calvariae after five routine sequential digestions with 0.1%\ncollagenase (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan) and 0.2% dispase (Godo\nShusei, Tokyo, Japan), as previously described (4, 23). Osteoblasts were cultured\nin alpha minimum essential medium (�MEM) (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island,\nN.Y.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (GIBCO BRL). Immunochemical\nstaining with osteocalcin and staining for alkaline phosphatase activity demon-\nstrated that more than 95% of the cells showed osteoblastic characteristics (4,\n23).\n\nInvasion and adhesion assay. Mid-log-phase bacteria were added to osteoblast\ncultures grown in 24-well culture plates (multiplicity of infection [MOI], 10), and\nthe cultures were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. To determine the numbers of\nadherent and internalized bacteria, the cultures were incubated for 4 h. After\nunattached bacteria were washed off with PBS, the osteoblasts were disrupted by\nextensive pipetting with sterile water and then serially diluted in water and plated\non THY agar plates. For the invasion assay, bacteria were added to osteoblast\ncultures and incubated for 3 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. After the wells were washed\nwith PBS, the attached bacteria were killed by 1 h of incubation with gentamicin\n(100 �g/ml; Sigma) and penicillin (100 U/ml). Then the cells were disrupted with\nsterile water. The intracellular bacteria were suspended in water, serially diluted,\nand plated on THY agar plates to determine the number of intracellular bacteria\n(15).\n\nImmunocytochemical analysis. Osteoblasts were seeded onto eight-well\nLabTek chamber slides (Nalge-Nunc International, Naperville, Ill.). The cells\nwere infected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing S.\npyogenes JRS4 (21) at an MOI of 10. Invasion by and adhesion of the EGFP-\n\nexpressing S. pyogenes strain were analyzed by using a confocal microscope\nsystem (model LSM510; Carl Zeiss Co., Ltd.). Briefly, cells were fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 2 h after infection with EGFP-expressing S. pyogenes, and\nthis was followed by staining with anti-S. pyogenes antibody (1:100 dilution) and\nAlexa Fluor 568-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (1:500 dilution; Mo-\nlecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.). The anti-S. pyogenes antibody was prepared by\nimmunizing rabbits with lyophilized whole cells of S. pyogenes (21). Under the\nconfocal conditions used, the emission of EGFP was quenched by the emission\nof Alexa Fluor 568, resulting in red fluorescence from the adhered bacteria.\nIntracellular bacteria exhibited green fluorescence from EGFP (21).\n\nRT-PCR assay and real-time PCR analysis. For reverse transcription-PCR\n(RT-PCR), total RNA was prepared from cells by using TRIzol reagent (GIBCO\nBRL), and 2 �g of total RNA was reverse transcribed in the presence of\noligo(dT)15 by using the SuperScript first-strand synthesis system (GIBCO BRL)\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA samples were tested for\nintegrity and amount of input RNA by RT-PCR with �-actin, which served as an\nendogenous control. To quantitate RANKL mRNA, a real-time PCR was per-\nformed by using the GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (Applied Bio-\nsystems, Foster City, Calif.) with a SYBR Green reagent. Samples were subjected\nto 40 cycles of amplification consisting of 95°C for 15 s followed by 60°C for 1 min\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions (Applied Biosystems). Each assay\nwas normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA. The nor-\nmalized data were expressed the following two ways: (i) as a percentage of the\ngene expression in osteoblasts stimulated with 2 �M PGE2, and (ii) as a fold\nincrease compared with the mRNA level of unstimulated cells. The primers used\nin this study are listed in Table 1.\n\nLigand receptor precipitation. Osteoblasts cultured in the absence or presence\nof stimulants were lysed by addition of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris buffer [pH 8.0],\n150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, complete protease inhibitor\ncocktail [Boehringer Mannheim GmbH, Mannheim, Germany]). After sonica-\ntion for a short time, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 15,000\n� g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected, and the protein concentration\nwas determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, Ill.).\nRANK-immobilized beads were prepared by agitating mouse RANK/Fc (R&D\nSystems) with protein A/G agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,\nCalif.) overnight at 4°C (22). RANK/Fc protein was bound to protein A/G beads\nat concentration of 20 �g/ml of beads. Cell lysates containing approximately 0.5\nmg/ml were precipitated with 20 �l of RANK-immobilized agarose beads in lysis\nbuffer overnight at 4°C. The RANKL-RANK precipitated materials were recov-\nered by boiling in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample loading buffer (1% SDS,\n10 mM Tris buffer [pH 6.8], 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) and were\nsubjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and Western blot-\nting (22).\n\nWestern blot analysis. Osteoblasts cultured in the absence or presence of\nstimulants were washed with PBS and dissolved in 50 mM Tris-HCl containing\n0.2% SDS (pH 6.8). Extracted proteins (50 �g) were separated by SDS-PAGE\nand electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. Proteins or phos-\nphorylated proteins were detected with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Phar-\nmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).\n\nRESULTS\n\nExpression of RANKL and osteotrophic cytokines in osteo-\nblasts as a result of S. pyogenes infection. It was reported\npreviously that S. pyogenes is able to attach to and invade\nmammalian epithelial cells; however, little information is avail-\nable regarding the attachment to and invasion of osteoblasts by\nS. pyogenes. As shown in Fig. 1, wild-type strain JRS4 exhibit-\ning type 6 M protein (M6) and fibronectin-binding protein F1\nwas found to attach to and be internalized in mouse primary\nosteoblasts. The level of adhesion to and invasion of mouse\nosteoblasts by S. pyogenes JRS4 was comparable to the level of\nadhesion to and invasion of human pharyngeal carcinoma ep-\nithelial HEp-2 cells, which was estimated in a previous study\n(21). Osteoblasts are known to produce RANKL, an osteoclas-\ntogenic cytokine, in response to several humoral factors, such\nas IL-1 and PGE2. Thus, it is important to clarify whether\nosteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes produce RANKL and/or\nother osteotropic cytokines. RT-PCR revealed that osteoblasts\n\nVOL. 71, 2003 STREPTOCOCCI INDUCE RANKL PRODUCTION IN OSTEOBLASTS 949\n\n\n\ninfected with S. pyogenes expressed RANKL mRNA (Fig. 2A).\nWe found that the amounts of RANKL protein on osteoblasts\nwere less than the limit of detection of conventional Western\nblot analysis even after stimulation with PGE2. Therefore, we\nemployed a ligand receptor precipitation technique (22) to\nspecifically concentrate RANKL protein and to detect protein\nexpression on osteoblasts. Western blot analysis after ligand\nprecipitation demonstrated that osteoblasts stimulated with\nPGE2 produced RANKL protein with a molecular mass of\napproximately 40 kDa. Osteoblasts infected with JRS4 also\nproduced detectable amounts of RANKL protein (Fig. 2B).\n\nRT-PCR performed with the primer pairs that targeted IL-\n1�, IL-6, TNF-�, or transforming growth factor beta (TGF-�)\nrevealed that osteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 pro-\nduced IL-6 (Fig. 3). An increase in the TGF-� level was also\ndetectable. Neither IL-1� nor TNF-� was detectable\n\nQuantitative analysis of RANKL expression in osteoblasts\ninfected with S. pyogenes. Quantitative analysis by real-time\nPCR revealed that the RANKL expression in osteoblasts\ntreated with S. pyogenes was fivefold greater than the RANKL\nexpression in uninfected cells at 6 h after infection (Fig. 4). The\ninduction of RANKL mRNA expression in osteoblasts exhib-\nited a dose-dependent relationship. As shown in Fig. 4A and B,\nwhen the ratio of the number of cells of S. pyogenes in the\ninoculum to the number of osteoblasts was increased from 1:1\nto 10:1, there was a concomitant increase in RANKL mRNA\nexpression. The time-dependent increase in RANKL mRNA\nexpression is shown in Fig. 4C. The expression of RANKL\nmRNA in infected cells was fivefold greater than the expres-\nsion in the uninfected controls at 6 h. Longer infection periods\nresulted in overgrowth of S. pyogenes in the infected cultures,\nwhich led to death of osteoblasts.\n\nIn contrast to viable S. pyogenes, heat-inactivated S. pyogenes\ndid not induce RANKL mRNA expression. As shown in Fig.\n4D, exposure of mouse osteoblasts to heat-inactivated (60°C,\n\n30 min) S. pyogenes was not a potent stimulus for RANKL\nexpression. Viable S. pyogenes at a ratio of 10:1 routinely in-\nduced expression of fivefold more RANKL mRNA, whereas\nheat-inactivated S. pyogenes did not stimulate RANKL mRNA\nexpression even at a ratio of 100:1. The effect of S. pyogenes\nJRS4 supernatant on RANKL expression in osteoblasts was\nalso examined. Bacterial supernatant was prepared from cul-\nture supernatant of S. pyogenes JRS4 and added to osteoblast\ncultures. No stimulation of RANKL mRNA expression in os-\nteoblasts was observed at concentrations of 10 to 50 �g of total\nprotein per ml of osteoblast culture (data not shown).\n\nPrevious investigations have demonstrated that protein F1\nmediates cellular invasion by S. pyogenes JRS4 (13, 21, 24). We\ninvestigated the adherence of and invasion by isogenic mutant\nstrains JRS145 (M6� F1�) and SAM1 (M6� F1�). An adhe-\nsion study revealed that the number of JRS145 cells that ad-\nhered to osteoblasts was significantly lower than the number of\nwild-type JRS4 cells that adhered to osteoblasts (Fig. 5A). On\nthe other hand, invasion by SAM1 was significantly reduced\nand was �10% of the invasion by JRS4 (Fig. 5B). These results\nsuggest that F1 protein plays an important role in the invasion\nof osteoblasts by S. pyogenes. The levels of RANKL expression\n\nFIG. 1.

The levels of expression of\nRANKL mRNA in osteoblasts infected with these strains were\nfour- to fivefold greater than the levels of expression in un-\nstimulated osteoblasts. Thus, the presence of M6 protein or\nprotein F1 of S. pyogenes was not found to be essential for\nRANKL expression in infected osteoblasts.\n\nS. pyogenes infection results in phosphorylation of the mouse\n\nosteoblast p38 MAPK. It was reported previously that infection\nby several pathogens induces phosphorylation of several types\nof MAPKs. Western blot analysis with antibodies specific for\nactivated forms of MAPKs was performed to study down-\nstream signaling that allowed the synthesis of RANKL. Osteo-\nblasts infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 at an MOI of 10:1 exhib-\nited an increase in p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 7A).\nWestern blot analysis with anti-phospho-p38 MAPK demon-\nstrated that p38 MAPK was phosphorylated for 60 min follow-\ning infection.

The level of phos-\nphorylation did not change during the infection period. In\ncontrast to phosphorylation of ERK1/2, phosphorylation of\nJNK was not detectable (Fig. 7B). Western blotting with anti-\nbodies against total JNK suggested that the lower-molecular-\nmass JNK protein (46 kDa) was not present in osteoblasts,\nbecause only a higher-molecular-mass protein (54 kDa) was\nvisible. Treatment of osteoblasts with the p38 MAPK inhibitor\nSB203580 (5 �M) resulted in a reduction in RANKL mRNA\nexpression in osteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 (Fig.\n8). These results suggested that phosphorylation of p38 MAPK\nis involved in the up-regulation of RANKL expression in os-\nteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis study demonstrated for the first time that viable S.\npyogenes is a potent stimulant in induction of RANKL produc-\ntion by osteoblasts. S. pyogenes infection induced transcrip-\ntional regulation of the RANKL gene. An increase in RANKL\nmRNA was detectable 3 h after infection, and there was a four-\nto fivefold increase 6 h after infection. RANKL is a potent\ncytokine that stimulates differentiation of osteoclasts together\nwith macrophage colony-stimulating factor (18, 27, 34). This\ncytokine is produced by activated osteoblasts, as well as by\nactivated T cells, and is an activating agent involved in bone\ndestruction (17, 18, 27, 28, 34). Since RANKL-deficient mice\nshow severe osteopetrosis, RANKL appears to be essential in\nosteoclastogenesis (18). Furthermore, Kotake et al. (19) re-\nported that RANKL is involved in bone destruction in patients\n\nwith rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, we have found that S.\npyogenes infection induces bacterial arthritis in mice; in the\ninfected joints, significant increases in the level of RANKL, as\nwell as in the levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1� and\nIL-6, were observed (submitted for publication). Therefore,\nRANKL in infected joints may lead to bone destruction in\nbacterial septic arthritis.\n\nRT-PCR revealed that S. pyogenes infection induced up-\nregulation of the mRNAs of both IL-6 and TGF-� (Fig. 2).\nBoth of these cytokines are involved in osteoclastogenesis and\nstimulate osteoclast formation and differentiation (14, 27).\nWith regard to cytokine production by osteoblasts, infection by\nviable S. aureus was reported to induce granulocyte-macroph-\nage colony-stimulating factor, IL-6, and IL-12 expression by\nhuman and mouse osteoblasts (4, 5). IL-6 and IL-12 produced\nby infected osteoblasts should play an important role in initi-\nating immune responses after S. aureus infection in osteomy-\nelitis. Together with these findings, the results described here\nprovide evidence that cytokines produced by osteoblasts may\ncontribute to the inflammatory reactions in the joints during\nseptic arthritis. Experimental septic arthritis induced by S. au-\nreus and group B S. agalactiae accompanies an increase in the\nlocal synthesis of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-� (30, 32), but the\nsignificance of RANKL in arthritis has not been examined.\nThis is simply because RANKL was discovered only recently.\nFurther investigations should be performed to establish the\n\nFIG. 5.

Total RNA was extracted and\nsubjected to RT-PCR for RANKL and �-actin analysis (A) and RANKL\nmRNA was quantified by real-time PCR (B).

An\nasterisk indicates that the P value was �0.05 for a comparison with the\nRANKL mRNA level in cells cultured in the absence of the stimulant.\n\n952 OKAHASHI ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nrole of RANKL in septic arthritis and other inflammatory bone\ndiseases.\n\nNakagawa et al. (21) reported that invasion of epithelial cells\nby S. pyogenes triggers apoptosis of the infected cells. This\napoptosis is strongly related to the F1-mediated invasion, be-\ncause F1-deficient isogenic mutant strain SAM1 does not in-\nduce apoptosis of infected cells. Induction of apoptosis re-\nquires a higher S. pyogenes MOI. We found that infection by S.\npyogenes at a higher MOI, such as 50:1, also resulted in death\nof osteoblasts (data not shown). We found in this study that S.\npyogenes JRS4 (M6� F1�) adhered to and invaded osteoblastic\n\ncells. Since the invasive ability of SAM1 was weak (Fig. 5), the\nprotein F1 molecule may play an important role in invasion of\nosteoblasts, as well as epithelial cells, by S. pyogenes. However,\nexpression of RANKL mRNA did not change in SAM1-in-\nfected or JRS145 (M6� F1�)-infected osteoblasts (Fig. 6),\nsuggesting that adhesion or invasion is not a key step in induc-\ning up-regulation of RANKL. These results suggest that the\nability of S. pyogenes to attach and the ability of S. pyogenes to\ninvade are not relevant for RANKL induction.\n\nHow does S. pyogenes induce RANKL production in osteo-\nblasts? It was reported previously that adherence of S. pyogenes\ntriggers a proinflammatory response in keratinocytes (33). In-\nfection of mouse and human osteoblasts by S. aureus was found\nto induce IL-6 and IL-12 production (4). The production of\nthese cytokines may be related to internalization of S. aureus in\nthe osteoblasts, because UV-killed S. aureus was not a potent\ninducer of the cytokines. In this study, we also found that\nheat-inactivated S. pyogenes did not function as a potent in-\nducer of RANKL production (Fig. 4D). At this time, however,\nit is difficult to claim that bacterial internalization per se trig-\ngers the cytokine production in the osteoblasts, because F1-\ndeficient mutant SAM1 induced RANKL production compa-\nrable to that induced by the parent strain. In addition, culture\nsupernatant of S. pyogenes JRS4 did not stimulate expression\nof RANKL mRNA (data not shown). Therefore, an unknown\nnovel cell-associated molecule(s) of S. pyogenes may trigger\ncytokine production. It was reported previously that streptol-\nysin O from S. pyogenes and listeriolysin O from Listeria mono-\ncytogenes induce production of proinflammatory cytokines in\nkeratinocytes (25) and phosphorylation of MAPK in HeLa\ncells (29), respectively. In addition to streptolysin O, extracel-\nlular cysteine proteases from S. pyogenes have been reported to\ninduce proinflammatory responses in mammalian cells (6). The\npossible involvement of these exotoxins in cytokine production\nis now under investigation.\n\nA recent study suggested that various bacterial components,\n\nFIG. 7. Western blot analysis of phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and other signal proteins. Osteoblasts were infected with S. pyogenes JRS4 for\n0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at an MOI of 10. The phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK (A) and the phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 and JNK\n(B) were analyzed by Western blotting by using antibodies against phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-JNK, total p38 MAPK, total\nERK1/2, and total JNK.\n\nFIG. 8.

The results\nwere expressed as fold increases compared with the RANKL mRNA\nlevels in osteoblasts cultured without stimulants. The values are the\nmeans � standard deviations for triplicate assays. An asterisk indicates\nthat the P value was �0.05 for a comparison with the RANKL mRNA\nlevel in the cells infected with S. pyogenes in the absence of SB203580.\n\nVOL. 71, 2003 STREPTOCOCCI INDUCE RANKL PRODUCTION IN OSTEOBLASTS 953\n\n\n\nsuch as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), lipoteichoic acids, pepti-\ndoglycans, and lipoproteins, bind to toll-like receptors (TLRs)\non a wide range of eukaryotic cells (1). Such binding leads to\nactivation of NF-�B signaling pathways and to the release of\nboth inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines (1). Kiku-\nchi et al. (16) reported that LPS of gram-negative bacteria\ninduces RANKL gene expression in mouse osteoblasts via\nTLR4. They suggested that RANKL expression via the TLR\npathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of\nLPS-mediated bone disorders. By using RT-PCR, we also\nfound here that osteoblasts expressed mRNAs for TLR2,\nTLR4, and TLR5 (data not shown). Several bacterial compo-\nnents, such as M protein, peptidoglycan, or lipoteichoic acid of\nS. pyogenes, may bind to the TLRs and activate the signal\npathways in the osteoblasts. However, neither heat-inactivated\nwhole cells of S. pyogenes nor bacterial culture supernatant of\nS. pyogenes induced RANKL expression in osteoblasts. These\nresults suggest that the pathway to RANKL expression in os-\nteoblasts infected with S. pyogenes is not identical to that in\nosteoblasts stimulated by LPS of gram-negative bacteria. In\naddition, it has been reported that heat-inactivated S. pyogenes\nis able to induce TNF-� production in human monocytes (10).\nThe cellular responses of osteoblasts to heat-inactivated S.\npyogenes may be different from those of monocytes.\n\nIt has been recognized that MAPKs are key players in many\nhost cell signaling pathways (8). MAPKs are involved in cyto-\nkine responses, cytoskeletal reorganization, and stress re-\nsponses. Involvement of MAPKs in S. pyogenes infection has\nnot been demonstrated yet. In the present study, we found that\ninfection of S. pyogenes resulted in activation of the intracel-\nlular p38 MAPK signaling pathway (Fig. 7). In this regard,\nEllington et al. (11) reported recently that infection by S.\naureus induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in osteoblasts.\nThey also reported that S. aureus infection induces IL-6 and\nIL-12 production in osteoblasts. On the other hand, we found\nthat spontaneous phosphorylation of ERK1/2 occurs in osteo-\nblasts. The role of ERK1/2 in cytokine production in osteo-\nblasts is still unclear. It is possible that S. aureus triggers IL-6\nand IL-12 production via ERK1/2 pathways, whereas S. pyo-\ngenes induces RANKL production via p38 MAPK pathways. In\nthis regard, the p38 MAPK pathway was reported to regulate\nIL-6 synthesis in the MG-63 osteoblastic cell line in response to\nTNF-� (7). Although it is possible that S. pyogenes and S.\naureus stimulate independent signal pathways, the detailed sig-\nnal pathways involved in infection by these two bacterial spe-\ncies require further investigation.\n\nStimulation of local RANKL and other inflammatory medi-\nators is an important event in bone destruction (17, 18, 19, 27,\n28, 30). Clinically, infection by S. pyogenes causes two bone\ndiseases. One is a septic arthritis, and the other is a poststrep-\ntococcal reactive arthritis. Infiltration of immune cells, such as\nT and B cells, production of inflammatory cytokines, such as\nIL-1, and production of inflammatory mediators, such as\nPGE2, may be associated with these diseases. However, acti-\nvation of osteoblasts in infected bone tissue may be another\nimportant event. RANKL produced by activated osteoblasts\ninduces osteoclast differentiation or osteoclast-mediated bone\nresorption. IL-6 and TGF-� can directly or indirectly modulate\nthe activity of bone-resorptive osteoclasts (14, 27). The in-\ncreased production of these cytokines by infected osteoblasts\n\nmay play important roles in septic arthritis and poststreptococ-\ncal arthritis. Other inflammatory responses may be mediated in\nosteoblasts through infection by S. pyogenes. Techniques such\nas DNA microarray analysis should enable definition of genes\nthat are regulated in response to S. pyogenes infection. Such\ninformation should be useful in treating diseases such as septic\narthritis and poststreptococcal arthritis.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by grants-in-aid for scientific research\n12672026 and 14207074 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of\nScience, by health science research grant H12-shinko-27, and by a\ngrant from Japan Science and Technology Corporation.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
