ARTICLE Open Access\n\nLoss of plakoglobin promotes decreased cell-cell\ncontact, increased invasion, and breast cancer\ncell dissemination in vivo\nIngunn Holen1, Jacob Whitworth1, Faith Nutter1, Alyson Evans1, Hannah K Brown1, Diane V Lefley1, Ivana Barbaric2,\nMark Jones2 and Penelope D Ottewell1*\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: The majority of deaths from breast cancer are a result of metastases; however, little is understood\nabout the genetic alterations underlying their onset. Genetic profiling has identified the adhesion molecule\nplakoglobin as being three-fold reduced in expression in primary breast tumors that have metastasized compared\nwith nonmetastatic tumors. In this study, we demonstrate a functional role for plakoglobin in the shedding of\ntumor cells from the primary site into the circulation.\n\nMethods: We investigated the effects of plakoglobin knockdown on breast cancer cell proliferation, migration,\nadhesion, and invasion in vitro and on tumor growth and intravasation in vivo. MCF7 and T47D cells were stably\ntransfected with miRNA sequences targeting the plakoglobin gene, or scramble vector. Gene and protein\nexpression was monitored by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot. Cell proliferation,\nadhesion, migration, and invasion were measured by cell counting, flow cytometry, and scratch and Boyden\nChamber assays. For in vivo experiments, plakoglobin knockdown and control cells were inoculated into mammary\nfat pads of mice, and tumor growth, shedding of tumor cells into the bloodstream, and evidence of metastatic\nbone lesions were monitored with caliper measurement, flow cytometry, and microcomputed tomography (μCT),\nrespectively.\n\nResults: Plakoglobin and g-catenin expression were reduced by more than 80% in all knockdown cell lines used\nbut were unaltered after transfection with the scrambled sequence. Reduced plakoglobin resulted in significantly\nincreased in MCF7 and T47D cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, compared with control, with significantly more\ntumor cells being shed into the bloodstream of mice bearing plakoglobin knockdown tumors. In addition,\nplakoglobin knockdown cells showed a >250% increase in invasion through basement membrane and exhibited\nreduced cell-to-cell adhesion compared with control cells.\n\nConclusion: Decreased plakoglobin expression increases the invasive behavior of breast cancer cells. This is the first\ndemonstration of a functional role for plakoglobin/g-catenin in the metastatic process, indicating that this molecule\nmay represent a target for antimetastatic therapies.\n\nIntroduction\nBreast cancer is a highly metastatic disease, and once\nmetastases are established, this condition becomes\nincurable. In 65% to 75% of patients with advanced\nbreast cancer, skeletal involvement is present, with\n\nmedian survival rates of approximately 2 years after\ninitial diagnosis of bone metastasis [1]. However, little is\nunderstood about the genetic alterations that are\nresponsible for changing a nonmetastatic tumor into a\ntumor with a metastatic phenotype. Identification of\nthese genes and their functional significance is therefore\nessential for the development of novel therapeutic\nregimens.* Correspondence: P.D.Ottewell@sheffield.ac.uk1Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, University of Sheffield, Medical School,\n\nBeech Hill Road, Sheffield, S10 2RX, UK\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nHolen et al.

Furthermore, expression of\nplakoglobin is reduced on autocrine production of\nhuman growth hormone, which is associated with\nincreased breast tumor cell invasion in vivo [3]. Plako-\nglobin resides on the same locus as the BRCA1 gene,\n17q12-17q21, and patients showing loss of heterozygos-\nity of BRCA1 also show loss of heterozygosity of plako-\nglobin [4,5]. Patients with this mutation have an 80%\nchance of developing breast cancer, further suggesting a\nrole for plakoglobin in the etiology of breast cancer [6].\nFor metastases to develop, tumor cells must first\n\nacquire a motile phenotype and migrate toward the\nbasement membrane. Breakdown of the extracellular\nmatrix then allows the cells to invade the surrounding\ntissue and enter the bloodstream or lymphatic system.\nOnce in the circulation, cells must evade the host\nimmune system before exiting the vasculature by\nadhering to the endothelium of the target site. Finally,\ntumor cells implant at a secondary site, forming a\nmetastases [7]. Therefore, genetic alterations that lead\nto disruption of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions\nmay play a role in the initiation of cancer metastases,\nfacilitating tumor-cell dissemination from the primary\nsite into the circulation.\nPlakoglobin encodes for the cell-adhesion protein g-\n\ncatenin [8,9]. In conjunction with b-catenin, g-catenin\nlinks e-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton, forming inter-\ncellular cadherin-catenin complexes, a key part of the\nextracellular matrix [10]. In this study, we aimed to\nestablish whether plakoglobin has a functional role in\nthe metastatic cascade in breast cancer. We investigated\nthe effects of reducing plakoglobin expression on the\ninvasive properties of breast cancer cells by using\nmiRNA technology. We have designed small ssRNA\nsequences of approximately 22 nucleotides in length\nthat trigger gene silencing through specific cleavage and\nRNA degradation to target plakoglobin exclusively\n[11,12]. We compared the effects of reduced plakoglobin\nexpression in weakly metastatic MCF7 and nonmeta-\nstatic T47D breast cancer cells on growth, adhesion,\nmigration, and invasion in vitro [13-16]. In addition, we\nanalyzed tumor growth and intravasation from the\nmouse mammary fat pad into the circulation in vivo.\nOur data show that loss of plakoglobin promotes the\nprometastatic phenotype of breast cancer cells, indicat-\ning that this molecule may be a potential prognostic fac-\ntor of increased risk of cancer progression as well as a\ntherapeutic target.\n\nMaterials and methods\nGeneration of plakoglobin knockdown cell lines\nPre-miRNA expression cassettes were designed to target\nthe plakoglobin gene by using the BLOCK-iT Pol II miR\nRNAi Expression vector kits and manufacturer’s instruc-\ntions. In brief, complementary DNA oligos containing\nfour-nucleotide overhangs were designed by using the\nRNAi Designer online tool (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,\nUSA) and synthesised by using the following primer\npairs: 2 = Forward (5’ to 3’): TGC TGA TGA GAT\nGCA CAA TGG CCG ACG TTT TGG CCA CTG ACT\nGAC GTC GGC CAG TGC ATC TCA T Reverse (5’ to\n3’): CCT GAT GAG ATG CAC TGG CCG ACG TCA\nGTC AGT GGC CAA AAC GTC GGC CAT TGT\nGCA TCT CAT C. 3 = Forward (5’ to 3’): TGC TGA\nTTG CTG GGA CAC ACG GAT AGG TTT TGG\nCCA CTG ACT GAC CTA TCC GTG TCC CAG CAA\nT Reverse (5’ to 3’): CCT GAT TGC TGG GAC ACG\nGAT AGG TCA GTC AGT GGC CAA AAC CTA\nTCC GTG TGT CCC AGC AAT C. Double-stranded\noligos were then cloned into pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-\nmiR expression vectors by using T4 DNA Ligase before\nbeing transformed into One Shot TOP10 Competent\nEscherichia coli. Transformed E. coli was plated onto LB\nagar, Miller (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) containing 100\nμg/ml nucleoside antibiotic (Blasticidin; Invitrogen). To\ncheck accuracy of cloning and transformation DNA\nfrom five individual Blasticidin-resistant colonies per\noriginal double-stranded oligo was purified by using\nPureLink HQ Mini Plasmid purification Kit (Invitrogen),\nsequenced in house by using the random shotgun\nmethod by the Genomics core facility, University of\nSheffield, as previously described; data were analyzed by\nusing Finch TV software and data cross referenced to\nthe plakoglobin sequence on Genbank [Genbank:\nAC000149] [17,18]. To enable lentiviral transfection, the\npre-miRNA expression cassettes were then transferred\nto pLenti6/V5-DST destination vector (as described in\nBLOCK-iT Lentiviral PolII miRNAi Expression System\nmanual, available online) [19]. Pre-miRNA cassettes and\nViraPower (Invitrogen) were co-transfected into a\n293FT donor cell line by using Lipofectamine 2000\n(Invitrogen) to produce a replication-incompetent lenti-\nvirus. Lentivirus containing pre-miRNA cassettes or\ncontrol (scramble miRNA sequence) were used to trans-\nduce the human breast cancer cell lines T47D and\nMCF7 to produce three plakoglobin-knockdown and\ncontrol cell lines.\n\nReal-time PCR\nTotal RNA was extracted with Trizol (Invitrogen), before\nreverse transcription by using superscript III (Invitrogen);\nthe resulting cDNA was used as a template for real-time\n\nHolen et al.

Cells from three separate in vitro\nexperiments or five tumors per in vivo group were ana-\nlyzed separately. Relative mRNA expression of plakoglo-\nbin (Hs00984034_m1; Applied Biosystems), e-Cadherin\n(Hs1013953_m1), or NM23-H1 (Hs00264824_m1) were\ncompared with the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Hs99999905_m1) by\nusing an ABI 7900 PCR system (Perkin-Elmer, Applied\nBiosystems) and Taqman universal master mix (Applied\nBiosystems). Relative mRNA was determined by using\nthe formula 2-ΔCT (CT; cycle threshold) where ΔCT =\nCT (target gene) - CT (GAPDH).\n\nWestern blotting\nProtein was extracted from pooled cells from three\nseparate in vitro experiments and tumor samples from\nindividual mice by using a Mammalian cell lysis kit\n(Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK). Ten micrograms of protein\nwas run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred\nonto an imibilon-P nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore).\nNonspecific binding was blocked with 1% casein (Vector\nLaboratories) before incubation with mouse monoclonal\nantibodies specific for gamma-catenin [15F11] (1:500),\ne-cadherin [HECD-1] (1:1,000), or GAPDH [6C5]\n(1:1,000) for 16 hours at 4°C (all primary antibodies\nwere from AbCam, Cambridge, UK). Secondary antibody\nwas sheep anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP;\n1:15,000), and HRP was detected with the Supersignal\nchemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce). Band quantifi-\ncation was carried out by using Quantity One software\n(Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) and normalized to\nRNA polymerase.\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nImmunohistochemistry was performed on 4% formalin-\nfixed cells grown on chamber slides. Primary antibodies\nrabbit anti-g catenin (2309s, 1:500 dilution; New England\nBiolabs), rat anti-e-cadherin (DECMA-1, 1:50; AbCam),\nand rabbit anti- b-catenin (E247, 1:50; AbCam). Cells were\nsubsequently incubated with biotin anti-rabbit (for g-cate-\nnin and b-catenin at 1:100) and biotin anti-ray (for e-cad-\nherin at 1:100). Visualization followed incubation with\nfluorescence avidin (Vector A-2001) at 1:250.\n\nnalysis of prometastatic parameters in vitro\nAll cell lines were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemen-\nted with 10% FCS (Gibco Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and\n50 mg/ml blasticidin, 24 hours before experimental proto-\ncol cells were transferred to RMPI-1640 supplemented\nwith 10% FCS in the absence of blasticidin. All experi-\nments were carried out in triplicate and repeated 3 times.\nCell proliferation was monitored every 24 hours for\n96 hours by cell counting with a 1/400 mm2 hemocyt-\nometer (Hawksley, Lancing, UK), and a sample of cells\n\nwas taken at each time point for Western blotting and rt-\nPCR to check the stability of the siRNA knockdown.\nCell-cell adhesion was monitored by using two meth-\n\nods: (a) the ability of cells to form three-dimensional\nspheroids after seeding of 2,000 cells into a semisolid\nmedium. Medium consisted of 1.5% agarose (Invitrogen)\nin RPMI media supplemented with 1% fungizone\n(Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich).\nThe spheroid area was calculated 10 and 21 days after\nseeding by using ImageJ software (ImageJ v1.44;\nNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA); and\n(b) the ability of cells to bind to a confluent monolayer\nof the corresponding cell type; cells were cultured to\nform a confluent monolayer, and 20,000 cells of the\nsame type (plakoglobin knockdown or control) were\nlabeled with 1 nM DiD (Invitrogen, Molecular Probes)\nfor 30 minutes in serum-free media before being seeded\nonto the equivalent confluent cells. Two hours after co-\nculture, media containing floating cells were discarded,\nand adherent cells were trypsinized. The number of\nDiD-labeled cells that had adhered to nonlabeled cells of\nthe same cell type was analyzed at 644 nM with flow\ncytometry.\nTumor cell invasion was assessed by using 6-mm\n\nTranswell plates with an 8.0-μm pore size (Costar;\nCorning Incorporated, Corning, NY, USA) either\nuncoated or coated with basement membrane matrix\n(Matrigel; Invitrogen). Cells were seeded into the inner\nchamber at a density of 2.5 × 105 and 5 × 105 per assay\nin RPMI without FCS, and RPMI supplemented with\nFCS was added to the outer chamber. Twenty-four\nhours after seeding, cells were removed from the top\nsurface of the membrane, and cells that had invaded\nthrough the pores were stained with hematoxylin and\neosin. Invasion was calculated as the percentage of cells\nthat invaded through basement membrane compared\nwith cells that had moved to the underside of uncoated\nplates. Numbers of cells were counted by using a DMRB\nmicroscope (Leitz, Germany) and OsteoMeasure XP\nv1.2.0.1 program (Osteometrics, Decatur, GA, USA).\nMigration of tumor cells was investigated by analyzing\n\nwound closure: Cells were seeded onto 0.2% gelatin;\nonce confluent, 10 µg/ml mitomycin C was added, and\na 50-μm scratch made across the monolayer. The per-\ncentage of wound closure was measured at 24, 48, and\n72 hours. To monitor migration of individual tumor\ncells, a 50-μm scratch was made across the monolayer\nof confluent cells. Images were taken every hour for\n72 hours by time-lapse microscopy by using a CTR7000\ninverted microscope; images were captured by using\nLAS-AF v2.1.1 software (Leica Applications Suite; Leica\nMicrosystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and analyzed by Ima-\ngeJ software (ImageJ v1.44; National Institutes of\nHealth).\n\nHolen et al.

Seven\ndays after the pellet had been implanted, 1 × 105 MCF7\n3c-3 or control cells (n =15 per group) or 1 × 105 T47D\n2A-4 or control cells (n = 10 per group) in 20 μl (33%\nMatrigel: 66% PBS) were inoculated into the fifth and 10th\n\nmammary fat pads. Tumor volume was measured twice\nper week by using calipers. For differences in tumor\ngrowth, 10 mice per group were culled by cervical disloca-\ntion 32 or 34 days after tumor cell implantation. For analy-\nsis of circulating tumor cells, five mice per group bearing\nMCF7 3c-3 or control cells were culled once tumors were\nof equal size (1 cm3 ). Tumors were placed in cell-lysis\nbuffer (MCL-1KT mammalian cell-lysis kit (Sigma, Poole,\nUK)), and protein was extracted according to the manu-\nfacturer’s instructions. Experiments were carried out with\nUK Home Office approval under project license 40/2343.\nIsolation of circulating tumor cells\nWhole blood was analyzed from five mice per group bear-\ning 1-cm3 tumors from MCF7 3C-3 or control cells.\nWhole blood from three naïve mice and parental MCF7\ncells were used for staining controls by using the protocol\ndescribed in Ottewell et al. [20], with the exception that\nthe primary antibody used was anti-human EpCAM anti-\nbody directly conjugated to phycoerythrin (PE) (Clone\n1B7; 1:50; eBioscience, Hatfield, UK). PE-positive cells\nwere plated directly into a 96-well tissue-culture plate\n(one well per group) (Nunc, Rochester, UK) on a MoFlow\nHigh performance cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Cam-\nbridge, UK). PE fluorescence was detected with a 555LP\ndichroic long-pass and a 580/30-nm band-pass filter.\nAcquisition and analysis of cells was performed by using\nSummit 4.3 software. After sorting, cells were cultured in\nRPMI medium supplemented with 10% FCS.\n\nMicrocomputed tomography imaging\nMicrocomputed tomography analysis of tibiae and femurs\nwere carried out by using a Skyscan 1172 x-ray-computed\nmicrotomograph (Skyscan, Aartselaar, Belgium) equipped\nwith an x-ray tube (voltage, 49 kV; current, 200 μA) and a\n0.5-mm aluminum filter. Pixel size was set to 4.37 μm, and\nscanning was initiated from the top of the proximal tibia\nor the distal femur. For each sample, 275 cross-sectional\nimages were reconstructed with NRecon software (version\n1.4.3, Skyscan). After reconstruction, the volume of inter-\nest was defined on the two-dimensional acquisition images\nby using a hand-drawing tool. Trabecular bone volume\nfraction (BV/TV), the ratio of the volume of bone present\n(BV) to the volume of the cancellous space (TV), was\n\ncalculated for 1 mm of the bone, starting 0.2 mm from the\ngrowth plate. 3D modeling and analysis were performed\nby using CTAn (version 1.5.0.2) and CTvol (version\n1.9.4.1) software (Skyscan).\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical analysis was carried out by using analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) followed by the Dunnett two-sided\nmultiple comparison test. All P values are two-sided.\n\nResults\nPlakoglobin expression in parental cell lines\nThe main aim of this study was to investigate whether\nexpression of the cell-adhesion molecule plakoglobin\nplays a role in the dissemination of breast cancer cells\ninto the circulation. We first compared the expression of\nplakoglobin in weakly metastatic MCF7, nonmetastatic\nT47D, and highly metastatic HeLa, MDA-MB-436, and\nMDA-MB-231 cell lines [13-16,21-24]. Real-time PCR\nanalysis showed significantly higher levels of plakoglobin\nin MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells compared with\nHeLa, MDA-MB-231, or MDA-MB-426 (P < 0.0001 for\nT47D cells and P < 0.005 for MCF7 cells compared with\nHeLa, MDA-MB-231, or MDA-436) (Figure 1A).\nFurthermore, significantly higher levels of plakoglobin\nwere detected in T47D cells compared with MCF7 (P <\n0.005). In all cell lines tested, plakoglobin gene expression\ncorrelated with g-catenin protein expression (Figure 1C).\nThe protein product of plakoglobin, g-catenin, com-\n\nplexes with e-cadherin to form intercellular bonds; we\ntherefore examined the gene and protein expression of e-\ncadherin in the highly metastatic versus weakly and non-\nmetastatic cell lines. Real-time PCR and Western blot\nanalysis showed high levels of e-cadherin in T47D and\nMCF7 cells, whereas this gene was undetectable in HeLa,\nMDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-436 cells (Figure 1B).\nSimilar to plakoglobin expression, significantly less e-cad-\nherin was detected in MCF7 cells compared with T47D\n(P < 0.005). As both plakoglobin and e-cadherin were\ndetectable in MCF7 and T47D cells, these cell lines were\nselected as models for investigating the effects of reduced\nplakoglobin on parameters associated with metastases\nafter targeted miRNA knockdown.\n\nEffects of miRNA transfection on plakoglobin expression\nTo produce T47D and MCF7 cells with reduced levels\nof plakoglobin, pre-miRNA expression cassettes were\ndesigned to target the plakoglobin gene, and control\ncells were produced by using scramble sequence. Pre-\nmiRNA cassettes were transfected into MCF7 and T47D\ncells, and six clones from each transfection were tested\nfor plakoglobin expression. Transfection with scramble\nsequence had no effect on plakoglobin expression;\n\nHolen et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R86\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R86\n\nPage 4 of 14\n\n\n\nhowever, transfection with miRNA 2 resulted in a 58%\nto 81% reduction in plakoglobin expression in MCF7\ncells (Figure 2A) and a 0 to 90% reduction in expression\nin T47D cells (Figure 2C). Transfection miRNA cassette\n3 resulted in a 55% to 83% reduction in plakoglobin\nexpression in MCF7 cells (Figure 2B). MCF7 clone 2A-1\nfrom cassette 2 and clone 3C-3 from cassette 3 showed\na >80% reduction in plakoglobin, and T47D clone 2A-1\nshowed a 90% reduction in plakoglobin compared with\nscramble sequence; therefore, these clones were selected\nfor use in the subsequent experiments. In all cases, the\nreduction in plakoglobin expression was translated into\nreduced g-catenin levels (Figure 1D), with high levels of\ng-catenin detected on the cell membrane of control\nMCF7 and T47D cells and reduced staining detected on\nthe cell membranes of plakoglobin-knockdown cell lines\n(T47D cells shown in Figure 1E).\nReal-time PCR analysis showed that knockdown of pla-\n\nkoglobin had no effect on total e-cadherin (Figure 2A, B,\nC). However, protein levels were decreased by 6% in\nMCF7 2A-1 and 6.5% in 3C-3 cells, whereas e-cadherin\nwas increased by 13% in T47D 2A-4 cells, when normal-\nized to RNA polymerase, compared with control (Figure\n2D). Importantly, knockdown of plakoglobin resulted in\nthe translocation of the cell-cell adhesion proteins e-cad-\nherin and b-catenin from the cell membrane into the\nnucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 2E).\n\nReduced expression of plakoglobin increases proliferation\nReduced expression of plakoglobin resulted in a signifi-\ncant increase in proliferation of both MCF7 and T47D\ncells. In MCF7 cells a >80% reduction in plakoglobin led\nto a 2.5-fold increase in proliferation at 72 hours and a\nthreefold increase at 96 hours compared with scramble\nsequence, with no significant difference between miRNA\nclones detected (P < 0.005 at 72 hours and P < 0.001 at\n96 hours for 2A-1 and 3C-3) (Figure 3A). In T47D cells\nin which plakoglobin expression was reduced by 90%,\nproliferation was further increased with a twofold\nincrease in numbers of cells at 48 hours (P < 0.005), a\nthreefold increase at 72 hours (P < 0.005) and a fourfold\nincrease at 96 hours (P < 0.0001) compared with control\n(Figure 3B). Furthermore, T47D 2A-4 cells showed sig-\nnificantly increased proliferation compared with control\nthan did MCF7 2A-1 or 3C-3 clones (P < 0.005).\nTo ensure that miRNA knockdown was stable over\n\ntime, the levels of plakoglobin in tumor cells were ana-\nlyzed at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours for each cell-prolifera-\ntion study. Figure 1C and 1D show that plakoglobin is\nconstitutively reduced in MCF7 and T47D miRNA\nknockdown cells compared with control, and these cells\nwere used in the subsequent experiments.\n\nM\nC\n\nF\n7\n\nT\n4\n7\nD\n\nH\ne\nL\n\na\n\nM\nD\n\nA\n-2\n\n3\n1\n\nGamma catenin\n\nE-cadherin\n\nRNA polymerase\n\nA)\n\nB)\n\nC)\n\nFigure 1 Comparative expression of adhesion molecules .\nRelative expression of (A) plakoglobin and (B) e-cadherin compared\nwith GAPDH ± SEM for T47D, HeLa, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and\nMCF7 cells, as assessed with real-time PCR.

To investigate the effect of plakoglobin\nexpression on cell-cell adhesion, we analyzed the ability\nof control and knockdown cell lines to form three-\ndimensional spheroid structures in agar. Figure 3E\nshows control MCF7 cells growing as spheroids on agar,\ndemonstrating that these cells were able to form exten-\nsive bonds with surrounding cells. Control T47D, which\nexpressed sixfold more plakoglobin than did control\nMCF7 cells (see Figure 1A), grew as a much tighter\nspheroid. Reducing plakoglobin levels resulted in a com-\nplete loss of spheroid formation in MCF7 cells; both\n2A-1 and 3C-3 cells grew as monolayers across the sur-\nface of the agar, indicating that these cell lines no longer\nform strong intercellular bonds. Similarly, reducing pla-\nkoglobin in T47D cells resulted in decreased cell-cell\nadhesion, with 2A-4 cells growing in a less-compact\nspheroid formation than control cells and cells at the\nedge of the spheroid growing in a monolayer. The\nreduced cell-cell adhesion after loss of plakoglobin was\nconfirmed by measuring the ability of DiD-labeled con-\ntrol and knockdown cells to adhere to a confluent cell\nmonolayer of the corresponding cell type. Measurement\nof the percentage of cells binding to a monolayer after 2\nhours (Figure 3F) showed that 19.23% ± 2.6% of DiD-\nlabeled MCF7 control cells bound to unlabeled control\ncells, compared with 2.71% ± 0.30% MCF7 2A-1 cells\nbinding to unlabeled 2A-1 cells and 2.54% ± 0.26% 3C-3\ncells binding to unlabeled cells. In addition, T47D con-\ntrol cells were significantly more adhesive than T47D\n2A-4 cells; 19.01% ± 2.79% of control cells adhered to a\nmonolayer of the same cell type compared with 4.21% ±\n1.06% of 2A-4 cells (P < 0.005), demonstrating that\nreduced expression of plakoglobin significantly reduces\ncell-cell adhesion.\n\nEffects of plakoglobin expression on tumor cell invasion\nand migration\nAs invasion of cancer cells into the surrounding tissue\nand vasculature is an essential step for initiation of\nmetastasis, we next investigated whether altering plako-\nglobin levels affects invasion through a basement mem-\nbrane. Reducing expression of plakoglobin significantly\nincreased MCF7 and T47D tumor-cell invasion through\n8-µm pores in a Matrigel-coated membrane at 24 hours:\n89.8% of MCF7 2A-1 cells and 86.5% of MCF7 3C-3\ncells that migrated trough an uncoated membrane also\ninvaded through Matrigel compared with 36.6% of\nMCF7 control cells (P < 0.001 for both knockdown cell\nlines compared with control). Similar proinvasive effects\nwere also observed in plakoglobin-knockdown T47D\ncells: 63.6% of T47D 2A-4 cells invaded through\n\nMatrigel compared with just 1.3% of T47D control cells\n(P < 0.001; 2A-4 versus control) (Figure 4B). In the\nabsence of a basement membrane, plakoglobin-knock-\ndown cells were significantly more migratory than were\ncontrol cells (250 ± 50.4 MCF7 2A-1 cells and 248 ±\n54.2 MCF7 3C-3 cells migrated through 8-µm pores\ncompared with 1.3 ± 2.1 MCF7 control cells) over a 24-\nhour period. These data imply that reduced expression\nof plakoglobin promotes cell migration toward a chemo-\ntactic agent.\nAs knockdown cells had increased ability to invade\n\nthrough an artificial basement membrane compared with\ncontrol, we used a wound-healing assay to investigate\nwhether plakoglobin expression altered cell motility in the\nabsence of a chemotactic agent. No significant differences\nin cell motility were observed between MCF7 control and\nplakoglobin-knockdown cells over a period of 72 hours\n(Figure 4D), with cell tracking showing individual cells\nmoving at an average of (23 ± 9 μm/h) for control; (27 ± 8\nμm/h) for 2A-1 and (29 ± 9 μm/h) for 3C-3. In contrast,\nsignificantly increased cellular movement was observed in\nT47D 2A-4 cells compared with control; after 24 hours,\n29.6% ± 3.2% of the wound was closed in 2A-4 cells com-\npared with 3.3% ± 2.4% for control (P < 0.0001), increasing\nto 57.8% ± 4.2% in 2A-4 and 16.7% ± 3.5% in control cells\nafter 48 hours (P < 0.0001; Figure 4E). Average cell move-\nment measured by individual cell tracking was (11.5 ± 4.8\nμm/h) for control and (18.6 ± 8.4 μm/h) for 2A-4 cells,\nclearly demonstrating that loss of plakoglobin expression\nis associated with a significant increase in cell motility,\npotentially leading to increased tumor cell spread.\n\nEffects of plakoglobin on expression of the tumor-\nsuppressor molecule NM23-H1\nReduced expression of NM23-H1 has been shown to\ndisrupt cell-cell adhesion mediated by e-cadherin, result-\ning in b-catenin nuclear translocation [25]. Furthermore,\nsilencing of this gene promotes cellular scattering, moti-\nlity, and extracellular matrix invasion [26]. We therefore\ninvestigated the effects of plakoglobin knockdown on\nexpression of NM23-H1. As shown in Figure 4E redu-\ncing expression of plakoglobin by >80% resulted in a sig-\nnificant decrease of NM23-H1 in MCF7 2A-1 cells (P <\n0.005) and T47D 2A-4 (P < 0.005) cells. In contrast,\nexpression of NM23-H1 was not significantly decreased\nin MCF7 3C-3 cells (P = 0.08 compared with control),\nimplying that prometastatic effects seen after plakoglo-\nbin knockdown may not be due to reduced expression\nof MN23-H1.\n\nEffects of plakoglobin on tumor cell growth and\ndissemination in vivo\nAs the in vitro data showed that reduced plakoglobin\nexpression increased the prometastatic phenotype of\n\nHolen et al.

At 32 days after\ninoculation of tumor cells, MCF7 3C-3 tumors mea-\nsured 281.43 ± 54.31 mm3, and control tumors mea-\nsured 184.21 ± 34.93 mm3 (P < 0.001), with plakoglobin\nexpression accounting for 30.7% of the total variance.\nFurthermore, mammary fat pad inoculation of T47D\ncells resulted in a 55-fold increase in growth of T47D\n2A-4 cells compared with control cells (Figure 5C).\nReal-time PCR analysis of tumors after extraction\n\nconfirmed that plakoglobin expression remained sup-\npressed in knockdown cells in vivo (Figure 5B and 5C).\nMCF7 cells have previously been shown to home to\n\nand grow in mouse long bones when inoculated directly\ninto the bloodstream [27]. We therefore analyzed the\nlong bones of tumor-bearing mice for evidence of meta-\nstatic tumor growth. Microcomputed tomography analy-\nsis of tibiae and femurs from mice bearing MCF7 cells\nconfirmed that no evidence existed of osteolytic lesions\nor tumor-induced bone loss in any mice bearing mam-\nmary fat pad tumors. In the absence of late-stage metas-\ntases (tumor in bone), we measured the effects of\naltered plakoglobin expression on an early metastatic\nevent by comparing the number of tumor cells in the\n\nFigure 5 Effects of plakoglobin expression on tumor growth in vivo.

Blood from tumor-free animals was\nused as a negative control. Mice bearing 1 cc MCF7 3C-\n3 tumors had >2.5 times more tumor cells per millilitre\nof blood than did mice with 1-cc MCF7 control tumors,\nimplying that reduced plakoglobin increases tumor cell\n\nshedding from the primary site into the circulation. No\ncolonies formed by day 7 after plating of the 165\nEpCAM-positive cells isolated from MCF7 control sam-\nples or tumor-free controls (Figure 6B). In contrast, 19\ncolonies grew from a total of 522 cells isolated from\nMCF7 3C-3 blood samples, showing that the EpCAM-\npositive population isolated from animals with plakoglo-\nbin knockdown tumors contains increased numbers of\nviable tumor cells.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we established that loss of plakoglobin\nleads to significant changes in breast cancer cell pheno-\ntypes, indicative of increased capacity for invasive\ngrowth. Accumulating evidence suggests that adhesive\ninteractions are critical in the process of metastatic\ntumor dissemination and that adhesion molecules can\nact as both positive and negative modulators of the\nmetastatic process [reviewed in [28]]. The g-catenin-e-\ncadherin complex promotes homotypic tumor cell adhe-\nsion, maintaining intercellular contacts that confine cells\nto the primary tumor site. Many studies have shown a\ncorrelation between reduced e-cadherin expression and\nincreased metastasis both in laboratory models and in\nclinical samples; however, a direct functional role of\ng-catenin in this process has not been shown [29-33].\nEvidence from clinical studies suggests that reduced\nexpression of plakoglobin in human breast cancers is\nassociated with increased tumor progression and adverse\nclinical outcome [34-36]. Additionally, translocation of\ng-catenin from the membrane to the cytoplasm has\nbeen shown in breast cancers with a more-aggressive\nphenotype [37]. Fitting with our hypothesis that reduced\nplakoglobin expression increases the metastatic pheno-\ntype of cancer cells, we observed very low levels of pla-\nkoglobin in the highly metastatic cancer cell lines:\nMDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, and HeLa, higher levels\nof plakoglobin in weakly metastatic MCF7 cells, and\nvery high levels in nonmetastatic T47D cells. In accor-\ndance with previously published studies of human breast\ncancer biopsies, we found that cells with low levels of\nplakoglobin expressed low levels of e-cadherin, and sig-\nnificantly more e-cadherin was detectable in nonmeta-\nstatic cell lines. Interestingly, levels of plakoglobin and\ne-cadherin not only correlated with each other, but also\nappeared to correlate with the metastatic potential of\nthe cell lines tested, implying that loss of this catenin-\ncadherin complex is directly involved in the metastatic\nprocess.\nIn the current study, we investigated the specific\n\neffects of reduced plakoglobin expression on tumor cell\nmetastasis. Breast cancer metastasis is initiated by the\ntransition of epithelial cancer cells to a mesenchymal\nphenotype. We demonstrated that miRNA silencing of\n\nFigure 6 Effects of plakoglobin expression on tumor cell\nshedding into the bloodstream.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R86\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/3/R86\n\nPage 11 of 14\n\n\n\nplakoglobin causes translocation of intercellular adhesion\nproteins e-cadherin and b-catenin from the cell mem-\nbrane to the nucleus and the cytoplasm; these processes\nare strongly associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition [26,38,39]. These prometastatic changes have\nbeen linked with downregulation of the tumor suppres-\nsor NM23-H1 [25]. In the current study, NM23-H1\nexpression was reduced in T47D 2A-3 and MCF7 2A-1\ncells; however, NM23-H1 was unaltered in MCF7 3C-3\ncells, which were significantly more migratory and inva-\nsive than MCF-7 2A-1 cells. Therefore, it appears that\nalthough altering intercellular adhesion molecules can\ndownregulate NM23-H1, other interacting factors may\nbe necessary for silencing of this gene. Key events in\ninitiation of metastasis include tumor cell proliferation,\ndetachment of cells from the primary tumor, migration\ntoward the vasculature, and invasion into the blood and\nlymphatic systems. Knocking down plakoglobin expres-\nsion substantially increased the prometastatic potential\nof both cell lines, increasing proliferation, reducing\nintercellular adhesion, and increasing invasion. Tumor\ncell migration was also increased in T47D knockdown\ncells compared with control. Interestingly, alterations in\nmetastatic phenotype were more pronounced in T47D\nthan in MCF7 cells. These observations may be due to\nthe differences in plakoglobin expression between the\ntwo cell lines: T47D miRNA knockdown cells express\nbetween 19- and 21-fold lower plakoglobin levels com-\npared with control, whereas plakoglobin expression in\nMCF7-knockdown cells is six- to eightfold lower com-\npared with MCF7 control. MCF7 2A-1 cells that show a\nsixfold reduction in plakoglobin compared with control\nare less invasive and migratory than MCF7 3C-3 cells,\nwhose plakoglobin expression is reduced eightfold com-\npared with control. These data strongly indicate that the\nlevel of plakoglobin expression within a breast cancer\ncell specifically correlates with its ability to undergo\nevents involved in escape of tumor cells from the pri-\nmary site.\nFor a metastatic tumor to grow at a distal site, tumor\n\ncells must be able to invade the circulatory system, sur-\nvive in the bloodstream, and home to and colonize a\nspecific metastatic site [23,28,40]. In accordance with\nour in vitro findings, plakoglobin-knockdown cells grew\nsignificantly faster than control cells when inoculated\ninto the mammary fat pads of balb/c nude mice. In\naddition, increased numbers of EpCAM-positive tumor\ncells were isolated from whole blood in mice with\nMCF7 3C-3 tumors compared with controls, and the\ncells were viable and able to form colonies when grown\nin culture. These data indicate a higher degree of tumor\ncell dissemination into the circulation from mammary\ntumors with low levels of plakoglobin than from tumors\nexpressing high levels of this gene. Despite high levels of\n\ncirculating EpCAM-positive cells in mice with MCF7\n3C-3 tumors, metastatic tumor growth was not detected\nin the bones of any animals. This finding may be due to\nMCF7 cells being unable to undergo the late stages of\nmetastases (bone homing and colonization), although\nMCF7 cells have previously been used to induce breast\ncancer growth in bone after intracardiac inoculation\n[41]. The most likely explanation for this finding is that\nmice used in the current study were 10 to 12 weeks old\nwhen tumors were inoculated, and we and others have\nshown tumors do not take if animals that are older than\n8 weeks. It is hypothesized that high bone turnover, as\nseen in young animals, is critical for human tumor\nmetastasis to mouse bone [41,42]. We were unable to\ntest this hypothesis in the mammary fat pads of 6-week-\nold animals, as the fat pads were too small to inoculate.\nIt is also possible that any tumor metastases present in\nbone were undetectable because of the short period of\nthese experiments (~5 weeks compared with 12 weeks\nrequired for metastatic lesions to develop in mouse\nbones after intracardiac inoculation of MCF7 cells) [42].\nThe effects of plakoglobin expression on tumor cell\nhoming and colonization of distal organs clearly warrant\nfurther investigation and will form part of our future\nresearch strategy.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, this study is the first to show that\nreduced plakoglobin expression results in translocation\nof intercellular adhesion proteins e-cadherin and b-cate-\nnin from the cell membrane to the nucleus and cyto-\nplasm, as well as increasing cell-cell detachment,\ninvasion, and intravascular dissemination of breast can-\ncer cells. Taken together, our results show that plakoglo-\nbin has a functional role in the metastatic process; it\nmay therefore be a suitable prognostic marker for breast\ncancer metastasis and be considered a potential thera-\npeutic target.\n\nAbbreviations\nE. coli: Escherichia coli; FCS: fetal calf serum; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-\nphosphate dehydrogenase; HRP: horseradish peroxidase; miRNA:\nmicroribonucleic acid; μCT: microcomputed tomography; PE: phycoerythrin;\nRNAi: interfering ribonucleic acid; ssRNA: single-stranded ribonucleic acid.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWork was funded by Yorkshire Cancer Research.\n\nAuthor details\n1Academic Unit of Clinical Oncology, University of Sheffield, Medical School,\nBeech Hill Road, Sheffield, S10 2RX, UK. 2Centre for Stem Cell Research,\nUniversity of Sheffield, Alfred Denny Building, Western Bank, Sheffield, S10\n2TN, UK.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\nIH was co-applicant on the grant providing the funds for this research,\nhelped prepare the manuscript, and had significant academic input into this\nproject.
