These  contained the same GAPDh control data, even though Fig. 4B  and C were intended to show the inhibition of osteosarcoma  cell migration by a recombinant adenovirus (ad) expressing  bone morphogenetic protein 9 (adBMP-9) in two different cell  lines, MG-63 and hOS, respectively.  After having re-examined our original data, we realize that  the same GAPDh control bands were inadvertently selected  for Fig. 4B and C.  A corrected version of Fig. 4, containing alternative data  obtained from the experiments performed in duplicate, is  presented below. Western blot assay was performed to examine  the effect of adBMP-9 on metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)  expression, showing that the expression of MMP-9 protein was  significantly inhibited in the adBMP-9 group compared with  the ad-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the control (CON)  groups in the MG-63 and hOS cell lines. In addition, no  marked differences were noted between the ad-GFP group and  the CON group. The error made with the selection of the  control data did not affect the results in this study. We sincerely  apologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our article  who drew this matter to our attention. Furthermore, we regret  any inconvenience this mistake has caused.  Figure 4. Inhibition of osteosarcoma cell migration by adBMP-9 in MG-63  and hOS cell lines. (A) Wound-healing assay showed that the migration  capacity of OS cells in adBMP-9 group was markedly lower than those in  ad-GFP group and CON group. No difference was found between ad-GFP  group and CON group. (B and C) Western blot assay was performed to  examine the effect of adBMP-9 on MMP-9 expression, showing that the  expression of MMP-9 protein was significantly inhibited in adBMP-9 group  compared with the ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and hOS cell  lines. No difference was found between ad-GFP group and CON group.   '}
