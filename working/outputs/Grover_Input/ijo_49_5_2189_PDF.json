These \ncontained the same GAPDh control data, even though Fig. 4B \nand C were intended to show the inhibition of osteosarcoma \ncell migration by a recombinant adenovirus (ad) expressing \nbone morphogenetic protein 9 (adBMP-9) in two different cell \nlines, MG-63 and hOS, respectively.\n\nAfter having re-examined our original data, we realize that \nthe same GAPDh control bands were inadvertently selected \nfor Fig. 4B and C.\n\nA corrected version of Fig. 4, containing alternative data \nobtained from the experiments performed in duplicate, is \npresented below. Western blot assay was performed to examine \nthe effect of adBMP-9 on metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) \nexpression, showing that the expression of MMP-9 protein was \nsignificantly inhibited in the adBMP-9 group compared with \nthe ad-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the control (CON) \ngroups in the MG-63 and hOS cell lines. In addition, no \nmarked differences were noted between the ad-GFP group and \nthe CON group. The error made with the selection of the \ncontrol data did not affect the results in this study. We sincerely \napologize for this mistake, and thank the reader of our article \nwho drew this matter to our attention. Furthermore, we regret \nany inconvenience this mistake has caused.\n\nFigure 4. Inhibition of osteosarcoma cell migration by adBMP-9 in MG-63 \nand hOS cell lines. (A) Wound-healing assay showed that the migration \ncapacity of OS cells in adBMP-9 group was markedly lower than those in \nad-GFP group and CON group. No difference was found between ad-GFP \ngroup and CON group. (B and C) Western blot assay was performed to \nexamine the effect of adBMP-9 on MMP-9 expression, showing that the \nexpression of MMP-9 protein was significantly inhibited in adBMP-9 group \ncompared with the ad-GFP group and CON group in MG-63 and hOS cell \nlines. No difference was found between ad-GFP group and CON group.\n\n\n'}
