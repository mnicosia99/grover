The innate immune response is the first line of\ndefense against invading bacteria. Neutrophil recruitment to the lungs is the first step in a multistep sequence leading to bacte-\nrial clearance. Ligand interaction with pattern-recognizing receptors (PRRs) leads to chemokine production, which drives neu-\ntrophils to the site of infection. Although we demonstrated that RIP2 is important for host defense in the lungs against Esche-\nrichia coli, the individual roles of NOD1 and NOD2 in pulmonary defense have not been addressed. Here, we explored the role\nof NOD2 in neutrophil-mediated host defense against an extracellular pathogen, E. coli. We found enhanced bacterial burden\nand reduced neutrophil and cytokine/chemokine levels in the lungs of NOD2�/� mice following E. coli infection. Furthermore,\nwe observed reduced activation of NF-�B and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in the lungs of NOD2�/� mice upon\nE. coli challenge. Moreover, NOD2�/� neutrophils show impaired intracellular bacterial killing. Using NOD2/RIP2�/� mice, we\nobserved bacterial burden and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs similar to those seen with NOD2�/� mice. In addition,\nbone marrow-derived macrophages obtained from NOD2/RIP2�/� mice demonstrate a reduction in activation of NF-�B and\nMAPKs similar to that seen with NOD2�/� mice in response to E. coli. These findings unveil a previously unrecognized role of\nthe NOD2-RIP2 axis for host defense against extracellular Gram-negative bacteria. This pathway may represent a novel target\nfor the treatment of lung infection/inflammation.\n\nGram-negative bacterial pneumonia is a leading cause of mor-tality in the United States and worldwide (10, 47). Neutrophil\nrecruitment to tissues is essential for effective innate defense\nagainst bacteria (1, 16). Neutrophil trafficking to the lungs con-\nsists of a sequentially regulated network of signals beginning with\nthe recognition of microbes (1, 16). The pattern-recognizing\nreceptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-\nlike receptors (NLRs), detect pathogen-associated molecular\npatterns (PAMPs) present on bacteria and initiate cellular sig-\nnaling cascades in the host, leading to bacterial clearance (1).\nNOD2 (caspase-1 recruitment domain [CARD] 15) is among the\nNLRs that detect muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a conserved glyco-\nprotein of the bacterial cell wall (8, 40). NOD2 has a C-terminal\nleucine-rich repeat (LRR) that interacts with microbial compo-\nnents, a central ATP-dependent oligomerization domain, and two\nCARDs at the N terminus to transduce intracellular signals (8, 40).\nNOD2 is a cytosolic receptor expressed mainly in leukocytes,\ndendritic cells, and epithelial cells (14, 30), although the rela-\ntionship between NOD2-mediated signaling and host defense\nagainst pulmonary extracellular bacterial infection has not\nbeen elucidated.\n\nWhen ligands interact with NOD2, it gets oligomerized and\nbinds to RIP2 kinase (also known as RICK or CARDIAK) by a\nCARD-CARD interaction which activates a signaling cascade that\nleads to NF-�B activation and cytokine/chemokine transcrip-\ntion (8, 40). Interestingly, an earlier report showed that NOD2\nactivation promotes membrane recruitment of RIP2 and the\nNOD2/RIP2 complex signals from the plasma membrane (36).\nSubsequent studies demonstrated that NOD2 activation en-\nhances TLR2-, TLR3-, and TLR4-mediated signaling (44, 52, 63).\nIn a murine model of uveitis, it has been shown that NOD2 regu-\n\nlates the production of gamma interferon (IFN-�) (59). Tak-1, a\nmember of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family\ninvolved in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�), interleukin-1\nbeta (IL-1�), and TLR signaling, has been shown to be a central\nmediator of NOD2 signaling in epidermal cells (32). Furthermore,\nNOD2 has been shown to be responsible for IL-6 production and\nactivation of STAT-3 (15, 27). In addition, the cytokine IL-32\nenhanced NOD2-mediated cytokine response upon MDP chal-\nlenge (51).\n\nPrior studies demonstrated that NOD2 is an essential mediator\nof host defense against a variety of intracellular pathogens such as\nListeria monocytogenes (56), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (23, 54),\nand Legionella pneumophila (9). In addition, it has been demon-\nstrated that murine macrophages require NOD2 to respond to\nStaphylococcus aureus infection (31). NOD2�/� mice showed\nenhanced susceptibility to Staphylococcus aureus infection due\nto increased bacterial burden and defective neutrophil phago-\ncytosis. In an aerosolized infection with Legionella pneumo-\nphila, NOD2�/� mice displayed reduced neutrophil recruitment\nand cytokine production and increased bacterial burden com-\npared to controls (22). Recent work revealed that NOD2/RIP2\n\nReceived 24 November 2011 Returned for modification 9 January 2012\nAccepted 25 April 2012\n\nPublished ahead of print 30 April 2012\n\nEditor: J. N.

Nevertheless, much less is\nknown about NOD2 in acute pneumonia caused by extracellular\nGram-negative pathogens such as Escherichia coli.\n\nIn this study, we explored the role of NOD2 in neutrophil-\nmediated host defense against pulmonary E. coli infection. We\nfound enhanced bacterial burden and reduced neutrophil influx,\ncytokine response, and NF-�B and MAPK activation in the lungs\nof NOD2�/� mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice upon E. coli\ninfection. Furthermore, we found that NOD2�/� neutrophils show\ndefective phagocytosis and bacterial killing along with reduced elas-\ntase, H2O2, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and nitric oxide (NO) produc-\ntion as well as expression and activation of NADPH oxidase subunits.\nCompared with NOD2�/� mice, NOD2/RIP2�/� mice exhibit sim-\nilar bacterial burden and neutrophil accumulation in the lungs\nfollowing E. coli infection. Compared with NOD2�/� macro-\nphages, macrophages obtained from NOD2/RIP2�/� mice indi-\ncate similarly attenuated activation, as evidenced by reduced levels\nof NF-�B and MAPKs following E. coli infection.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMice. The NOD2�/� and RIP2�/� mice used in the experiment were\ngenerated on a C57BL6 background (33, 34); therefore, C57BL/6 mice\nwere used as wild-type controls. NOD2/RIP2 mice were generated by\ninterbreeding mice containing those targeted mutations. Eight-to-10-\nweek-old female mice were used in all experiments. Animal studies were\napproved by the Louisiana State University Animal Care and Use Com-\nmittee. The mice ranged from 19 to 25 g in weight at the time of experi-\nments.\n\nIntratracheal (i.t.) instillations. Mice were anesthetized by intraper-\nitoneal (i.p.) injection of a solution containing a ketamine/xylazine mix-\nture (250 mg/kg of body weight). The trachea was surgically exposed, and\na total volume of 50 �l of muramyl peptide (MDP; 100 ng/mouse), lipo-\npolysaccharide (LPS; 100 ng/mouse), or E. coli (American Type Culture\nCollection 25922) (106 CFU/mouse) was administered. Saline solution\nalone (50 �l) was instilled into the trachea as a control.\n\nPreparation of bacteria. E. coli was prepared for mouse inoculation as\ndescribed in reports of previous studies (2, 5, 12). Bacteria were grown in\nTrypticase soy broth (TSB) at 37°C overnight under conditions of con-\nstant agitation. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in\nsterile isotonic saline solution, and resuspended in sterile 0.9% saline\nsolution at a concentration of 20 � 106 CFU/ml. The initial mouse inocu-\nlums were confirmed by plating serial 10-fold dilutions on MacConkey\nand tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates. For enumerating bacterial CFU in the\nlungs, whole lungs were homogenized in 2 ml of sterile saline solution for\n30 s, and 20 �l of the resulting homogenates was plated by serial 10-fold\ndilutions on MacConkey and TSA plates. Bacterial colonies were counted\nafter incubation at 37°C for 24 h.\n\nNeutrophil recruitment. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was\ncollected to obtain BALF cells for enumeration of total leukocytes and\nneutrophils. The trachea was exposed and intubated using a 1.7-mm-\nouter-diameter polyethylene catheter. BALF collection was performed\nby instilling phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing heparin and\ndextrose in 0.8-ml aliquots. Approximately 3 ml of BALF was retrieved\nfrom each mouse. Cytospin samples were subsequently prepared from\nBALF cells and stained with Diff-Quick (Fisher). Differential cell\ncounts were determined by direct counting of stained slides. Total\nleukocyte numbers in BALF were determined using a hemocytometer\n(2, 5, 11, 12).\n\nMPO assay. An MPO assay was performed as described previously (2,\n5, 11, 12). Whole lungs were weighed, frozen at �70°C, and then homog-\nenized in 1 ml of hexadecyltrimethylammoniumbromide (HTAB) buffer\nfor 30 s (50 mg of tissue/ml of HTAB). The samples were homogenized,\nand 1 ml of homogenate was transferred into each microcentrifuge tube\n\nand centrifuged at 20,000 � g for 4 min. Seven microliters of supernatant\nwas transferred into a flat-bottom 96-well plate, and 200 �l of an\nO-dianisidine hydrochloride solution was added immediately before\nthe activity was determined. The MPO activity, measured as optical\ndensity at 450 nm, was expressed in units per milligram of lung tissue.\n\nCytokine and chemokine expression. Cell-free BALF was used for the\ndetermination of TNF-� (eBioscience), IL-6 (eBioscience), KC/CXCL1\n(R&D Systems), MIP-2/CXCL2 (R&D Systems), and LIX/CXCL5 (R&D\nSystems) levels by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA). The minimum detection limit is 2 pg/ml of cytokine or chemo-\nkine protein (2, 5, 11, 12, 29).\n\nNF-�B DNA binding assay. This technique has been described in our\nearlier publications (2, 5, 11, 12, 28, 29). Briefly, nuclear proteins were\nextracted from the lung tissue collected at 6 and 24 h post-E. coli or -saline\nsolution challenge. A total of 7.5 �g of nuclear extract was mixed with\nbinding buffer, added to the precoated plate (with the DNA binding motif\nof NF-�B), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature according to the\nmanufacturer’s protocol (TransAM ELISA kit). Wells were then washed,\nand plates were incubated with NF-�B/p65 antibody (Ab) for 1 h. Plates\nwere then washed three times with wash buffer, and horseradish peroxi-\ndase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was added to each well and incu-\nbated for 1 h. Plates were read at 450 nm after adding the developing\nreagent.\n\nLung pathology. The lungs were perfused from the right ventricle of\nheart with 10 ml of isotonic saline solution after 24 h postinfection from\nNOD2�/� and WT mice. Lungs were then removed and fixed in 4%\nphosphate-buffered formalin. Fixed-tissue samples were processed in\nparaffin blocks, and fine sections (5 �m in thickness) were cut with a\nmicrotome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Assessments\nof histopathology were performed by a veterinary pathologist in a blinded\nfashion as described in our earlier publications (2, 11) according to the\nfollowing scoring scale: 0, no inflammatory cells (macrophages or neutro-\nphils) present in section; 1, �5% of section infiltrated by inflammatory\ncells; 2, 5% to 10% of section infiltrated by inflammatory cells; and 3,\n\t10% of section infiltrated by inflammatory cells.\n\nWhole-cell protein extraction and immunoblotting. Whole-cell\nproteins were extracted by homogenizing the lungs in a lysis buffer cock-\ntail containing 0.1% Triton X-100 –PBS, complete protease inhibitor\ncocktail (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), complete phosphatase in-\nhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 1 mM dithio-\nthreitol (DTT). Protein extracts from neutrophils were prepared by lysing\ncells with urea/CHAPS {3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-\npropanesulfonate}/Tris buffer containing protease and phosphatase in-\nhibitor cocktails. Cell lysates were centrifuged at maximum speed in a\nmicrocentrifuge at 4°C. The resulting supernatants were used for immu-\nnoblotting. Whole-cell proteins were fractioned by 10% to 12% sodium\ndodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and\nelectrophoretically transferred onto Immobilon-P (Millipore) polyvi-\nnylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were blocked and probed\nwith VCAM-1, ICAM-1, phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/\nTyr204), phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr180/Tyr182), phospho-MAPK/Jun N-\nterminal protein kinase (phospho-MAPK/JNK) (Thr183/Tyr185), NF-\n�B, phospho-NF-�B/p65 (Ser536), I�B�, phospho-I�B� (Ser32),\nphospho-p47phox (Ser370), p47phox, p67phox, and NOD-2 (1:1,000 dilu-\ntion). The primary Ab was detected using autoradiographic film with an\nappropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and an ECL chemilu-\nminescent system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). To\ndemonstrate equal protein loading on gels, the blots were stripped and\nreprobed with Ab specific for total p38 MAPK or GAPDH (glyceralde-\nhyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (2, 5, 11, 12).\n\nNeutrophil purification and E. coli killing assay. To evaluate the\nability of neutrophils to kill E. coli, a killing assay was performed. Murine\nneutrophils were purified by negative magnetic selection. Wild-type and\nNOD2�/� mice were sacrificed, and their femurs and tibias were flushed\nto obtain bone marrow cells. A cell suspension was passed through a\n\nNOD2 in Pulmonary Host Defense\n\nJuly 2012 Volume 80 Number 7 iai.asm.org 2559\n\n o\nn\n A\n\nu\ng\nu\nst 2\n\n2\n, 2\n\n0\n1\n2\n b\n\ny Y\na\nle\n\n U\nn\n\nive\nrsity\n\nh\nttp\n\n://ia\ni.a\n\nsm\n.o\n\nrg\n/\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\n\nlo\na\n\nd\ne\n\nd\n fro\n\nm\n \n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\n0.77-�M-pore-size filter and was resuspended in RoboSep buffer (PBS\nwithout Ca2\n/Mg2\n, 2% fetal bovine serum [FBS], 1 mM EDTA). Neu-\ntrophils were purified by using a custom mixture containing Abs to CD5,\nCD4, CD45R/B220, TER119, F4/80, CD11c, and c-KIT (catalog no.\n19709). Briefly, bone marrow cells were incubated in RoboSep buffer\ncontaining 5% normal rat serum along with the custom Ab cocktail, bio-\ntin selection cocktail, and a magnetic colloid according to the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. Samples were then placed in an EasySep magnet.\nAfter 3 min of incubation, samples highly enriched with neutrophils were\nseparated by pouring into a new tube. Fractions were analyzed using a\nfluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) to determine the purity of the\ncells (\t92% purity was confirmed). Purified neutrophils were used for\nneutrophil-mediated bacterial killing. These neutrophils were also used to\ndetect elastase, H2O2, MPO, and nitric oxide (NO) release along with\nexpression, phosphorylation, and membrane translocation of NADPH\noxidase subunits as well as expression of NOD2.\n\nFor bacterial killing, 1 � 106 neutrophils were pooled with 10% (vol/\nvol) FBS, and 1 � 106 opsonized bacteria were added to polypropylene\ntubes (BD Biosciences) (10 by 75 mm). The capped tubes were incubated\nin a shaking water bath at 37°C with continuous agitation for 0, 30, 60, or\n120 min. Samples were removed at each time point and placed in an ice\nbath. A portion of sample was spun at 100 � g for 10 min to collect the\nviable bacteria in media; the remaining sample was washed in PBS three\ntimes to remove the extracellular and adherent bacteria. The neutrophil\npellet was resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, the cells were ruptured by four\nfreeze-thawing cycles, and the lysate was used for subsequent culture and\nenumeration of bacteria. Colony counting of viable bacteria was deter-\nmined by plating 20-�l aliquots of five diluted samples on McConkey agar\nand TSA plates. The number of colonies was enumerated after incubation\nat 37°C overnight (20).\n\nNE activity. Culture media obtained from a neutrophil-mediated\nkilling assay were collected at different time intervals and stored at\n�80°C until use. N-methoxysuccinyl–Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroaniline\n(Sigma Chemical) was used as the substrate for neutrophil elastase\n(NE), as this compound is not hydrolyzed by cathepsin G. Hydrolysis\nof the substrate by NE was determined spectrophotometrically at 405\nnm. In brief, 1 mM substrate was incubated with 0.2 ml of sample in\n0.1 M Tris (hydroxyl-methyl) aminomethane-HCl buffer (pH 8.0)\ncontaining 0.5 M NaCl at 37°C for 24 h. Optical density was deter-\nmined and activity of NE was determined, where one enzyme unit is\ndefined as the quantity of enzyme that liberated 1 �mol of p-nitro-\naniline in 24 h (65).\n\nDetermination of hydrogen peroxide levels. Hydrogen peroxide\nlevels were measured to evaluate reactive oxygen species (ROS) pro-\nduction by using a fluorescent H2O2/peroxidase (Fluoro H2O2) detec-\ntion kit (Cell Technology, Inc., Mountain View, CA). The Fluoro H2O2\ndetection kit utilizes a nonfluorescent detection reagent to detect\nH2O2. H2O2 oxidizes the detection reagent by the use of 1:1 stoichi-\nometry to produce a fluorescent product (resorufin) which is catalyzed\nby peroxidase in a homogeneous no-wash assay system. To evaluate\nthe generation of ROS in control and infected tissues, 50 �l of lung\nhomogenates was incubated with 50 �l of reaction cocktail (10 mM\ndetection reagent, horseradish peroxidase [HRP; 10 U/ml]), for 5 min\nat room temperature in the dark. After incubation, the fluorescence\nwas measured (excitation, 540 nm; emission, 595 nm) in a fluorescent\nplate reader (49).\n\nMPO activity in neutrophils. MPO release by the neutrophils was\nmeasured as previously described (2, 5, 11, 12, 26). Briefly, culture media\nobtained at different time intervals were stored at �80°C until the assay\nwas performed. The reaction mixture consisted of 100 �l of culture media,\n50 �l of 1.0% hexadecyltrimethylammoniumbromide (HTAB) (Sigma\nChemical, St. Louis, MO) in phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) (100 mmol/liter),\nand 50 �l of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0) (50 mmol/liter) con-\ntaining o-dianisidine hydrochloride (Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO)\n(0.167 mg/ml) and 0.0005% hydrogen peroxide. Absorbance changes at\n\n460 nm were monitored with a spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Tokyo, Ja-\npan) at 5-min intervals at room temperature.\n\nNO release by neutrophils. The NO assay was performed as described\nin previous reports (7, 38, 39). Neutrophils isolated from bone marrow\nwere infected with E. coli at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for\ndifferent time intervals. Media were collected at designated time points for\nthe determination of nitric oxide (NO) concentrations using a colorimet-\nric assay kit (Cayman Chemical Company). A standard curve was plotted\nby diluting standards with incubation media (7, 38, 39).\n\nBone marrow-derived macrophage culture. Bone marrow cells from\nNOD2�/� and WT (control) mice were differentiated into macrophages\nby adding macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) for 7 days. A\ntotal of 1 � 106 cells/well were used for each group at each time point for\ninfection with E. coli at an MOI of 0.1 and incubated at 37°C with slow\nagitation. At 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, cell pellets were purified and pro-\ncessed for Western blot analysis to determine the activation of NF-�B and\nMAPKs (5, 11).\n\nFractionation of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins. A Fraction-\nPREP cell fractionation kit (Biovision, San Francisco, CA) was used for\npreparation of the cytoplasmic and membrane fractions following the\nvendor’s recommendations. Briefly, 2 � 106 E. coli-infected bone marrow\nneutrophils were suspended in the cytosol extract buffer, processed with a\nvortex device, and incubated for 10 min on ice. Following centrifugation,\nthe cytosolic fraction was separated and membrane fractions were\nsuspended in urea/CHAPS/Tris buffer and protein contents were\nquantified. Equal protein amounts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and\nmembranes were probed with antibodies for p47phox, GAPDH, or pan-\ncadherin (control).\n\nPhagocytic index. Neutrophils were purified from bone marrow by\nnegative selection. A total of 1 � 106 neutrophils were infected with\nopsonized E. coli (1 � 106). At 30 min postincubation, the cells were\nwashed in PBS three times and centrifuged at 200 � g (to remove\nextracellular bacteria), deposited onto microscope slides in a cytocen-\ntrifuge at 200 � g (Thermo Shandon), fixed with methanol, and\nstained by the Diff-Quick (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) method.\nThe number of neutrophils that ingested bacteria and the number of\ningested bacteria per cell were counted under a light microscope using\nan oil immersion lens.\n\nStatistical analysis. All data are expressed as means � standard errors\nof the means (SEM). The intensity of Western blot bands was determined\nusing gel-digitizing software (UN-SCAN-IT gel) from Silk Scientific, Inc.,\nOrem, UT. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA), fol-\nlowed by Bonferroni’s post hoc analysis for multiple comparisons. Differ-\nences in data values were defined as statistically significant at a P value of\nless than 0.05 using GraphPad Prism 4.\n\nRESULTS\nNOD2 is important for neutrophil accumulation in the lungs in\nresponse to MDP but not LPS challenge. As a first step to explore\nthe function of NOD2 in the lungs, we used NOD2�/� mice and\nchallenged them with intratracheal muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a\nNOD2-specific agonist, LPS, a canonical TLR4 agonist, or a com-\nbination of MDP and LPS. Mice were sacrificed at 24 h postinfec-\ntion, and BALF was collected for total leukocyte and neutrophil\ncounts. At 24 h postinfection, neutrophil numbers were increased\nin BALF following MDP and LPS challenge, although LPS caused\nhigher neutrophil numbers in BALF than MDP (Fig. 1A and B).\nOur data show that LPS-induced neutrophil influx in the pulmo-\nnary airways is not dependent on the presence of NOD2 whereas\nMDP-induced neutrophil migration to the airways is depen-\ndent on the presence of NOD2 (Fig. 1A and B). When MDP was\ncoadministered with LPS intratracheally, we observed a syner-\ngistic neutrophil influx in the lungs which was dependent on\nNOD2 (Fig. 1A and B).

In initial experiments, we\ndetermined if NOD2 is important for bacterial clearance from the\nlungs. In this regard, NOD2�/� mice and their wild-type controls\nwere intratracheally instilled with E. coli (106 CFU/animal). Mice\nwere sacrificed at both 6 and 24 h postinfection, and the lungs were\nremoved and processed for bacterial culture. At 24 h postinfec-\ntion, the bacterial burden in the lungs was increased in NOD2�/�\n\nmice compared to wild-type controls (Fig. 1C). However, no bac-\nterial dissemination was observed in mice with this bacterial dose\n(data not shown). To examine if NOD2 deficiency affects neutro-\n\nphil recruitment to the lungs during Gram-negative bacterial in-\nfection, NOD2�/� mice were intratracheally infected with E. coli\nand BALF was collected at 6 and 24 h postinfection. At 24 h postin-\nfection, there was a reduction in total leukocyte and neutrophil\ncounts in NOD2�/� mice (Fig. 1D and E). This result was further\nconfirmed by reduced myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung ho-\nmogenates of NOD2�/� mice (Fig. 1F). Since there was a reduction in\nneutrophil recruitment in NOD2�/� mice following E. coli challenge,\nwe determined whether NOD2 deficiency affects the severity of lung\ninflammation during E. coli infection. NOD2�/� mice showed re-\nduced inflammation in lung sections as evidenced by less neutrophil\nrecruitment and alveolar edema compared to their wild-type controls\nfollowing E. coli infection (Fig. 1G and H).\n\nFIG 1 Importance of NOD2 in host defense against pulmonary Gram-negative infections.

In the above-described experiments, we demon-\nstrated that NOD2 participates in modulating bacterial clearance\nand neutrophil accumulation in pulmonary airspaces. As neu-\ntrophil recruitment to the infected focus is a multistep se-\nquence beginning with cytokine and chemokine expression (1,\n3, 17), we sought to determine the levels of the cytokines\n(TNF-� and IL-6) and neutrophil chemoattractants (CXCL2\nand CXCL5) in BALF. As shown in Fig. 1I to L, NOD2�/� mice\nexhibited reduced levels of cytokines in BALF compared to\ntheir littermate controls following E. coli infection. The level of\nthe potent neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL2 was also re-\nduced in the BALF of NOD2�/� mice following bacterial infec-\ntion (Fig. 1K).\n\nNOD2�/� mice exhibit reduced activation of NF-�B, MAPKs,\nand expression of cellular adhesion molecules. Expression of pro-\ninflammatory mediators is primarily regulated by transcription\nfactors (6, 58). Of these, NF-�B has been identified as a critical\ntranscription factor important for inflammation (6, 58). Given the\nparticipation of NOD2 in cytokine and chemokine expression in\nthe lungs, we next asked if NOD2 is required for NF-�B activation\nduring E. coli infection. NOD2�/� mice showed reduced NF-�B\nDNA binding activity and NF-�B activation in the lungs following\nE. coli infection (Fig. 2A to C). In addition to NF-�B activation,\nMAPK activation is required to induce expression of cytokines\nand chemokines (17, 58). As shown in Fig. 2D and E, reduced\nactivation of JNK and p38 was observed in the lungs of E. coli-\ninfected NOD2�/� mice compared to wild-type controls.

We assessed if NOD2 deficiency affects phagocytosis\nand/or the bacterial killing ability of neutrophils. To explore this,\nbone marrow neutrophils were isolated from NOD2�/� or wild-\ntype (WT) mice and were stimulated with E. coli at an MOI of 1.0.\nWe found higher extracellular CFU in the supernatant of\nNOD2�/� neutrophils compared to supernatants from wild-type\n(control) neutrophils at 60 min postinfection (Fig. 3A). Com-\n\npared to WT controls, significantly higher intracellular CFU were\nobserved at 120 min postinfection in NOD2�/� mice (Fig. 3B).\nNOD2�/� neutrophils also showed reduced phagocytosis of E. coli\nat 30 min postinfection compared to the WT neutrophils (Fig.\n3C). We have also measured the levels of antimicrobial com-\npounds, including myeloperoxidase, H2O2, nitrate, and elas-\ntase, in isolated neutrophils (Fig. 3D to G).

To explore this, we generated NOD2/\nRIP2�/� mice.

Both NOD1 and NOD2 have CARDs in the N terminus,\na central nucleotide oligomerization domain, and a C-terminal\nLRR domain to recognize PAMPs (40, 57). The primary func-\ntion of NOD1 and NOD2 is to serve as pattern recognition\nreceptors for bacteria and/or their products.

In the current report, we describe a new\nrole for NOD2 in modulating neutrophil-dependent host de-\nfense in the lungs in response to extracellular Gram-negative\n(E. coli) infection. Consistent with the important role that\nNOD2 plays in augmenting host defense in the lungs, we found\nthat the NOD2-RIP2 axis is important to mediate pulmonary\ndefense against E. coli infection.\n\nPGN is a known inducer of host resistance to bacteria and\nserves as an immune adjuvant to immunoglobulin production\n(13). The biological properties of PGN show that PGN compo-\nnents such as desmuramylpeptide and MDP are potent immuno-\n\nFIG 6 Activation of NF-�B and MAPKs and upregulation of ICAM-1 in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) obtained from NOD2�/� and\nNOD2/RIP2�/� mice following E. coli infection.

Subsequent studies revealed that\nMDP can interact with NOD2 to induce downstream signaling\n(24). In previous studies, NOD2 signaling has been associated\nwith either higher or lower levels of tissue inflammation (19, 21,\n64), as this reflects the different bacterial strains used in experi-\nmental infection models. For example, NOD2 is important for\ndifferent organisms, including intracellular pathogens that reside\nin the cytosol (21) and intracellular organisms that evade phago-\nsomal-lysomal fusion (45). Both NOD1 and NOD2 modulate the\npulmonary immune response to Legionella pneumophila, whereas\nNOD2 contributes to host resistance to mycobacterial infection\nvia both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms (19). The dif-\nferent host responses to these bacterial pathogens may be attrib-\nuted to the quantity, location, and structure of peptidoglycan\n(PGN). In the current investigation, impaired bacterial clearance\nand reductions in inflammatory cell recruitment were observed in\nNOD2�/� mice compared to their wild-type counterparts.\nWhether different structures of MDP from E. coli alter their de-\ntection by NOD2 is to be the subject of future investigation. We\nhave chosen the E. coli ATCC 25992 strain in this investigation,\nbecause this strain has been shown to cause neutrophil recruit-\nment without capillary leakage even with a higher dose of 106\n\nCFU/animal (53).\nOne important issue arising from our studies is related to the\n\nmechanisms by which NOD2-mediated signaling is activated\nupon E. coli infection. The mechanisms involved in the recogni-\ntion of an extracellular pathogen by an intracellular receptor\n(NOD2) are not entirely clear, but at least three possibilities can be\noutlined: (i) bacterial MDP can be released to the cytosol and\nstimulate the intracellular receptors; (ii) E. coli cells and/or their\nproducts can be leaked into the cytosol from the endosomes or\nphagolysosomes (37, 60); and (iii) cross-talk between TLRs and\nNLRs might occur after initial bacterial recognition by TLRs.\n\nRecruitment of neutrophils to the lungs appears to play a piv-\notal role in mediating efficient innate immunity to extracellular\npathogens, including E. coli (24). To examine if differences in CFU\nwere due to differences in neutrophil influx in the lungs, we ex-\namined neutrophil accumulation in the pulmonary airspaces by\nperforming BALF experiments and in lung parenchyma by mea-\nsuring MPO activity. Although NOD2 contributes to innate anti-\nbacterial immunity to E. coli, NOD2�/� mice show 50%-reduced\nneutrophil recruitment in response to intrapulmonary E. coli\ninfection. This observation emphasizes the importance of other\nPRRs recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns\n(PAMPs) of E. coli, including plasma membrane- or endosome-\nbound TLRs. In this regard, we previously reported the impor-\ntance of TLRs in E. coli infection in the reduced bacterial clearance\nfrom the lungs along with attenuated accumulation of neutrophils\nin mice deficient in TIRAP or MyD88 (28). There are several re-\nports indicating the cross-talk between TLR and NOD molecules\n(27, 44, 52, 63), and recent work revealed that TLR2 and NOD2\nwere redundant in the detection of Gram-positive bacteria (S.\naureus) and cytokine production by macrophages (27, 44, 52, 63).\n\nOur data reveal reduced neutrophil influx into the airspaces of\nNOD2�/� mice when treated i.t. with LPS and MDP together. Our\nresults are in agreement with the earlier reports (50) that treat-\nment with LPS and MDP together substantially increased neutro-\nphil influx compared to treatment with each ligand alone, suggest-\ning that TLR signaling and NOD2 signaling can serve as an\namplifier for each other. Thus, analysis of NOD2 function in the\n\nabsence or presence of other PRRs may be required to unravel the\nimportance of NOD2 in antibacterial host defense.\n\nRecent studies have highlighted the complex nature of RIP2\nsignaling, as this molecule plays a central role in both TLR and\nNOD signaling pathways (5). Both NOD1 and NOD2 contain\ncaspase-1 recruitment domains (CARDs) that can activate down-\nstream signaling through RIP2 (33). We demonstrated earlier that\nRIP2�/� mice show substantially decreased bacterial clearance\nfrom the lungs and neutrophil migration following E. coli infec-\ntion (5). These findings raised the issues regarding the upstream\nmolecules which cause RIP2-dependent signaling cascades that\naugment innate immune responses. The finding that NOD2�/�\n\nand NOD2/RIP2�/� mice show similar degrees of impairment in\nneutrophil-mediated host defense suggests that RIP2 is primarily\nan adaptor for NOD2 cascades. Although the data are not statis-\ntically significant, NOD2/RIP2�/� mice display more reduction in\nneutrophil recruitment to the lungs than NOD2�/� mice, sug-\ngesting a minor role of RIP2 in signaling cascades other than\nthe NOD2-mediated ones. Compared with NOD2�/� mice,\nNOD1�/� mice showed no significant reduction in neutrophil\nnumbers in BALF at 24 h after E. coli infection (data not shown),\nsuggesting that NOD1 is dispensable for the host defense against\nE. coli infection. However, more conclusive future studies are\nneeded to explore this possibility in detail.\n\nNeutrophil activation is a critical first step to clear bacteria\nfrom infected tissues (46, 48). In our previous reports, we have\nshown that neutrophil depletion renders the mice highly suscep-\ntible to Klebsiella pneumoniae (2, 11). The intriguing observation\nfrom the current study is that NOD2�/� neutrophils show an\ninherent defect in intracellular bacterial killing. In this regard, a\nprevious report demonstrated that adherent-invasive E. coli\nclearance was not different between NOD2�/� monocytes and\nwild-type monocytes (55). On the other hand, in a cutaneous\nStaphylococcus aureus infection model, it has been shown that\nNOD2�/� neutrophils were defective in killing the bacteria in\nvitro (27). We speculate that E. coli strain differences and the dif-\nferent cell types used in this investigation and other studies may\nhave contributed to the differences in host responses.\n\nThe data presented in Fig. 3 suggest that there are at least two\npotential defects in neutrophil function due to the absence of\nNOD2. Figure 3B shows that after 30 min, there was decreased\nintracellular CFU in neutrophils from NOD2�/� mice compared\nto WT mice but, at a later time point (120 min), there was in-\ncreased CFU in NOD2�/� compared to WT mice. The reduced\nnumbers of intracellular bacteria at the earlier time point (30 min)\nsuggest a potential defect in phagocytosis in neutrophils from\nNOD2�/� mice, and the increased numbers of bacteria at a later\ntime point suggest a defect in killing of bacteria once they have\nbeen phagocytosed. These findings confirm a previous report that\ndescribed defects in the phagocytosis of another extracellular bac-\nterium, Staphylococcus aureus, by neutrophils from NOD2�/�\n\nmice (18).\nIntracellular bacterial killing by neutrophils is primarily medi-\n\nated via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reac-\ntive nitrogen species (35, 42). The importance of the NADPH\noxidase to the host defense is shown by the frequent infections\nresulting from the impaired killing of microbes in patients with\nchronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (61). Chronic granuloma-\ntous disease results in an impaired NADPH oxidase due to muta-\ntions in the subunits of the NADPH oxidase (43).

However, the\nextent to which MPO is released and whether it retains extracel-\nlular activity that contributes to bacterial killing have not been\nfully established.\n\nIn conclusion, this investigation revealed that NOD2 may act\nas an important regulator during E. coli infection in the lungs.\nActivation of NOD2 resulted in NF-�B- and MAPK-dependent\ncytokine/chemokine expression and neutrophil recruitment as\nwell as activation in the lungs in a RIP2-dependent fashion.\nDelineating such new mechanisms would facilitate devising\nbetter immunotherapy to overcome the complications of bac-\nterial pneumonia.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Pete Mottram and Dan Chisenhall at LSU for critical reading of\nthe manuscript.
