(Rubiaceae),\nexhibits antitumor effects, its biological activity in oral cancer has not been reported. We thus investigated the effects and putative\nmechanism of apoptosis induced by mollugin in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells (OSCCs). Results show that mollugin\ninduces cell death in a dose-dependent manner in primary andmetastatic OSCCs.Mollugin-induced cell death involved apoptosis,\ncharacterized by the appearance of nuclear shrinkage, flow cytometric analysis of sub-G\n\n1\nphase arrest, and annexin V-FITC and\n\npropidium iodide staining. Western blot analysis and RT-PCR revealed that mollugin suppressed activation of NF-ùúÖB and NF-ùúÖB-\ndependent gene products involved in antiapoptosis (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl), invasion (MMP-9 and ICAM-1), and angiogenesis (FGF-2\nand VEGF). Furthermore, mollugin induced the activation of p38, ERK, and JNK and the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-\n1) and nuclear factor E2‚Äìrelated factor 2 (Nrf2). Mollugin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis of HO-1 were reversed by an\nHO-1 inhibitor and Nrf2 siRNA. Collectively, this is the first report to demonstrate the effectiveness of mollugin as a candidate for\na chemotherapeutic agent in OSCCs via the upregulation of the HO-1 and Nrf2 pathways and the downregulation of NF-ùúÖB.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) represents the fifth\nmost common cancer worldwide and is a significant cause\nof cancer morbidity and mortality. Each year, approximately\n300,000 new cases are diagnosed with only a 50% survival\nrate over 5 years. Common treatments, including surgery,\nradiation therapy, and chemotherapy, have very low success\nrates [1]. Two of the most frequently used chemotherapeutic\ndrugs, 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin, cause side effects such\nas bone marrow suppression, gastrointestinal toxicity, and\nrenal damage, which remain problems that need to be\n\nresolved [2]. To overcome such side effects and limitations,\nthe direction of present research into novel antitumor agents\nhas turned to natural products, especially plants used in\ntraditional medicine [3]. Previously, we demonstrated that\nhighly purified sulfur [4] and herbal medicines, such as\nCaesalpinia sappan [5], Coptidis rhizoma [6], and verticinone\n[7], exerted antitumor effects on oral cancer cells in vitro.\nMoreover, we showed that a single compound isolated from\nCaesalpinia sappan heartwood, isoliquiritigenin 2\U000f8020-methyl\nether (ILME), had antioral cancer effects involving mitogen-\nactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the nuclear factor-\nùúÖB (NF-ùúÖB) pathway [8]. In addition, we reported that\n\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\na flavonoid extracted from Caesalpinia sappan, sappanchal-\ncone, suppressed oral cancer cell growth and induced apop-\ntosis through activation of p53-dependent mitochondrial\nMAPK and NF-ùúÖB signaling [9].\n\nThe roots of Rubia cordifolia L. have been widely used\nas a traditional herbal medicine in Korea to treat cough,\nbladder and kidney stones, joint inflammation, uterine hem-\norrhage, and uteritis [10]. In addition, this plant has been\nused in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment\nof arthritis, dysmenorrheal, hematorrhea, hemostasis, and\npsoriasis [11, 12]. Among the bioactive components from\nRubia cordifolia, mollugin (C\n\n17\nH\n16\nO\n4\n; methyl 2,2-dimethyl-\n\n6-hydroxy-2H-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran-5-carboxylate) has been\nreported to have antitumor and anti-inflammatory activities,\nand neuroprotective and apoptotic effects [13‚Äì16]. A recent\nstudy demonstrated thatmollugin induced apoptosis through\nendoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated activation of c-Jun\nN-terminal kinase (JNK) and the mitochondria-dependent\ncaspase cascade, regulated by Bcl-xL in human Jurkat T cells\n[14]. Moreover, mollugin inhibited proliferation and induced\napoptosis by suppressing fatty acid synthase in HER2-\noverexpressing human breast and ovarian cancer cells [17].\n\nHeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) is an inducible cytoprotective\nenzyme that catalyzes the initial rate-limiting reaction in\nheme catabolism. Previously, we reported that the HO-1\npathway plays a key role in the adaptation of cells to stressful\nconditions and the recovery of dental pulp cells and perio-\ndontal ligament cells from injury [18‚Äì20]. Despite its cyto-\nprotective properties, recent evidence suggests a role for HO-\n1 in promoting cancer [21]. HO-1 is overexpressed in various\ntypes of cancer and is further induced by radiation and\nchemotherapy [22, 23]. Regarding the mechanisms of HO-\n1 induction, several studies have suggested the involvement\nof MAPK and NF-ùúÖB pathways, as well as nuclear factor\nerythroid 2‚Äìrelated factor 2 (Nrf2) [18, 24]. However, the\nprecise cellular mechanisms of mollugin on OSCCs are not\ncompletely understood.\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the chemothera-\npeutic effect of mollugin on human primary and metastatic\nOSCCs in vitro. In addition, we further explored whether\nthe effect of mollugin is related to Nrf2 activation and HO-\n1 expression.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Reagents. Mollugin was isolated from root of heartwood\nof Rubia cordifolia L. as described previously [13]. Antibody\nagainst NF-ùúÖB p65, IùúÖB, Nrf2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, p53, p21, or\nphosphorylated isoforms of IùúÖB and horseradish peroxidase-\nconjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa\nCruz Biotechnology (Delaware Avenue, CA). ERK, JNK, p38\nor phosphorylation of ERK, JNK, and p38 were purchased\nfrom Cell signaling, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Dulbecco‚Äôs modified\nEagle‚Äôs medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), and\nother tissue culture reagents were purchased fromGibco BRL\n(Grand Island, NY). All other chemicals were obtained from\nSigma (St. Louis, MO), unless indicated otherwise.\n\n2.2. Cell Culture. The cell line HNSCC4 (HN4), from a\nprimary OSCCs, and cell line HNSCC12 (HN12), from a\nmetastatic carcinoma of the OSCCs [25], were derived in the\nlaboratory of Dr. John F. Ensley (Wayne State University).\nCells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,\n100U/mL penicillin, and 100 ùúág/mL streptomycin in a\nhumidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n\n2\nat 37‚àòC. Cells were\n\ndissociated with 0.25% trypsin just before transferring for\nexperiments and counted using a hemocytometer.\n\nHuman keratinocyte cell line HaCaT (nontransformed\nhuman cell line) were incubated in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 50ùúág/mL strepto-\nmycin, and 50 ùúág/mL penicillin at 37‚àòC in 5% CO\n\n2\n. Human\n\ngingival fibroblasts (HGFs) cell line by transfection with the\nE6/E7 open reading frames of HPV type 16 was cultured\naccording to the following protocol, as reported by our study\n[26]. Briefly, HGFs were cultured in DMEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS, 100U/mL penicillin, and 100 ùúág/mL strepto-\nmycin in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO\n\n2\nat 37‚àòC.\n\n2.3. Antiproliferative Assay. Cell viability was determined by\n3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bro-\nmide (MTT) assay. Briefly, cells were seeded in flat-bottomed\n96-well plates, at 1 √ó 105 cell/well 24 h prior to treatment. The\ncells were treated for various lengths of time with the agents\nindicated. Then 25ùúáL of 5mg/mL MTT was added to each\nwell. After 4 h incubation at 37‚àòC, 100 ùúáL of lysing buffer was\nadded. The buffer consisted of 20% w/v of sodium dodecyl\nsulfate in 0.1% of HCl solution. The plates were incubated for\na further analysis on an ELISA reader at 570 nm. The same\nexperiment was repeated in three separate cultures, and the\ndata were presented as the means ¬± SD of five observations.\n\n2.4. Flow Cytometry\n\n2.4.1. Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining. Cells were seeded at\n5 √ó 105cells/well in six-well plates. After 24 h, cells were\ntreated with mollugin the 3 days. After treatment, cells were\nharvested and pelleted by centrifugation (400√óg, 4‚àòC, 5min).\nThe cells were fixed with cold 75% ethanol for 24 h and\nthen stained with PI solution, consisting of 45mg/mL PI,\n10mg/mL RNase A, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation\nin the dark at 4‚àòC for 1 h, fluorescence-activated cells were\nsorted using the FACScan flow cytometer, and the data were\nanalyzed using Cellfit Analysis Software.\n\n2.5. Fluorescein-Isothiocyanate-(FITC-) Annexin V and Pro-\npidium Iodide (PI) Double Staining. Cells (5 √ó 105) were\nseeded in 6-well plates, incubated for 24 h, and then treated\nwith or without mollugin, and the incubation was continued\nfor 3 days. After treatment, the cell pellet was prepared in\na FACStar tube containing annexin V-FITC solution and\nincubated in 5%CO\n\n2\nat 37‚àòC.ThePI solution (withoutNP40)\n\nwas then added, and the ratio of PI-positive and annexin\nV-positive cells was measured using the flow cytometer.\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\n2.6. Morphological Analysis of Apoptosis by Staining with 4\U000f8020,6-\nDiamino-2-Phenylindole Dihydrochloride (DAPI). To con-\nfirm that the nuclei underwent morphological changes, the\ncells were cultured in 60mm dishes overnight and then\nwashed twice in DMEM. The cells were then treated with\nmollugin and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, after which they\nwere incubated in 1ùúág/mL DAPI solution for 30min in the\ndark. The cells were then examined using a fluorescence\nmicroscope (Zeiss, OberkoÃàchen, Germany).\n\n2.7. Western Blot Analysis. Western blot analysis was per-\nformed by lysing cells in 20mMTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4) con-\ntaining protease inhibitor mixture (0.1mM phenylmethane-\nsulfonyl fluoride, 5mg/mL aprotinin, 5mg/mL pepstatin A,\nand 1mg/mL chymostatin). Protein concentration was deter-\nmined using the Lowry protein assay kit (P5626; Sigma).\nAn equal amount of protein for each sample was resolved\nusing 7% or 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then electrophoretically\ntransferred onto a Hybond-enhanced chemiluminescence\n(ECL) nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).\nThe membrane was blocked with 5% skim milk and sequen-\ntially incubated with primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary\nantibody followed by ECL detection (Amersham Pharmacia\nBiotech, Piscataway, NJ).\n\n2.8. Isolation of RNA and RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated\nusing the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)\naccording to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. It was then\nreverse-transcribed using AccuPower RT premix (Bioneer,\nDaejeon, Korea). The PCR amplification of the resulting\ncDNAsampleswas performedusing aGeneAmpPCRSystem\n2400 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer,Wellesley, MA, USA).The\nprimers information is summarized in Table 1. The following\nPCR conditions were used: 34 cycles of denaturation at 95‚àòC\nfor 30 s, primer annealing at 60‚àòC for 30 s, and extension\nat 72‚àòC for 30 s. The PCR products were resolved on 1-2%\nagarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide.\n\n2.9. HO-1 and Nrf2 siRNA Transfection. The target sequence\nfor human HO-1 siRNA was 5\U000f8020-AACUUUCAGAAGGGC-\nCAGGUGTT-3\U000f8020 (forward) and 5\U000f8020-CACCUGGCCCUU-\nCUGAAAGUUTT-3\U000f8020 (reverse). Transfection of Nrf2 siRNA\nwas performed using the target sequence 5\U000f8020-AAGAGUAUG-\nAGCUGGAAAAACTT-3\U000f8020 (forward) and 5\U000f8020-GUUUUU-\nCCAGCUCAUACUCUUTT-3\U000f8020 (reverse). Cells were trans-\nfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invit-\nrogen) according to the manufacture‚Äôs instruction. Silencer\nNegative Control siRNA (Invitrogen) was introduced into\ncells by the same method. Following transfection, cells were\ncultured in six-well plates at 37‚àòC until required.\n\n2.10. Statistical Analysis. Data are expressed as the mean\n¬± standard deviation. Statistical comparisons of the results\nwere made using analysis of variance (ANOVA). Significant\ndifferences (ùëÉ < 0.05) between the means of control and\nsulfur-treated cells were analyzed using Dunnett‚Äôs test.\n\nTable 1: Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction primers.\n\nGene Sequence 5\U000f8020-3\U000f8020 Size\n\nMMP-9 Forward: GTTGGGGAGGGCTGTCCGTGA 911 bp\nReverse: CGTGGCGCTATCCAGCTCACC\n\nICAM-1 Forward: CGCCCGATTGCTTTAGCTTG 320 bp\nReverse: CGACTCACCTGGGAACAGAG\n\nVEGF Forward: TCAAGGTTGGCGGAAGTGAGG 443 bp\nReverse: CCCTTGCATCAGTAGGCTTCA\n\nFGF2 Forward: GCCTCATTTCCATTTCGTGG 224 bp\nReverse: CGGGGGTACTGGTTTACAG\n\nùõΩ-actin Forward: CATGGATGATGATATCGCCGC 319 bp\nReverse: ACATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCT\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effect of Mollugin on HN4 and HN12 Cell Viability.\nTo investigate the effect of mollugin on the proliferation\nof human OSCCs, the MTT assay was used. As shown in\nFigure 1, mollugin inhibited cellular proliferation in a dose-\nand time-dependent manner. Moreover, mollugin displayed\nhigher cytotoxicity in primary OSCC HN4 cells compared\nwith metastatic OSCC HN12 cells, although the overall trend\nof the effects of mollugin onHN4 andHN12 cells was similar.\nFurthermore, we tested whether mollugin has any toxic\neffect on nonneoplastic human skin keratinocytes (HaCaT)\nand gingival fibroblasts (GF). Interestingly, we did not find\nsignificant cytotoxicity or cell death by mollugin on HaCaT\nand GF (Figures 1(c) and 1(d)).\n\n3.2. Effect of Mollugin on HN4 and HN12 Cell Apoptosis. To\ndetermine whether the cause of cell death was apoptosis,\nHN4 and HN12 cells were exposed to 40ùúáM mollugin\nfor 3 days. This concentration was used because it repro-\nducibly induced 50% growth inhibition in HN4 and HN12\ncells cultured for 3 days. Cell nuclei were stained with\n4\U000f8020,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), a fluorescent DNA-\nbinding dye (Figure 2(a)). DAPI staining showed that the\ncontrol nuclei were large and round without condensation\nor fragmentation, whereas most of the nuclei of mollugin-\ntreated cells were condensed and fragmented, as is typical\nduring apoptosis. The onset of apoptotic cell death by mollu-\ngin was confirmed by flow cytometry of HN4 and HN12 cells\n(Figure 2(b)).Without treatment, only 3.88%HN4 and 2.80%\nHN12 cells were in the sub-G\n\n1\nregion; however, mollugin\n\ntreatment increased the proportions of cells in the sub-G\n1\n\nregion to 20.26% and 31.46%, respectively. To determine\nwhether the growth inhibitory effect ofmollugin is associated\nwith cell death, annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) double\nstaining of HN4 and HN12 cells and flow cytometry was\nperformed (Figure 2(c)). Treatment of cells withmollugin for\n3 days increased the number of annexin V+/PI+ stained cells.\nThese results demonstrate that the inhibition of cell growth\nby mollugin was caused by the induction of apoptosis.\n\n3.3.

The same\nexperiment was repeated in three separate cultures, and the data were presented as the means ¬± SD of five observations.\n\nand their upstream activating molecules are attractive targets\nfor cancer therapeutics, we evaluated the effect of mollugin\non NF-ùúÖB activation by measuring the phosphorylation and\ndegradation of IùúÖBùõº andNF-ùúÖBp65. As shown in Figure 3(a),\ntreatment of HN4 and HN12 cells with mollugin decreased\nthe steady-state levels of phosphorylated IùúÖBùõº and nuclear\nNF-ùúÖB p65.\n\nTo clarify the molecular mechanism by which mollugin\ninduces apoptosis in primary and metastatic OSCCs, we\ndetermined the levels of NF-ùúÖB-regulated gene products\ninvolved in apoptosis and antiapoptosis (Figure 3(b)). Mol-\nlugin treatment upregulated p53 and p21 expression in both\nHN4 and HN12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In con-\ntrast, the expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 andBcl-xl proteins\nwas dose-dependently reduced by mollugin treatment in\n\nHN4 andHN12 cells. Next, we investigated whethermollugin\ncould modulate levels of NF-ùúÖB-regulated gene products\ninvolved in invasion (ICAM-1 andMMP-9) and angiogenesis\n(VEGF and FGF-2) ofOSCCs.The results show thatmollugin\ndownregulated the expression ofNF-ùúÖB-regulated gene prod-\nucts, includingMMP-9, ICAM-1, VEGF, and FGF-2mRNA in\na dose-dependent manner (Figure 3(c)).\n\n3.4. Effect of Mollugin on MAPK and Nrf2 Activation. To\nclarify the mechanism underlying the apoptosis, we assessed\nthe effect ofmollugin onNrf2 andNF-ùúÖBupstreampathways.\nTreatment with mollugin (40ùúáM) increased levels of phos-\nphorylated (activated) ERK, p38, and JNK; the phosphory-\nlated proteins were easily detectable by Western blot after 30\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 5\n\nH\nN\n\n4\nControl\n\nH\nN\n\n12\nMollugin 40 ùúáM\n\n(a)\n\n3.88 ¬± 0.03\n\n20.26 ¬± 0.92\n\n31.46 ¬± 1.38\n\n2.8 ¬± 0.11\n\nSub G1: Sub G1:\n\nSub G1:Sub G1:\n\n200\n160\n120\n\n80\n40\n\n0\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nFL2-A\n\nC\nou\n\nnt\ns\n\nH\nN\n\n4\n\nControl\n200\n160\n120\n\n80\n40\n\n0\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nFL2-A\n\nC\nou\n\nnt\ns\n\n200\n160\n120\n\n80\n40\n\n0\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nFL2-A\n\nC\nou\n\nnt\ns\n\nH\nN\n\n12\n\n200\n160\n120\n\n80\n40\n\n0\n0 200 400 600 800 1000\n\nFL2-A\n\nC\nou\n\nnt\ns\n\nMollugin 40 ùúáM\n\n(b)\n\nH\nN\n\n4\n\nControl\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\nFL1-H\n\nFL\n2-\n\nH\nH\n\nN\n12\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\nFL1-H\n\nFL\n2-\n\nH\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\nFL1-H\n\nFL\n2-\n\nH\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\n10\n0\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n2\n\n10\n3\n\n10\n4\n\nFL1-H\n\nFL\n2-\n\nH\n\nAnnexin V-FITC\n\nPr\nop\n\nid\niu\n\nm\n io\n\ndi\nde\n\n (P\nI)\n\n10\n1\n\n0.91 ¬± 0.28 9.91 ¬± 0.92\n\n0.85 ¬± 0.07 5.16 ¬± 0.88\n\n1.17 ¬± 0.48\n\n0.77 ¬± 0.19\n\n8.42 ¬± 1.42\n\n4.34 ¬± 1.31\n\nMollugin 40 ùúáM\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 2: Confirmation of mollugin-induced apoptosis by DAPI staining (a), cell cycle analysis (b), and annexin V-PI staining (c) in OSCCs.\nCells were incubated with 40 ùúáM mollugin for 3 days.

In contrast, mollugin did not affect total p38, ERK,\nor JNK levels (Figure 4(a)).\n\nSince the stress response element/Nrf2 transcription fac-\ntor pathway is important for HO-1 expression [23], we next\ndetermined whether Nrf2 signaling is involved in mollugin-\ninducedHO-1 expression and apoptosis. Initially, Nrf2 activa-\ntion was assessed by the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus.\nTreatment with mollugin resulted in an accumulation of\nNrf2 in the nucleus in primary and metastatic OSCCs\n(Figure 4(b)).\n\nTo determine whether mollugin induces expression of\nantioxidant genes, HO-1 expression in oral cancer cells and\nthe change in the pattern of HO-1 expression were evaluated.\nHO-1 protein expression in primary and metastatic OSCCs\nincreased following mollugin treatment in a time-dependent\nmanner (Figure 4(c)).\n\nTo confirm the involvement of MAPK pathways in the\nmollugin-driven activation of NF-ùúÖB and Nrf2, inhibitors\nof ERK (PD98059), JNK (SP6100126), and p38 (SB203580)\nMAPK signaling were used. Mollugin-induced NF-ùúÖB, Nrf2,\nand HO-1 expression was effectively inhibited by PD98059,\nSP600126, and SB203580 (Figure 4(d)), suggesting that p38,\nERK1/2, and JNK play important roles in activating NF-ùúÖB,\nNrf2, and HO-1 in HN4 and HN12 cells.\n\n3.5. Involvement of the HO-1 Pathway in Mollugin-Induced\nApoptosis. To examine the cytotoxic potential of tin proto-\nporphyrin (SnPP), an HO-1 inhibitor, its effect on viability\nwas initially measured by the MTT assay (Figure 5(a)).\nAlthough, 10 or 20ùúáMSnPP had no cytotoxicity effect for 3 h,\nwe found that SnPP exhibited slight cytotoxicity on HN4 and\n\n\n\n6 BioMed Research International\n\nHN4 HN12\n\nNF-ùúÖB p65 nuclear\n\nLamin B\n\np-IùúÖB\n\nIùúÖB\n\n(min)\n0 10 30 60 90 0 10 30 60 90\n\n(min)\n\n(a)\n\nHN4 HN12 \n\nùõΩ-actin\n\nBcl-2\n\nBcl-xL\n\np53\n\np21WAF1/CIP1\n\n0 10 20 40 800 10 20 40 80\nMollugin (ùúáM) Mollugin (ùúáM)\n\n(b)\n\nMMP-9\n\nICAM-1\n\nVEGF\n\nFGF2\n\nùõΩ-actin\n0 10 20 40 800 10 20 40 80\n\nHN4 HN12\n\nMollugin (ùúáM) Mollugin (ùúáM)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 3: Effects of mollugin on activation of NF-ùúÖB (a), and expression of NF-ùúÖB-regulated gene products involved in apoptosis and\nantiapoptosis (b), metastasis, and angiogenesis (c) in OSCCs.

Based on these findings, we chose to use\nSnPP for 3 h.\n\nTo determine whether the induction of HO-1 plays a\nrole in mollugin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in\nOSCCs, cells were treated with SnPP, an HO-1 inhibitor, for\n3 h before incubation with mollugin for 3 days. MTT assays\nshowed that mollugin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis\nin HN4 and HN12 cells were dose-dependently reversed\nby pretreatment with SnPP (Figures 5(a) and 5(b)). In\naddition, SnPP treatment abolished the induction of p53\nand p21WAF1/CIP1 expression by mollugin, but reversed the\nexpression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl (Figure 5(c)).\n\nAdditionally, we used a siRNA-expressing plasmid to\ninduce HO-1 gene silencing. HN4 and HN12 cells were\ntransfected with an HO-1-targeting siRNA expression vector\n(Figure 6). The siRNA approach resulted in high silencing\nefficacies for HO-1, which was confirmed by Western\nblot analysis (Figure 6(c)). Silencing of HO-1 significantly\nattenuated mollugin-induced cytotoxicity (Figure 6(a))\n\nand apoptosis (Figure 6(b)). Moreover HO-1 RNA blocked\nmollugin-induced Nrf2, p53, and p21 upregulation as well as\nBcl-2 and Bcl-xl downregulation (Figure 6(c)).\n\n3.6. Involvement of the Nrf2 Pathway in Mollugin-Induced\nHO-1 Induction and Apoptosis. To investigate whether\nmollugin-induced apoptosis and HO-1 expression were\nmediated by Nrf2 activation, a specific small interfering RNA\n(siRNA) against Nrf2 was used. As shown in Figure 7(c),\ntransfection with Nrf2 siRNA for 5 h in HN4 and HN12\ncells blocked mollugin-induced HO-1 and Nrf2 expression.\nHowever, Nrf2 siRNA did not affect the mollugin-induced\np65 expression. Transfection with Nrf2 siRNA inhibited\nmollugin-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HN4 and\nHN12 cells (Figures 7(a) and 7(b)). Moreover, transfection\nwith Nrf2 siRNA in HN4 and HN12 cells reduced mollugin-\ninduced apoptosis proteins (p53 and p21), but reversed\nantiapoptosis proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl) (Figure 7(c)).\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 7\n\nHN4 HN12\np-ERK\n\nERK\n\np-JNK\n\nJNK\n\np-p38\n\np38\n\n0 10 30 60 90 0 10 30 60 90\n(min)(min)\n\n(a)\n\nHN4 HN12\n\n(min)\n0 10 30 60 90 0 10 30 60 90\n\nNrf2 nuclear\n\nNrf2 cytoplasm\n\nùõΩ-actin\n\nùõΩ-actin\nMollugin\n\n(min)\n\n(b)\n\nHO-1\n\nùõΩ-actin\n\nMollugin 0 0.5 1 2 3 0 0.5 1 2 3\n(days)\n\nHN4 HN12\n\n(days)\n\n(c)\n\nHN4 HN12\np-ERK\n\nERK\n\np-JNK\n\nJNK\n\np-p38\n\np38\n\nNF-ùúÖB p65 nuclear\n\nNrf2 nuclear\n\nNrf2 cytoplasm\n\nMollugin\nPD98059\nSP600125\nSB203580\n\nHO-1\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\n‚àí\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\n+ +\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+‚àí\n‚àí ‚àí\n\n‚àí ‚àí\n‚àí\n\n+‚àí\n‚àí\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\n‚àí\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\n+ +\n\n+\n\n+\n+\n\n+‚àí\n‚àí ‚àí\n\n‚àí ‚àí\n‚àí\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 4: Effect of mollugin on phosphorylation of MAPK (a), activation of Nrf2 (b), and expression of HO-1 (c) in OSCCs.

Discussion\n\nThis study is to our knowledge the first to demonstrate that\nmollugin directly induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in\nprimary and metastatic OSCCs and to address the molecular\nbasis of this effect.\n\nWith regard to antitumor activity, mollugin has been\nshown to exert cytotoxic effects on human colon cancer\n(Col2) cells (IC\n\n50\n= 12.3 ùúáM; [11]), human liver carcinoma\n\n(HepG2) cells (IC\n50\nvalue = 60.2 ùúáM; [10]), and basal HER2-\n\nexpressing human breast cancer cells (IC\n50\n\nvalue = 58ùúáM;\n[17]). In the present study, we found that mollugin (10‚Äì\n80 ùúáM) resulted in significant growth inhibition, with an\naverage IC\n\n50\nvalue of 46.3ùúáM in metastatic OSCCs (HN12)\n\nand 43.9 ùúáM in primary OSCCs (HN4) after 3 days. These\nantiproliferative properties of mollugin are consistent with\nprevious reports in human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells\n[14] and HER2-overexpressing breast and ovarian cancer\ncell lines [17]. Moreover, we demonstrated that mollugin\ninduced OSCC cell death by triggering apoptosis due to the\npresence of several apoptotic characteristics, including sub-\nG\n1\nphase accumulation, increase in annexin+/PI+ cells, and\n\nDNA fragmentation.\nNF-ùúÖB signaling is a ubiquitous pathway in cell prolif-\n\neration, survival, and apoptosis. Normally, NF-ùúÖB proteins\nare inhibited by binding to IùúÖB proteins in the cytoplasm.\nStress factors cause degradation of IùúÖB proteins through\nthe ubiquitin-proteosomal pathway, and NF-ùúÖB is released\n\n\n\n10 BioMed Research International\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\nC\n\nel\nl v\n\nia\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\nMollugin\nNrf2 siRNA\n\nControl siRNA\n‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\nÔøΩÔøΩ\n\n‚àó‚àó\n\n+\n\nHN4\nHN12\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nMollugin\nNrf2 siRNA\n\nControl siRNA\n‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n‚àí\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\nÔøΩ\nÔøΩ\n\nA\nnn\n\nex\nin\n\n V\n+\n\n/P\nI‚àí\n\n(%\n)\n\nHN4\nHN12\n\n+\n\n(b)\n\nMollugin\n\nBcl-xL\n\nBcl-2\n\nùõΩ-actin\n\np53\n\np21WAF1/CIP1\n\nHO-1\n\nTotal Nrf2\n\nNrf2 nuclear\n\nNrf2 siRNA\nControl siRNA\n\n+\n\n+\n\n‚àí +\n\n+\n\n‚àí‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n+\n\n‚àí +\n\n+\n\n‚àí‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\nHN12 HN4\n\nNF-ùúÖB p65 nuclear\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 7: Effect of Nrf2 siRNA onmollugin-induced growth inhibition (a), apoptosis (b), and apoptosis-related proteins expression (c).

To explore\nthe mechanism underlying mollugin-induced apoptosis in\nOSCCs, we examined NF-ùúÖB activation. In agreement with\nprevious findings that mollugin suppressed NF-ùúÖB activation\ninHER2-overexpressing SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells [17], our\nresults indicate that mollugin significantly inhibited NF-ùúÖB\nactivation by reducing the level of phospho-IùúÖBùõº, leading to\nblockage of the IùúÖBùõº pathway in NF-ùúÖB activation in OSCCs.\nIn addition, it was reported that mollugin significantly sup-\npressed TNF-ùõº-induced NF-ùúÖB transcriptional activation in\nHT-29 human colonic epithelial cells [13].\n\nGenes involved in the proliferation, apoptosis, antiapop-\ntosis, angiogenesis, and metastasis of cancer are regulated\nby NF-ùúÖB [29]. Constitutive activation of NF-ùúÖB negatively\n\nregulates the proapoptotic functions of p53 by inducing the\nexpression of an array of antiapoptotic genes, including Bcl-\n2 and Bcl-xL [30]. In our study, treatment with mollugin\ninduced the downregulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-\nxL levels as well as the upregulation of apoptotic p53 and\np21 levels in OSCCs. Another hallmark of OSCC behavior\nis their propensity for local invasion and metastasis. MMP-\n9 is frequently overexpressed in OSCCs and is dependent\nupon NF-ùúÖB for expression [31]. Adhesion molecules such\nas ICAM-1 are regulated by NF-ùúÖB and are essential for\nthe adhesion of tumor cells to endothelial cells and thus\nmediate tumor cellmetastasis [32]. Angiogenesis is important\nfor tumor growth and progression. The development of\nangiogenesis is stimulated by cytokines and growth factors,\nand the expression of these cytokines and growth factors is\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 11\n\nMollugin\n\n(ERK, p38, JNK)\n\nProapoptotic\n\neffect\n\nAntiapoptotic\n\neffect\n\n?\n\nNF-ùúÖB ‚Üì MAPK ‚Üë Nrf2 ‚Üë\n\nVEGF ‚Üì FGF2 ‚ÜìMMP-9 ‚Üì ICAM-1‚Üì\nHO-1‚Üë\n\np21‚Üë p53 ‚Üë Bcl-2 ‚Üì Bcl-XL ‚Üì\n\nApoptosis ‚Üë\n\nFigure 8: Schematic diagram illustrating the Nrf2 pathway and other signaling pathways triggered by exposure to mollugin in in OSCCs.\nMollugin treatment leads to the activation of the cellular stress-dependent signaling pathways mediated byMAPK activation (ERK, JNK, and\np38) and subsequent transcription factor activation (NF-ùúÖB andNrf2). Ultimately, these transcription factors result in altered gene expression\nto produce cytoprotective gene HO-1, allowing lead to apoptosis.\n\ncorrelated with the pathological neovascularization circum-\nstances. Among these angiogenic factors, VEGF and FGF-\n2 are important angiogenic factors and essential for cancers\n[33]. In this study, we found that mollugin inhibited the\nexpression of NF-ùúÖB-regulated gene products involved in\ninvasion (MMP-9 and ICAM-1) and angiogenesis (FGF-2 and\nVEGF). Thus, our results demonstrate that mollugin inhibits\nNF-ùúÖB, leading to suppression of proliferation, invasion, and\nangiogenesis in OSCCs.\n\nThe MAPKs are proline-directed Ser/Thr protein kinases\nthat regulate many cellular processes, including cell prolif-\neration and death. JNK and p38 are activated by cellular\nstress and are associatedwith apoptosis [34].The involvement\nof ERK in the induction of apoptosis by quercetin, resver-\natrol, and taxol has been reported [35, 36]. In the present\nstudy, phosphorylation of p38, ERK, and JNK was detected\nin mollugin-treated OSCCs, which is consistent with our\nprevious reports that sappanchalcone may exert its effect on\nOSCCs through p38, ERK, and JNK activation [9].Therefore,\n\nNF-ùúÖB regulation downstream of the MAPK (ERK1/2, p38,\nand JNK) pathways may be involved in mollugin-induced\napoptosis inOSCCs.However,mollugin activated p38MAPK\nin hippocampal and microglial cells [15] and ERK in HER2-\noverexpressing breast cancer cells [17]. Therefore, MAPK can\nbe differentially activated, and its involvement in apoptosis is\nhighly context and model dependent.\n\nThe role of HO-1 in tumor development is still not\nunderstood completely. Some recent reports demonstrate dis-\ncordant or even completely contrasting results. Nevertheless,\naccumulating evidence indicates that HO-1 is expressed or\noverexpressed in a wide variety of human tumors and plays\na critical role in the progression of neoplastic diseases [37].\nFor example, it has been shown that increased expression\nof HO-1 is associated with a higher rate of proliferation of\nvarious tumor cells [37, 38], although opposite effects have\nbeen observed in breast cancer cells [39]. Furthermore, the\nincreased basal level of HO-1 expression in tumor cells can\nbe further elevated by chemotherapeutics or phytochemicals,\n\n\n\n12 BioMed Research International\n\nsuch as curcumin, carnosol, and ILME [8, 22, 23]. Our results\nshow that mollugin upregulated HO-1 expression in a time-\nand dose-dependent manner (data not shown), consistent\nwith results in hippocampal and microglial cells [15]. We\nfound that growth inhibition and apoptosis ofOSCCs bymol-\nlugin was reversed in the presence of an HO-1 inhibitor. In\naddition, mollugin induced downregulation of antiapoptotic\nBcl-2 and Bcl-xL levels, while upregulation of apoptotic p53\nand p21 levels was reversed by SnPP in a dose-dependent\nmanner. These results suggest that the growth inhibition and\napoptosis-inducing effect of mollugin is mediated via HO-1\nexpression.\n\nRegarding HO-1, Nrf-2 is a relatively well-known tran-\nscription factor [40]. In response to diverse HO-1 inducers,\nNrf2 translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus where it\nbinds to the antioxidant response element in the promoter\nregion of the HO-1 gene [41]. In our study, mollugin also\ninduced the translocation of Nrf-2 into the nucleus, as\nevidenced by Western blot. Furthermore, the results of this\nstudy demonstrate a correlation between apoptotic gene\nupregulation and the suppression of antiapoptotic genes of\nOSCCs to undergo mollugin-induced growth inhibition and\napoptosis when Nrf-2 is knocked down. Based on these\nobservations, it is reasonable to conclude that Nrf2 activation\nmediates mollugin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis\nin OSCCs.\n\nRedox-sensitive transcription factor (NF-ùúÖB, AP-1, and\nNrf2) pathways are known to be important molecular targets\nin chemoprevention. Activation of Nrf2 and NF-ùúÖB involves\nregulation of protein kinases, whichmay induce their nuclear\ntranslocation [42]. It was previously shown that mollugin\ninduced apoptosis via JNK inhuman Jurkat T cells [14]. In this\nregard, specific protein kinase inhibitors of PI3 K and ERK\nrepressed Nrf2 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of\nNrf2 and NF-ùúÖB in HepG2 cells, as previously reported in\ndifferent cell types [43, 44]. The present results also suggest\nthat the MAPK pathway plays a role in the mollugin-induced\nnuclear translocation of Nrf2 and NF-ùúÖB in HN4 and HN12\ncells. A variety of anticarcinogenic phytochemicals suppress\nNF-ùúÖB signalling and activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway [45],\nsuggesting that the suppression of NF-ùúÖB signalling and the\nactivation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway may crosstalk with each\nother. Indeed, inhibition ofNF-ùúÖB activation by phospholipid\nhydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase and 15-lipoxygenase\nis concomitant to upregulation of HO-1, probably via Nrf2\nactivation [46]. Thus, the findings support that the partici-\npation of NF-ùúÖB p65 in the negative regulation of Nrf2-ARE\nsignalling, providing a new insight into a possible role of\nNF-ùúÖB in suppressing the expression of anti-inflammatory\nor antitumour genes [47]. Our results suggest that MAPK\nsingnaling event mediates the link between NF-ùúÖB and Nrf2.\nAlthough the NF-ùúÖB pathway was inhibited by mollugin\nexposure, Nrf2 siRNA did not seem to participate in the\ntranslocation of NF-ùúÖB, suggesting that NF-ùúÖB and Nrf2\npathways might act in parallel in our in vitro model. A\nsummary of our results is shown in Figure 8.\n\nColectivelly, our results demonstrate for the first time\nthat mollugin inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis\n\nin OSCCs through the NF-ùúÖB/MAPK/Nrf2/HO-1 signal-\ning pathway. Therefore, mollugin may have potential as a\nchemotherapeutic agent for OSCCs. The activities of mol-\nlugin against multiple antitumor targets should be studied\nintensively for further clinical application either as a nat-\nural agent alone or in combination with other commonly\nused chemotherapeutics. Further investigation of mollugin\nin animal models of OSCCS will contribute to additional\nunderstanding of its in vivo activity toward malignant cells\nand its potential toxicity toward normal tissues.\n\nAuthors‚Äô Contribution\n\nY.-M.
