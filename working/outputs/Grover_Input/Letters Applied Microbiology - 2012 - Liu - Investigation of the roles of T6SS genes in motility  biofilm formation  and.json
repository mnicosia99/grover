Zhang\n\nState Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China\n\nIntroduction\n\nVibriosis, an infection caused by Vibrio species, is a wide-\n\nspread threat to the marine culture and brings about huge\n\neconomic loss worldwide. There have been more than 10\n\nkinds of vibrios reported to be the causative agents in the\n\nuniversal marine culture at present, including Vibrio an-\n\nguillarum, V. vulnificus, V. parahaemolyticus, V. harveyi\n\nand V. alginolyticus (Austin 2010). The genomes of all\n\nthese species have been sequenced and the information is\n\navailable on GenBank. Yet only a small portion of these\n\ngenes has been experimentally assigned a function.\n\nGenetic tools are essential for gene function analysis\n\nincluding the ectopic expression, the site-directed in-frame\n\ndeletion, and the complementation. The discovery of\n\nrestriction enzymes in the early 1970s led to the revolu-\n\ntionary progress in the analysis of nucleic acids. However,\n\nthis traditional method takes much time for the restriction\n\nenzyme digestion and ligation, meanwhile the process may\n\nbe hampered by the limited restriction enzyme sites\n\nlocated on the plasmid and versatile sites contained in the\n\ntarget DNA sequence. Furthermore, the efficiency of\n\nobtaining positive clones is closely correlated to the effec-\n\ntiveness of the restriction enzyme digestion. It is therefore\n\na burning need to expand the tools for high-throughput\n\nscreening and gene function analysis.\n\nGateway technology (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) is\n\na cloning technique based on site-specific recombination\n\nKeywords\n\nAsp, biofilm, gateway, T6SS, Vibrio\n\nalginolyticus.\n\nCorrespondence\n\nQ.

The results illustrated that all\n\nthe mutant strains showed no significant effects on extracellular protease pro-\n\nduction, expression of Hcp1, and biofilm formation when compared to the\n\nwild-type strain, but in-frame deletion of VEPGS_0008 resulted in obvious bio-\n\nfilm reduction and the complemented strain restored to the level of the\n\nwild-type strain. Besides, in-frame deletion of dotU1, VEPGS_0008 and ppkA2\n\nabolished the swarming ability.\n\nConclusions: A set of Gateway-compatible vectors for internal insertion,\n\nin-frame deletion and complementation of the target genes is constructed to\n\nfacilitate the general and rapid function analysis of genes involved in T6SS in\n\nVibrio alginolyticus.\n\nSignificance and Impact of the Study: The modified Gateway-compatible plas-\n\nmids greatly facilitate the high-throughput and convenient function analysis of\n\nthe unidentified genes.\n\nLetters in Applied Microbiology ISSN 0266-8254\n\nNo claim to Chinese Government works\n\nLetters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73–81 ª 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology 73\n\n\n\ncharacteristics of the lambda bacteriophage (Landy 1989)\n\nthat encompasses two opposite recombination reactions\n\n(BP and LR). The BP recombination reaction catalysed by\n\nBP clonase refers to the recombination reaction between\n\nattB sites in the target gene and attP sites carried on the\n\ndonor vector, resulting in the attL-containing entry plas-\n\nmid. Similarly, the attL-flanked target gene carried on\n\nentry plasmid can be transferred to various destination\n\nvectors that contain homologous attR sites by the LR\n\nreaction catalysed by the LR clonase, generating the target\n\nplasmid carrying the attB-flanked sequences. Gateway\n\ntechnology avoids the labour-intensive restriction enzyme\n\ndigestion and ligation process and enhances the efficiency\n\nof getting positive strains for the presence of the counter-\n\nselective marker, CcdB. At present, Gateway cloning sys-\n\ntem has been successfully used for high-throughput gene\n\nfunction analysis in various microorganisms (Dupuy et al.\n\n2004; Hope et al. 2004; Busso et al. 2005; Yahata et al.\n\n2005).\n\nIn this study, we have described the construction of a\n\nset of modified Gateway-compatible vectors and their\n\napplication in the rapid investigation of roles of type VI\n\nsecretion system (T6SS) genes in fish pathogen V. algino-\n\nlyticus.

The fragment with 210-bp in-frame deletion of\n\nthe dotU1 gene generated by overlap PCR was cloned into\n\nthe donor vector, pDONR221 with the BP reaction to get\n\nthe entry plasmid. Besides, for the construction of corre-\n\nsponding complemented strains, the sequences containing\n\nthe intact promoter regions and ORFs of the indicated\n\ngenes were obtained by PCR with the designed primers\n\nharbouring attB sites and then transferred to the\n\npDONR221 with BP reaction. The primers used for gene\n\ncloning and plasmid construction are listed in Table 2.\n\nConstruction of the destination vectors\n\nTo create the Gateway-compatible plasmids, first, the\n\nattR1-ccdB ⁄ Cmr-attR2 cassette was amplified from\npDEST17 (Invitrogen) with primers pDDF and pDDR,\n\nwhich covered 15-bp sequence homologous to either side\n\nof the SalI site located on pNQ705-1 (Wang et al. 2002)\n\nand pDM4 (Milton et al. 1996) at the 5¢ end, SalI site in\nthe middle, and the specific sequence of the attR1-\n\nccdB ⁄ Cmr-attR2 cassette at the 3¢ end. Then the fragment\nwas cloned into SalI digested linearized pNQ705-1 and\n\npDM4 respectively, to generate the destination plasmids\n\npNQ705-1.DEST and pDM4.DEST for the mutant con-\n\nstruction using the seamless cloning kit according to the\n\nmanufacturer’s instruction (Genescript, Shanghai, China).\n\nLikewise, the pMMB206.DEST was produced by inserting\n\nattR1-ccdB ⁄ Cmr-attR2 cassette amplified from pDEST17\nusing primers pMDF and pMDR into the EcoRI digested\n\npMMB206 (Morales et al. 1991). All destination plasmids\n\nwere transformed into SM10 kpir strain that was resistant\nto the CcdB toxicity and also supported replication of the\n\np protein required R6K plasmids such as pNQ705-1 and\npDM4 for positive screening.\n\nTransfer of target genes into the destination vectors\n\nAll the entry vectors and corresponding destination plas-\n\nmids were harvested from various hosts (Table 1). LR\n\nrecombination reaction was carried out according to the\n\nmanufacturer’s instruction (Invitrogen) and the reaction\n\nmixture was then transformed into E. coli CC118 kpir (Den-\nnis and Zylstra 1998). The destination vectors carrying the\n\ntarget sequences were confirmed by PCR and sequencing.\n\nScreening of target gene deletion mutants\n\nIn-frame deletion mutants were constructed in the\n\nselected genes by double-crossover allelic exchanges\n\naccording to previous protocols (Liu et al. 2011).\n\nWestern-blot analysis of Hcp1 and Asp\n\nTo detect the production of Hcp1 and Asp, Western-blot\n\nwas carried according to the previous work (Sheng et al.\n\n2012).\n\nExtracellular protease activity, biofilm formation, motil-\n\nity assay, and LD50 determination\n\nThe extracellular product (ECP) production assays deter-\n\nmined with hide powder azure (HPA) digestion assay and\n\nmilk plate assay, biofilm formation, motility assay, and\n\nLD50 determination with healthy zebrafish were carried\n\nout according to the previously described methods (Liu\n\net al. 2011).\n\nAggregation assay\n\nOvernight cultures of all the tested strains were harvested\n\nand normalized to the same OD600 values in 5 ml LBS\n\nbroth in glass test tubes. All the tubes were shaken vigor-\n\nously first and then cultured statically at room tempera-\n\nture for 10 min. Afterwards, OD600 of each strain was\n\nassayed to determine the aggregation.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical significance was determined using Student’s\n\nt-test (spss 11.5; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).\n\nResults\n\nConstruction of the Gateway-compatible destination\n\nvectors\n\nThe plasmid pNQ705-1 (Wang et al. 2002) used for inser-\n\ntion mutation construction, pDM4 (Milton et al. 1996)\n\nfor in-frame deletion mutant construction, and pMMB206\n\n(Morales et al. 1991) for complementation construction\n\nare widely used for the construction of mutant and com-\n\nplemented strains. They carried defined restriction enzyme\n\nsites, and thus the flexibility was limited. Besides, all the\n\nabove plasmids are recalcitrant to be definitely digested or\n\nobserved to show smearing on agarose gel (H. Liu, D. Gu\n\nand Q.Y. Wang, unpublished data). Thus, it is difficult\n\nand time-consuming for gene cloning using these plas-\n\nmids with the conventional method of restriction enzyme\n\ndigestion and ligation. To circumvent these limitations,\n\nwe set to modify the plasmids to make them compatible\n\nfor using with the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The\n\nattR1-ccdB ⁄ Cmr-attR2 cassette was amplified from\npDEST17 (Invitrogen) using the primers with the addition\n\nof the 21-bp consensus sequence to the defined sequences\n\nGateway plasmids for genetic analysis H. Liu et al.\n\n76 Letters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73–81 ª 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology\nNo claim to Chinese Government works\n\n\n\nof pDM4, pNQ705-1, and pMMB206 plasmids respec-\n\ntively (Fig. 1) and then moved onto these plasmids by\n\nseamless cloning method (Genescript). The desired desti-\n\nnation plasmids maintained in E. coli SM10 kpir strain\nthat was resistant to the toxic effect of CcdB and mean-\n\nwhile supplied the pir-encoded p protein for replication of\nR6K plasmids (e.g. pNQ705-1 and pDM4) (Table 1) were\n\nselected on the plates containing the indicated antibiotics.\n\nThe sequencing results confirmed the presence and the\n\nvalidity of the attR1-ccdB ⁄ Cmr-attR2 cassette in all\ntested strains. Therefore a set of Gateway-compatible plas-\n\nmids for convenient and systemic gene function analy-\n\nsis, including pNQ705-1.DEST, pDM4.DEST, and\n\npMMB206.DEST, was successfully constructed.\n\nExpression of Hcp1 based on Gateway destination plas-\n\nmid pDEST17\n\nTo evaluate the Gateway-based cloning technology, we\n\ncloned the ORF sequences of hcp1 (the hallmark of the\n\nT6SS in V. alginolyticus) into the donor vector\n\npDONR221 (Invitrogen) to generate the entry plasmid.\n\nThen the ORF of hcp1 was transferred from the entry vec-\n\ntor into the destination vector, pDEST17 (Invitrogen),\n\nwhich contains the strong bacteriophage T7 promoter for\n\nthe controlled and inducible expression of the proteins of\n\ninterest and 6 · His at the N-terminal of the specific\nsequence for the convenient purification, by LR reaction\n\nto obtain the expression plasmid. The efficiency of recov-\n\nering desired clones was high (49 ⁄ 50 positive, data not\nshown). However, 25-bp attB sites remained flanking the\n\nORF of hcp1 (Fig. 2a). To verify the expression of Hcp1\n\nbased on Gateway system, the Hcp1 expression was\n\ninduced by adding isopropyl-b-d-thiogalactopyranoside\n(IPTG) when the OD600 reached 0Æ4. Then the total pro-\nteins were harvested and loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE.\n\nThe result demonstrated that Hcp1 was expressed success-\n\nfully by using the Gateway-based plasmids and the pres-\n\nence of the attB sites seems to exert no effect on the\n\nnormal expression of Hcp1 (Fig. 2b). The expression of\n\nHcp1 utilizing pDEST17 was also verified by Western-blot\n\nusing Hcp1-specific antibody (Sheng et al. 2012)\n\n(Fig. 2b). Taken together, the protein expression can be\n\nachieved rapidly and efficiently with Gateway technology.\n\nFunctional analysis of T6SS genes using Gateway-com-\n\npatible plasmids\n\nTo validate and evaluate the Gateway-compatible plas-\n\nmids for mutant construction, five genes involved in\n\nT6SS in V. alginolyticus were selected to generate the in-\n\nframe deletion mutants. The process avoided the restric-\n\ntion enzyme selection, and the transfer efficiency of the\n\ntarget genes into the destination plasmids reached 90–\n\n100%. All the five in-frame deletion mutant strains were\n\nobtained successfully following the double-crossover alle-\n\nlic exchanges according to previous protocols (Liu et al.\n\n2011). Meanwhile, all the complemented strains were also\n\ngenerated successfully using Gateway-compatible plasmid\n\npMMB206.DEST.

Liu et al. Gateway plasmids for genetic analysis\n\nNo claim to Chinese Government works\n\nLetters in Applied Microbiology 55, 73–81 ª 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology 77\n\n\n\nmutation of the target genes was also achieved in V. algi-\n\nnolyticus (data not shown).\n\nThe T6SS has been linked to a myriad of processes,\n\nincluding biofilm formation (Aschtgen et al. 2008), motil-\n\nity (Jana et al. 2011), extracellular protease production\n\n(Weber et al. 2009), and promoting or limiting virulence\n\n(Filloux 2009). Here in, all the five obtained mutant strains\n\nbased on Gateway-compatible plasmids were analysed for\n\ntheir roles in regulating the virulence-related elements,\n\nincluding motility, extracellular protease production,\n\nbiofilm formation, and T6SS hallmark Hcp1 secretion in\n\nV. alginolyticus. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 3, there were\n\nno significant differences in swimming and aggregation in\n\nall tested strains, but DdotU1, DN08 harbouring in-frame\ndeletion of VEPGS_0008 gene, and DppkA2 lost the\nswarming ability. The extracellular protease production in\n\nthe mutant strains displayed no significant difference in\n\ncomparison with the wild-type strain. However, DN11\n\nstrain, which carried in-frame deletion of VEPGS_0011\n\ngene, exhibited almost 50% reduction in extracellular pro-\n\ntease production. Unfortunately, the complemented strain\n\ndid not fully restore to the level of the wild-type strain\n\n(Fig. 3b).\n\nBesides, the biofilm assay results revealed that all the\n\nfive mutant strains, except DN08, showed comparable\n\nlevel of biofilm production to that of the wild-type strain.\n\nThe biofilm was almost invisible in DN08 strain and\n\nrestored to the level observed in the wild-type when the\n\nintact gene was introduced into DN08, confirming the\n\ncrucial roles of VEPGS_0008 gene in biofilm formation in\n\nV. alginolyticus. For Hcp1 production assay, there are no\n\ndissimilarities in all these five mutant strains compared\n\nwith the wild-type strain when the whole cell lysates were\n\nprobed with Hcp1-specific antibody. However, no visible\n\nband against Hcp1 was present in any of the five mutant\n\nstrains when the concentrated supernatants were con-\n\nducted. In contrast, very weak and apparent Hcp1 secre-\n\ntion could be respectively detected in the wild-type strain\n\nand the DpppA mutant strain as previously described\n(Sheng et al. 2012) (Fig. 3d).\n\nThe zebrafish infection experiment was further per-\n\nformed to evaluate the impact of the five genes on the\n\nvirulence of V. alginolyticus. The fish infected with a high\n\ndose (3Æ5 · 107 CFU per fish) of the wild-type and the\nfive mutant strains died within 24 h. At the dose of\n\n3Æ5 · 106 CFU per fish and 3Æ5 · 105 CFU per fish, the\nmortality of the zebrafish reached 90% in 48 h and 60–\n\n70% in 96 h respectively. All the dead fish exhibited typi-\n\ncal haemorrhagic septicaemia. The LD50 values of the\n\nmutant strains and the wild-type were calculated and\n\nthere were no significant attenuation in the five mutant\n\nstrains compared to the wild-type strain (Table 3).\n\nDiscussion\n\nGateway cloning system has been commonly utilized for\n\nhigh-throughput characterization of ORFs in single stan-\n\ndard frame in organisms, including E. coli, Saccharomyces\n\ncerevisiae, plants, and Caenorhabditis elegans (Dupuy et al.\n\n2004; Hope et al. 2004; Busso et al. 2005; Earley et al.\n\n2006; Alberti et al. 2007).

Meanwhile, the Hcp1 protein was also expressed\n\nsuccessfully using the Gateway plasmid, pDEST17. These\n\ndata illustrated that the Gateway plasmid and the Gate-\n\nway-compatible plasmids constructed in this study can be\n\nused to facilitate systemic and even high-throughput func-\n\ntional study on novel genes. We confirmed that the use of\n\nthese Gateway-compatible plasmids has greatly facilitated\n\nstreamlined traditional day-to-day molecular cloning pro-\n\njects in which the restriction enzyme selection, the diges-\n\ntion activity, and the ligation efficiency have to be taken\n\ninto account and usually become the limiting factors for\n\nsuccessful construction and that it made the procedure\n\nmore rapid, convenient, and efficient in characterization of\n\ngenes of interest in V. alginolyticus. Besides, this Gateway-\n\ncompatible cloning system was also applied successfully\n\nin V. anguillarum, V. parahaemolyticus and Edwardsiella\n\ntarda collected in our laboratory (data not shown).\n\nT6SS is essential for bacterial pathogenesis. Yet the\n\noverall virulence regulation architecture of the T6SS is not\n\nwell known until now. In this study, the roles of five T6SS\n\ngenes in the virulence regulation of V. alginolyticus were\n\ndetermined by the extracellular protease production, bio-\n\nfilm formation, motility, and Hcp1 secretion. The results\n\nshowed no significant differences in the tested strains in\n\ncontrast with wild-type strain in Asp production except\n\nDN11, which exhibited 50% decrease in extracellular pro-\n\ntease production. VEPGS_0011 encodes a putative T6SS\n\nlysozyme-related protein and belongs to gp25 family. The\n\nDN08 strain was unexpectedly inefficient in the biofilm\n\nformation and swarming ability. VEPGS_0008 encodes a\n\nputative transcriptional regulator belonging to AsnC fam-\n\nily, which regulates the cell metabolism in response to the\n\nexogenous amino acid and has not been well characterized\n\nso far. Its roles in T6SS and virulence regulation are not\n\nclear. Besides, DdotU1 and DppkA2 displayed no swarm-\ning ability. The dotU1 gene encodes a transmembrane\n\nprotein while PpkA2 is annotated as a serine ⁄ threonine\nprotein kinase. At present, the detailed investigation of\n\nthe functions of these five genes is underway in our labo-\n\nratory. The secretion of Hcp1 was absent in all five\n\nmutant strains and their complemented strains. This may\n\nbe caused by the tight post-translational regulation of\n\nPpkA ⁄ PppA system in which PpkA is established to be\nrequired for assembly of the T6SS and secretion of Hcp\n\nand its activity is antagonized by PppA (Mougous et al.\n\n2007), for the secretion of Hcp1 was enhanced remarkably\n\nin DpppA strain (Fig. 3d). The influence of the T6SS com-\nponents on Hcp1 secretion should be further assayed in\n\nthe strain with DpppA genetic background.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis study was supported by National Natural Science\n\nFoundation of China (no. 30901113) and Shanghai Lead-\n\ning Academic Discipline Project (no.
