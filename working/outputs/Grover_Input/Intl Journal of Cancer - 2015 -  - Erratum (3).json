Int J Cancer. 2013 Apr 15;132(8):1940â€“1953. doi: 10.1002/ijc.27863. Epub 2012 Oct 17.\n\nIn this article, Figure 1b contained an error in the plot relative to DMSO treatment at 1 hr. The plot image of DMSO was mis-\ntakenly the same plot image relative to GSI treatment at 1 hr, but the gating numbers were correct. The corrected Figure 1b,\nshowing the correct DMSO plot image, is now provided. The authors regret this error, which however, does not alter the conclu-\nsions of the study.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.29623\n\nFigure 1. Rosati et al.\n\nE\nrr\nat\nu\nm\n\nInt. J.
