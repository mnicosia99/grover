    "text": "Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), an emerging infec- tious disease in humans, is increasingly being recognized in the United States (6, 9, 11). Serological and PCR studies suggest that HGE infection also exists in Europe (5, 7, 23, 28). The etiologic agent of HGE is an obligate intracellular bacterium that has been identified as a member of the family Rickettsi- aceae and is closely related to the Ehrlichia equi-Ehrlichia phagocytophila group on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison (9). It has been successfully propagated in a con- tinuous promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60 (14, 26). HGE infection is characterized by the presence of ehrlichial inclu- sions called morulae in human or animal peripheral blood granulocytes. Recently, evidence of coinfection with Borrelia burgdorferi and the HGE agent was obtained by isolation of both organisms from the same patient (19). Although several laboratories have used indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) testing (6, 26, 31), acute-phase blood smear (6), nested PCR (9, 13, 31), and culture isolation (14, 26, 31) for diagnosis of HGE, each of these diagnostic tests has both advantages and disadvantages. IFA testing using the HGE agent or E. equi- infected cells has been the most widely used method for the serodiagnosis of ehrlichiosis. The IFA test is the most sensitive method when both acute- and convalescent-phase sera are being tested (31). However, it requires a tissue culture system for preparation of HGE agent-infected cell antigen slides, a fluorescent microscope, and trained persons especially for evaluation of the serum reactivity to the antigen on the slide. * Corresponding author.

Although antisera against various Ehrlichia species other than E. equi and E. phagocytophila did not react with the HGE agent (26), cross-reactivity between the HGE agent and Ehrlichia chaffeensis was reported in previous studies (1, 6, 26). This cross-reactivity is probably caused by common antigenic com- ponents possessed by these two organisms. The nested PCR appears to be the best test for the early diagnosis of HGE (13, 31). However, the nested PCR requires a thermocycler and trained personnel and the reagents are relatively expensive. The HGE agent has been directly isolated and stably cultivated from blood specimens of human patients (14, 26). In our pre- vious investigation (31), four new HGE agent isolates (8% of the total examined) were obtained from 53 blood specimens. The sensitivity of culture isolation in diagnosis seems to be relatively lower than those of the IFA test (23% positive of the total examined) and the nested PCR (13% positive of the total examined). Moreover, it requires serologic evidence, PCR, or 16S rRNA gene sequence for confirmation of the identity of new isolates (31). Therefore, a convenient and sensitive method with high specificity for the diagnosis of HGE infection is still desirable. It has been found that the host humoral immune response in HGE infection is mainly directed against 44- and 42-kDa proteins of the HGE agent (4, 14, 31). Western blot analysis showed that 44- or 42-kDa proteins in different HGE isolates were recognized by various sera from HGE pa- tients and an experimentally infected horse, indicating the cross-reactivity of major antigens among the different isolates of the HGE agent (4, 14, 31). In the present study, the gene of the major surface 44-kDa protein (P44) of the HGE agent was cloned and sequenced and the partial gene which codes for the antigenic epitopes was overexpressed. Affinity-purified recom- binant P44 (rP44) was used as a testing antigen in Western 1666 Downloaded from https://journals.asm.org/journal/jcm on 29 March 2022 by 23.240.217.17.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Organisms and sera. HGE agent isolates 2, 3, 6, 11, and 13 from patients in New York State and USG isolate from the tick kindly provided by R. Coughlin (Cambridge Bio-Tech, Worcester, Mass.) were cultivated in HL-60 cells (11, 26, 31). E. chaffeensis Arkansas was cultivated in the DH82 dog macrophage cell line (25). The organisms were purified by the Sephacryl S-1000 chromatography method described by Rikihisa et al. (24). B. burgdorferi HBH-1 and rabbit anti-B. burgdorferi HBH-1 were provided by Karim Hechemy, New York State Depart- ment of Health (Albany, N.Y.). All HGE patient serum samples, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 13, 21, and 22, were collected from patients at the Westchester County Medical Center in New York State. The diagnosis of HGE was confirmed by using PCR, IFA testing, and culture isolation as previously described (31). Among these serum samples, samples 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, and 13 had been characterized by using Western immunoblot analysis in a previous study (31). Patient serum samples 21-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 were collected at different stages of illness (25 July 1995, first acute stage; 24 August 1995, convalescent stage; 5 October 1995, 13 June 1996, and 17 July 1997, second acute stage), respectively, from patient 21, who was suspected of being reinfected with the HGE agent. Horse anti-HGE and horse anti-E. equi sera were kindly provided by J. Madigan, University of Cali- fornia, Davis (18). Human anti-E. chaffeensis serum was kindly provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga., and previously char- acterized by Western blotting (25). The sera from patients with Lyme borreliosis and coinfection with B. burgdorferi and HGE agent were also collected from patients seen at the Westchester County Medical Center in New York State. The procedure of evaluation for B. burgdorferi infection was performed as previously described (19). The motile spirochetes visualized in blood or biopsy specimens of erythema migrans lesions by fluorescence microscopy were confirmed to be B. burgdorferi with a PCR using primers IS1 and IS2. Serum antibodies to B. burgdorferi were assayed by an immunoglobulin M (IgM)-IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELA Lyme Stat; Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, Md.) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Construction and immunoscreening of the HGE agent gene library. Genomic DNA of the HGE agent H2 strain (isolate 13) was isolated from purified ehrli- chial organisms by lysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), pronase digestion, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation in accordance with the procedure of Ohashi et al. (20). Purified genomic DNA was completely digested with 20 U of EcoRI at 37°C for 4 h and then ligated into the 􏱋ZAPII vector. All procedures were carried out with a 􏱋ZAPII/EcoRI/CIAP cloning kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the gene library was constructed by infecting Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF􏰘 with the recombinant phage. Clones expressing ehrlichial proteins were identified by using horse anti-HGE serum (18) (kindly provided by J. Madigan), which had been preabsorbed with E. coli lysate. Positive recombinant pBluescript phage- mids were excised from the 􏱋ZAPII phages in the presence of helper phage f1 and used to transform E. coli SOLR cells (Stratagene). All of the positive clones were analyzed by Western blotting with the horse anti-HGE agent serum. Phage- mid purification, restriction enzyme digestion, and gel electrophoresis were car- ried out as described by Sambrook et al. (27). DNA sequence analysis. DNA sequencing was determined by a dideoxy chain termination method with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) model 373 DNA sequencer. DNA sequencing was performed by a primer-walking method using synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. Translation of the nucleotide se- quence and alignment of the amino acid sequence were done by using DNASIS computer software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan). A homology search was done with the GenBank (National Center for Biotech- nology Information, Bethesda, Md.) database by using the local alignment search tool (3) software in the BLAST network service (National Center for Biotech- nology Information). The GenBank accession number of the P44 gene is AF059181. Analysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the outer membrane proteins of the HGE agent. An outer membrane protein fraction from the purified the HGE agent was prepared by the Sarkosyl extraction method as described previously (20, 31). Proteins in the Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet prepared from 700 􏱌g of purified HGE agent organisms were separated by SDS–10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred to a ProBlot membrane (Applied Biosystems) in 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane- sulfonic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 10% methanol (pH 11) at 300 mA for 4 to 5 h by use of a Bio-Rad (Hercules, Calif.) transblot cell, and the sheet was stained with 1% amido black in 42% methanol–17% acetic acid. The protein band areas were cut out, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the proteins on the strips were analyzed by use of an Applied Biosystems model 470A protein sequencer.Overexpression of the 44-kDa major outer membrane protein of the HGE agent. To effectively overexpress antigenic epitopes of rP44, the deduced amino acid sequences based on the sequences of plasmid pHGE1221, which was posi- tive by immunoscreening and contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding the proposed P44, were analyzed with DNASTAR (Madison,",
