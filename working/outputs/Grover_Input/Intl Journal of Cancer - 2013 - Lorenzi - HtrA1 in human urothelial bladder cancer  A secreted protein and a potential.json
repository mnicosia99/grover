Bladder tissue and urine specimens from cancer patients with\n\ndifferent tumor grades and stages (n 5 68) and from individuals with cystitis (n 5 16) were collected along with biopsy speci-\n\nmens and urine from healthy individuals (n 5 68). For the first time, we demonstrated by immunohistochemistry that HtrA1 pro-\n\ntein is produced by bladder urothelium in both physiological and inflammatory conditions, whereas it is not detectable in\n\nurothelial cancer cells regardless of tumor grade and stage. A different HtrA1 expression between normal-looking and neoplastic\n\nbladder tissue, despite similar HtrA1 mRNA levels, was also found by western blotting, which disclosed the presence of two forms\n\nof HtrA1, a native form of ~50 kDa and an autocatalytic form of ~38 kDa. Our investigations documented the presence of the two\nforms of HtrA1 also in urine. The ~38 kDa form was significantly down-regulated in neoplastic tissue, whereas significantly higher\namounts of both HtrA1 forms were found in urine from cancer patients compared with both healthy subjects and patients with\n\ncystitis. Our findings suggest that HtrA1 is a downexpressed molecule since an early stage of bladder urothelial carcinoma devel-\n\nopment and that urinary HtrA1 protein may be considered, if successfully validated, as an early and highly sensitive and specific\n\nbiomarker for this neoplasia (the sensitivity and specificity of HtrA1 are 92.65% and 95.59%, respectively).\n\nBladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the West-\nern world, where it is predominantly of the transitional (uro-\nthelial) cell type.1 Approximately 80% of patients with\nurothelial bladder cancer suffer from recurrence within 1 or\n2 years of the initial treatment.2 Fifteen to twenty percent of\nbladder tumors present as muscle-invasive disease; despite\nradical cystectomy (RC) and systemic therapy, 50% of these\npatients die from metastatic disease.3,4 Currently, the gold\nstandard for diagnosis and monitoring of bladder cancer is\ncystoscopy combined with urine cytology. Cystoscopy is inva-\nsive and expensive, while cytology is scarcely sensitive and is\ncharacterized by poor interobserver reproducibility.5 The bio-\nlogical, morphological and clinical alterations present in\nmalignant and premalignant lesions give the opportunity to\naccurately identify the early stage of cancer progression, sig-\nnificantly enhancing cancer treatment. In recent years, consid-\nerable advances have been made in the study of biomarkers\nassociated with the molecular changes occurring during the\ndevelopment and progression of urothelial carcinoma.6\n\nKey words: human urothelial bladder cancer, serine protease HtrA1,\n\nurinary biomarkers, UROtsa, TCC-SUP, T24 cell lines\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online\n\nversion of this article.\n\n*M.L. and E.A. contributed equally to this work.\n\nGrant sponsor: Banca Marche, Universit�a Politecnica delle Marche,\n\nFutura Onlus.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.28280\n\nHistory: Received 24 June 2012; Accepted 23 Apr 2013; Online 27\n\nMay 2013\n\nCorrespondence to: Teresa Lorenzi, Ph.D., Department of\n\nExperimental and Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty, Universit�a\n\nPolitecnica delle Marche, Via Tronto 10/a, 60020 Torrette, Ancona,\n\nItaly, Tel.: 1[39-071-2206-270], Fax: 1[39-071-2206-087], E-mail:\n\nteresalorenzi@yahoo.it, t.lorenzi@univpm.it or Daniela Marzioni,\n\nDepartment of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Medical Faculty,\n\nUniversit�a Politecnica delle Marche, Via Tronto 10/a, 60020\n\nTorrette, Ancona, Italy, Tel.: 1[39-071-2206-270], Fax: 1[39-071-\n\n2206-087], E-mail: d.marzioni@univpm.it\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\no\nn\nan\n\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\no\nsi\ns\n\nInt.

Through the incorporation of appropriately vali-\ndated biomarkers, one can expect better clinical study designs,\nimproving patients’ prospects by reducing morbidity and\nmortality while curbing costs which, per bladder cancer\npatient from diagnosis to death, are estimated to be the high-\nest among all cancers. Therefore, not only the patients but\nalso the healthcare systems would benefit from the use of bio-\nmarkers.6 Unfortunately, most of the markers tested to date\nseem to add little to current diagnostic methods.6 Therefore,\nthe search is still on for a stand-alone biomarker providing\nfor specific and sensitive early screening and long-term sur-\nveillance of patients with or at risk of bladder cancer.\n\nHtrA1, a member of the family of HtrA proteins, is a\nsecreted multidomain protein with serine protease activity. It\nis characterized by a highly conserved, trypsin-like serine\nprotease domain and at least one PDZ [PSD-95 (Postsynaptic\ndensity protein of Mr 95kDa), Dlg (Drosophila Discs-Large\nprotein) and ZO-1 (Zonula occludens protein 1)] domain.7 It\nalso contains an insulin-like growth factor-binding protein/\nfollistatin/Mac25-like domain and a Kazal-type serine prote-\nase inhibitor motif at its N-terminus.7 Recently, it has been\nshown that HtrA1 can be expressed as a native protein form\nof �50 kDa and as a �35 kDa product, whose generation\nrequires the protease activity of HtrA1.8 Serine protease\nHtrA1 is implicated in physiological processes such as TGF-\nb signaling9 and in the pathogenesis of various diseases,\nincluding age-related macular degeneration, Alzheimer’s dis-\nease, osteoarthritis and preeclampsia.10–13 Changes in its\nexpression associated with specific tumor behavior have also\nbeen reported. HtrA1 down-regulation has been described in\nhuman ovarian cancer14 and is closely related to the progres-\nsion and metastasis of malignant melanoma,15 whereas its\noverexpression has been seen to suppress proliferation and\nmigration of tumor cells in highly invasive melanoma.15\n\nIndeed, several lines of evidence indicate that HtrA1 func-\ntions as a tumor suppressor in various solid tumors, such as\novarian and lung cancer and mesothelioma.16–18\n\nThese findings prompted us to investigate whether HtrA1\nderegulation could also be relevant to the development of\n\nurothelial bladder cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the\nrole of HtrA1 has never been investigated in this neoplasm.\nHtrA1 contains a signal sequence for secretion,7 suggesting\nthat it may be recovered in urine. On the other hand, bladder\ncancer is particularly amenable to biomarker development,\nsince secretion of tumor-associated molecules is easily\ndetected in urine. In this study, we evaluated for the first\ntime the expression of the serine protease HtrA1 in healthy\nand neoplastic bladder tissue and urine by real-time PCR,\nimmunohistochemistry and western blotting techniques, sug-\ngesting an early association between expression/processing of\nthis protein with the presence of bladder tumor. In addition,\nwe estimated HtrA1 concentration in urine from healthy\nindividuals and cancer patients by enzyme-linked immuno-\nsorbent assay (ELISA), showing that HtrA1 may be consid-\nered a specific and sensitive biomarker for urothelial bladder\ncancer.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nPatients\n\nThe procedure for this research project conforms to the pro-\nvisions of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects involved\nin the investigation provided their informed consent.\n\nAs reported in Table 1, the study was conducted with a\ncohort of 68 healthy individuals (controls) [age range 51–75\nyears, mean age 6 standard deviation (sd): 66.5 6 5.5] and of\n84 patients, of which 68 affected by urothelial bladder cancer\n[age range 52–79 years, mean age 6 sd: 68.2 6 7.0] and 16\naffected by recurrent bacterial cystitis [age range 42–79 years,\nmean age 6 sd: 59.1 6 11.8]. Both cancer patients and con-\ntrol group were enrolled in the study consecutively. The 84\npatients presented with one of the following symptoms: gross\nhematuria, microscopic hematuria, urinary urgency or urinary\npain (Table 1). Cystoscopy was the diagnostic procedure used\nto rule out the presence of urothelial carcinoma in patients\nwith persistent inflammation of the bladder (i.e., recurrent bac-\nterial cystitis unresponsive to pharmaceutical therapy). The\ndistribution of the two types of surgical procedure done in\nthe patients with bladder cancer, i.e., transurethral resection of\nthe bladder (TURB) and RC, is reported in Table 1.\n\nSpecimen collection\n\nTissue samples. Bladder tissue from the 68 cancer patients\nand the 16 individuals with cystitis was provided by the\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nFour-fifths of urothelial bladder cancer patients suffer a relapse of disease within one to two years of initial treatment, a prob-\n\nlem that could be alleviated by advances in biomarker-based early stage screening. This investigation introduces one possible\n\nbiomarker, the secreted serine protease HtrA1. While previous studies have suggested that HtrA1 may function as a tumor\n\nsuppressor in certain solid tumors, this report indicates that a reduction in its expression may be an early, highly sensitive\n\nand specific biomarker particularly for urothelial bladder cancer. The recoverability of HtrA1 in urine would allow for a nonin-\n\nvasive means of routine screening.\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\no\nn\nan\n\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\no\nsi\ns\n\nLorenzi et al. 2651\n\nInt.

Tumors were graded\naccording to the WHO classification19 and staged according\nto the TNM system20 (Supporting Information Table 1). Pap-\nillary tumor samples with different grades of malignancy\n(n 5 33) were obtained from patients subjected to TURB;\nsamples of invasive urothelial carcinoma (n 5 35), showing\nfocal tumor, came from RC procedures (Supporting Informa-\ntion Table 1). The four different types of bladder specimens\nare described in Table 2. Tissue samples were weighed and\nprepared for molecular (real-time PCR), immunohistochemi-\ncal, and/or biochemical (western blotting) analyses as detailed\nin Table 2. Tissue samples from 1st-trimester placenta (Table\n2) were used as a positive control for real-time PCR (Q-\nPCR),21 immunohistochemistry and western blotting22 (Table\n2). Specimens for Q-PCR and western blotting analyses were\nimmediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80�C,\nthose for immunohistochemistry were fixed for 24 hr in 4%\nneutral buffered formalin at 4�C and embedded in paraffin.\n\nUrine samples. The urine specimens of the cancer patients,\ncollected on the day of TURB or RC, and those from the cys-\ntitis patients were provided by the Urology Section together\nwith urine samples from the 68 healthy individuals (Table 2).\nThey were analyzed by western blotting and ELISA, as shown\nin Table 2. First-void urine was collected in sterile plastic\ntubes on ice and immediately centrifuged at 1,500g for 15\nmin at 4�C. Creatinine was determined in the urine superna-\ntants before their storage at 220�C.\n\nExperimental Procedures\nQ-PCR\n\nRNA extraction, reverse transcription and real-time PCR\nwere performed as previously described.23 The sequences of\nthe Q-PCR primers targeting the HtrA1 gene are reported in\nSupporting Information Table 2.

An isotype control antibody (Rabbit IgG, cat. n� I-100,\nVector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was employed as negative\ncontrol (Supporting Information Table 3).\n\nHtrA1 protein staining per each bladder section at light\nmicroscopy was determined by two separate observers (D.M.\nand M.C.) in a double-blind fashion and was scored with a\nfour-point scale attributed as follows: 1 point (absent stain-\ning), 2 points (low staining), 3 points (moderate staining)\nand 4 points (strong staining). When the pattern of immuno-\nstaining for HtrA1 was nonhomogeneous, the average of the\nscores ascribed to the different parts of the tissue was consid-\nered. The urothelium, stroma, vessels and smooth muscle\ncells were taken into consideration for the HtrA1 expression\nin normal, cystitis, TURB and RC groups.\n\nPreparation of tissue lysates\n\nLysates were obtained as previously described.23 Protein con-\ncentrations of the extracts were assessed with the Bradford\nprotein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Milan, Italy).25\n\nSamples were immunoprecipitated for analysis of the\nexpression of the �50 kDa HtrA1 form, whereas they were\ndirectly processed by western blotting for the quantitative\ndetermination of the autocatalytic form.\n\nCell lines and preparation of their whole cell lysates and\n\nconditioned media for western blotting\n\nSV-40 transformed human bladder urothelial cell line (i.e.,\nUROtsa cell line) was a kind gift from Dr. Scott H. Garrett\n(Department of Urology, West Virginia University, Morgan-\ntown, West Virginia, USA). Human bladder transitional car-\ncinoma cell line (i.e., TCC-SUP cell line) was kindly provided\nby Dr. Axel Ullrich (Max-Planck-Institute of Biochemistry,\nDepartment of Molecular Biology, Martinsried, Germany).\nThe human transitional carcinoma cell line T24 (ATCCV\n\nR\n\nNumber: HTB-4\nTM\n\n) was purchased from the American Type\nCulture Collection (ATCC) (Rockville, MD, USA). The cul-\ntures were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented\nwith 10% FBS, at 37�C in 5% CO2. Eighty percent confluent\ncells were washed with cold PBS, trypsinized, collected and\nlysed in RIPA buffer (Sigma, Milan, Italy) supplemented with\nprotease inhibitors (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Lysed cells\n\nwere centrifuged at 20,000g to collect supernatant which pro-\ntein concentration was assessed by Bradford protein assay.\nConditioned media were obtained from the confluent cell\ncultures after centrifugation of spent media.\n\nPreparation of urine specimens for western blotting\n\nUrine supernatants were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4\nand Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Units—30,000\nNMWL (Millipore, Milan, Italy). The samples were normal-\nized on the basis of creatinine concentrations. Concentrated\nurine was immunoprecipitated for analysis of the expression\nof the �50 kDa HtrA1 form and directly processed by west-\nern blotting for the quantitative determination of the autoca-\ntalytic form.\n\nImmunoprecipitation\n\nImmunoprecipitation was performed as previously described.23\n\nFor each sample, 3 lg of monoclonal anti-human HTRA1/\nPRSS11 antibody (raised against the recombinant human\nHtrA1, aa 23–480) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) (Sup-\nporting Information Table 3) were added to the 50% slurry of\nprewashed GammaBind G Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare\nLife Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden). Two micrograms of\nprotein extract or 225 ll of concentrated urine were\nimmunoprecipitated.\n\nWestern blotting\n\nSamples (immunoprecipitated proteins, 100 lg of tissue\nextract, 50 ll of concentrated urine, 150 lg of the UROtsa,\nTCC-SUP and T24 cell lysates and 40 ll of their conditioned\nmedia) were fractionated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulphate -\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).26 Western\nblotting analysis was carried out as described before,23 using\nthe monoclonal anti-human HTRA1/PRSS11 antibody (R&D\nSystems) or the monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody, clone AC-\n74 (Sigma) (Supporting Information Table 3).\n\nLevels of HtrA1 and b-actin, used as the tissue house-\nkeeping protein, were quantified by densitometry using\nChemidoc and the Quantity-One program (Bio-Rad Labora-\ntories). The amount of HtrA1 in tissue was expressed as the\nratio of HtrA1 to b-actin, and its amount in urine as densito-\nmetric intensity.\n\nHtrA1 ELISA\n\nSince western blotting analysis may not be the choice method\nfor diagnostics, we tested an HtrA1 ELISA kit purchased\nfrom USCN, Life Science Inc. (DBA Italia s.r.l., Milan, Italy)\nfor sensitive and specific detection of HtrA1 protein in\nvoided urine sample. The immunogen used for preparation\nof the antibody provided with the kit was the recombinant\nhuman HtrA1 (aa 23–480) and internal negative and positive\nquality controls were supplied in each kit. Urine samples\n(100 ll) were added to wells without their previous concen-\ntrations and creatinine was used to normalize HtrA1\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\no\nn\nan\n\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\no\nsi\ns\n\nLorenzi et al. 2653\n\nInt.

The measurements were conducted in dupli-\ncate, according to the supplied protocol.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nHtrA1 transcription and protein levels in tissue specimens\nwere tested using a two-tailed t test (PRISM software, version\n4 for Windows: GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA).\nResults are presented as mean 1 sd. A p value < 0.05 was\nconsidered statistically significant.\n\nDifferences in urinary HtrA1 among and within groups\nwere evaluated by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the\nSAS/STAT software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The data\nobtained from the semi-quantitative immunohistochemical\nanalysis of HtrA1 expression in bladder specimens were\ntested by ANOVA.\n\nAs in our previous study regarding HtrA1,27 the\nKolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed in advance to check\nthe normality of variables. Receiver Operating Characteristic\n(ROC) curve was plotted for HtrA1 by the SAS/STAT soft-\nware to assess the accuracy of diagnostic test used to discrim-\ninate between two conditions which, in our study, are\nreferred to as cases (subjects with cancer) and healthy con-\ntrols. The analysis consists in plotting a graph of the sensitiv-\nity versus 1-specificity of the diagnostic test. An area under\nROC curve (AUC) equal to 0.9 � AUC � 1.0 was considered\nas a very good performance of the test.28 In addition, we cal-\nculated the proportion of patients with positive test results or\nwith negative test results who are correctly diagnosed (Posi-\ntive Predictive Value: PPV and Negative Predictive Value:\nNPV, respectively). To indicate the precision of the point\nestimate, we used a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n\nResults\nExpression of HtrA1 mRNA in bladder tissue\n\nTo determine whether HtrA1 mRNA expression may be\naltered in urothelial carcinoma of the bladder, neoplastic and\nnormal-looking bladder specimens were analyzed by Q-PCR.\nNone of the normal, cystitis and TURB samples were exam-\nined by this technique because of the lack of enough fresh\ntissue banking (see Table 2). When SDHA was used as the\nhousekeeping gene, the HtrA1 transcript was not significantly\ndifferent in cancer compared with normal-looking tissue\n(p 5 0.432) (data not shown). Similarly, when TBP was used\nas the housekeeping gene, mRNA expression was similar in\nneoplastic and normal-looking tissue (p 5 0.422) (data not\nshown). Gene expression data collected from Oncomine\nMicroarray database showed no significant difference in the\nvalue of HtrA1 mRNA expression in infiltrating bladder uro-\nthelial carcinoma compared to the corresponding normal-\nlooking counterpart, confirming our results.\n\nHtrA1 immunohistochemistry\n\nImmunohistochemical localization studies disclosed a cyto-\nplasmic staining pattern that was similar in normal, normal-\nlooking (Fig. 1a) and cystitis specimens (Fig. 1b). HtrA1\n\nimmunolabeling was seen in the urothelium, particularly in\nthe umbrella cells lining the bladder lumen (Figs. 1a and 1b).\nThe bladder vessel walls were HtrA1-positive (Figs. 1a\nand 1b).\n\nHtrA1 urothelial immunoreactivity declined with increas-\ning neoplasm grade (Figs. 1c–1g). In papillary urothelial neo-\nplasms with low malignant potential (Fig. 1c), the urothelial\ncell cytoplasm was weakly HtrA1-positive in the basal layer\n(Fig. 1c) and largely negative in the upper layer. In addition,\nthe vessel walls were HtrA1-positive (Fig. 1c). The urothelium\nof noninvasive low-grade and high-grade papillary carcino-\nmas (Figs. 1d and 1e) and of invasive neoplasms (Fig. 1f) was\nHtrA1-negative. HtrA1 immunostaining was very weak in\nvessel walls (data not shown). Smooth muscle cells (data not\nshown) and the stroma (Figs. 1a–1g) stained weakly or not at\nall for HtrA1 in all samples. The negative controls confirmed\nthe specificity of the immunolabeling obtained with the pri-\nmary antibody. The semi-quantitative immunohistochemical\nanalysis revealed significant differences of HtrA1 expression\nin the urothelium and vessels among normal, cystitis, TURB\nand RC groups (in both the urothelium and vessels p <\n0.0001) (Fig. 1g). On the other hand, HtrA1 expression in\nstroma and muscle cells was not significantly different among\nnormal, cystitis, TURB and RC groups (in stroma p 5 0.14\nand in muscle cells p 5 0.06) (Fig. 1g).\n\nExpression of HtrA1 protein in bladder, UROtsa, TCC-SUP\n\nand T24 cell lines and their conditioned media\n\nAs for Q-PCR, normal, cystitis and TURB samples were not\nanalyzed by western blotting because of the lack of enough\nfresh tissue banking (see Table 2). Representative blots of RC\nspecimens are shown in Figure 2. Immunoblotting with anti-\nHtrA1 antibody disclosed two highly specific bands of �50\nkDa and �38 kDa (Fig. 2a), representing the predicted native\nand autocatalytic forms of HtrA1, respectively. The intensity\nof each band was quantified by densitometry in all tissue\nsamples. The �50 kDa band was not significantly different in\nnormal-looking and neoplastic tissue (p 5 0.320) (Figs. 2a\nand 2b), whereas the �38 kDa band was strongly reduced\nand in some cases barely detectable in all cancer specimens\n(Fig. 2a). Based on densitometry, the autocatalytic form was\nabout fourfold lower in neoplastic than in normal-looking\ntissue, and the difference was highly significant (p < 0.001)\n(Fig. 2b).\n\nBlot of lysate from UROtsa, TCC-SUP and T24 cells and\nof their conditioned media is shown in Figure 2c. The anti-\nHtrA1 antibody detected only one band of �50 kDa, corre-\nsponding to the HtrA1 native form, both in UROtsa cell\nlysate and in its conditioned medium. On the contrary,\nHtrA1 was absent in TCC-SUP and T24 cell lysates as well\nas in their conditioned media.\n\nExpression of HtrA1 protein in urine by Western blotting\n\nFigure 3a shows representative blots of the �50 kDa HtrA1\nform detected in urine from patients with bladder cancer,\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\no\nn\nan\n\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\no\nsi\ns\n\n2654 HtrA1 expression in human bladder cancer\n\nInt.

In fact, the �50 kDa HtrA1 band\nwas detected in all cancer patients (TURB and RC), while it\nwas very weak and at times nearly absent in healthy individ-\nuals and in patients with cystitis (Fig. 3a). Densitometric\nanalysis showed an about eightfold increase in the levels of\nthe native form in urine from cancer patients compared with\nhealthy subjects and patients with cystitis. These differences\nwere highly significant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 3b). A representa-\ntive western blot of the �38 kDa HtrA1 form is shown in\nFigure 3c. In the same urine specimens, the �38 kDa form\nwas found to be overexpressed, albeit not homogeneously, in\ncancer patients compared with healthy subjects and patients\nwith cystitis, where it was largely absent (Fig. 3c); the differ-\nences were highly significant (p 5 0.0002) (Fig. 3d).\n\nExpression of HtrA1 protein in urine by ELISA and its\n\ndiagnostic performance\n\nThe detection of urinary HtrA1 protein and the determina-\ntion of its expression levels in urine from patients with uro-\nthelial cancer compared with healthy individuals and patients\nwith cystitis were obtained by the use of the HtrA1 ELISA\nkit. The analysis showed higher levels of HtrA1 in urine\nfrom cancer patients compared with healthy subjects and\npatients with cystitis. These differences were highly signifi-\ncant (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4a).\n\nHtrA1 levels were normally distributed in patients with\ncancer (p 5 0.18), in healthy controls (p 5 0.13) and in\npatients with cystitis (p 5 0.77). The global performance of\nour diagnostic test is summarized by the area under the ROC\ncurve (Fig. 4b). Our results showed that AUC is equal to\n0.9839 (C.I. 0.97–0.99), highlighting a very good global per-\nformance of the diagnostic test. The sensitivity (SE) and spec-\nificity (SP), using a cutpoint of 1.48 (HtrA1), were 92.65%\n(C.I. 86.44–98.85%) and 95.59% (C.I. 90.7–99.7%), respec-\ntively. The positive and negative predictive values were:\nPPV 5 95.45% (C.I. 90.42–99.7%) and NPV 5 92.86% (C.I.\n86.82–98.89%).\n\nDiscussion\nOur immunohistochemical results demonstrate for the first\ntime that HtrA1 protein is produced by the bladder urothe-\nlium both in physiological conditions and in inflammatory\npathologies such as cystitis, whereas it is not found in uro-\nthelial cancer tissue regardless of tumor grade and stage.\n\nThese data suggest that HtrA1 is a downexpressed molecule\nsince an early stage of urothelial carcinoma development.\nThe downexpression of HtrA1 detected in neoplastic urothe-\nlium was not so evident in the other bladder tissue compo-\nnents. The normal-looking and neoplastic bladder specimens\nfrom RC patients did not exhibit significant differences in\nHtrA1 mRNA by real-time PCR. This finding, together with\nimmunohistochemical data, let us to suppose that HtrA1\ntranscription is not affected in urothelial carcinoma, but that\nHtrA1 protein translation is blocked in the pathological uro-\nthelium. Western blotting performed in the specimens from\nRC patients disclosed the coexistence of two HtrA1 protein\nforms: a native form (�50 kDa) and its autocatalytic product\n(�38 kDa). Recent data show that the protease active form\nof HtrA1 is represented by its auto-proteolytic product, sug-\ngesting for it a crucial role in proapoptotic activity.8,16,29\n\nSince reduction of apoptosis is a recognized event contribut-\ning to cancer progression,30,31 also in bladder urothelium,32\n\nthe auto-proteolytic protein form may be viewed as a mole-\ncule with anti-cancer properties. Moreover, HtrA1 functions\nas an inhibitor of transforming growth factor (TGF)-b signal-\ning9 and seems to be able to bind and inhibit signaling of a\nwide range of TGF-b family proteins9 as well as to degrade\nTGF-b1 in vitro.33 TGF-b1 is considered to be crucial in uri-\nnary bladder carcinoma tumorigenesis34 and it is also associ-\nated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis,\nmigration and metastasis in many types of malignant\ntumor.35 TGF-b1 is absent in the epithelial cells of normal\nbladder tissues while a strong expression of the protein is\nshown in muscle-invasive urothelial bladder carcinoma.36\n\nThus, HtrA1 and TGF-b1 expression patterns seem to be\ninversely correlated in normal and neoplastic bladder tissue.\nSince the inhibitory action of HtrA1 on TGF-b signaling\nwholly depends on its protease activity,9 also in this case the\nautocatalytic form may conceivably have greater anti-cancer\nproperties than the native one. The �38 kDa HtrA1 form\nwas highly significantly down-regulated in neoplastic com-\npared with normal-looking tissue, whereas the expression of\nthe native form was similar across all specimens. The differ-\nence of 38 kDa HtrA1 form expression between normal-\nlooking and bladder cancer specimens from RC patients\nusing western blotting was weaker than it was expected on\nthe basis of immunohistochemistry. This less marked differ-\nence of HtrA1 expression was due to the analysis of full-\nthickness bladder samples, i.e., inclusive of urothelium (nega-\ntive for HtrA1 in cancer) and of all other bladder tissue\n\nFigure 1.

Taking into account these\nresults, it is plausible that HtrA1 protein is mainly expressed\nin its auto-proteolytic (active) form in normal urothelium, in\norder to be more promptly available to counteract the poten-\ntial risk of cancer related to urinary cytotoxic compounds. Its\ndecreased levels observed in neoplastic urothelial tissue, due\nto a block of protein translation, could be one effector of\ncancer development. This is consistent with the notion that\nHtrA1 functions as a tumor suppressor, as already described\nin human ovarian cancer14 and in malignant melanoma15\n\nwhere the molecule is downexpressed. The loss of HtrA1\nexpression in urothelial carcinoma cells and, on the other\nhand, its presence in normal urothelial cell line UROtsa is\ncongruent with the tumor suppressor role of HtrA1.\n\nHtrA1 autocatalytic form generation may be augmented\nby upregulation of HtrA1 protein, as described in ovarian\ncancer cells under treatment with chemotherapeutic agents\n(cisplatin, paclitaxel).8 The expression of HtrA1 influences\nthe tumor response to chemotherapy by modulating\n\nchemotherapy-induced cytotoxicity8 and HtrA1 is a potential\nprognostic factor of clinical response to cisplatin-based chem-\notherapy for patients with ovarian or gastric cancer.8,37 Con-\nsidering our findings concerning the association between\nHtrA1 autocatalytic form and urothelial bladder cancer, it\nwould be possible to hypothesize that HtrA1 could represent\na valuable tool to predict chemotherapy response also in\npatients with this neoplasm. However, it would be necessary\nto plan a new study based on the analysis of the prognostic\nfactors.\n\nWe found that HtrA1 immunolocalization is particularly\nstrong in the upper portion of the urothelium, suggesting\nrapid release, and that the normal human urothelial cell line\nUROtsa produces and constitutively secretes HtrA1 native\nform into the growth medium, showing that urothelium\ncould be the potential source of HtrA1 in urine. It is notable\nthat normal mammalian urothelium can function not only as\na permeability barrier but also as a possible supply of urinary\nproteins that may play important physiological or pathologi-\ncal roles in the urinary tract.38 We can assume that the\n\nFigure 3.

Cancer: 133, 2650–2661 (2013) VC 2013 UICC\n\n\n\n50 kDa HtrA1 form in normal urothelium has two fates, i.e.,\nto be secreted into the urine as it is and to originate the 38\nkDa form by auto-proteolysis. Moreover, the lack of HtrA1\nproduction and secretion in the medium from urothelial car-\ncinoma cells prompt us to suppose that neoplastic urothelium\ndoes not influence at all urine composition. Surprisingly, our\nwestern blotting investigations documented a very strong\npresence of the �50 kDa HtrA1 form in urine from patients\nwith different grades and stages of bladder cancer and since\nan early stage of urothelial carcinoma growth. Statistical anal-\nysis demonstrated that HtrA1 (50 kDa form) in this group is\nsignificantly higher than in both healthy individuals and\n\npatients with cystitis. Probably, normal urothelium is forced\nby the flanking tumor tissue to produce more HtrA1 than\nusual, possibly in the attempt to contain tumor progression,\nleading to an increase of secreted HtrA1 native form. Also\nthe level of the �38 kDa form in urine from cancer patients,\nalthough inhomogeneous, was higher than in healthy subjects\nand in individuals with inflammatory conditions, where it\nwas largely absent. This protein form has lost the secretion\nsignal sequence, thus its recovery in urine from patients with\nurothelial bladder cancer could be related to autoproteolysis\nof the native form rather than to its secretion from bladder\ntissue. The highly variable amount of the �38 kDa form\n\nFigure 4.

In particular, we\ndocument for the first time, using different experimental\napproaches, that expression of the �38 kDa form of HtrA1\nprotein is strongly reduced in urothelial cancer tissue regard-\nless of tumor grade and stage. The most significant finding of\nour study is that detection of HtrA1 in urine may represent\nan innovative, simple, specific and sensitive approach to the\nearly diagnosis of bladder malignant transformation. Urine\ncytology and many of the currently developed urine based\nbiomarkers approved by the United States Food and Drug\nAdministration (FDA), including detection of chromosomal\naneuploidy and deletion using fluorescence in situ hybridiza-\ntion (UroVysion), have limited sensitivity for recognition of\nlow stage and grade tumors.39 A recent study provides the\ndemonstration that NMP22 and CYFRA 21-1, widely used\nover the past decade, are effective markers for detecting blad-\nder cancer40 and there are also several emerging urine\nmarkers, as DNA methylation markers,41 tested extensively\nand looking quite promising, that have not yet been applied\n\nclinically because of lack of validation. HtrA1, in our study,\nshows a very good diagnostic performance (ROC-AUC of\nHtrA1 is 0.9839) and thus, if successfully validated testing\nHtrA1 assay in larger cohorts and with fewer confounders, it\ncould improve the predictive ability of current biomarkers,\nalone or in combination with them, providing a noninvasive\nand practical tool for the routine screening of bladder cancer\nrisk in large population groups. We recognize some limita-\ntions of our study. We show gender disparity between cancer\npatients and subjects with cystitis, meaning that the ratio\nbetween females and males is about 1:3 for patients with uro-\nthelial carcinoma and 3:1 for infection group. However, it is\nrecognized in literature that bladder cancer is 3 to 4 times\nmore frequent in men than in women and that urinary tract\ninfections occur more commonly in women than men.\nAnother limitation of the study consists in the fact that while\ncarrying out a consecutive enrollment of all subjects, matched\ncontrol cohort by age (6 1 year) and gender was not used.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors wish to thank Dr. Alessandro Conti (Universit�a Politecnica\ndelle Marche, Italy) and Dr. Carlo Vecchioli (Presidio Ospedali Riuniti\nMurri-Jesi, Italy) for providing some of the specimens.
