receptor-c (ERRc) is a constitutively active transcription factor regulating\ngenes involved in several important cellular processes, including hepatic glucose metabolism, alcohol metabolism, and the\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. cAMP responsive element-binding protein H (CREBH) is an ER-bound bZIP\nfamily transcription factor that is activated upon ER stress and regulates genes encoding acute-phase proteins whose\nexpression is increased in response to inflammation. Here, we report that ERRc directly regulates CREBH gene expression in\nresponse to ER stress. ERRc bound to the ERRc response element (ERRE) in the CREBH promoter. Overexpression of ERRc by\nadenovirus significantly increased expression of CREBH as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), whereas either knockdown of\nERRc or inhibition of ERRc by ERRc specific inverse agonist, GSK5182, substantially inhibited ER stress-mediated induction of\nCREBH and CRP. The transcriptional coactivator PGC1a was required for ERRc mediated induction of the CREBH gene as\ndemonstrated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showing binding of both ERRc and PGC1a on the CREBH\npromoter. The ChIP assay also revealed that histone H3 and H4 acetylation occurred at the ERRc and PGC1a binding site.\nMoreover, chronic alcoholic hepatosteatosis, as well as the diabetic obese condition significantly increased CRP gene\nexpression, and this increase was significantly attenuated by GSK5182 treatment. We suggest that orphan nuclear receptor\nERRc directly regulates the ER-bound transcription factor CREBH in response to ER stress and other metabolic conditions.\n\nCitation: Misra J, Chanda D, Kim D-K, Cho S-R, Koo S-H, et al.

These orphan nuclear receptors regulate transcription via\nERREs but do not bind endogenous estrogen [1]. The ERRs are\n\nnamed due to the conservation in the structure of their DNA-\n\nbinding domains/DBDs with the highly homologous Estrogen\n\nReceptor [2]. Crystallographic studies indicate that the ERRs\n\nalong with ERRc are constitutively active without a natural\nligand, while several synthetic ligands either stimulate or repress\n\nthe activity of ERRc by promoting or disrupting ERR–coactivator\ninteractions [3]. Among them GSK5182, a 4-hydroxy tamoxifen\n\nanalogue, is a selective inverse agonist of ERRc and directly binds\nto the ligand binding domain and inhibits transactivation by\n\nERRc [4–8]. ERRc is primarily expressed in heart, brain, kidney,\npancreas and liver tissues [3]. We previously reported that hepatic\n\nERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis by directly binding to the\nPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and Glucose 6-\n\nphosphatase (G6Pase) promoters along with coactivator PGC-1a\n\n[5]. Previous results from our laboratory also demonstrated that\n\nERRc directly binds to the LIPIN1 promoter along with\ncoactivator PGC-1a to regulate LIPIN1 gene expression, and\ninhibits hepatic insulin signaling [6]. ERRc also controls hepatic\nCB1 receptor-mediated CYP2E1 expression at the transcriptional\n\nlevel and thus contributes to the oxidative liver injury by alcohol\n\n[7]. Finally, hypoxia induces PDK4 gene expression through\n\ninduction of ERRc [8]. The transcriptional activity of the ERR\nfamily is dependent on interactions with coactivators, in particular\n\nPGC-1a and PGC-1b [9]. ERRa and ERRc regulate mitochon-\ndrial programs involved in oxidative phosphorylation and a\n\nnuclear-encoded mitochondrial genetic network that coordinates\n\nthe postnatal metabolic transition in the heart [9]. Though all\n\nthese reports clearly suggest a key role of ERRc in different\ncellular processes, its role in ER stress is yet to be determined.\n\nER stress is a state associated with perturbation of ER\n\nhomeostasis and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins\n\nin the ER [10]. CREBH, an ER-stress-activated liver enriched\n\ntranscription factor, has been previously reported to transcrip-\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342\n\n\n\ntionally activate acute phase response genes in the liver in response\n\nto lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines\n\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) [11].\nRecently, CREBH has been demonstrated to play a critical role in\n\nER-stress-mediated regulation of iron metabolism via induction of\n\nhepcidin (Hamp) gene expression, in triglyceride metabolism and\n\nhepatic lipogenesis, and in the mediation of the hormonal\n\nregulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis under fasting or insulin-\n\nresistant conditions [12–15], thereby underlining the importance\n\nof CREBH in various hepatic metabolic pathways. Recent studies\n\nfrom our group have demonstrated that activation of Cb1r leads to\n\nphosphorylation of the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) signaling\n\npathway which in turn activates CREBH. This Cb1r-JNK-\n\nCREBH pathway was further demonstrated to regulate hepatic\n\ngluconeogenesis by regulating key gluconeogenic genes (PEPCK,\n\nand G6Pase) and lipid metabolism by regulating Lipin1 [16–17].\n\nOur group has also reported that hepatic cannabinoid receptor\n\ntype 1 mediates alcohol-induced regulation of bile acid enzyme\n\ngenes (CYP7A1, and CYP27A1) expression via CREBH [18].\n\nPGC-1a, a member of a small family of coactivators, was\nidentified using yeast two hybrid assays for PPARc-interacting\nproteins [19] and is implicated in mitochondrial metabolism,\n\nthermogenesis, mitochondrial biogenesis, adipocyte differentia-\n\ntion, gluconeogenesis and glucose uptake [20–21]. PGC-1a targets\npromoters by interacting directly with numerous DNA binding\n\ntranscription factors and then coordinating several biochemical\n\nevents, including recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes\n\nsuch as p300/CBP and SRC-1, interaction with the basal\n\ntranscription machinery and linking of transcription to RNA\n\nsplicing [22].\n\nC-reactive protein (CRP) in comparison to other inflammation\n\nmarkers is a relatively stable, robust and an exquisitely sensitive\n\nserum protein. In some studies, CRP level in plasma predicts\n\ncardiovascular events even better than low-density lipoprotein\n\ncholesterol level [23]. Multiple epidemiological and mechanistic\n\nstudies have shown that CRP is not just a marker but rather an\n\nactive mediator for endothelial dysfunction, arterial thrombosis\n\nand atherogenesis [24–25]. CRP, as an inflammatory cytokine, is\n\nprimarily synthesized in liver and regulated in response to\n\ninterleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-1b (IL-1b) [26–28]. Hepato-\ncytes are believed to be the major contributor of circulating CRP\n\nin plasma. Therefore, hepatic CRP is able to cause liver per se\n\ndamage and inflammation, and plays a key role in the\n\ndevelopment of atherosclerosis when entering into the blood\n\ncirculation. In hepatoma cell lines, the endogenous CRP gene is\n\neither dysregulated or weakly active [29]. However, plasma levels\n\nof CRP may rise rapidly and markedly (.1000 fold) after an acute\n\ninflammation in human [30].\n\nHere, we examined the mechanism of how nuclear receptor,\n\nERRc regulates ER bound bZIP transcription factor, CREBH\nunder the conditions of ER stress. Upon ER stress, expression of\n\nboth transcription factors increases significantly. ERRc directly\nbinds to the CREBH promoter. Of interest, PGC1a acts as a\ncoactivator for ERRc. We observed a significant increase in\nhistone H3 and H4 acetylation in CREBH promoters upon\n\ninduction of ER stress by tunicamycin (Tm) treatment. Knock-\n\ndown of ERRc significantly decreases the expression of CREBH\n\nFigure 1. ERRc induces CREBH gene. (A,B), AML12 cells were infected with Ad-GFP or Ad-ERRc for 24 hr.

In addition, the nuclear receptors GR, PPARa,\nand HNF4a regulate transcription of the ER bound transcription\nfactor CREBH [15,36–37]. We demonstrated previously that\n\nERRc regulates ATF6a in response to ER stress [38]. To\ninvestigate whether ERRc regulates CREBH, which belongs to\nthe same CREB3 family as ATF6 and is structurally related to it,\n\nERRc was overexpressed by Ad-ERRc in AML12 cells. Interest-\ningly, CREBH mRNA level, as determined by qPCR, increased\n\nmore than six-fold after ERRc overexpression (Fig. 1A). CREBH\nprotein level, as determined by Western blot, also increased under\n\nthe same experimental conditions (Fig. 1B). Next, to check\n\nwhether CREBH gene induction was ERRc specific, ERRa was\noverexpressed in AML12 cells by adenovirus. No significant\n\nchange in CREBH protein level was observed after ERRa\noverexpression, suggesting that CREBH gene induction is ERRc\nspecific (Fig. 1C). To verify these in vitro results, mice were infected\n\nwith Ad-ERRc by tail vein injection. Consistent with the in vitro\nresults, an almost fivefold increase in CREBH mRNA level was\n\nobserved. A significant increase in CREBH-N (active form) protein\n\nlevel was also observed in vivo (Fig. 1D and 1E). As observed in the\n\nmouse cell lines, we noticed a similar effect of ERRc overexpres-\nsion in HepG2 cells. ERRc overexpression significantly increased\nCREBH mRNA, and protein levels (Fig. 1F and G), indicating\n\nFigure 4. ERRc regulates CREBH target gene.

Collectively these\n\nresults demonstrate that ERRc positively regulates CREBH gene\nexpression.\n\nER Stress Induces CREBH Gene Expression via ERRc\nNext, we ascertained the molecular mechanism of ERRc-\n\nmediated CREBH gene induction. A transient transfection assay\n\nwas performed with the ERRc expression vector and the mouse\nand human CREBH promoter- driven luciferase reporter gene\n\n(Fig. 2A, and B). ERRc significantly enhanced both mouse and\nhuman CREBH promoter activity. It was reported previously that\n\ntunicamycin (Tm) induces CREBH and ERRc gene expression\n[11,38]. To investigate whether Tm mediated activation of the\n\nCREBH promoter depends on ERRc, a transient transfection\nassay was performed with the mouse CREBH promoter-driven\n\nluciferase reporter gene. Tm treatment significantly increased\n\nCREBH promoter activity but activation was severely compro-\n\nmised when endogenous ERRc was knocked down (Fig. 2C).\nNext, AML12 cells were treated with Tm or infected with Ad-\n\nshERRc to knockdown endogenous ERRc to observe the effect of\nERRc knockdown on CREBH gene expression. As expected,\n\nknockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly suppressed the Tm-\nmediated increase in CREBH mRNA level (Fig. 2D). Next, we\n\nperformed Western blot analyses to check the CREBH-N protein\n\nlevel under the same experimental conditions. In agreement with\n\nthe mRNA level, CREBH-N protein level also decreased\n\nsignificantly in response to Ad-shERRc infection (Fig. 2E) in\nAML12 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that\n\nERRc mediates the induction of CREBH gene expression by ER\nstress.\n\nERRc Activates CREBH Gene Promoter via an ERRE\nPGC1a acts as an ERRc coactivator [6]. To test whether\n\nPGC1a and ERRc together play any role in the induction of\nCREBH, transient transfection assays were performed with the\n\nmouse CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene and\n\nERRc and PGC1a expression vectors. ERRc significantly\nincreased CREBH promoter activity, and this activity was further\n\naugmented in the presence of PGC1a (Fig. 3A). A series of\ndeletion constructs was analyzed to identify the DNA sequence\n\nconferring the ERRc-mediated ER stress effect on the CREBH\npromoter. Deletion of the CREBH promoter sequence from\n\n0.2 kb to 0.1 kb drastically decreased the promoter activity\n\nconferred by ERRc, suggesting that the region from 0.2 kb to\n0.1 kb confers activation of the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3B). It was\n\nreported previously that ERRc binds to a consensus sequence\nAGGTCA [38]. We aligned this sequence with the CREBH\n\npromoter region from 0.2 kb to 0.1 kb and found a perfect match\n\nto the consensus sequence, AGGTCA, spanning the 0.2 kb to\n\n0.1 kb region. Transient transfection assays were performed using\n\nwild-type and AGGTCA mutant CREBH promoters with the\n\nERRc expression vector to test whether AGGTCA is critical for\nERRc binding. This mutant reporter did not show any significant\nresponse to ERRc cotransfection (Fig. 3C). Next, the ChIP assay\nwas performed to monitor the effect of Tm on ERRc and PGC1a\nrecruitment to the endogenous CREBH gene promoter. Under\n\nbasal conditions, both ERRc and PGC1a occupied the CREBH\npromoter. However, Tm treatment significantly augmented ERRc\nand PGC1a occupancy on the CREBH promoter (Fig. 3D). The\nChIP assay results provide critical in vivo evidence that the ER-\n\nstress-ERRc-PGC1a signaling pathway increases CREBH gene\ntranscription. Gene activation is often associated with increased\n\nhistone acetylation [39], and the ChIP assay was performed to\n\ndetermine whether Tm treatment results in increased template-\n\nassociated histone (H3 and/or H4) acetylation of the CREBH\n\ngene promoter in AML12 cells (Fig. 3E). Tm treatment and\n\nadenoviral overexpression of ERRc and/or PGC1a increased\nacetylation of H3 (Ac–H3) and H4 (Ac–H4) on the ERRc-\nresponsive region of the CREBH promoter, whereas knockdown\n\nof endogenous ERRc or PGC1a significantly reduced histone (H3\nand/or H4) acetylation. We observed a synergistic effect of ERRc\nand PGC1a overexpression on acetylation of H3 (Ac–H3) and H4\n(Ac–H4) (Fig. 3E) which was in accordance with our previous\n\nresults (Fig. 3A) where, synergistic effect on CREBH promoter\n\nactivation was clearly observed by cotransfection of ERRc and\nPGC1a with CREBH promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene.\nOverall, these results demonstrate that ER stress augments the\n\nbinding of ERRc and PGC1a to the CREBH promoter and\nincreases template-associated histone (H3 and H4) acetylation to\n\nfacilitate CREBH gene transcription.\n\nEffect of ERRc Knockdown on CREBH-mediated\nRegulation of CRP Gene Expression\nNext, we examined regulation of CREBH target genes. Our\n\nresults (Figs. 1–3) demonstrate that ERRc regulates CREBH gene\n\nFigure 5.

Following comple-\ntion of the experiments, mice were sacrificed, and liver tissues were\nobtained for western blot analyses of CRP, CREBH-N, and ERRc.

After completion of the\ntreatment, mice were sacrificed. Western blot analyses shows CRP,\nCREBH-N and ERRc expression in liver tissue.

CRP is a well-known marker\n\nof various human diseases and is regulated by CREBH in response\n\nto ER stress [11]. We examined the effect of ERRc knockdown on\nTm mediated CRP promoter activation by transient transfection\n\nassay in 293T cells to verify the effect of ERRc on CREBH target\ngene (Fig. 4A). Both Tm treatment and ERRc overexpression\nsignificantly increased CRP promoter activation. However,\n\nknockdown of endogenous ERRc or CREBH significantly blunted\nthe increase in CRP promoter activation by Tm. These results\n\ndemonstrate that Tm-induced CRP promoter activation is\n\nmediated through ERRc. Next, ERRc was overexpressed in\nAML12 cells to confirm the effect of ERRc on CRP gene\nexpression (Fig. 4B). As expected, ERRc overexpression signifi-\ncantly increased both CRP mRNA and protein levels, and this\n\nincrease was significantly attenuated upon endogenous CREBH\n\nknockdown. This result indicates that ERRc regulates CRP gene\nexpression through CREBH. Endogenous ERRc was knocked\ndown in AML12 cells for further verification. In agreement with\n\nthe previous results, we observed that the Tm-mediated increase in\n\nCRP mRNA and protein was substantially reduced after ERRc\nknockdown (Fig. 4C). Taken together, we demonstrated that\n\nERRc induces CREBH target genes by regulating CREBH itself.\n\nAlcohol Feeding and Diabetic Obesity Induce Hepatic\nCREBH and CRP Gene Expression via Hepatic ERRc\nOur results (Figs. 1–4) demonstrate that ER stress induces\n\nCREBH and CRP gene expression through ERRc in vitro.\nGSK5182, an inverse agonist of ERRc [4–8] that specifically\nbinds to ERRc and inhibits ERRc transcriptional activity, was\nused to verify this effect in vivo. As expected from previous results,\n\nwe noticed that GSK5182 treatment substantially reduced Tm-\n\ninduced CREBH-N and CRP protein levels in mouse liver\n\n(Fig. 5A). Moreover, ERRc protein levels were decreased upon\nTm+GSK treatment as compared to Tm alone. This might be due\nto the mechanism of autoregulatory feed forward loop that\n\nregulates ERRc gene expression [38]. Previous reports from our\nlaboratory demonstrated that acute alcohol consumption induces\n\nhepatic ERRc gene expression [8]. Mice were treated with EtOH\nto investigate whether ERRc induces CREBH-N and CRP gene\nexpression. The EtOH treatment significantly increased CREBH-\n\nN and CRP gene expression, along with ERRc. However,\nGSK5182 strongly inhibited both basal and alcohol-induced\n\nhepatic CREBH-N, and CRP protein expression in mice liver\n\n(Fig. 5B). Our laboratory reported previously that the diabetic\n\nobese condition (db/db mice), induces ERRc gene expression [6].\nA significant induction in CREBH-N and CRP protein levels were\n\nobserved under the same conditions. However, we observed that\n\nGSK5182 treatment substantially suppressed both CREBHN, and\n\nCRP protein levels in db/db mice liver in accordance with previous\n\nresults (Fig. 5C). Overall, we demonstrated that ERRc regulates\nCREBH gene expression in vitro and in vivo.\n\nDiscussion\n\nER stress activates the unfolded protein response to generate\n\nmultiple transcription factors that function in different cellular\n\nphenomena including chromatin remodeling [40–44]. Our results\n\nprovide direct evidence for a newly recognized function of ERRc\nduring transcriptional regulation of CREBH in response to ER\n\nstress, as well as in diabetic obese condition [38,11]. The\n\ncoactivator PGC1a plays a crucial role in this regulation.\nMoreover, chromatin remodeling during subsequent transcription\n\nevents was observed and provided a mechanistic basis for the\n\nERRc-mediated induction of CREBH under different physiolog-\nical conditions.\n\nWe reported previously that ERRc directly regulates ATF6a,\nan ER membrane-bound bZIP transcription factor, in response to\n\nER stress [38]. CREBH is also an ER membrane-bound bZIP\n\ntranscription factor that belongs to the same CREB3 family as\n\nATF6a [11]. Moreover, we reported an increase in CREBH\nmRNA level following ERRc overexpression, although not as\nmuch as that of ATF6a [38]. Hence, we investigated the role of\nERRc in the regulation of ER-bound transcription factor CREBH\nunder different physiological conditions including ER stress. We\n\nobserved significant enhancement of CREBH gene expression by\n\noverexpressing ERRc in vitro and in vivo. A six-fold increase in\nCREBH mRNA level was noticed along with a significant increase\n\nin the CREBH-N form in response to ERRc overexpression\n(Fig. 1). CREBH is regulated by nuclear receptor PPARa,\nHNF4a, and GR [36–37,15]; hence, our current findings further\nestablish the interconnection between nuclear receptors and ER\n\nmembrane-bound transcription factors.\n\nAccording to previous reports, ER stress activates both CREBH\n\nand ERRc gene expression [11,38]. As we observed CREBH gene\ninduction by ERRc (Fig. 1), we speculated that ERRc might be\ninvolved in ER stressmediated induction of CREBH. In fact,\n\nknockdown of endogenous ERRc significantly reduced ER stress-\ninduced CREBH mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2), further\n\nsupporting the ER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. It has been\nreported that ERRc activates target genes by directly binding to\nthe ERRE on the promoter of the target gene [38]. This led us to\n\nspeculate the presence of ERRE on the CREBH promoter, and\n\nwe identified a potential site (AGGTCA) on the CREBH promoter\n\nfor ERRc binding. The ChIP assay provided further crucial\nevidence and confirmed ERRc binding on the CREBH promoter\nunder ER stress. PGC1a is closely associated with ERRc\ntranscriptional activity [3]. Several lines of evidence have shown\n\nthat the transcriptional regulation of PDK4 expression by PGC1a\nis mediated by ERRa or ERRc [45]. In accordance with these\nprevious reports, occupancy of PGC1a on ERRE of the CREBH\npromoter was observed during ER stress, providing critical in vivo\n\nevidence indicating that PGC1a is a coactivator for ERRc. Gene\nrepression is often associated with decreased histone acetylation\n\n[39]. Chromatin remodeling also occurs during coactivator gene\n\ntranscription [46]. In agreement with previous reports, a\n\nsignificant increase in template-associated histone, H3, and H4\n\nacetylation was noticed (H3 and H4) at the ERRE on CREBH\n\npromoter following Tm treatment or ERRc overexpression,\nshowing the importance of chromatin remodeling during gene\n\ntranscription (Fig. 3). Overall, our findings reveal a novel\n\nmolecular mechanism employed by ERRc linking transactivation\nof ERRc [38] to CREBH gene expression. Along with past\nindications of a probable nuclear receptor/ER membrane-bound\n\ntranscription factor interconnection, these data raise the possibility\n\n(discussed further below) that ERRc may serve as a key mediator\nin ER stress-induced CREBH gene expression.\n\nCRP, a known marker for several pathological conditions\n\nincluding ER stress, is regulated by CREBH [11]. Besides being a\n\nmarker, CRP is an active mediator of endothelial dysfunction,\n\narterial thrombosis, and atherogenesis [24–25]. Numerous groups\n\nhave shown pro-inflammatory and pro-atherogenic effects of CRP\n\nin vitro [25,47–48]. Transgenic expression of human CRP\n\nsuppresses endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression and\n\nbioactivity following vascular injury [49]. Several lines of evidence\n\nsuggest that CRP is a modulator that drives direct biological effects\n\non vascular cells. CRP, at concentrations known to predict adverse\n\nvascular events, directly quenches the production of the NO, in\n\nRegulation of CREBH by ERRc\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e86342\n\n\n\npart, through a post-transcriptional effect on endothelial NO\n\nsynthase mRNA stability. Diminished NO bioactivity, in turn,\n\ninhibits angiogenesis, an important compensatory mechanism\n\nduring chronic ischemia [50]. CRP has also been implicated in\n\nglucose metabolism. CRP infusion induces an inflammatory\n\nresponse followed by increased norepinephrine and cortisol levels,\n\nwhich result in increased gluconeogenesis [51]. Our initial results\n\n(Figs. 1–3) linking ER stress to ERRc-mediated induction of\nCREBH, raise the possibility that ERRc might regulate CREBH\ntarget genes by regulating CREBH itself. ERRc significantly\ninduced CRP gene expression (Fig. 4), which further verifies the\n\nER stress-ERRc-CREBH pathway. Alcohol consumption induces\nhepatic ERRc expression [8]. ERRc gene expression increases in\nthe liver of db/db mice [6]. Moreover, ERRc along with CREBH\nare positive regulators of gluconeogenesis [6,15]. In agreement\n\nwith these previous reports, alcohol treatment significantly induced\n\nboth CREBH and CRP gene expression, and this augmentation\n\nwas substantially compromised upon ERRc inhibition in vivo\n(Fig. 5B). Regulation of CREBH by ERRc was further established\nwhen GSK5182 treatment significantly reduced CREBH and its\n\ntarget gene, CRP, expression in db/db mice liver tissue (Fig. 5C).\n\nERRc, CREBH, and CRP are implicated in numerous\nbiological events. ERRc regulates hepatic gluconeogenesis [6]\nand hepatic lipid metabolism [7]. CREBH positively regulates\n\nhepatic gluconeogenesis [15]. In addition, CREBH is a master\n\nregulator of the lipin 1 gene, a key regulator of lipid metabolism\n\n[17]. Both CREBH and ERRc gene expression is enhanced in a\n\ndiabetic mouse model to increase blood glucose level [15,6].\n\nRegulation of both factors is important to regulate gluconeogenesis\n\nin response to ER stress, and diabetes. Because the regulation of\n\nCRP is also very critical to maintain glucose homeostasis as well as\n\nother cellular phenomena including angiogenesis, inhibiting\n\nCREBH transactivity and CRP gene expression by inhibiting\n\nERRc through GSK5182 could be important to relieve disease\nsymptoms. As depicted in Fig. 5D, we hypothesize that ERRc\ndirectly binds to the CREBH promoter along with coactivator\n\nPGC1a to regulate CREBH at the transcriptional level in response\nto ER stress and other physiological conditions, and that CREBH,\n\nin turn, regulates its target genes. Overall, our current findings\n\nprovide insight into a novel chromatin remodeling strategy utilized\n\nby ERRc, and it may be helpful to understand the complex link\nbetween nuclear receptors, ER membrane-bound transcription\n\nfactors, and glucose homeostasis.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank our lab members for technical assistance, Kezhong\n\nZhang for providing us with CRP promoter.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: JM HSC.
