A gene encoding this protein was cloned and sequenced.\nSouthern blot results revealed the existence of multigenes homologous to the P44 gene in the genome of the\nHGE agent. The recombinant 44-kDa protein (rP44) was expressed by using expression vector pET30a. The\nreactivity of the affinity-purified rP44 was evaluated by Western immunoblot analysis and dot blot immuno-\nassay. Western immunoblot analysis showed that mouse anti-rP44 serum reacted with 44- to 42-kDa proteins\nin six different HGE agent strains tested except strain 2, in which three proteins of 42, 40, and 38 kDa were\nrecognized. Eleven HGE patient serum samples, a horse anti-HGE serum, and a horse anti-Ehrlichia equi\nserum recognized the rP44 protein. This suggests that rP44 is an HGE-E. equi group-specific antigen. Neither\nhuman anti-Ehrlichia chaffeensis serum nor rabbit anti-Borrelia burgdorferi serum reacted with rP44. Sera from\ntwo patients coinfected with the HGE agent and B. burgdorferi reacted positively with rP44 and the HGE agent.\nSera from 20 HGE patients with indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA) titers ranging from 1:20 to 1:2,560 gave\ndistinct positive reactions in a dot immunoblot assay. There was a positive correlation between the color\ndensities of the dot reactions and the IFA titers when greater than 50 ng of recombinant antigen per dot was\nused. The use of the affinity-purified rP44 protein as antigen would provide a more specific, consistent, and\nsimpler serodiagnosis for HGE than the use of whole infected cells or purified HGE agents.\n\nHuman granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE), an emerging infec-\ntious disease in humans, is increasingly being recognized in the\nUnited States (6, 9, 11). Serological and PCR studies suggest\nthat HGE infection also exists in Europe (5, 7, 23, 28). The\netiologic agent of HGE is an obligate intracellular bacterium\nthat has been identified as a member of the family Rickettsi-\naceae and is closely related to the Ehrlichia equi-Ehrlichia\nphagocytophila group on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence\ncomparison (9). It has been successfully propagated in a con-\ntinuous promyelocytic leukemia cell line, HL-60 (14, 26). HGE\ninfection is characterized by the presence of ehrlichial inclu-\nsions called morulae in human or animal peripheral blood\ngranulocytes. Recently, evidence of coinfection with Borrelia\nburgdorferi and the HGE agent was obtained by isolation of\nboth organisms from the same patient (19). Although several\nlaboratories have used indirect fluorescent-antibody (IFA)\ntesting (6, 26, 31), acute-phase blood smear (6), nested PCR\n(9, 13, 31), and culture isolation (14, 26, 31) for diagnosis of\nHGE, each of these diagnostic tests has both advantages and\ndisadvantages. IFA testing using the HGE agent or E. equi-\ninfected cells has been the most widely used method for the\nserodiagnosis of ehrlichiosis. The IFA test is the most sensitive\nmethod when both acute- and convalescent-phase sera are\nbeing tested (31). However, it requires a tissue culture system\nfor preparation of HGE agent-infected cell antigen slides, a\nfluorescent microscope, and trained persons especially for\nevaluation of the serum reactivity to the antigen on the slide.\n\nAlthough antisera against various Ehrlichia species other than\nE. equi and E. phagocytophila did not react with the HGE agent\n(26), cross-reactivity between the HGE agent and Ehrlichia\nchaffeensis was reported in previous studies (1, 6, 26). This\ncross-reactivity is probably caused by common antigenic com-\nponents possessed by these two organisms. The nested PCR\nappears to be the best test for the early diagnosis of HGE (13,\n31). However, the nested PCR requires a thermocycler and\ntrained personnel and the reagents are relatively expensive.\nThe HGE agent has been directly isolated and stably cultivated\nfrom blood specimens of human patients (14, 26). In our pre-\nvious investigation (31), four new HGE agent isolates (8% of\nthe total examined) were obtained from 53 blood specimens.\nThe sensitivity of culture isolation in diagnosis seems to be\nrelatively lower than those of the IFA test (23% positive of the\ntotal examined) and the nested PCR (13% positive of the total\nexamined). Moreover, it requires serologic evidence, PCR, or\n16S rRNA gene sequence for confirmation of the identity\nof new isolates (31). Therefore, a convenient and sensitive\nmethod with high specificity for the diagnosis of HGE infection\nis still desirable. It has been found that the host humoral\nimmune response in HGE infection is mainly directed against\n44- and 42-kDa proteins of the HGE agent (4, 14, 31). Western\nblot analysis showed that 44- or 42-kDa proteins in different\nHGE isolates were recognized by various sera from HGE pa-\ntients and an experimentally infected horse, indicating the\ncross-reactivity of major antigens among the different isolates\nof the HGE agent (4, 14, 31). In the present study, the gene of\nthe major surface 44-kDa protein (P44) of the HGE agent was\ncloned and sequenced and the partial gene which codes for the\nantigenic epitopes was overexpressed. Affinity-purified recom-\nbinant P44 (rP44) was used as a testing antigen in Western\n\n* Corresponding author.

HGE agent isolates 2, 3, 6, 11, and 13 from patients in\nNew York State and USG isolate from the tick kindly provided by R. Coughlin\n(Cambridge Bio-Tech, Worcester, Mass.) were cultivated in HL-60 cells (11, 26,\n31). E. chaffeensis Arkansas was cultivated in the DH82 dog macrophage cell line\n(25). The organisms were purified by the Sephacryl S-1000 chromatography\nmethod described by Rikihisa et al. (24). B. burgdorferi HBH-1 and rabbit anti-B.\nburgdorferi HBH-1 were provided by Karim Hechemy, New York State Depart-\nment of Health (Albany, N.Y.). All HGE patient serum samples, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 13,\n21, and 22, were collected from patients at the Westchester County Medical\nCenter in New York State. The diagnosis of HGE was confirmed by using PCR,\nIFA testing, and culture isolation as previously described (31). Among these\nserum samples, samples 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, and 13 had been characterized by using\nWestern immunoblot analysis in a previous study (31). Patient serum samples\n21-1, -2, -3, -4, and -5 were collected at different stages of illness (25 July 1995,\nfirst acute stage; 24 August 1995, convalescent stage; 5 October 1995, 13 June\n1996, and 17 July 1997, second acute stage), respectively, from patient 21, who\nwas suspected of being reinfected with the HGE agent. Horse anti-HGE and\nhorse anti-E. equi sera were kindly provided by J. Madigan, University of Cali-\nfornia, Davis (18). Human anti-E. chaffeensis serum was kindly provided by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga., and previously char-\nacterized by Western blotting (25). The sera from patients with Lyme borreliosis\nand coinfection with B. burgdorferi and HGE agent were also collected from\npatients seen at the Westchester County Medical Center in New York State. The\nprocedure of evaluation for B. burgdorferi infection was performed as previously\ndescribed (19). The motile spirochetes visualized in blood or biopsy specimens of\nerythema migrans lesions by fluorescence microscopy were confirmed to be B.\nburgdorferi with a PCR using primers IS1 and IS2. Serum antibodies to B.\nburgdorferi were assayed by an immunoglobulin M (IgM)-IgG enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELA Lyme Stat; Bio-Whittaker, Walkersville, Md.) in\naccordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nConstruction and immunoscreening of the HGE agent gene library. Genomic\nDNA of the HGE agent H2 strain (isolate 13) was isolated from purified ehrli-\nchial organisms by lysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), pronase digestion,\nphenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation in accordance with the\nprocedure of Ohashi et al. (20). Purified genomic DNA was completely digested\nwith 20 U of EcoRI at 37°C for 4 h and then ligated into the lZAPII vector. All\nprocedures were carried out with a lZAPII/EcoRI/CIAP cloning kit (Stratagene,\nLa Jolla, Calif.) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the\ngene library was constructed by infecting Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF9 with\nthe recombinant phage. Clones expressing ehrlichial proteins were identified by\nusing horse anti-HGE serum (18) (kindly provided by J. Madigan), which had\nbeen preabsorbed with E. coli lysate. Positive recombinant pBluescript phage-\nmids were excised from the lZAPII phages in the presence of helper phage f1\nand used to transform E. coli SOLR cells (Stratagene). All of the positive clones\nwere analyzed by Western blotting with the horse anti-HGE agent serum. Phage-\nmid purification, restriction enzyme digestion, and gel electrophoresis were car-\nried out as described by Sambrook et al. (27).\n\nDNA sequence analysis. DNA sequencing was determined by a dideoxy chain\ntermination method with an Applied Biosystems (Foster City, Calif.) model 373\nDNA sequencer. DNA sequencing was performed by a primer-walking method\nusing synthetic oligonucleotides as primers. Translation of the nucleotide se-\nquence and alignment of the amino acid sequence were done by using DNASIS\ncomputer software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co. Ltd., Yokohama, Japan).\n\nA homology search was done with the GenBank (National Center for Biotech-\nnology Information, Bethesda, Md.) database by using the local alignment search\ntool (3) software in the BLAST network service (National Center for Biotech-\nnology Information). The GenBank accession number of the P44 gene is\nAF059181.\n\nAnalysis of the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the outer membrane\nproteins of the HGE agent. An outer membrane protein fraction from the\npurified the HGE agent was prepared by the Sarkosyl extraction method as\ndescribed previously (20, 31). Proteins in the Sarkosyl-insoluble pellet prepared\nfrom 700 mg of purified HGE agent organisms were separated by SDS–10%\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electrophoretically transferred\nto a ProBlot membrane (Applied Biosystems) in 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propane-\nsulfonic acid (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) and 10% methanol (pH 11) at 300 mA for\n4 to 5 h by use of a Bio-Rad (Hercules, Calif.) transblot cell, and the sheet was\nstained with 1% amido black in 42% methanol–17% acetic acid. The protein\nband areas were cut out, and the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the\nproteins on the strips were analyzed by use of an Applied Biosystems model\n470A protein sequencer.\n\nOverexpression of the 44-kDa major outer membrane protein of the HGE\nagent. To effectively overexpress antigenic epitopes of rP44, the deduced amino\nacid sequences based on the sequences of plasmid pHGE1221, which was posi-\ntive by immunoscreening and contained an open reading frame (ORF) encoding\nthe proposed P44, were analyzed with DNASTAR (Madison, Wis.) computer\nsoftware. Several motifs with a high antigenic index and a probability of surface\nexposure were found in the NH2-terminal portion. Therefore, the primers were\ndesigned to amplify the DNA sequence encoding a 219-amino-acid polypeptide\nfrom the NH2 terminus including 8 amino acid residues of signal peptide and\nwere prepared by BioServe (Laurel, Md.). The 59 oligonucleotide primer consists\nof the DNA sequence coding for the NH2-terminal region of the HGE agent P44\nand the NcoI restriction sites (underlined) (59-CGCCATGGCTGGGAGTGAT\nGTCA-39), and the 39 oligonucleotide primers consist of the DNA sequence\ncoding for the amino acids from positions 243 to 247 with the additions of a stop\ncodon (TAG; in boldface type) and a EcoRI restriction site (underlined) (59-G\nCGAATTCTACGCACTACCATTACTCA-39) (Fig. 1). PCR amplification was\ncarried out with a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA thermal cycler (model 480) by using\nstandard procedures. The 657-bp amplified product containing approximately\nhalf of the P44 gene was digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into dephos-\nphorylated NcoI- and EcoRI-digested pET30a expression vector (Novagen, Inc.,\nMadison, Wis.). The recombinant plasmid was designated pEP44. E. coli Nov-\naBlue (Novagen) was transformed with recombinant pET30a. A plasmid prep-\naration of pEP44 from transformed NovaBlue was then used to transform E. coli\nBL21(DE3)/pLysS. The induction of the recombinant protein was performed by\na procedure described elsewhere (17). The purification of rP44 protein was\nperformed by using the His-Bind buffer kit (Novagen) in accordance with the\nmanufacturer’s instruction.\n\nSouthern blot analysis. Genomic DNA (200 ng) extracted from the purified\nHGE agent strain HZ (26) was completely digested with 20 U of restriction\nendonucleases at 37°C for 4 h, electrophoresed, and transferred to a Hybond-N1\n\nnylon membrane (Amersham, Arlington Heights, Ill.) by a standard method (27).\nThe 1.2-kb P44 gene fragment generated by PCR from the clone pHGE1221 was\nlabeled with [a-32P]dATP by the random primer method using a kit (Boehringer\nMannheim, Indianapolis, Ind.), and the labeled fragment was used as a DNA\nprobe. Hybridization was performed at 60°C in rapid hybridization buffer (Am-\nersham) for 16 h. The nylon sheet was washed in 0.13 SSC (13 SSC is 0.15 M\nNaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate)–1% SDS at 55°C, and hybridized probes were\nexposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham) at 280°C.\n\nPreparation of hyperimmune anti-rP44 polyclonal antiserum. Hyperimmune\nanti-rP44 polyclonal antiserum was generated by intraperitoneal immunization\nof male BALB/c mice (6 weeks old) with affinity-purified rP44 as described\nabove. Primary immunization of each animal was done with 15 mg of purified\n\nFIG. 1. Restriction map of a 6.9-kb genomic DNA fragment including the P44 gene of the HGE agent.

Two boosts of 10 mg each of rP44 in\nFreund’s incomplete adjuvant followed on days 14 and 28. Hyperimmune serum\nobtained 14 days after the last boost was used in Western immunoblot analysis as\ndescribed below.\n\nWestern immunoblot analysis. The affinity-purified rP44 and purified HGE\norganisms were used for Western immunoblot analysis. Western immunoblotting\nwas performed by a procedure described elsewhere (31). Briefly, uninfected\nHL-60 cells, purified HGE agent, E. chaffeensis, B. burgdorferi (HBH-1), and\nrP44 protein separated by 10% PAGE were transferred to a nitrocellulose sheet\nand then the sheet was immersed in TBS (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH\n7.4]) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (T-TBS) and 5% milk at 4°C overnight to\nsaturate protein-binding site. The antigen electroblotted onto the nitrocellulose\nmembranes was incubated with the primary mouse, human, or horse sera at a\n1:1,000 dilution and then with peroxidase-conjugated affinity-purified anti-hu-\nman, anti-horse, or anti-mouse IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.,\nGaithersburg, Md.) at a 1:1,000 or 1:2,000 dilution. The peroxidase-positive\nbands were detected by immersing the sheet in a developing solution (70 mM\nsodium acetate [pH 6.2]) containing 0.3% diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride\n(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) and 0.03% H2O2 at room temperature for\n5 min. The enzyme reaction was terminated by washing the sheet in 0.1 M\nH2SO4.\n\nDot immunoblot assay. The dot immunoblot assay was performed by using a\nBio-Rad dot blot apparatus. The affinity-purified rP44 protein in TBS was blotted\nonto the nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, N.H.) and then\nimmersed in T-TBS containing 5% milk at room temperature for 30 min, air\ndried, and stored at 220°C until required. Based on the results of a quantitative\nanalysis (see Fig. 5), 0.5 mg of rP44 per dot was used in the immunoassay to assay\nthe clinical specimens. For the immunoassay, sera to be tested were diluted at\n1:1,000 in T-TBS containing 5% milk and incubated with the antigen dots for 1 h\nat room temperature. The sera used in this study were from HGE patients\ncharacterized previously (26, 31). After being washed three times with T-TBS,\nthe nitrocellulose sheets were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated affinity-\npurified anti-human IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry) at a 1:2,000 dilution. The perox-\nidase-positive bands were detected by immersing the sheet in a developing\nsolution as described in “Western immunoblot analysis.” The color density was\nmeasured by using background correction of ImageQuaNT program (Molecular\nDynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif.).\n\nRESULTS\n\nCloning, sequencing and overexpression of the 44-kDa ma-\njor surface protein gene of the HGE agent. An HGE agent\ngenomic library was constructed in lZAPII phage and identi-\nfied by immunoscreening with horse anti-HGE agent serum as\ndescribed in Materials and Methods. One of the positive clones\nwhich expressed a 44-kDa antigenic protein was named\npHGE1221. The insert size of pHGE1221 was approximately\n6.9 kb. The nucleotide sequence of recombinant plasmid\npHGE1221 was determined by the primer-walking method.\nThe sequence of pHGE1221 contained five ORFs, and the\nsecond ORF, 1,239 bp in size, encoded a 413-amino-acid pro-\ntein with a molecular mass of 43,739 Da including signal pep-\ntide (Fig. 1). This ORF (ORF2) was found to contain 44-kDa\nantigen because the N-terminal 10-amino-acid sequence of\nnative 44-kDa major outer membrane protein in the Sarkosyl-\ninsoluble fraction (Fig. 2) was identical to the NH2-terminal\namino acid sequence (without a 37-amino acid signal peptide)\nof the ORF2 predicted from the nucleotide sequence. The\n44-kDa major outer membrane protein corresponded to the\n49-kDa protein in our previous study (31) due to the variation\nof the prestained standard in which the molecular mass of\novalbumin was recently changed from 51 to 47 kDa in accor-\ndance with the manufacturer’s instruction (Bio-Rad).\n\nORF1 contained 759 nucleotide base pairs encoding 253\namino acids without a start codon. Two regions in ORF1 were\nfound to have the identical sequences within ORF2 (Fig. 1).\nThese conserved regions, named R1 and R2, encoded 59 and\n65 amino acids, respectively.\n\nAmino acid sequence analysis indicated that the P44 protein\nof the HGE agent is a typical transmembrane protein which\ncontains alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic motifs with a\nsignal peptide of 37 amino acid residues. A search of the\nGenBank database revealed significant amino acid sequence\n\nsimilarity between the HGE agent P44 and major surface pro-\ntein 2 (MSP-2) of Anaplasma marginale, a bovine intraeryth-\nrocytic bacteria (66% similarity; 44% identity). A. marginale\nMSP-2 is an immunoprotective protein encoded by a polymor-\nphic multigene family (22). The regions conserved between the\nHGE agent P44 and A. marginale MSP-2 were found located in\nthe hydrophobic motifs. ORF3, -4, and -5 are currently under\ninvestigation.\n\nWe expressed the entire P44 by cloning the whole P44 gene\ninto the pET30a vector. However, the expression level was very\nlow (data not shown). To effectively overexpress antigenic\nepitopes of P44 of the HGE agent, the DNA sequence coding\nfor a 219-amino-acid polypeptide with a molecular mass of\n23,246 Da from the NH2 terminus (including 8 amino acid\nresidues of signal peptide) was subcloned into the pET30a\nexpression vector. The recombinant plasmid was named\npEP44. The expressed rP44 antigenic protein purified by af-\nfinity chromatography was 35 kDa in size by SDS-PAGE. It\nwas a fusion protein in which a 44-amino-acid sequence in-\ncluding the His tag peptide derived from the pET30a expres-\nsion vector was located at the NH2 terminus (Fig. 2).\n\nPresence of multigenes homologous to P44 gene. Genomic\nSouthern blot analysis with several restriction enzymes, includ-\ning EcoRI, XbaI, SpeI, and SstI, revealed that the 32P-labeled\nP44 gene probe hybridizes with multiple DNA fragments of the\nHGE agent (Fig. 3). All five restriction enzymes used gener-\nated approximately 10 bands with different densities. The re-\nstriction enzymes used did not cut within the P44 gene that was\ncloned in this study, and therefore the Southern blot result\nshowed that the multigenes homologous to the P44 gene were\npresent in the HGE agent genome. The exact number of P44\ngene copies cannot be determined, since restriction site poly-\n\nFIG. 2. SDS-PAGE patterns of the antigens used in this study.

Western immunoblot analy-\nsis showed that mouse anti-rP44 serum strongly reacted with\n44- to 42-kDa proteins in all of the different HGE agent strains\nexcept strain 2, in which three proteins of 42, 40, and 38 kDa\nwere recognized (Fig. 4). The mouse antiserum also recog-\nnized a 27-kDa protein in isolates 2 and 6 and a 15-kDa protein\nin isolates 2, 3, 6, and USG (Fig. 4). Horse anti-HGE serum\nand 11 serum samples from HGE patients used in this study\nspecifically recognized rP44 (Fig. 5). All of these patients were\n\npreviously confirmed to have HGE by PCR and/or culture\nisolation (26, 31). Five serum samples collected over a 2-year\nperiod from a patient (patient 21) at different stages of illness\nreacted with rP44 (Fig. 5). This patient was suspected of having\nreinfection with the HGE agent, since the IFA titer at 8 days\nbefore the sample 21-5 serum collection date was 1:40. The\nresult indicates that regardless of the stages of infection or\nreinfection, P44 is the major antigen recognized by the patient\nsera. The horse anti-E. equi serum strongly reacted with both\nnative 44-kDa protein in whole-cell organisms and rP44 of the\nHGE agent (Fig. 6). Human anti-E. chaffeensis and rabbit\nanti-B. burgdorferi did not recognize rP44. This suggests that\nrP44 might be used as a testing antigen to differentiate infec-\ntion with the HGE agent from infection with E. chaffeensis or\nB. burgdorferi. Two patients, 21 and 22, were diagnosed as\nhaving coinfection with B. burgdorferi and the HGE agent. The\nsera of patients 21 and 22 reacted positively with rP44 and the\nHGE agent as well as with the antigenic components of B.\nburgdorferi (Fig. 7). Three serum samples from patients with\nLyme borreliosis were also investigated by Western blot anal-\nysis using HGE agent organisms and rP44 as antigens. None of\nthem had a positive reaction (data not shown).\n\nDot blot immunoassay. To determine the optimal amount of\nantigen per dot and the optimal dilution of patient sera for dot\nblot immunoassay, nitrocellulose membrane strips, each hav-\ning eight dots containing different amounts of purified rP44\nantigen, were incubated with five different serum samples with\nIFA titers ranging from 1:2,560 to ,1:20 (Fig. 8, insert). There\nwas a positive correlation between the color densities of the\ndot reactions and the IFA titers when .50 ng of recombinant\nantigen was used per dot. These results indicate that the dot\nimmunoassay using rP44 protein provides a simpler serodiag-\n\nFIG. 3.

No reaction\nwas detected with negative control sera (IFA titer, ,1:20) (Fig.\n8, insert). The color density values of each dot measured after\nbackground correction by the ImageQuaNT program are\nshown in Fig. 8. Since the difference in color density among\nsera with different IFA titers was quite distinct and the color\ndensity progressively increased (especially at antigen amounts\n\nof 0.25 to 1 mg per dot), 0.5 mg per dot was used in the\nfollowing experiments. This amount of protein can distinguish\nboth high and low titers.\n\nA total of 25 clinical patient serum samples with different\nIFA titers (from 1:2,560 to ,1:20) were examined by dot blot\nimmunoassay using 0.5 mg of affinity-purified rP44 per dot. As\nshown in Fig. 9A, the color density of the each dot is highly\ncorrelated with the IFA titer. In five tested serum samples with\nIFA titers of ,1:20, the color density of one dot can be clearly\ndistinguished from that of other negative sera by the naked\neye. This serum sample was collected in the acute phase from\npatient 3 (31), who was positive for the HGE agent by nested\nPCR and culture isolation. This patient developed a convales-\ncent-phase IFA titer of 1:640 (Fig. 9A, dot E1). The remaining\nfour serum samples with titers of ,1:20 were derived from\npatients who were negative by convalescent-phase serum IFA,\nPCR, and isolation (31).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe availability of recombinant immunodominant major\nsurface proteins of the HGE agent will greatly assist in the\ndiagnosis of this intracellular bacterium and elucidation of\npathogenesis of HGE such as mechanisms of invasion of host\ncells and intracellular survival and immune responses. In pre-\nvious studies, 44- to 42-kDa proteins or proteins of similar sizes\nwere shown to be immunodominant major surface proteins of\nthe HGE agent, which are recognized by all the sera from\nHGE patients tested (4, 16, 31). The present study is the first\nreport that a 44-kDa major outer membrane protein of the\nHGE agent has been identified and characterized at the mo-\nlecular and protein sequence level. Interestingly, the sequence\nanalysis of P44 also revealed significant homology to an immu-\nnoprotective A. marginale major surface protein, MSP-2, which\nis encoded by a polymorphic multigene family (22).\n\nPolymorphic multigene families encoding the major outer\nmembrane proteins have been identified in E. chaffeensis and\nA. marginale that are closely related to the HGE agent based\non 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison. In E. chaffeensis, six\ncopies of the P28 gene were tandemly arrayed 1 kb apart in the\nehrlichial chromosome. This multiple gene family of E.\nchaffeensis encodes a group of immunodominant major outer\nmembrane proteins ranging in size from 23 to 30 kDa (20). A.\nmarginale MSP-2 and -3 are also encoded by multiple gene\nfamilies (2, 22). These latter multiple gene copies were distrib-\nuted widely throughout the chromosome. In addition, strain\nvariations of these gene copies were demonstrated. Although\nthe exact number of copies of the P44 gene of the HGE agent\nhas not been determined, Southern blot analysis showed mul-\ntigenes homologous to the P44 gene in the genome of the HGE\nagent isolate 13. In addition, identical sequences (R1 and R2)\npresent in ORF1 and ORF2 (P44 gene) may also provide\nevidence for the existence of multiple homologous P44 genes\nin the genome of the HGE agent. Further molecular genetic\nstudies are required to clarify the role of the multiple copies of\nthe P44 gene in antigenic and biologic polymorphism of the\nHGE agent.\n\nOur Western immunoblot results showed that the rP44 pro-\ntein specifically reacted with HGE patient sera having different\nIFA titers. This indicates that rP44 is properly folded, exposing\nthe specific antigenic epitopes which are recognized by the host\nimmune system. Infections caused by E. chaffeensis or B. burg-\ndorferi are the two most important infections in humans that\nare related to HGE. A diverse serologic cross-reactivity be-\ntween the HGE agent and E. chaffeensis was reported by us\npreviously and by others (1, 6, 26). The human anti-E. chaffeen-\n\nFIG. 6.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\nsis serum used in the present study was kindly provided by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. It was collected\nfrom a patient with a typical E. chaffeensis infection and char-\nacterized by IFA testing and Western blot analysis (25). Ad-\nditionally, in unpublished data of our laboratory, 20 different\nserum samples from HGE patients were analyzed by Western\nimmunoblotting against both the HGE agent and E. chaffeensis\nantigens. Cross-reactive antigens between the HGE agent and\nE. chaffeensis were found in the size range of 55 to 60 kDa\nrather than 44 kDa. Therefore, we believe that rP44 can be\nused to differentiate HGE and E. chaffeensis infections. More-\nover, it had been reported that false-positive Lyme disease\ntests can occur in cases of HGE infection (30). These recent\nresults suggest that potential cross-reactive antigens among\nthree pathogenic microorganisms might complicate serodiag-\nnostic evaluation of these diseases. The results of the Western\nimmunoblot analysis in this study showed that rP44 is not\nrecognized by antisera against E. chaffeensis or B. burgdorferi.\nTherefore, use of rP44 as the testing antigen is advantageous\n\nsince it eliminates the possibility of cross-reactivity between the\nHGE agent and these microorganisms, which is caused by\ncommon antigenic components such as heat shock proteins in\nwhole-organism preparations as suggested previously (31).\n\nOn the basis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison,\nthe Ehrlichia species along with several related genera can be\ndivided into three distinct groups. The HGE agent is closely\nrelated to the E. equi-E. phagocytophila group (9). The major\nantigenic components of organisms in the three groups of\nEhrlichia resemble each other but are quite different between\ngroups (4, 20, 24). Therefore, within each group, ehrlichial\norganisms are highly cross-reactive antigenically and share sev-\neral homologous surface antigens. Dumler et al. previously\nreported that serum from an HGE patient reacted with the\n44-kDa protein of E. equi and E. phagocytophila (12). Diversity\nof major antigens has been observed previously among differ-\nent strains of Ehrlichia risticii and E. chaffeensis (8, 10). Al-\nthough only little is known about antigenic variants among\nstrains of the HGE agent (4, 31), we previously demonstrated\n\nFIG. 8. Optical density analysis of the reaction of the HGE agent rP44 antigen (Ag) with patient sera having different IFA testing titers was performed by using\nImageQuaNT computer program. Color development of various amounts of affinity-purified rP44 of the HGE agent was done after reaction with patient sera having\ndifferent HGE agent IFA titers and with negative control sera (insert). The sera were diluted at 1:1,000.\n\nVOL. 36, 1998 MAJOR OUTER MEMBRANE PROTEIN OF THE HGE AGENT 1671\n\n\n\na strain polymorphism among the major antigenic proteins of\nthe HGE agent (31). However, the mouse antiserum specific to\nrP44 strongly recognized 44- to 42-kDa proteins in all isolates\ntested, indicating that the major antigenic proteins in different\nHGE agent isolates are antigenically cross-reactive with rP44\n(31). Since all HGE agent isolates used in these studies were\nisolated from the same geographic regions in New York State,\nthe results may not represent all of the different serotypes\nexisting in the United States. However, our observation of the\nreaction of horse anti-HGE (Wisconsin strain) and anti-E. equi\nsera with rP44 suggests that rP44 has an HGE-E. equi group-\nspecific epitope. It is, therefore, probably useful for serodiag-\nnosis of all strains of the HGE agent.\n\nAdditionally, the mouse antiserum specific to rP44 also re-\nacted with a 27-kDa protein with two of the isolates and a\n15-kDa protein with four of the isolates even when proteinase\ninhibitor (e.g., phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was added dur-\ning the preparation of antigens. Therefore, it is unlikely that\nthese antigens were generated from the degradation of P44 in\nthese isolates. According to the data presented in this paper,\nthe P44 proteins might be encoded by a multigene family and\nsome of these homologous genes might be truncated either at\nthe N terminus (e.g., ORF1 in pHGE1221) or the C terminus.\n\nIt is possible that the 27- and 15-kDa antigens were encoded by\na gene whose C-terminal portion was truncated. In addition, in\nour previous study (20), we identified a multigene family en-\ncoding a group of major antigens of E. chaffeensis. We dem-\nonstrated the possibility that the P23 protein is generated from\nOMP-1F (P30) by specific processing. Whether this also hap-\npens to the 27- or 15-kDa antigen of the HGE agent remains\nto be seen.\n\nThe dot immunoblot assay has been developed for detection\nof several infectious agents (15, 21, 29). The advantages of this\nassay are that no particular instrument is required and the\ninterpretation of the results is easy for inexperienced personnel\nsince positive and negative reactions can be distinguished by\nthe naked eye. In the dot immunoblot assay described herein,\nthe color density of positive sera (IFA titer, .1:20) is signifi-\ncantly stronger than that of negative controls. Therefore, an-\ntibody-positive sera can be easily distinguished from antibody-\nnegative sera by the naked eye. One acute-stage serum sample\nwith an IFA titer of less than 1:20 was positive by the dot blot\nimmunoassay. This may indicate that the dot blot immunoas-\nsay using rP44 is more sensitive than IFA testing. However,\nanother acute-phase serum sample, from patient 4 (31), who\nwas positive for the HGE agent infection by IFA testing of\nconvalescent-phase serum, nested PCR, and culture isolation,\nshowed a negative reaction in the dot blot immunoassay. This\nmay be explained by the slower or lower level of humoral\nimmune response against HGE infection in this individual\nbecause the IFA titer of convalescent-phase sera collected\nfrom the same patient 2 weeks later was only 1:80.\n\nFor the serodiagnosis of HGE infection, IFA testing is\nwidely used. However, the final evaluation needs specific\nequipment and trained personnel. It also requires cultivation\nof the HGE agent, which may change its antigenic composition\nduring passage. Use of whole infected cells or whole organisms\nas antigen increases the false-positive rate due to antigenic\ncross-reactivity or nonspecific antibody binding. The affinity-\npurified recombinant major antigenic protein would provide a\nstable and economical source of the pure antigen for specific\nand sensitive serologic tests. Especially since the dot blot or\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using recombinant anti-\ngens can be automated in the diagnostic laboratory, a simple\nand rapid diagnosis of HGE infection could be made. Al-\nthough more patient serum samples must be tested to verify its\nusefulness in the clinical laboratory, the recombinant P44 of\nthe present study should greatly advance HGE serodiagnosis.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank John Lowbridge of the Peptide and Protein Engineering\nLaboratory, The Ohio State University, for his assistance in NH2-\nterminal amino acid sequencing and Qin Lu of the Neurobiological\nCenter, The Ohio State University, for her assistance in DNA sequenc-\ning.
