It is widely re‐\nported that endogenous sex hormones, originally considered to act \non the reproductive system, contribute to the development of kid‐\nney diseases, but their overall impacts on renal function still remain \ncontroversial. Quite a few studies held the view that female sex hor‐\nmones were overall protective in terms of renal diseases because \naccelerated progression of CKD in males was more frequent than fe‐\nmales\t(Kang\t&\tMiller,\t2002;\tSaran\tet\tal.,\t2015;\tSilbiger\t&\tNeugarten,\t\n1995).\t However,\t the\t sex\t differences\t in\t this\t renoprotection\t seem\t\nto diminish after menopause, when stratified by age (Nitsch et al., \n2013). Furthermore, hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis dysfunc‐\ntion ultimately brings about a decline in the estrogen level and was \nconsidered to be the key factor for the increased incidence of CKD, \nwhile estrogen supplementation alone failed to fully reverse renal \ndysfunction\t (Holley,\t 2004;\t Pietrzak\t et\t al.,\t 2006).\t Together,\t these\t\nfindings suggest that some sex hormones may play roles, which have \nnot yet been investigated, in the pathophysiology of postmeno‐\npausal CKD.\n\nA\tsubstantial\televation\tin\tthe\tserum\tfollicle-stimulating\thormone\t\nlevel, although likely to compensate for estrogen withdrawal, has \nbeen closely involved in the adverse effects of menopause on many \nnongonadal\ttissues,\tincluding\tbone\t(Sponton\t&\tKajimura,\t2017),\tliver\t\n(Song\tet\tal.,\t2016),\tadipose\ttissue\t(Liu\tet\tal.,\t2015),\tumbilical\tvascular\t\nendothelial cell (Siraj et al., 2013), and biliary epithelium (Onori et \n\nal., 2013). Functional follicle‐stimulating hormone receptors (FSHRs) \nwere also reported to exist in these extragonadal tissues to regulate \nbone, glucose, and lipid metabolism (Qi et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2006). \nIn addition, the abundance of FSHR in patients with primary renal \ncarcinoma was nearly comparable to that in testicular cancer, in \nwhich the surge was different from the physiologically low FSHR ex‐\npression in the kidneys (Fagerberg et al., 2014). FSHR can serve as an \neffective tumor vasculature marker, whose elevation is strongly re‐\nlated\tto\tangiogenesis\tin\trenal\tmetastatic\ttumors\t(Siraj,\tPichon,\tRadu,\t\n&\tGhinea,\t2012).\tHowever,\tto\tdate,\tepidemiological\tand\texperimen‐\ntal studies exploring the potential association between FSH and \nCKD are not available, and no information exists about a functional \ncontribution of FSH to kidney disease. Thus, the aim of this study \nwas to investigate the hypothesis that FSH participates in the de‐\nvelopment of renal impairment during the postmenopausal period.\n\n2\u2003 |\u2003RESULTS\n\n2.1\u2003|\u2003FSH is associated with eGFR, decreased eGFR, \nand CKD in postmenopausal women\n\nTo confirm our hypothesis that FSH participates in the develop‐\nment of renal impairment during the postmenopausal period, we \nselected\t3,055\tpostmenopausal\twomen\tfrom\t10,441\tparticipants\t\nbased\t on\t a\t cross-sectional\t study\t called\t “SPECT-China”\t (Figure\t\n\nF I G U R E  1 \u2003 FSH is associated with eGFR, decreased eGFR, and CKD in postmenopausal women.

The protein localization of FSHR \nwas further confirmed by immunofluorescence staining, showing \nthat FSHR was highly abundant in mouse renal tubular epithelium \nand HK‐2 cells (Figure 2b). Thus, we speculated that renal proximal \nepithelium cells were likely to be the key candidate sites where FSH \nexerted an effect on the kidney. In addition, we attempted to in‐\nvestigate whether the FSHR is a functional FSHR when exposed to \nFSH treatment in vitro, and found that FSHR expression generally \nincreased in a dose‐dependent manner in HK‐2 cells treated with \nFSH (Figure S2). These results suggest that FSHR may mediate FSH‐\nrelated kidney changes.\n\nTo confirm whether high FSH levels exert impacts on renal \nfunction in mice, we performed ovariectomy surgery to mimic \npostmenopausal\t hormone\t changes\t (Figure\t S3A).\t As\t expected,\t\nOVX mice had declined levels of E2 as well as increased levels \nof\t LH\t and\t FSH\t (Figure\t S3C,D),\t and\t obvious\t elevations\t in\t kidney\t\nweight/body weight, 24‐hr urine protein/creatinine, serum cre‐\natinine, and serum urea nitrogen (Figure 2c–f), but no significant \nchanges in body weight (Figure S3B) were observed. Ovariotomy‐\ninduced renal dysfunction was improved by daily administration \nof GnRHa, a gonadotropin‐releasing hormone agonist that can \nsuppress\t pituitary-derived\t FSH\t and\t LH\t release.\t Additional\t FSH\t\ninjected into mice was used to explore the singular effect of FSH \non renal dysfunction as shown in Figure 2c–f described, and FSH \nsupplementation\tin\tthe\tabsence\tof\tLH\tled\tto\ta\tmarked\taggravation\t\nin renal dysfunction.\n\n2.3\u2003|\u2003High FSH impaired kidney function through \nenhanced tubulointerstitial fibrosis\n\nGiven that functional FSHR was highly elevated in renal tubular epi‐\nthelium, we mainly focused on HK‐2 cells to further understand how \nFSH exacerbated renal dysfunction. In vitro, the transcriptional and \nprotein expression of several fibrotic genes (collagen IV, fibronec‐\ntin,\tand\tPAI-1)\tsignificantly\t increased\t in\ta\t time-\tand\tdose-depend‐\nent manner in HK‐2 cells (Figure 3a–d), while we did not observe an \nobvious difference in cell viability (Figure S4), which led us to specu‐\nlate that renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, rather than apoptosis, might \nbe responsible for FSH‐induced renal dysfunction. Renal fibrosis is \ncharacterized by excessive fibrous connective tissues, such as col‐\nlagen and fibronectin in or around lesions. In vivo, renal Sirius Red \nstaining\t and\tMasson\t staining\twere\t performed\twhich\t showed\t that\t\nhigh circulating FSH groups (OVX vs. OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice) have \nmore interstitial collagen deposition, whose positive areas increased \napproximately threefold compared to low circulating FSH group \n(OVX\t+\tGnRHa\tmice;\t Figure\t 3e).\tWe\t further\t validated\t the\tmRNA\t\nand protein expression levels of profibrotic factors by quantitative \nRT-PCR\tand\tWestern\tblot\t and\t found\t that\t collagen\t IV,\t fibronectin,\t\nand\tPAI-1\texpression\tlevels\tin\tthe\thigh\tcirculating\tFSH\tgroups\twere\t\nnotably upregulated compared to those in low circulating FSH group \n(Figure 3f–h). These identical alterations were also observed in the \nIHC and IF results (Figure 3i).\n\n2.4\u2003|\u2003The AKT/GSK‐3β/β‐catenin signaling pathway \nwas essential for FSHR‐mediated interstitial fibrosis\n\nSince\thigh\tcirculating\tFSH\tlevels\twere\tfound\tto\tcause\trenal\tECM\t(ex‐\ntracellular matrix) deposition and interstitial fibrosis, we mainly con‐\ncentrated on the signaling pathways that might be involved in renal \nfibrosis\treported\tin\trecent\tliterature.\tWe\tfirst\texamined\tthe\tprotein\t\nchanges\tof\tpAKT\t(Thr308),\tAKT,\tpGSK-3β (Ser9), and GSK‐3β, and \nwe\tfound\tthat\tphosphorylation\tof\tAKT\t(Thr308)\tand\tGSK-3β (Ser9) \nwas increased in OVX and OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice compared with \nthat in OVX + GnRHa mice (Figure 4a), respectively. No significant \nchanges in the corresponding total proteins were observed. The re‐\nsults in HK‐2 cells treated with FSH were consistent with those in \nkidney\t samples\t (Figure\t S5).\t Enhanced\t phosphorylation\t of\t GSK-3β \n(Ser9) led to its own inactivation, causing β-catenin\taccumulation.\tAs\t\nexpected, the protein expression of β‐catenin, a downstream sign‐\naling molecule, increased in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of \nHK-2\t cells\t (Figure\t S5).\t To\t further\t examine\twhether\t the\t activation\t\nof\tAKT\tsignaling\t is\t indispensable\tfor\tFSH-induced\tECM\taccumula‐\ntion,\tLY294002\tand\tMK\t2206,\ttwo\tcommon\tAKT\tpathway\tinhibitors,\t\nwere\tadded\tto\tHK-2\tcells.\tLY294002\tor\tMK\t2206\tcaused\ta\tmarked\t\ninhibition\tof\tphospho-AKT\t(Thr308),\tphospho-GSK-3β (Ser9) phos‐\nphorylation, and a reduction of the β‐catenin level (Figure 4b,c). \nMoreover,\tLY294002\tor\tMK\t2206\treversed\tthe\tfibrotic\tphenotypes\t\ndemonstrated\tby\tWestern\tblot,\twhich\t effectively\t decreased\tFSH-\nstimulated protein levels of collagen IV and fibronectin in HK‐2 cells \n(Figure 4d,e). This was consistent with a reduced expression of col‐\nlagen IV, as assessed by immunofluorescence (Figure 4f). These re‐\nsults\tindicated\tthat\tFSH\tcan\tenhance\tthe\tdownstream\tAKT\tsignaling\t\npathway to inactivate GSK‐3β, followed by β‐catenin accumulation \nand translocation into the nucleus to activate fibrosis‐related genes.\n\nGiven that FSH exerts its biological effect via binding to FSHR, \nwe\tnext\tattempted\tto\tsilence\tFSHR\tfunction\tvia\tthe\tspecific\tsiRNA\t\nto explore whether FSH‐induced fibrogenic action was mediated by \nFSHR. Effective ablation of FSHR was obtained with an approxi‐\nmately twofold decline in the transcriptional and protein expression \nin HK‐2 cells (Figure 4g,h). FSHR knockdown significantly reduced \nFSH-stimulated\t transcription\t and\t protein\t levels\t of\t PAI-1\t and\t fi‐\nbronectin, suggesting that FSH‐mediated renal fibrosis is depen‐\ndent\ton\t functional\tFSHR\t (Figure\t4g,h).\tWe\tnext\t tested\t the\teffect\t\nof\tFSHR\ton\tFSH-induced\tsignaling\ttransduction.\tWestern\tblotting\t\nanalyses revealed that FSHR ablation inhibited FSH‐stimulated \nphosphorylation\tof\tAKT\tand\tGSK-3β, as well as β‐catenin accumu‐\nlation and its nuclear transduction in HK‐2 cells (Figure 4i).

To diminish \nthe potential effect of these two parameters, we used GnRHa‐treated \novariectomized mice administered with recombinant FSH in accor‐\ndance\twith\tseveral\tstudies\t(Li,\tChen,\tet\tal.,\t2017;\tSong\tet\tal.,\t2016).\t\nGiven that kidney injury is a relatively chronic process, we increased \nthe\tdose\tof\tFSH\tfrom\t0.15\tIU\tto\t0.3\tIU\tand\tlengthened\tintervention\t\ntime\t to\t6\tweeks,\twhich\twas\tdifferent\t from\tLiu's\t study\ton\t fat\t accu‐\nmulation.\tConsequently,\t rising\tserum\tFSH\tand\tfalling\tserum\tLH\tand\t\nE2 were all observed in OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice. Under these \n\nconditions, OVX + GnRHa + FSH mice had higher levels of 24‐hr uric \nprotein/creatinine, serum Cr, and serum BUN and presented a more \nobvious\tphenotype\tof\tECM\tdeposition\tby\thistopathology,\tsuggesting\t\nthat FSH was responsible for renal dysfunction and tubulointerstitial \nfibrosis. These results also indirectly eliminated the effect of GnRHa \non\t kidney\t injury\t as\t Gandaglia's\t findings\t reported\t (Gandaglia\t et\t al.,\t\n2014). Interstitial fibrosis exhibited identical manifestations in all pro‐\ngressive forms of chronic kidney disease, although glomerular lesions \nplayed\ta\tspecific\trole\tin\tthe\tpathogenesis\tof\trenal\tdisease\t(Zeisberg\t&\t\nNeilson, 2010). Tubulointerstitial fibrosis seen in ovariectomized mice \nmight be partly attributed to abundant expression of FSHR in the renal \ntubular epithelium. The transition of tubular epithelial cells (TECs) from \nan epithelial phenotype to mesenchymal feature contributed to tub‐\nulointerstitial\tfibrosis\t(Li,\tLi,\tHao,\tLiu,\t&\tDuan,\t2017).\tConsistent\twith\t\nthese findings, FSH treatment significantly increased transcriptional \nand\tprotein\texpression\tof\tfibrogenic\tcytokines\t(PAI-1,\tfibronectin,\tand\t\ncollagen IV) in vitro and in vivo.\n\nFollicle‐stimulating hormone receptor is a member of the G \nprotein‐coupled receptor that is considered as a driver of the ac‐\ntivation of multiple signaling cascades. Emerging evidence from \nstudies\t suggests\t that\t an\t altered\t PI3K/AKT\t signaling\t pathway\t is\t\nhighly linked to the pathogenesis of renal fibrosis. FSH stimulated \nthe\t FSHR-mediated\t PI3K\t pathway,\t leading\t to\t activation\t of\t AKT\t\nand\tdownstream\t targets\t in\tGCs\t (Hunzicker-Dunn\tet\t al.,\t 2012).\tA\t\nreport by Cheryl et al. demonstrated that FSHR interacts with the \nadaptor\tprotein\tAPPL1\tvia\tthe\tPI3K/AKT\tpathway\tto\tpromote\tcell\t\nsurvival in HEK 293 cells in response to FSH treatment (Nechamen \net\tal.,\t2004).\tAs\tshown\tin\tour\tfindings,\tFSH-stimulated\trapid\tAKT\t\n(Thr308) phosphorylation was observed in HK‐2 cells, and the in‐\nhibition\tof\tPI3K/AKT\tsignaling\twith\tLY294002\tor\tMK\t2206,\tor\tthe\t\nsilencing\tof\tFSHR\tby\tsiRNA,\tsignificantly\t reduced\t this\tactivation.\t\nGSK‐3β is believed to exert an anti‐fibrotic effect in multiple organ \nsystems\t (Gong,\tRifai,\tGe,\tChen,\t&\tDworkin,\t2008).\tThe\tenhance‐\nment\t in\t AKT\t phosphorylation\t activates\t GSK-3β by phosphoryla‐\ntion at Ser9, thus leading to changes in activity of GSK‐3β. Further, \nGSK‐3β targets the β‐catenin complex for ubiquitination and pro‐\nteasomal degradation, and the disintegration of this complex con‐\ntributes to β‐catenin accumulation and nuclear translocation, thus \ntriggering\tfibroblast\tactivation\tand\tfibrogenesis\t(Hwang,\tSeo,\t&\tHa,\t\n2009). FSH promoted the phosphorylation of GSK‐3β and β‐cat‐\nenin\ttranslocation\tinto\tthe\tnucleus,\tand\tLY294002\tor\tMK\t2206,\tor\t\nFSHR\tsiRNA\tpowerfully\tblocked\tGSK-3β/ β‐catenin signaling and \nlessened the expression of profibrotic proteins mediated by FSH, \nsuch as fibronectin and collagen IV.\n\nNumerous evidence has suggested that macrophages have cru‐\ncial\troles\tin\tthe\tprogression\tof\tfibrosis\t(Wynn,\t2011).\tMacrophages\t\nhave 2 distinct subtypes participating in this process: classically \nactivated\t (M1)\t and\t alternatively\t activated\t (M2)\t macrophages.\tM1\t\nmacrophages generally infiltrated and presented profibrotic activity \nby releasing toxic factors that can aggravate tissue injury, such as \nROS, iNOS, TNF‐α,\t and\t IL-1β\t (Wynn\t&\tBarron,\t 2010).\t Indeed,\twe\t\nfound that FSH triggered classical macrophage activation in vitro, \n\n\n\n\u2003\u2002 \u2003 | \u20039 of 12ZHANG et Al.\n\nwhich was characterized by increased transcriptional levels of proin‐\nflammatory factors. Interestingly, damaged epithelial cells and en‐\ndothelial cells per se secrete a series of chemotactic cytokines that \ncan\t recruit\t macrophages\t to\t the\t site\t of\t diseased\t tissue\t (Wynn\t &\t\nRamalingam,\t2012).\tIL-8\tis\twell\tbelieved\tto\tbe\ta\tkey\tchemotactic\tcy‐\ntokine,\twhich\tis\tinvolved\tin\tthe\trecruitment\tof\tmonocyte\t(Meniailo\tet\t\nal.,\t2018).\tProfibrotic\tmediators\tsuch\tas\tTGF-β induced proximal tu‐\nbular\tcells\tto\tsecrete\tIL-8,\tand\tits\tproduction\twas\tmarkedly\tenhanced\t\nin urine proteins obtained from patients with tubular injury (Huang, \nWen,\tZhou,\t&\tYu,\t2008;\tQi\tet\tal.,\t2006;\tSinghto\t&\tThongboonkerd,\t\n2018). In our results, FSH‐treated HK‐2 cells resulted in the produc‐\ntion\tof\tchemokine\tIL-8,\twhich,\tin\tturn,\tinduced\tFSHR-mediated\tmac‐\nrophage migration.\n\nIn conclusion, we have identified that FSH promoted renal dys‐\nfunction\tand\ttubulointerstitial\tfibrosis\tvia\tthe\tAKT/GSK-3β/β‐catenin \npathway in HK‐2 cells. FSH also activated macrophage polarization \nand recruited macrophages to exacerbate renal injury.
