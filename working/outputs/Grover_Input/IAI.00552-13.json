The conformational state of the translocated substrates within the bacterial cell is\nunknown, so we sought to determine if folded substrates could be translocated via this system. Fusions of L. pneumophila Icm/\nDot-translocated substrates (IDTS) to dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) or ubiquitin (Ub), small proteins known to fold rapidly,\nresulted in proteins with low translocation efficiencies. The folded moieties did not cause increased aggregation of the IDTS and\ndid not impede interaction with the adaptor protein complex IcmS/IcmW, which is thought to form a soluble complex that pro-\nmotes translocation. The translocation defect was alleviated with a Ub moiety harboring mutations known to destabilize its\nstructure, indicating that unfolded proteins are preferred substrates. Real-time analysis of translocation, following movement\nduring the first 30 min after bacterial contact with host cells, revealed that the folded moiety caused a kinetic defect in IDTS\ntranslocation. Expression of an IDTS fused to a folded moiety interfered with the translocation of other IDTS, consistent with it\ncausing a blockage of the translocation channel. Furthermore, the folded protein fusions also interfered with intracellular\ngrowth, consistent with inefficient or impaired translocation of proteins critical for L. pneumophila intracellular growth. These\nstudies indicate that substrates of the Icm/Dot T4SS are translocated to the host cytosol in an unfolded conformation and that\nfolded proteins are stalled within the translocation channel, impairing the function of the secretion system.\n\nLegionella pneumophila is a pathogen of amoebae that grows inan intravacuolar niche in these cells (1–4). Upon aerosol-\nization of contaminated water supplies, inhalation of L. pneu-\nmophila and subsequent internalization by alveolar macro-\nphages lead to disease (2, 5, 6). The bacterium replicates within\na membrane-bound vacuole in macrophages that is identical to\nthe replication compartment found in amoebae (7). Formation\nof the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) requires a func-\ntional type IV secretion system (T4SS) known as the Icm/Dot\ncomplex (8, 9), which transports a massive collection of effec-\ntors into the host cytosol. To date, over 275 of these protein\nsubstrates have been identified (10–19). Shortly after internal-\nization of the bacteria into either macrophages or amoebae,\nmitochondria and markers of the endoplasmic reticulum are\nrecruited to the LCV to establish a vacuole that allows replica-\ntion before the cell lyses, releasing bacteria into the extracellu-\nlar milieu for a second round of infection (20–22).\n\nType IV secretion systems (T4SS) are utilized by a wide variety\nof Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria to translocate effec-\ntor molecules across the bacterial membrane. This diverse group\nof secretion complexes is defined by ancestral relatedness to bac-\nterial conjugation machines that are able to translocate nucleic\nacids, proteins, and nucleoprotein complexes (23–26). T4SS can\nbe broadly classified into two subgroups based on similarity to the\narchetypal Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 (VirB/D4)\ncomplex (24). Type IVA systems (T4ASS) share significant simi-\nlarity to the VirB/D4 system and can be found in pathogens such\nas Helicobacter pylori and Brucella abortus (24, 25). The type IVB\nsystems (T4BSS) are distinct from the VirB/D4 system and are best\nrepresented by Legionella species and Coxiella burnetii (24, 25, 27,\n28). Although sequence similarities may be limited between the\nT4ASS and T4BSS members, there is evidence for functional con-\nservation between these two subclasses as both appear to have core\n\nprotein components that form a complex spanning the inner and\nouter membranes of Gram-negative organisms (29–31). In addi-\ntion, each has a coupling ATPase complex, which is thought to act\nas a receptor for translocated substrates, transferring them to\nother components of the secretion system as a first step in transit\nto target cells (32).\n\nIn L. pneumophila, the earliest steps in the translocation pro-\ncess involve interactions between the Icm/Dot-translocated sub-\nstrate (IDTS) and the IcmS/IcmW chaperone (33, 34), which is a\nsoluble heteromeric component of the (IcmS/W) apparatus. As\nIcmS/W associates with the coupling ATPase complex DotL/\nDotM/DotN, it is likely that this five-member multiprotein com-\nplex presents translocated substrates to core secretion system\ncomponents that span the bacterial envelope. Inactivating muta-\ntions in IcmS or IcmW result in highly reduced efficiencies of\ntranslocation of most IDTSs although a subset appears to translo-\ncate into host cells independently of this chaperone. It is likely that\nstructural determinants control the dependence on IcmS/W for\ntranslocation of a protein and that IDTSs are capable of interact-\ning directly with the secretion system in the absence of the chap-\nerone. The critical components of the translocated substrates that\nallow Icm/Dot recognition are still somewhat obscure although it\nis clear that each IDTS contains a carboxyl-terminal signal of less\n\nReceived 2 May 2013 Returned for modification 2 June 2013\nAccepted 13 June 2013\n\nPublished ahead of print 24 June 2013\n\nEditor: A.

Both short polar amino acids and a glutamate-rich\nregion appear to be common sequence determinants for this sig-\nnal (13, 19, 35). The proteins that recognize this signal and target\nthe protein to the complex are not known.\n\nIn many secretion systems, there are determinants other than\nthe recognition signal that are required for successful movement\nthrough the membrane. In Escherichia coli, chimeric proteins that\nfused secretion signal sequences onto normally cytoplasmic pro-\nteins resulted in “jamming” of the secretion apparatus, presum-\nably by entry of an impassable substrate into the secretion channel\n(36). Similarly, translocation of proteins from the cytosol into\nmitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes can all be blocked by\nintroduction of tightly folded protein moieties into coding se-\nquences, consistent with there being a secretion-competent con-\nformation required for translocation (37–39). The necessity of a\nsecretion-competent conformation, however, does not appear ev-\nident in many systems, such as the bacterial twin-arginine trans-\nlocation (Tat) pathway and the eukaryotic peroxisomal import\npathway, in which the insertion of folded domains has no effect on\ntranslocation (40–42).\n\nSpecialized bacterial secretion systems that deliver proteins to\ntarget cells provide a very special problem for maintaining a secre-\ntion-competent conformation. The translocated substrates of\nthese systems are often synthesized and stored prior to contact of\nbacteria with their secretion targets, and a large bolus of protein\nmust be injected via these systems quickly. In spite of these issues,\nthere is evidence that a tightly folded moiety interferes with trans-\nlocation of type III secretion substrates, either because it is rejected\nby the complex or jams the apparatus (43, 44). There is also some\nevidence that in the case of some proteins, the secretion apparatus\nitself can unfold a substrate, converting a nontranslocatable form\ninto a secretion-competent conformation (45, 46). In contrast,\nlittle is known regarding the tertiary structure of T4SS substrates,\nand structural analysis of the T4ASS core complex does not nec-\nessarily demand that substrates be unfolded prior to entering into\nthe channel (30, 47). In this study, we investigate whether the L.\npneumophila Icm/Dot system can tolerate substrates containing\ndomains known to poison secretion by other translocation appa-\nratuses. The results obtained are consistent with the presence of\nconformational states that interfere with efficient translocation.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains, plasmids, and cell culture. All bacterial strains and\nplasmids used in this work are listed in Table 1. All PCR primers used in\nthis work are available from the authors. Growth medium for L. pneumo-\nphila was as described previously (8, 48). For L. pneumophila, chloram-\nphenicol was used at a concentration of 20 �g/ml. For E. coli strains,\nantibiotics were used at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 40 �g/\nml; ampicillin, 100 �g/ml; and chloramphenicol, 30 �g/ml.\n\nL. pneumophila strain Lp02 (thyA-hsdR rpsL) (49), a thymine (Thy)-\nauxotrophic derivative of the Philadelphia-1 isolate, was used as the wild\ntype in experiments. Lp03 (Lp02 dotA03) was used as a translocation-\ndeficient control where indicated (49). The icmS deletion mutant (Lp02\n�icmS) was generated as previously described (50).\n\nAll CyaA fusions were constructed by cloning IDTS open reading frames\n(ORFs) into pJB2581 (51). Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) fusions were\nconstructed by inserting the coding sequence of Mus musculus dhfr (GenBank\nNM_010049.3) into pJB2581, in between the cyaA and IDTS sequences unless\notherwise indicated. Fusions were generated using splicing by overlap exten-\nsion PCR (SOE-PCR). Ubiquitin fusions were constructed similarly to those\n\nwith DHFR, using the 67-amino-acid monomer of ubi4p from Saccharomyces\ncerevisiae S288c (NM_001181859.1). FLAG-tagged fusions were constructed\nby adding FLAG sequence (ATG-GATTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAG)\nto the amino terminus of IDTS ORFs by PCR and cloning into pJB908.\nThe glutathione S-transferase (GST)-IcmS/IcmW plasmid (pJB5809) was\na generous gift of J. Vogel, Washington University, St. Louis, MO.\n\nThe U937 cell line (ATCC CRL-1593.2) was passaged and differenti-\nated as described previously (8). HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-11268) were\ngrown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 4.5g/\nliter D-glucose (catalog number 11995; Invitrogen-Gibco) supplemented\nwith 10% heat-inactivated HyClone fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo\nScientific). Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were\nprepared from the femurs of female A/J mice (Jackson Laboratories) ac-\ncording to a previously published protocol (52) and cultivated in RPMI\n1640 medium supplemented with glutamate (Invitrogen-Gibco) and 10%\nheat-inactivated FBS (Gibco). All manipulations with animals were ap-\nproved by the Tufts University IACUC, and the research approach was\napproved the Tufts University Institutional Biosafety Review Board.\n\nCyaA translocation assay. Translocation assays using CyaA protein\nfusions were adapted from previous protocols (51). Unless otherwise in-\ndicated, L. pneumophila was grown overnight in AYE [N-(2-acetamido)-\n2-aminoethanesulfonic acid-buffered yeast extract] broth with appropri-\nate additives to exponential phase (A600 of �2.2 to 2.4, with less than 10%\nof the bacteria motile). CyaA protein expression was induced with 200\n�M isopropyl-�-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and incubated for an\nadditional 3 to 5 h until late exponential phase (A600 �3.2 to 3.6 with more\nthan 50% motility). A total of 2.5 � 106 phorbol ester-differentiated U937\ncells were incubated in 24-well plates and challenged with L. pneumophila\nstrains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. After a 1-h incubation\nwith bacteria (unless otherwise indicated), U937 cells were washed three\ntimes with warm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and extracts were pre-\npared by the addition of 200 �l of lysis buffer (50 mM HCl, 0.1% Triton\nX-100) and incubation on ice for 10 min. Lysates were collected, boiled for\n5 min, and then neutralized by the addition of 12 �l of 0.5 M NaOH.\nProtein was precipitated by adding 400 �l of cold 95% ethanol (EtOH)\nand incubated at �20°C for at least 5 min. Insoluble material was removed\nby centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 rpm. Supernatants were dried and\nresuspended in assay buffer, and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration\nwas measured in extracts diluted 1:500 using a GE Healthcare Life Sci-\nences Biotrak cAMP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit\n(RPN225). Data were normalized to the amount of the housekeeping\nprotein isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) or the Icm/Dot system protein\nDotF to determine bacterial load, and data were expressed as a ratio of the\ncyclase reaction rate relative to the steady-state levels of CyaA reporter\nfusions in each well, as determined by Western blotting of bacterial ly-\nsates. Data are presented as fmol/well/[fusion protein].\n\nAntibodies used in this work. For detection of cyclase fusions by\nWestern blotting probing, anti-CyaA (3D1) mouse monoclonal IgG\n(Santa Cruz) was used at a concentration of 1:15,000 diluted in 5% milk\nwith a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\nsecondary antibody used at a concentration of 1:10,000. For detection\nusing the FLA-9000 developer, anti-CyaA was used at a concentration of\n1:5,000 diluted in NAP (non-animal protein) Blocker (GBiosciences)\nwith a Cy5-goat anti-mouse IgG at a concentration of 1:10,000 or Cy3-\ngoat anti-mouse IgG at a concentration of 1:5,000 (Invitrogen). Serum\nspecific for Bacillus subtilis isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) was gener-\nously provided by A. L. Sonenshein, Tufts University Medical School,\nBoston, MA.\n\nReal-time assay of translocation rate. A GloSensor cAMP assay\n(TM076; Promega) was adapted for the real-time analysis of translocation\nusing L. pneumophila harboring CyaA fusions. Two days prior to infec-\ntion, 293T cells were resuspended at a density of 1.5 � 105 cells/ml in a\nsolid white 96-well plate (Costar 3917) and incubated overnight. The next\nday, cells were transfected with pGloSensor20F cAMP plasmid (E1171;\nPromega) at a concentration of 12.5 ng/�l, as well as with a plasmid\n\nAmyot et al.\n\n3240 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nexpressing Fc�RIIA at a concentration of 18.75 ng/�l, using FuGENE HD,\naccording to the manufacturer’s instructions. After 24 h of incubation, the\nmedium was carefully removed from the 293T cells and replaced with 200\n�l of GloSensor cAMP reagent (E1290; Promega) equilibration medium\n(88% CO2-independent medium [Invitrogen 18045], 10% FBS, 2 to 3%\n[vol/vol] freshly thawed cAMP reagent) supplemented with 100 �g/ml\nthymidine and 200 �M IPTG, as necessary. The cells were incubated for 1\nh further at 37°C prior to challenge at an MOI of 10 with bacteria that were\ndiluted in opsonizing medium (CO2-independent medium, 10% FBS, 100\n�g/ml Thy, 200 �M IPTG, and anti-Legionella antibody [1:1,000]). The\nwells containing the opsonized bacteria were subjected to 5 min of cen-\ntrifugation at 1,000 rpm and immediately placed in a luminescence plate\nreader preheated to 37°C. Luminescence measurements were taken every\n\n2 min for up to 1 h. As a positive control, forskolin, an activator of adenylyl\ncyclase, was added at a concentration of 10 �M. Data were recorded as\nrelative light units, after the subtraction of background from wells that\nwere not incubated with the cAMP reagent.\n\nDetermination of DHFR enzymatic activity. DHFR activity of the\nCyaA-IDTS fusions was measured with a colorimetric assay based on the\nNADPH-dependent reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic\nacid. For measurement of DHFR activity, 100-ml overnight cultures of L.\npneumophila expressing IDTS fusions to murine DHFR were pelleted,\nresuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mM\nEDTA, 50 �g/ml DNase, 200 �g/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitor cocktail\n[Roche]), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were lysed by three\nfreeze-thaw cycles, alternating 1- to 2-min incubations in liquid nitrogen,\n\nTABLE 1 Strains and plasmids used in this study\n\nStrain or plasmid Genotype or relevant characteristic(s)a Oligonucleotide(s)\nReference\nor source\n\nStrains\nL. pneumophila\n\nLp01 Philadelphia-1 rpsL hsdR 8\nLp02 Philadelphia-1 rpsL hsdR thyA mutant 8\nLp03 Lp02 dotA03 8\nLp02 �icmS 62\n\nE. coli\nDH5� \t� \n80dlacZ�M15 �(lacZYA-argF)U169 recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rK\n\n� mK\n�)\n\nsupE44 thi-1 gyrA relA1\nPlasmids\n\npJB908 pMMB66EH oriRSF1010 oriT bla td�i 66\npJB2581 cyaA in pJB908-td�i, Cmr 49\npCyaA-DHFR pJB2581 dhfr� 35, 36 This study\npCyaA-MavU pJB2581 mavU 63, 58 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU pCyaA dhfr mavU 63, 64, 65, 58 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C50) pJB2581 mavU(348-end) 44, 45 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C50) pCyaA dhfr mavU(348-end) 44, 45 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C186) pJB2581 mavU(212-end) This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C186) pCyaA dhfr mavU(212-end) 63, 58, 71, 72 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C118) pJB2581 mavU(280-end) This study\npCyaA-DHFR-MavU(C118) pCyaA dhfr mavU(280-end) 63, 58, 73, 74 This study\npCyaA-MavU(C78) pJB2581 mavU(320-end) This study\npCyaA-DHFR-Mavu(C78) pCyaA dhfr mavU(320-end) 64, 58, 75, 76 This study\npMavU pJB908 mavU 99, 58 This study\npCyaA-SidG pJB2581 sidG 60, 54b This study\npCyaA-DHFR-SidG pCyaA dhfr sidG 60, 54b This study\npJB-CyaA-RalF pJB2581 ralF 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-RalF pCyaA dhfr ralF 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-LidA pJB2581 lidA 25, 31 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-LidA pCyaA dhfr lidA 25, 31, 17, 18, 20, 21 This study\npCyaA-SidC pJB2581 sidC 7, 10 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-SidC pCyaA dhfr sidC 7, 10 This study\npCyaA-VIpD pJB2581 vipD 22, 24 This study\npCyaA-DHFR-VipD pCyaA dhfr vipD 22, 24 This study\npCyaA-Ub pJB2581 ubi4p 93, 95 This study\npCyaA-Ub(G3,13) pJB2581 ubi4p(G3,13) 94, 95 This study\npCyaA-Ub-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p ralF 93, 95, 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-Ub(G3,13)-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p(G3,13) ralF 94, 95, 66, 67 This study\npCyaA-Ub(V76)-RalF pJB2581 ubi4p(V76) ralF 108, 95 This study\npFLAG-SidG pJB908 FLAG-sidG 104b, 43 This study\npFLAG-SidG(Cterm) pJB908 FLAG-sidG(936-end) 43 This study\npFLAG-MavU pJB908 FLAG-mavU 110 This study\npFLAG-RalF pJB908 FLAG-ralF 109 This study\npJB5809 pGST-IcmS/W J.

Cell debris was cleared by centrifugation at\n15,000 � g at 4°C for 30 min. Total protein in the extracts was quantified\nusing a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) according to standard protocols.\n\nFor each reaction, 100 �l of protein extracts (0.5 to 1.0 mg of total\nprotein) was incubated in assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mM\nNaCl, 5 mM �-mercaptoethanol) containing 100 �M �-2=-NADPH\n(Sigma) and 100 �M dihydrofolic acid (Sigma). In each reaction mixture,\n100 �M trimethoprim (TMP) or 100 �M methotrexate (MTX) was\nadded. The substrate (dihydrofolic acid) was then added, the reaction\nsolution was mixed by inverting the cuvette several times; the A340 was\nmeasured immediately and every 15 s thereafter for 3 min. Purified mam-\nmalian DHFR (1.5 � 10�3 units) was used as a positive control. Specific\nactivity in �mol/min/mg of protein is calculated by the following formula:\nunits/mg protein � [(�OD/minsample) � (�OD/minblank)]/ε(mM\n\n�1\n\ncm�1)V (mg protein/ml), where ε is 12.3, V is the volume of enzyme (ml),\nand mg protein/ml is the enzyme concentration of the original sample. To\nnormalize specific activity to the DHFR present in the fusions, steady-\nstate levels of DHFR were determined by Western blotting to obtain pro-\ntein amounts. Quantification by densitometry compared to a standard\ncurve made from serial dilutions of pure DHFR on the same immunoblot\nwas used to determine protein concentrations.\n\nCyclase assay on bacterial cultures. A total of 1 � 108 bacteria of each\nculture were pelleted at 8,000 rpm for 5 min, resuspended in 190 �l of lysis\nbuffer (60 mM Tris [pH 8], 10 mM MgCl2, 50 �M CaCl2, 50 �g/ml\nDNase, 200 �g/ml lysozyme, protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and\nincubated on ice for 45 min. Samples were lysed by three freeze-thaw\ncycles, alternating 1 to 2 min incubations in liquid nitrogen, and a 37°C\nwater bath. In both lysed and unlysed samples, cell debris was cleared by\ncentrifugation at 15,000 � g at 4°C for 5 min. For the reaction mixture,\n100 �l of supernatant was mixed with 1 mM ATP in 50 mM Tris and 50\n�M CaCl2; 10 �M calmodulin (CaM) was added to each tube, and reac-\ntion mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 5 to 30 min before reactions were\nstopped with 2� stop buffer (100 �M HCl– 0.2% Triton X-100) and\nboiling for 5 min, followed by neutralization with 12 �l of 0.5 M NaOH.\nProtein was precipitated with 400 �l of ice-cold 95% EtOH and incubated\nat �20°C for at least 5 min. Extracts were dried under vacuum and mixed\nwith assay buffer, and cAMP concentration was measured as for all cyclase\nassays. Data were normalized to the expression of CyaA fusions as deter-\nmined by steady-state levels of lysates on a Western blot and displayed as\nfmol/[fusion protein].\n\nQuantification of protein aggregation. Overnight cultures of L. pneu-\nmophila harboring fusion proteins were grown as for cyclase assays. A\ntotal of 2.5 � 109 bacteria were pelleted at 10,000 � g for 5 min, resus-\npended in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA [pH\n8.0], 50 �g/ml DNase, 200 �g/ml lysozyme, and protease inhibitor cock-\ntail [Roche]), and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were lysed as\ndescribed for bacterial cyclase assays. Cellular debris was separated by a\nslow centrifugation at 3,000 � g for 1 min. The pellets were resuspended in\n500 �l 2� sample buffer and saved. Total protein samples were obtained\nby mixing 80 �l of supernatant with 20 �l of 5� sample buffer. To pre-\ncipitate proteins, 800 �l of supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at\n�100,000 � g for 1 h. Pellets (aggregated proteins) were resuspended in\n400 �l of 2� sample buffer, and 160 �l of supernatant was mixed with 40\n�l of 5� sample buffer. All samples were boiled, and the equivalent of\n2.5 � 107 cells for each sample was separated by SDS-PAGE. CyaA-IDTS\nprotein in each sample was detected using antibody against CyaA and\nquantified by densitometry. Percent aggregation was expressed as the\namount of protein in the pellet fractions relative to the total protein.\n\nCopurification of the IDTS and IcmS/W complex. E. coli DH5� was\ntransformed with the plasmid pJB5809, encoding GST-IcmS-IcmW (J.\nVogel, Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and a second plasmid that\nencodes a FLAG-tagged IDTS. A plasmid expressing GST without IcmS/\nIcmW was used as a control. Overnight cultures (500 ml) were grown in\nLB medium supplemented with kanamycin and carbenicillin. Protein ex-\npression was induced by the addition of 0.5 M IPTG, and cells were incu-\n\nbated at 30°C for 3 h with slow shaking. Cultures were harvested by cen-\ntrifugation at 10,000 � g for 15 min at 4°C, and pellets were resuspended\nin 10 ml of PBS (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl2, 50 �g/ml DNase, 1 mM dithio-\nthreitol (DTT), and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), followed by lys-\ning with a French press. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at\n15,000 � g for 15 min at 4°C, and cleared lysates were incubated with 0.5\nml of glutathione beads for 2 h at 4°C. Columns were washed three times\nwith cold wash buffer (PBS [pH 7.4], 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and\nprotease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]). Bound GST-IcmS/IcmW and asso-\nciated proteins were eluted with four 0.75-ml aliquots of 10 mM reduced\nglutathione in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0).

Differentiated\nU937 cells were plated in a six-well tissue culture dish at a density of 1.5 �\n107 cells/well. L. pneumophila strains were cultured as for other transloca-\ntion assays and used to challenge U937 cells at an MOI of 5. After 1.5 h,\nwells were washed three times with warm medium to remove nonassoci-\nated bacteria. Cells were lifted by pipetting up and down in 2 to 3 ml of\nPBS, pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 rpm, resuspended in 200\n�l of PBS containing 0.5% digitonin and protease inhibitor cocktail\n(Roche), and incubated for 20 min with rotation at room temperature.\nThe detergent lysate was separated by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15\nmin at 4°C. Supernatant, representing the detergent soluble fraction, was\nmixed with 5� sample buffer and boiled. Pellets were further solubilized\nin 2% SDS and mixed with 2� sample buffer.\n\nIntracellular growth assay. Bone marrow-derived macrophages\n(BMDM) from A/J mice were replated on glass coverslips in a 24-well\nplate at 2 � 105 cells per well. Postexponential phase L. pneumophila was\nused to challenge cells at an MOI of 1, and plates were subjected to cen-\ntrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 rpm to promote bacterial association with\ncells. After 2 h, cells were washed with RPMI medium, and growth was\nallowed to proceed for an additional 12 h. Coverslips were washed in PBS,\nfixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min, and blocked in 4% goat serum\nin PBS. After samples were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, bac-\nteria were stained by anti-L. pneumophila rat serum and secondary anti-\nrat Texas Red (1:500) (Invitrogen). The number of intracellular bacteria\nin individual phagosomes was counted by visual inspection under a mi-\ncroscope for 150 to 300 cells.\n\nRESULTS\nFusion of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) to Icm/Dot-translo-\ncated substrates interferes with translocation. The fusion of se-\ncreted proteins to DHFR, a rapidly folding enzyme that can be\nstabilized in its folded conformation with folate analogs, is com-\nmonly used to monitor whether proteins can be secreted or trans-\nlocated in a folded state (33, 37–39, 43, 53). To analyze if translo-\ncation via the Legionella pneumophila Icm/Dot type IVB secretion\nsystem can occur in the presence of folded substrates, fusions of\nseveral Icm/Dot-translocated substrates (IDTSs) to the carboxyl\nterminus of the murine DHFR were constructed. We chose four\ndifferent substrates to analyze. RalF and SidG were interrogated\nbecause there is considerable information regarding the nature of\nthe C-terminal translocation signals of these proteins as well as the\neffects of the mature protein sequences on translocation efficiency\n(34, 54). MavU was chosen because in a previous study we found\nthat its C-terminal signal was one of the most effective targeting\nsequences identified among the IDTSs, so we wanted to determine\nif a high-efficiency signal could overcome deficits caused by the\npresence of a folded domain (13). Finally, we wanted to investigate\nwhether the introduction of a folded domain internal to an IDTS\ncould have different effects from placing the domain upstream\n\nAmyot et al.\n\n3242 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nfrom the complete coding sequence. For this reason, we used\nLidA, because in previous studies we had identified important\njunctions between domains in the protein that we thought would\nlikely tolerate added sequences (55).\n\nTo detect translocation, each construction was tagged with the\ncalmodulin-dependent adenylyl cyclase enzymatic domain en-\ncoded by the Bordetella pertussis cyaA gene (Fig. 1A; Table 1).\nProduction of cAMP by these constructions requires transloca-\ntion into eukaryotic cells as bacteria do not express calmodulin\n(56). Expression of these CyaA constructs was induced by the\naddition of IPTG to cultures of the wild-type L. pneumophila\nstrain Lp02, and the bacteria were used to challenge the human\nmacrophage-like cell line U937. The translocation efficiency of\neach protein fusion into target U937 cells was quantified as intra-\ncellular cAMP produced by the CyaA-IDTS fusions, normalized\nto relative steady-state levels of the fusion within each strain (see\nMaterials and Methods) (13).\n\nEach of the IDTSs tested exhibited translocation defects when\nfused to DHFR (Fig. 1B), with each DHFR fusion showing trans-\nlocation levels that were between 8-fold (for DHFR-MavU) and\n40-fold (for DHFR-LidA) lower than the comparable fusions lack-\n\ning the DHFR moiety. In the case of DHFR-LidA, it appeared that\nDHFR totally blocked translocation; its translocation efficiency\nwas no greater than that observed with a mutant strain (dotA)\ncontaining a defective type IV system unable to translocate IDTS\n(Fig. 1B).\n\nInterestingly, the CyaA protein that was not fused to any IDTS\nstill translocated at levels �5-fold higher in a wild-type strain than\nin a dotA mutant background (Fig. 1B), and this level was higher\nthan what we observed with wild-type strains harboring the\nDHFR-LidA fusion. The CyaA construction had a short tail added\nto its carboxyl-terminal end to facilitate construction of the fu-\nsions, and this may have acted as a cryptic signal since the identical\nconstruction lacking this short carboxyl-terminal sequence\nshowed translocation levels as low as those of the dotA control (J.\nVogel, personal communication). This leakage through the Icm/\nDot complex was abolished when CyaA was fused to DHFR, indi-\ncating that the DHFR moiety alone is inhibitory to translocation\nthrough the Icm/Dot complex even when a cryptic translocation\nsignal is present in a protein (Fig. 1B).\n\nThere was considerable translocation of the protein having a\nDHFR fusion to MavU, presumably due to the extremely effective\nC-terminal signal, so we tested whether the relatively high levels of\ntranslocation were due to protein structure or the nature of the\nsignal. To this end, serial amino-terminal deletions of the L. pneu-\nmophila IDTS MavU (Lpg1798) were constructed to selectively\nremove domains in the protein. MavU is a 398-amino-acid pro-\ntein predicted to contain a Rho-GTPase-activating protein\n(RhoGAP) domain and a coiled-coil region (Fig. 2A). Therefore,\ntruncations were made immediately downstream of the RhoGAP\ndomain (Fig. 2, C186), flanking the predicted coiled-coil domain\n(C118 and C78), and just upstream of the predicted disordered\ncarboxyl terminus (C50) (Fig. 2A; Table 1). CyaA fusions to these\ntruncated proteins were all similarly expressed, and all exhibited\ntranslocation efficiencies that were similar to the translocation\nefficiency of the full-length MavU (Fig. 2B and C, black bars).\nTranslocation of each of the truncated proteins fused to DHFR\nwas then determined relative to the amount of full-length steady-\nstate protein found on gels (see Materials and Methods). All of\nthese DHFR fusion proteins were translocated at similar levels and\nshowed similar levels of defects, consistent with the idea that a\nspecific protein structure cannot ameliorate DHFR-mediated\ntranslocation defects (Fig. 2C). The observation that translocation\nof CyaA-DHFR-MavU(C50), encoding only the C-terminal 50\namino acids of MavU, was similar to that of the full-length MavU-\nDHFR fusion indicates that the sensitivity of an IDTS to translo-\ncation inhibition resulting from insertion of the DHFR moiety\ndoes not depend on the size of the hybrid protein but may be\nconnected to the efficiency at which the C-terminal signal can\nallow recognition by the Icm/Dot translocation system.\n\nThe DHFR moiety in IDTS fusions is enzymatically active. In\nmany of the previous studies examining the effects of protein fold-\ning on secretion, a DHFR inhibitor such as methotrexate (MTX),\nwhich inhibits both mammalian and bacterial proteins, was nec-\nessary to stabilize the DHFR in a folded conformation (37). As\nDHFR blocked IDTS translocation in the absence of MTX, we\ntested whether the inhibitor would cause further depression of\ntranslocation and whether the enzyme was folded in an active\nconfirmation, consistent with its ability to block translocation. As\nexpected, MTX had no effect on the growth in culture of the thy\nmutant strain used in these studies (data not shown). Further-\n\nFIG 1 Insertion of DHFR interferes with translocation.

For fu-\nsions containing the DHFR moiety, DHFR was fused to the carboxyl terminus\nof CyaA immediately upstream of an IDTS or translocation signal. (B) The\npresence of DHFR inhibits translocation. Translocation levels of the IDTS\nwere quantified by measuring intracellular cAMP levels resulting from CyaA.\nThe wild-type L. pneumophila strain Lp02 (black and gray bars) or the trans-\nlocation-defective dotA strain (striped bar) expressing the indicated CyaA pro-\ntein fusions was used to challenge U937 cells.

This raised the possibility that the DHFR moiety was not\nassuming the conformation of the native active protein in these\nprotein fusions. Therefore, to determine whether DHFR placed\nwithin the chimeric proteins was in its native folded form, we\ntested if the derivatives were enzymatically active.\n\nDHFR activity of the CyaA-IDTS fusions was measured using a\ncolorimetric assay that detects the NADPH-dependent reduction\nof dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid (Fig. 3A) (see Materials\nand Methods). Cell lysates of L. pneumophila expressing CyaA-\n\nDHFR-IDTS fusions were incubated with NADPH and dihydro-\nfolic acid, and the accumulation of tetrahydrofolate was measured\n(see Materials and Methods). To determine the specific activity,\nthe rate of hydrolysis as a function of protein concentration was\ndetermined by quantitating the amount of fusion protein ex-\npressed for each sample (see Materials and Methods) (Fig. 3B).\nTrimethoprim was added to eliminate the endogenous L. pneu-\nmophila DHFR activity as, unlike MTX (57), this antibiotic inhib-\nits the prokaryotic protein specifically and has no effect on the\nmammalian DHFR present in the fusions (Fig. 2C). The specific\nactivities of DHFR in the protein fusions were comparable to\nthose of purified DHFR, consistent with proper folding of this\nmoiety (Fig. 2C). As expected, no activity was seen in a CyaA-\nIDTS fusion that did not have DHFR, and the enzymatic activity in\n\nFIG 2 Serial truncations of MavU fused to DHFR exhibit equivalent defects in\ntranslocation competence.

The data are con-\nsistent with a folded protein moiety causing defective substrate\ntranslocation.\n\nDHFR does not interfere with cyclase activity or increase ag-\ngregation of the chimeric proteins. One complication of using\nCyaA fusions is that the assay is contingent on the enzymatic ac-\ntivity of the CyaA moiety being unaffected by the IDTS sequence.\nTherefore, it was necessary to exclude the possibility that the pres-\nence of DHFR inhibits adenylate cyclase activity. A modified, in\nvitro version of the CyaA translocation assay was established to\nquantify the enzymatic activity of CyaA-DHFR-IDTS fusions rel-\native to the respective CyaA-IDTS. L. pneumophila cultures were\ngrown to late exponential phase, induced to express the CyaA\nconstructs, and lysed. The supernatants of the bacterial lysates\nwere incubated for 30 min in the presence of calmodulin and the\nadenylate cyclase substrate ATP, and the resulting cAMP produc-\ntion was measured via ELISA (see Materials and Methods). No\nsignificant difference was observed in the CyaA activities of any of\nthe protein fusions, regardless of DHFR, confirming that DHFR is\nnot inhibiting the activity of the marker enzyme (Fig. 4A). Similar\ndata were seen when the incubation period was shortened to 5\nmin, indicating that the longer reaction time did not overload the\nsystem (data not shown). Background levels of cAMP produced\nby L. pneumophila not expressing any CyaA fusion and a reaction\nmixture lacking calmodulin confirmed that adenylate cyclase ac-\ntivity was due to the B. pertussis CyaA. The culture supernatant\nfrom a strain that was not lysed also did not produce significant\nlevels of cAMP, consistent with previous research showing that\nIcm/Dot secretion occurs only after contact with a host cell (58).\nThese data are consistent with the DHFR moiety having no effect\non cyclase activity, with the caveat that it is possible that after\ntranslocation into host cells, the folding properties of the translo-\ncated substrate may differ significantly from that observed in bac-\nterial extracts.\n\nWe next determined if DHFR hinders translocation by causing\naggregation of the fusions. To compare aggregation of DHFR fu-\nsions and IDTS alone, we lysed cells and compared the relative\namounts of soluble and pelleted protein after high-speed centrif-\nugation. The presence of substrate proteins in postcentrifugation\nfractions was visualized via immunoblots probed with anti-CyaA\n(Fig. 4B) (see Materials and Methods). The percentage of aggre-\ngation was determined as the amount of CyaA fusion protein that\nprecipitated after high-speed centrifugation relative to the total\nprotein retrieved, as quantified by densitometry of the immuno-\nblots. In all strains tested, no significant difference in aggregation\nwas seen between the IDTS fusions in the presence or absence of\nDHFR, demonstrating that DHFR does not cause protein aggre-\ngation (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, a majority of the protein remained\nsoluble after centrifugation in the strains expressing RalF and\nMavU fusions, but in the strains expressing SidG fusions, nearly all\nprotein recovered from the high-speed centrifugation was seen in\nthe pellets. Although a relatively small amount of soluble SidG\nprotein appears to be available, our results show that SidG is still\nreadily translocated. These results are consistent with the model\nthat the DHFR moiety does not cause aggregation and that aggre-\ngation does not correlate with decreased translocation.\n\nInterference of IDTS translocation by ubiquitin requires\nfolding of the interfering moiety. Although the data presented\nargue that the DHFR moiety was folded and did not interfere with\nthe reporter readout, we could not analyze the consequences of\n\nconditional folding of an interfering moiety. Therefore, we ana-\nlyzed ubiquitin (Ub) fusions to IDTSs as mutant Ub derivatives\nexist that are poorly folded, allowing us to compare folded and\nunfolded internal domains. As with DHFR, ubiquitin (Ub) is a\ncompact, rapidly folding protein that can serve as a disruptive\ndomain for secreted substrates in multiple systems (43, 59, 60).\nFurthermore, simple mutations can be used to destabilize the pro-\ntein and yield an unfolded control for secretion assays (43, 59). To\nthis end, we constructed a fusion of RalF tagged with CyaA to a Ub\nprotein in which two residues in the hydrophobic core (Ile3 and\nIle13) are replaced with Gly (UbG3,13) to destabilize the protein\nconformation (Fig. 5A) (59).\n\nInterestingly, we found that the CyaA-RalF fusion to wild-type\nUb was cleaved in the cytosol of L. pneumophila (Fig. 5B). This\nmay be due to a deubiquitinating protease (DUB) that was pre-\ndicted bioinformatically to be encoded by L. pneumophila\n(Lpg2907; MavW) (13, 61). In contrast, the UbG3,13 protein was\nnot cleaved, consistent with the interpretation that these muta-\ntions prevent folding of the Ub domain. As cleaved Ub fusion\nproteins would be uninformative in our experiments, we con-\nstructed an additional Ub construct by replacing the terminal res-\nidue (Gly76) with a Val residue (UbV76). This mutation alters the\nsite of proteolytic cleavage by DUBs without perturbing the fold-\ning of Ub (62).\n\nCyaA-RalF fused to the folded, uncleavable UbV76 demon-\nstrated very low translocation efficiency (Fig. 5C), resulting in\ncAMP levels similar to those of the dotA strain. In contrast, the\nfusion protein having the unfolded UbG3,13 derivative was trans-\nlocated at a small but significantly (P � 0.02) higher efficiency\nthan CyaA-RalF alone. Taking these results together with the\nDHFR data, we conclude that the extent to which an IDTS main-\ntains a region with a folded conformation inversely correlates with\nits translocation efficiency.\n\nThe DHFR-MavU fusion protein exhibits a kinetic defect in\ntranslocation. The above analysis shows that accumulation of the\nfusion proteins is lowered by the presence of a poison domain but\ndoes not investigate whether there is premature termination of secre-\ntion or whether the domain slows the rate of translocation. To carry\nout real-time, kinetic analysis of translocation to answer this ques-\ntion, we adapted the GloSensor cAMP assay (see Materials and Meth-\nods). The system uses a modified Photinus pyralis luciferase that con-\ntains a cAMP-binding domain. Binding of cAMP causes a\nconformational change that allows the luciferase to interact with its\nsubstrate to produce light. For our purposes, monolayers of 293T\ncells transiently transfected with a plasmid expressing the modified\nluciferase and the Fc�RIIA receptor (to facilitate uptake of IgG-op-\nsonized L. pneumophila) were preincubated with the luciferase sub-\nstrate and then challenged with L. pneumophila strains harboring\nIDTSs fused to CyaA. Intracellular cAMP resulting from transloca-\ntion of the adenylate cyclase was monitored by the luminescent out-\nput over the course of the infection (see Materials and Methods). The\nkinetic analysis agreed strongly with the endpoint cAMP assay.\nDHFR fusions to RalF and SidG, as well as the CyaA gene itself, re-\nsulted in a substantial kinetic delay in luminescence signal (decreased\nrate of transfer as represented by depressed slope and increased time-\nto-half-maximal signal). (Fig. 6A and B). In each case, the time to\nhalf-maximal luminescence for the wild-type proteins fused to Cya\nwas approximately 5 min (Fig. 6A to C). In contrast, for the DHFR\nfusions to RalF and SidG, the time to half-maximal luminescence was\nat least 30 min (Fig. 6A and B).

Similar results were obtained with the quantitative end-\n\npoint CyaA translocation assay using individual time points\nover the course of infection (Fig. 6D). Both assays are consis-\ntent with an initial kinetic delay caused by DHFR fusion to\nMavU of about 15 to 20 min.

The\n\nIcmS/W adaptor complex is necessary for translocation of a large\nsubset of L. pneumophila effectors (63, 64). Previous work indi-\ncated that the IcmS/W complex binds to several different IDTSs,\nand in the case of SidG, this appears to alter the conformational\nstate of the protein (34). Furthermore, IcmS is necessary for the\nstability of the T4BSS coupling protein DotL and binds directly to\nDotL (32, 64). Therefore, if folded DHFR precludes IcmS from\nbinding the IDTS fusions, the folded moiety could restrict the\nsubstrate from forming a translocation-competent conformation\nwith IcmS/W.\n\nTo investigate whether the presence of DHFR precludes IcmS\nfrom facilitating translocation, we first compared translocation of\nDHFR-MavU in the wild type (Lp02) to an icmS deletion mutant\nof L. pneumophila. The translocation efficiency of DHFR-MavU\nwas more than 10-fold lower in the �icmS strain than in the wild\ntype, similar to the magnitude of defect found with the parental\nMavU fusion (Fig. 7A). This indicates that the IcmS/IcmW com-\nplex is still necessary and capable of facilitating translocation of\nthe DHFR fusion and is consistent with DHFR interfering with\ntranslocation at some level other than IcmS/W interactions.\n\nTo further determine if DHFR prevented association of the\nIcmS/W complex with IDTSs, we determined the relative fraction\nof fusions that coassociate with the chaperone in the presence or\nabsence of the DHFR moiety (Fig. 7B). Either CyaA-MavU or\nCyaA-DHFR-MavU was coexpressed in E. coli with a GST-IcmS/\nIcmW complex (see Materials and Methods) (Table 1). Lysates\nwere incubated with immobilized glutathione resin, bound pro-\nteins were eluted with reduced glutathione, and CyaA-tagged\nproteins bound to GST-IcmS/IcmW were detected by immuno-\nblotting. There was no significant difference in binding to GST-\nIcmS/W between CyaA-MavU and CyaA-DHFR-MavU (Fig. 7B).\nIn contrast, little fusion protein was associated with the resin in\nthe absence of coexpression of the GST-IcmS/W complex or if\nGST alone was coexpressed with the fusions (Fig. 7B). We thus\nconfirm that the folded DHFR moiety does not interfere with the\ninteraction of IcmS/W with IDTSs.\n\nIDTS fused to folded DHFR or Ub interferes with Icm/Dot\nsecretion channel function. It is well documented that secretion\nsignals fused to secretion-incompetent proteins often result in\nblockage of the translocation channel, resulting in a severe atten-\nuation of channel function (36). Most relevant to this study, in-\ntroduction of DHFR and Ub to type III secretion system-translo-\ncated substrates in Yersinia enterocolitica has been shown to\ninterfere with transport of other proteins through this channel\n(43, 65). As the DHFR and Ub fusions interfered with transloca-\ntion in the Icm/Dot T4SS, we tested whether these constructions\ncould occlude translocation of other IDTSs or slow the rate of\ntranslocation to the extent that there would be defective intracel-\nlular growth due to a blockage the Icm/Dot system, which is\nknown to be essential for intracellular growth.\n\nTo determine if introducing a folded moiety into RalF causes\ntranslocation inhibition, we monitored export of an endoge-\nnously expressed IDTS, SidC, in strains overproducing RalF fu-\nsions having either folded or unfolded domains inserted. U937\ncells were challenged for 1.5 h with L. pneumophila that expresses\neither RalF or one of the RalF fusions (Fig. 8A and B), and cells\nwere lysed with digitonin. The detergent-soluble and -insoluble\nfractions were then analyzed by immunoblotting to identify ex-\nported and bacterium-associated SidC, respectively (55) (see Ma-\nterials and Methods). Strains expressing either the UbV76 or\n\nFIG 5 Folded ubiquitin inhibits translocation of fused Icm/Dot substrates.\nU937 cells were challenged with the wild-type L. pneumophila strain Lp02 or a\ntranslocation-defective dotA strain expressing CyaA-tagged RalF fused to ei-\nther ubiquitin, a nonfolding variant of ubiquitin (UbG3,13), or a variant that\ncannot be cleaved by DUBs (UbV76).

Therefore,\noverproduction of the translocation-incompetent proteins inter-\nferes with function of the Icm/Dot translocon.\n\nTo determine if interference with translocation also inhibits\nintracellular bacterial replication, an intracellular growth assay of\nL. pneumophila overexpressing RalF fused to DHFR, UbG3,13, or\nUbV76 was performed. Monolayers of bone marrow-derived mac-\nrophages from A/J mice were challenged with wild-type L. pneu-\nmophila expressing the reporter protein fusions for 14 h, which is\napproximately one round of infection. Cells were fixed, and the\nnumber of bacteria in individual Legionella-containing vacuoles\n(LCVs) was determined by microscopy. In strains harboring RalF\nalone or RalF fused to the unfolded UbG3,13 variant, approxi-\nmately 60% of LCVs were large vacuoles with 11 or more bacteria,\nconsistent with efficient growth in the presence of these proteins.\nIn the strain expressing the DHFR fusion, the presence of DHFR\nrestricted growth, as evidenced by an increase in the percentage of\nvacuoles that had small numbers of bacteria (1–3), with a corre-\nsponding decrease in vacuoles having more than 11 bacteria (Fig.\n8C). The growth defect was most pronounced in the strain ex-\npressing the folded ubiquitin (UbV76), with the percentage of large\nvacuoles of 11 or more bacteria decreasing approximately 4-fold\ncompared to the strain expressing the unfolded Ub fusion (Fig.\n8C). Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the percent-\nage of small and medium-sized vacuoles, consistent with de-\ncreased growth in the presence of this fusion. This phenotype is\nindicative of a partial blockage of the translocon by folded pro-\nteins, reducing the rate of translocation of IDTSs needed for bac-\nterial replication. Therefore, occlusion of the channel by the in-\ntroduction of a folded domain interferes with the ability of L.\npneumophila to grow intracellularly.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we show that translocation of substrates of the Icm/\nDot T4SS into host cells is depressed by the presence of moieties\nthat assume folded conformations. Fusion proteins of DHFR and\nUb to IDTSs demonstrate a defect in translocation compared to\ntheir unfolded counterparts (Fig. 1 and 5). Furthermore, there was\na small but significant increase in translocation of the IDTS RalF\nfused to a destabilized variant of ubiquitin (UbG3,13) relative to\nRalF alone, consistent with an unfolded region stimulating trans-\nlocation (Fig. 5). If the unstructured moiety increases the amount\nof unfolding of the entire IDTS, translocation competence may be\ndefined by the ability of the IDTS to maintain an unfolded con-\nformation.\n\nMany IDTSs are translated prior to infection, as indicated by\nthe fact that protein synthesis inhibitors do not affect transloca-\ntion rates (58). If we consider this in context with our data, the\n\nFIG 6 The DHFR-IDTS fusion proteins exhibit kinetic defects in transloca-\ntion.

These may be heat shock proteins or uncharacterized\nchaperones but also could include the adapter protein complexes\nof IcmS/W and IcmS/LvgA (64). These small proteins are hypoth-\nesized to resemble the type III secretion system chaperones which\nact to hold proteins in a partially unfolded conformation for de-\nlivery to the translocon ATPase for subsequent unfolding and se-\ncretion (45, 46, 66).

This\npretranslocation complex appears to be the form that is presented\nto the secretion channel as IcmS binds directly to DotL, the secre-\ntion ATPase in the Icm/Dot system (32). Although insertion of\nDHFR interfered with translocation, IcmS/W was still able to in-\nteract with MavU- and SidG-DHFR fusions, and IcmS was neces-\nsary to facilitate the translocation of the DHFR-MavU fusion (Fig.\n7). These results indicate that the defect in translocation observed\nin this work is independent of IcmS/W action.\n\nUsing two different assays, we were able to demonstrate that\nthe DHFR moiety decreases the rate of protein transport (Fig. 6).\nTwo models can explain this result. The first possibility is that a\nfolded domain does not cause an absolute block in translocation,\neither because the Icm/Dot system has some intrinsic ability to\ntranslocate folded proteins or because the secretion system is able\nto convert translocation-incompetent substrates into transferra-\nble conformations. The second possibility is that there is a small\nsubpopulation of proteins that are partially unfolded. In either\nmodel, the extent to which a protein is in a translocation-compe-\ntent conformation directly correlates with the rate that it can be\ntransported through the Icm/Dot translocon.\n\nIn addition to the translocation defect of a tightly folded pro-\ntein, the effector fusions interfere with translocation of other\nIDTSs (Fig. 8), consistent with at least partial occlusion of the\ntranslocon. In the case of the Yersinia T3SS, the presence of folded\ndomains in translocated substrates interferes with the assembly of\nspecific components necessary for the function of the translocon\n(65). Although we cannot exclude this possibility, the fact that the\nDHFR fusions are very poorly translocated but cause only partial\ninterference with intracellular growth (Fig. 8) is consistent with\nthe Icm/Dot complex being largely intact. We propose two models\nfor the mechanism of this blockage. First, the interfering protein\nfusion could disrupt transport of only a subset of translocated\neffectors that are critical for intracellular growth. The second\nmodel is that the fusion protein is stalled within the secretion\nchannel, causing a global decrease in the rate of all IDTSs. The low\nrate of transport of the fusion proteins could generate a situation\nakin to a traffic jam, in which a group of slow-moving individuals\ncauses a general reduction in the rate of movement of all individ-\nuals moving through the secretion channel.\n\nIf stalled or slow-moving substrates cause the generalized\ntranslocation defect, then there must be some explanation for why\nsuch interference occurs. Although the structure of the T4BSS has\nnot been fully elucidated, cryo-electron microscopic and crystal\nstructures of core components of a T4SS from plasmid pKM101\nhave been solved. While the Icm/Dot system constitutes a differ-\nent class of secretion apparatus (T4BSS), some insight can be\ngained from considering the known structure. Cryo-electron mi-\ncroscopy of the T4SS reveals a unique structure in which the core\nforms a large, bulbous chamber between the inner and outer\nmembranes (47). Importantly, the channel is constricted at the\ncapped outer membrane face, which the crystal structure suggests\nundergoes a conformational change that could restrict the chan-\nnel at the outer membrane, allowing opening or closing of the\nsecretion pore (30, 47). At the base of the structure is a large\nentryway of 55 nm although it is believed that other components\nof the secretion system could fit within this entryway and make for\na much narrower passage site (47). Based upon this configuration,\nat the very least, the transport of folded proteins through the Icm/\nDot system may be hindered while exiting the translocon. This\n\nsituation would likely lead to the accumulation of proteins within\nthe secretion system core.\n\nBlocks could also occur at the entry site of the secretion com-\nplex. In this scenario, initiation of movement into the secretion\ncomplex would result in a frustrated intermediate in which there is\na physical block at the entrance. Furthermore, occlusion of IDTSs\ncould occur at a step that is prior to entry into the complex. In the\nT3SS, folded effector fusions prevent translocation of other IDTSs\nby binding to and inhibiting the ATPase associated with the secre-\ntion system (65). Normally, chaperones carry their cognate sub-\nstrates to the T3SS in a partially unfolded conformation, thus\n“priming” them for complete unfolding by the ATPase before\ntranslocation (45, 46). In the Icm/Dot system it has been proposed\nthat DotL, as part of a subcomplex with the ATPases DotM and\nDotN, acts as a regulator of IDTS entry (67). DotL has sequence\nsimilarity to type IV secretion system coupling proteins, which are\nproposed to link substrates to the rest of the secretion complex\n(68). The fact that DotL associates with IcmS could be key to\nlinking the substrate to the secretion system. Folded proteins may\nbe blocked from entry by an inappropriate interaction with DotL,\nthus inhibiting further translocation of effectors.\n\nThese studies demonstrate that small folded domains can gen-\nerate impassable substrates through the L. pneumophila T4SS,\nconsistent with a strong selection against such moieties being\npresent in IDTSs. Therefore, it would appear that most IDTSs are\neither easily unfolded, maintained with chaperones in an unfolded\nconformation, or have determinants that allow recognition by un-\nfoldases associated with the Icm/Dot complex. Future work will\nrequire identifying the features of the substrates that allow them to\nbe secretion competent and determining which bacterial proteins\ncontribute to generating structures that maintain this conforma-\ntion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nR.R.I. is an investigator of HHMI, while W.M.A. and D.D. were supported\nby NIH training grant T32AI00742.
