The mitochondrial dysfunction has\n\nbeen found to be associated with the development of human\n\ncancers [2], [3]. It has been reported that mitochondrial\n\ndysfunction could be caused by inhibitors of mitochondrial\n\nelectron transport chain [4], pathogenic mutations in mitochon-\n\ndrial DNA (mtDNA) [3], and mutations in nuclear gene coded\n\nelectron transport chain proteins [2]. Additionally, accumulating\n\nevidence suggests that cancer cells exhibit increased intrinsic\n\nreactive oxygen species (ROS) stress partly due to mitochondrial\n\nmalfunction [5], [6]. The increased ROS in cancer cells may in\n\nturn affect certain redoxsensitive molecules and further lead to\n\nstimulation of cellular proliferation, cell migration and invasion,\n\ncontributing to carcinogenesis [7], [8]. However, the underlying\n\nmolecular mechanisms by which mitochondrial dysfunction\n\nincreases ROS production and subsequently leads to tumorigen-\n\nesis are not fully understood.\n\nEmerging evidence suggests that mitochondrial malfunction and\n\nhypoxia in the tumor microenvironment are considered as two\n\nmajor factors contributing to the Warburg effect [9], [10]. In solid\n\ntumors, hypoxia, which is an oxygen tension below physiologic\n\nlevels, develops as abnormal proliferation outstrips the blood\n\nsupply [11]. This hypoxic region is involved in tumor malignancy\n\nand proliferation, resulting in the development of resistance to\n\nradiotherapy [12]. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a tran-\n\nscription factor that regulates the cellular response to hypoxia,\n\ninduces several genes that mediate tumorigenesis [13], [14]. It is\n\nknown that HIF-1 is a heterodimer that consists of the oxygen-\n\nsensitive HIF-1a subunit and the constitutively expressed HIF-1b\nsubunit [15], [16]. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1a is\n\nhydroxylated by prolyl hydroxylases on the proline residues in\n\nthe oxygen-dependent degradation domain [17], [18]. In hypoxic\n\nconditions, low oxygen leads to HIF-1a stabilization due to the\ninhibition of prolyl-hydroxylation and subsequent reduction in\n\nHIF-1a ubiquitination and degradation [18].\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69485\n\n\n\nIn addition to the regulation of HIF-1a by oxygen supply, there\nare also different HIF activators that include growth factors,\n\nhormones, cytokines and viral proteins [19]. Interestingly, related\n\nobservations of ROS regulating HIF-1a expression appear to be\ncontroversial. For example, multiple studies have shown that\n\nincreased HIF-1a expression contributes to mitochondrial activity\nand ROS formation during hypoxia [20], [21]. However, other\n\nstudies have demonstrated a decrease in HIF-1a with increasing\nROS [22]. Moreover, some studies have shown no effects on\n\nmitochondrial ROS [23]. These controversy results suggest that\n\nfurther study is required to investigate the relationship between\n\nHIF-1 a and ROS.\nIn the present study, we treated SKBR3 and 4T1 breast cancer\n\ncells by an inhibitor of mitochondrial electron transport complex I,\n\nrotenone, for 1–2 weeks to establish mitochondrial dysfunction\n\nsubclones. Each subclone was confirmed to have mitochondrial\n\ndysfunction by measurement of oxygen consumption, glucose\n\nuptake, and lactate production. We found that mitochondrial\n\ndysfunction subclones had elevated levels of ROS production. We\n\nfurther analyzed (a) whether ROS are required for induction of\n\ntumor cell migration and invasion; (b) whether ROS production\n\nregulate HIF-1a and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\nexpression; (c) whether ROS govern tumor cell migration and\n\ninvasion through the regulation of HIF-1a and VEGF expression.\nThis work provides the molecular insight into the role of ROS in\n\nthe regulation of breast cancer cell migration and invasion.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nReagents\nAntibody against HIF-1a was purchased from BD Biosciences.\n\nAntibodies against VEGF and b-actin were purchased from Santa\nCruz Biotechnology.

It is important to note that\n\nrotenone was absent after clone generation during the clone\n\nstudies. Briefly, cells were treated for 24 h with rotenone\n\n(100 nmol/L), then cultured in drug-free medium for 48 h.\n\nFollowed by two more cycles of rotenone treatment, cells were\n\nthen plated at a density of 200 per dish in drug-free medium to\n\nallow the formation of colonies, which caused an increase in\n\nsuperoxide generation measured by flow cytometry. Among these\n\nclones, two clones with higher ROS from SKBR3 cells were\n\nnamed as A and B, and two clones with higher ROS from 4T1\n\ncells were marked as C and D for further studies.\n\nROS Measurement\nIntracellular ROS generation was assessed using 29,7,-dichloro-\n\nfluorescein diacetate. Briefly, 16106 cells were plated on the 6-well\nplates and incubated with DCFH-DA (10 mmol/L) for 30 min at\n\n37uC. Cells were washed and harvested in Hank’s buffered salt\nsolution (HBSS) and analyzed immediately using a BD FACScan\n\nflow cytometer. Data were analyzed as single parameter frequency\n\nhistogram using cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Results are\n\npresented as mean fluorescence intensity.\n\nHydrogen Peroxide Measurement\nThe cells were lysed in 100 ml lysis buffer supplied by the H2O2\n\nassay kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, China) to determine\n\nthe intracellular H2O2 concentration. The supernatants were\n\nobtained by centrifuging at 12,0006g for 10 min. The H2O2\n\nFigure 3. The migration capacity of subclones and their parental cells was measured by wound healing assay.

Briefly, 50 ml sample solution\nwas incubated with 100 ml reaction solution at room temperature\nfor 30 min, and then the absorption at 560 nm was measured.\n\nThe H2O2 concentration was calculated by the standard curve\n\nmade from the standard solutions.\n\nMitochondrial Respiratory Defect Measurement\nATP measurements were performed using ATP assay Kit\n\n(Beyotime). We also investigated the mitochondrial oxidative\n\nphosphorylation contribution on ATP production with the\n\naddition of ATP synthase inhibitor, oligomycin, as previously\n\ndescribed [25]. Briefly, cells were grown to approximately 80%\n\nconfluence, and then incubated in DMEM containing the\n\nfollowing combinations of substrates and inhibitors: 4.5 mg/ml\n\nglucose plus 110 mg/l pyruvate; glucose plus 15 mg/ml of\n\noligomycin. Cells were incubated with 15 mg/ml of oligomycin\n\nfor 20 min before harvesting. The remaining steps were following\n\nthe manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nCellular glucose uptake was measured by incubating cells in\n\nglucose-free medium with 0.2 Ci/mL [3H] 2-deoxyglucose\n\n(specific activity, 40 Ci/mmol) for 60 minutes. After the cells\n\nwere washed with ice-cold PBS, the radioactivity in the cell pellets\n\nwas quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Cellular lactate\n\nlevel was measured under normoxia with lactate assay kit\n\n(Biovision) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The absor-\n\nbance was recorded using a microplate reader at a 570-nm\n\nwavelength. The data were normalized to the control group.\n\nTranswell Migration and Invasion Assays\nThe migration of breast cancer cells and their subclones was\n\nperformed using a 24-well transwell chamber (Corning) containing\n\ngelatin-coated polycarbonate membrane filter (6.5 mm diameter,\n\n8 mm pore size). 16105 cells suspended in 100 ml culture medium\nwith 1% FBS were seeded into the upper chamber. The lower\n\nchamber contained 600 ml culture medium with 10% FBS as a\nchemoattractant. After 24 h incubation at 37uC in 5% CO2, non-\nmigrated cells were scraped from the upper surface of the\n\nmembrane with a cotton swab, and migrated cells remaining on\n\nthe bottom surface were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, staining\n\nwith giemsa and photographed under a microscope at 20\n\nmagnification. The numbers of migrated cells were counted under\n\na light microscope in 5 randomly-selected fields for each chamber.\n\nThe invasion of the cancer cells were performed by the same\n\nprocedure as in the migration assay except that the chamber filter\n\nwere coated with matrigel (BD Biosciences) and 56105 cells were\nseeded into the upper chamber.\n\nWound Healing Assay\n26105 cells were added to each well of 6-well plate and cultured\n\nat 37uC in 5% CO2 until more than 80% confluent. They were\nthen scratched with a standard 200 ml pipette tip, wounded\nmonolayers were washed twice to remove nonadherent cells and\n\nimages were captured at 0 h, 24 h and 48 h after wounding using\n\na Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope and a Nikon Plan Fluor\n\n460.13 objective.\n\nFigure 5. ROS promoted HIF-1a and VEGF expression in subclone cells. A, ROS led to increased expression of HIF-1a and VEGF in SKBR3\nsubclones. SKBR3 subclones showed higher normoxic and hypoxic HIF-1a level than the parental SKBR3 cells. VEGF expression was more increased in\nSKBR3 subclones than in the parental SKBR3 cells.

The proteins were\n\nquantified by BCA protein assay. Twenty-five micrograms of\n\nlysate proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE and subsequently\n\ntransferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked\n\nwith a solution of Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween-20\n\n(TBS-T) containing 5% nonfat milk. The membranes were\n\nincubated overnight at 4uC with primary antibodies against\nhuman HIF-1a, VEGF, and b-actin. The membranes were\nwashed with TBS-T, and secondary antibodies were added to\n\nthe membrane for 1 h at 37uC. Membranes were washed with\nTBS-T, visualized with ECL reagent (Millipore), and exposed to\n\nfilm.\n\nRNAi-mediated Inhibition of HIF-1a\nThe target sequence of HIF-1a was selected [27] as followed:\n\n59-TACGTTGTGAGTGGTATTATT-39. The 21 nt target se-\n\nquence served as the basis for the design of the two complemen-\n\ntary 55-mer siRNA template oligonucleotides that were synthe-\n\nsized, annealed, and ligated annealed siRNA template were\n\ninserted into the pSilencer 4.1-CMV vecter (Ambion). Briefly,\n\nshRNA was designed by using the siRNA software according to\n\nthe sequence target as follows: Forward oligo, 59-GAT CCC GTT\n\nGTG AGT GGT ATT ATT TTC AAG AGA AAT AAT ACC\n\nACT CAC AAC GTA A-39, Reverse oligo, 59-AGC TTT ACG\n\nTTG TGA GTG GTA TTA TTT CTC TTG AAA TAA TAC\n\nCAC TCA CAA CGG-39. The double stranded DNA sequence\n\nwas obtained through annealing after chemosynthesis and was\n\ninserted into PsilencerTM4.1-CMV vector. The insert production\n\nwas transformed into E. coli cells. Then the clones were picked and\n\nsequenced to verify the inserts. Transient transfection was\n\nperformed using the Cationic lipid Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen)\n\nwith HIF-1a shRNA vector.\n\nResults\n\nGeneration of Subclones with Higher ROS\nRotenone has been accepted as a blocker of the electron flow\n\nthrough inhibition of complex I and subsequently causing an\n\nincrease in the production of superoxide due to electron flow\n\nbifurcation [4]. Therefore, we used rotenone to increase superox-\n\nide generation which leads to subsequent induction of ROS stress\n\nin SKBR3 and 4T1 cells. After three cycles of rotenone treatment,\n\ncells were plated in drug-free medium to allow the formation of\n\ncolonies. After subclones are generated, each 18 subclones from\n\nSKBR3 and 4T1 cells were picked to measure ROS level. Among\n\n18 SKBR3 subclones, 15 subclones showed significantly higher\n\nROS production compared to their parental SKBR3 cells, 3\n\nsubclones showed almost the same ROS level as their parental\n\nSKBR3 cells (data not shown). Among 18 4T1 subclones, 14\n\nsubclones have obviously higher ROS production than that of\n\ntheir parental 4T1 cells, and 4 subclones showed no difference in\n\nROS production with their parental 4T1 cells (data not shown).\n\nFour clones with highest ROS were selected for further studies.\n\nTwo SKBR3 cells’ subclones with higher ROS were named A and\n\nB (Figure S1A), while C and D subclones were selected from\n\n4T1cells (Figure S1B).\n\nSubclones Exhibiting Mitochondrial Dysfunction\nTo determine whether increased ROS affect mitochondrial\n\ndysfunction, we performed the mitochondrial respiratory defect\n\nmeasurement. As illustrated in Figure 1A, both A and B clones\n\nshowed increased in glucose uptake and lactate production\n\ncompared to their parental SKBR3 cells (Fig. 1A). Moreover,\n\nboth A and B clones had similar total ATP content compared with\n\nthe parental SKBR3 cells: however; ATP synthesis sensitive to\n\noligomycin that assumed to be contributed by mitochondrial ATP\n\nsynthase further decreased in A and B clones compared with\n\nparental SKBR3 cells (Fig. 1B). Similar results were found in 4T1\n\ncells (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that up-regulation of glycolysis\n\nwas sufficient to compensate the decreased ATP generation in the\n\nmitochondria.\n\nROS Promoted Cell Motility and Invasion\nAs ROS have been reported to be involved in tumor metastasis\n\n[8], we tested the motility and invasive potential of each subclones.\n\nFurthermore, to evaluate whether increased ROS were essential\n\nfor this process, cells were pretreated with the antioxidant N-acetyl\n\ncysteine (NAC) before the Transwell assay and wound healing\n\nassay. As we expected, four subclones exhibited greater motility\n\ncompared to their parental cells. More importantly, these\n\nmigration capacities were significantly inhibited by NAC\n\n(Fig. 2A, 2B). Consistent with these results, we observed that\n\nthese subclones with higher ROS showed highly invasion capacity,\n\nwhich can be inhibited by NAC (Figure S2). In agreement with the\n\nTranswell assay, the wound healing assay showed significantly\n\naccelerated wound closure in these subclone cells compared to\n\ntheir parental cells after scratch assay (Fig. 3A, 3B). NAC\n\neffectively inhibited the wound closure in these subclones\n\n(Fig. 3A, 3B). These results indicated that the aggressive cellular\n\nbehaviors of subclones might be regulated by ROS.\n\nInhibition of ROS Generation Decreased Cell Motility and\nInvasion\nTo further confirm whether ROS were increased in subclone\n\ncells, we measured the H2O2 concentrations in these subclones\n\nusing the commercial assay kit [24]. As expected, we found that\n\nH2O2 was increased in these subclones (data not shown), and NAC\n\nsignificantly inhibited generation of H2O2 in subclones (Figure 4A).\n\nFurthermore, H2O2 promoted cell migration and invasion, while\n\nits scavenger PEG-catalase decreased cell migration and invasion\n\nin subclone cells (Figure 4B, 4C, 4D, Figure S3), suggesting that\n\nROS play a role in cell motility and invasion. More importantly,\n\nmitochondria-target SOD mimetic, mito-TEMPO [28] inhibited\n\nmigration and invasion in subclone cells (Figure 4B, 4C, 4D,\n\nFigure S3).\n\nROS Induced HIF-1a and VEGF Expression\nNext, we explore the molecular mechanism of ROS-mediated\n\nmigration and invasion.

As cobalt chloride (CoCl2) has been\n\naccepted as a hypoxic mimetic agent, we used 500 mmol/L CoCl2\nto treat cells for 30 minutes before the cells were lysed. As shown in\n\nFigure 5, the subclones exhibited increased expression of HIF-1a\nunder normoxic and hypoxic conditions. NAC inhibited not only\n\nnormoxic HIF-1a expression but also hypoxic HIFa expression in\nboth subclones (Figure 5A, 5B). VEGF, a crucial angiogenic factor\n\nfor controlling angiogenesis and vasculature, is one of the most\n\nprominent HIF-1 target genes. Therefore, we further measured\n\nVEGF expression in these subclones. We found that these\n\nsubclones have increased expression of VEGF (Figure 5A, 5B).\n\nWe also observed that VEGF expression was significantly\n\ndecreased after NAC treatment in both subclones (Figure 5A,\n\n5B). These results suggest that ROS could induce HIF-1a and\nconsequently leads to increased VEGF expression. To further\n\nvalidate the role of ROS in regulation of HIF-1a, the subclone\ncells were treated with PEG-calatase and mito-TEMPO, respec-\n\ntively. We observed that H2O2 upregulated HIF-1a expression,\nwhereas both PEG-calatase and mito-TEMPO down-regulated\n\nthe expression of HIF-1a in subclone cells (Figure 5C, 5D). Taken\ntogether, our findings demonstrated that ROS play a critical role\n\nin cell migration and invasion partly through induction of HIF-1a.\n\nROS Promoted Cell Motility by Upregulation of HIF-1a\nExpression\nTo determine the role of HIF-1a in ROS-mediated cell motility\n\nand invasion, we constructed the expression vector of HIF-1a\nsmall interfering RNA to silence HIF 1a expression. The\nconstructs were sequenced to confirm that there are no unwanted\n\nmutations (Fig. 6A). The interfering effects were determined by\n\nWestern blotting analysis. HIF-1a protein expression was signif-\nicantly inhibited by its shRNA transfection (Fig. 6B). Then we\n\nmeasured cell mobility and invasion ability after depletion of HIF-\n\n1a. The results indicate that HIF-1a shRNA transfected cells\nsignificantly decreased cells mobility and invasive capacity\n\ncompared to control cells (Fig. 6C, 6D, 6E). Our results suggest\n\nthat rotenone initially generate mitochondrial dysfunction and\n\nincreased ROS production which, in turn, affect tumor cell\n\nmotility and invasive capacity by upregulation of HIF-1a\nexpression.\n\nDiscussion\n\nMitochondria possess many biological functions, including the\n\nproduction of ATP, housing numerous biochemical reactions,\n\ngenerating ROS, and governing apoptosis [29]. Numerous studies\n\nhave suggested that these mitochondrial processes may play\n\nimportant roles in tumor initiation and progression [30], [31]. For\n\nexample, mitochondrial ROS have been implicated in malignant\n\ncell transformation [32]. Moreover, it has been suggested that\n\nmitochondrial ROS may be important in the maintenance of\n\nmalignant phenotype through regulation of HIF-1a [28]. In this\nstudy, we tested the hypothesis that additional mitochondrial\n\nalterations acquired after malignant transformation may increase\n\nROS production which will further contribute to cancer develop-\n\nment via ROS-dependent HIF-1a and VEGF pathways to\npromote cancer cell migration and invasion.\n\nTo achieve our goal, we choose rotenone to induce mitochon-\n\ndrial dysfunction to investigate whether rotenone could induce\n\nROS production. Both subclones of breast cancer cells showed\n\nhigher ROS consistent with declined mitochondrial respiration\n\nfunction, as suggested by decreased ATP generation through\n\noxidative phosphorylation, increased ATP generation through\n\nglycolysis, higher glucose uptake and lactate production. These\n\nsubclones also exhibited increased cellular motility and ability to\n\ninvade through Matrigel. These malignant behaviors were\n\ninhibited by the antioxidant NAC, PEG-Calatase, and mito-\n\nTEMPO, indicating the important role of ROS, which is\n\nassociated with mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\nAlthough some researchers investigated the role of ROS in\n\ncarcinogenesis, the exact mechanisms how ROS are involved in\n\ntumorigenesis are unclear. Recently, a number of studies have\n\nsuggested that mitochondrial ROS are involved in the stabilization\n\nand activation of HIF under hypoxic conditions [21]. It is known\n\nthat HIF-1a, which is induced by hypoxia, growth factors, and\noncogenes, plays a pivotal role in tumor growth and angiogenesis\n\n[13]. ROS affect HIF-1a expression under gastric ischemic\nconditions, suggesting that ROS can regulate HIF-1a expression\nin gastric ischemia [33]. Moreover, increased ROS and ROS-\n\ndependent stabilization of HIF under conditions of normal oxygen\n\ntension have also been reported in cancer cells by suppression of\n\nSdhB expression [20]. Furthermore, Xia et al. found that the\n\nstabilization of HIF-1a via ROS generation led to the binding of\nHIF-1a to the FoxM1 promoter, resulting in increased FoxM1\noncoprotein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma [34]. Recent-\n\nly, mitochondria-target antioxidant mito-TEMPO has been\n\ndemonstrated to inhibit redox-dependent HIF-1a-mediated can-\ncer pro-survival signaling pathways [28]. Consistent with these\n\nreports, our results clearly suggest that increased ROS production\n\nis required for HIF-1a stabilization in the mitochondrial\ndysfunction cells induced by rotenone, and these effects were\n\nattenuated by antioxidant NAC, PEG-Calatase, and mito-TEM-\n\nPO. Therefore, our study indicates that ROS promote breast\n\ncancer progression, which is in part mediated through up-\n\nregulation of HIF-1a expression in breast cancer cells.\nMultiple studies have demonstrated that ROS regulate VEGF\n\nexpression in various human cancers [35]. For example, Xia et al.\n\nreported that ROS regulate angiogenesis and tumor growth,\n\nwhich is mediated through upregulation of VEGF [36]. Moreover,\n\nLiu et al. found that ROS up-regulate VEGF and HIF-1a through\nthe activation of Akt and p70S6K in human cancer cells [37].\n\nInterestingly, HIF-1a has been found to control VEGF in a variety\nof human cancer cells [38], [39]. Notably, HIF-1a-mediated up-\nregulation of VEGF is important in the switch to the angiogenic\n\nphenotype during early tumorigenesis [40]. Therefore, these\n\nfindings suggest that ROS govern VEGF production which is in\n\npart mediated through up-regulation of HIF-1a. In line with these\nreports, we revealed that high levels of ROS production caused\n\nelevated VEGF expression by regulating HIF-1a. Conversely, the\ndecrease of HIF-1a expression by ROS inhibitors suppressed\nVEGF transcriptional activation. Taken together, our present\n\nstudy suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction in breast cancer cells\n\nwith high ROS production promotes cell mobility and invasion\n\nwhich is in part mediated through HIF-1a and VEGF. However,\nfurther in-depth investigation is warranted to explore the\n\nmolecular insight into the role of ROS-mediated tumorigenesis\n\nin vivo.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 ROS were measured in subclones by DCF-DA\nmethod.
