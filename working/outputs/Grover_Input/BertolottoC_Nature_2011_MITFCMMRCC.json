A recent study\nof coexisting melanoma and RCC in the same patients supports a\ngenetic predisposition underlying the association between these\ntwo cancers3. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor\n(MITF) has been proposed to act as a melanoma oncogene4; it also\nstimulates the transcription of hypoxia inducible factor5 (HIF1A),\nthe pathway of which is targeted by kidney cancer susceptibility\ngenes6. We therefore proposed that MITF might have a role in\nconferring a genetic predisposition to co-occurring melanoma\nand RCC. Here we identify a germline missense substitution in\nMITF (Mi-E318K) that occurred at a significantly higher frequency\nin genetically enriched patients affected with melanoma, RCC or\nboth cancers, when compared with controls. Overall, Mi-E318K\ncarriers had a higher than fivefold increased risk of developing\nmelanoma, RCC or both cancers. Codon 318 is located in a\nsmall-ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) consensus site (YKXE)\nand Mi-E318K severely impaired SUMOylation of MITF. Mi-\nE318K enhanced MITF protein binding to the HIF1A promoter\nand increased its transcriptional activity compared to wild-type\nMITF. Further, we observed a global increase in Mi-E318K-\noccupied loci. In an RCC cell line, gene expression profiling\nidentified a Mi-E318K signature related to cell growth, prolifera-\ntion and inflammation. Lastly, the mutant protein enhanced\nmelanocytic and renal cell clonogenicity, migration and invasion,\n\nconsistent with a gain-of-function role in tumorigenesis. Our data\nprovide insights into the link between SUMOylation, transcription\nand cancer.\n\nMITF encodes a member of the Myc supergene family of basic\nhelix–loop–helix zipper transcription factors. It has a complex\nintron–exon structure, yielding protein products with different amino\ntermini7. The M-isoform (expressed in the melanocyte lineage) of\nMITF regulates expression of a large set of genes promoting prolifera-\ntion and invasion. For instance, it controls the expression of MET5 and\nCDKN2A/p16INK4A5, which have key roles in melanoma develop-\nment. The role of the A-isoform of MITF (expressed in kidney) in\nrenal cell transformation has yet to be elucidated. However, MITF\nbelongs to the same family of transcription factors (the MiT family)\nas the TFEC, TFE3 and TFEB genes; the two latter were identified as\ntargets of somatic recurrent translocations in a RCC subtype found\npredominantly in children and young adults8.\n\nWe sequenced the MITF gene in 62 patients with melanoma and\nRCC. Five patients exhibited a germline heterozygous missense sub-\nstitution, p.E318K (c.952G.A, in MITF isoform 4, NCBI accession\nNM_000248.3) (Fig. 1a). The frequency of this variant was signifi-\ncantly higher in patients with both melanoma and RCC (melanoma\n1 RCC) than in 1,659 population-based cancer-free controls\n(P 5 1.3 3 1024). Carriers of the p.E318K variant (Mi-E318K) exhibited\na 14-fold higher risk than controls for developing melanoma 1 RCC\n(Table 1). To investigate the effect of Mi-E318K on susceptibility\nto melanoma alone, we genotyped 603 affected patients that had under-\ngone oncogenetic testing for melanoma susceptibility genes1 and\nwere negative for CDKN2A and CDK4 mutations (Table 1). Mi-E318K\n\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\n{A list of authors and their affiliations appears at the end of the paper.\n\n1INSERM, U895 (équipe 1), Equipe labélisée Ligue Contre le Cancer, C3M, 06204 Nice, France. 2Université of Nice Sophia-Antipolis, UFR Médecine, 06204 Nice, France. 3Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de\nNice, Service de Dermatologie, 06204 Nice, France. 4Service de Génétique, Institut de Cancérologie Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France. 5Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire,\nCNRS, INSERM, Université de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch, France. 6INSERM, UMR985, Institut de Cancérologie Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France and Université Paris-Sud 11, 91405 Orsay. 7INSERM,\nU946, Genetic Variation and Human Diseases Unit, 75010 Paris, France. 8Université Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cité, Institut Universitaire d’Hématologie, 75010 Paris, France. 9Fondation Jean Dausset-\nCentre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH), 75010 Paris, France. 10AP-HP, Hôpital Bichat, Service de Dermatologie, Faculté Paris Diderot, 75018 Paris, France. 11Département de Pathologie,\nCentre Léon Bérard, 69008 Lyon, France. 12Department of Pathology, Hôpital Saint-Joseph, 75014 Paris, France. 13Department of Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 21079 Dijon, France.\n14Lyon 1 University and Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Department of Dermatology, 69495 Pierre Bénite, France. 15AP-HP, Hôpital Cochin -Tarnier, Service de Dermatologie and Université Paris Descartes,\n75006 Paris, France. 16Unité de Génétique Clinique, Hôpital Charles Nicolle, CHU Rouen, 76038 Rouen, France. 17Department of Dermatology, CHU Hôpital Nord, 42055 Saint-Etienne, France.\n18Department of Medicine, Institut de Cancérologie Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France. 19Department of Pediatry, Institut de Cancérologie Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France. 20Institut Curie,\nCNRS UMR33 and INSERM U1021, Université Paris-Sud 11, 91405 Orsay, France. 21Génétique Oncologique EPHE-INSERM U753, Faculté de Médecine, Université Paris-Sud 11 and Institut de\nCancérologie Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France. 22Centre Expert National Cancers Rares PREDIR, INCa/AP-HP, Service d’Urologie, Hôpital de Bicêtre, 94275 Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France. 23Service de\nGénétique, Institut Curie, 75005 Paris, France. 24Laboratory of Cancer Genetics, Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, 49503 Michigan, USA. 25NCCS-VARI Translational Research Laboratory,\nNational Cancer Center Singapore, 16910 Singapore. 26Department of Internal Medicine, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy. 27Dermatology Department and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics,\nMelanoma Unit, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, and CIBER de Enfermedades Raras, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, 08036 Barcelona, Spain. 28Department of Oncology, Lund University and Hospital, Lund, 22185\nSweden. 29Department of Surgery, Lund University and Hospital, Lund, 22185 Sweden. 30Service d’Oncogénétique, Hôpital René Huguenin- Institut Curie, 92210 Saint-Cloud, France. 31Department of\nPathology, Translational Research Laboratory and Biobank, Institut de Cancérologie Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France. 32Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique, Centre National de Génotypage, 91057\nEvry, France. 33INSERM, UMR557, INRA U1125, CNAM, Paris 13, CRNH Idf, 93000 Bobigny, France. 34Université d’Evry Val d’Essonne, 91025 Evry, France. 35Université Paris-Sud 11, Faculté de Médecine,\n94275 Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, France. {Present addresses: Genetic Cancer Susceptibility group, International Agency for Research on Cancer, 69372 Lyon, France (F.L.); Genetic Department, Institut Paoli\nCalmettes, 13273 Marseille, France (A.R.).\n\n0 0 M O N T H 2 0 1 1 | V O L 0 0 0 | N A T U R E | 1\n\nMacmillan Publishers Limited.

The carriers of Mi-E318K in this group exhibited\n.4-fold higher melanoma risk than controls (Table 1). In addition, Mi-\nE318K co-segregated with melanoma in three melanoma-prone families\nthat had DNA available in relatives of index cases carrying Mi-E318K\n(SupplementaryFig.1a).WealsofoundthatMi-E318Kwasmorestrongly\nassociated with multiple occurrences of primary melanomas than with\nsingle occurrence, irrespective of family history (P 5 0.02, Supplementary\nTable 1). To investigate the effect of Mi-E318K in RCC susceptibility, we\ngenotyped 164 patients with RCC referred to oncogenetic clinics, who\nwereenrichedforrarehistological subtypesandwhowerewild type for the\nknown RCC-predisposing genes6. These patients also exhibited a higher\nfrequency of Mi-E318K than controls (P 5 0.008) (Table 1). After cor-\nrecting for multiple testing, the association between Mi-E318K and mel-\nanoma 1 RCC, melanoma only or RCC only remained significant,\nalthough marginally so for the RCC-only group (P 5 0.02). The three\ngroups showed similar Mi-E318K allele frequencies (P 5 0.10). When\nall 829 patients with melanoma and/or RCC were pooled, Mi-E318K\nfrequency was significantly different from controls (P 5 1.2 3 1026).\nThe pooled group of Mi-E318K carriers had a greater than fivefold risk\nof developing melanoma, RCC or both cancers, as compared to controls\n(Table 1). The clinical and pathological features of the 27 Mi-E318K\ncarriers are described in Supplementary Table 2. Principal component\nanalysis (PCA) of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data across the\ngenome in more than 75% of cases and controls showed appropriate\nclustering of cases and controls after exclusion of a few subjects of\nnon-European ancestry (Supplementary Fig. 1b). Association analysis\nof melanoma and/or RCC with Mi-E318K provided similar results when\nperformed with or without adjusting for principal components\n(Supplementary Table 3). To assess whether Mi-E318K predisposed to\nthe coexistence of melanoma and a second primary neoplasm other than\nRCC, we gathered data from European countries, but these data were\ninsufficient for separate analyses of each type of cancer. Overall, we con-\ncluded from our findings that Mi-E318K is a rare substitution that confers\nan increased risk for developing melanoma and/or RCC. However, given\nthe selection of patients who were part of case series undergoing genetic\ntesting, further investigation of Mi-E318K in large series of unselected\nsporadic renal cancer and melanoma cases is merited.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that MITF is expressed in a majority of\nmelanomas and in a subset of kidney tumours9. Accordingly, our\nimmunohistochemical analyses showed that MITF was expressed in\nboth melanomas from patients carrying the germline mutation Mi-\nE318K (n 5 8) and in melanomas from wild-type patients (n 5 8)\n(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). In addition, two out of seven RCCs from\nMi-E318K carriers were positive for MITF (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d),\nsuggesting that Mi-E318K might have a role in renal transformation.\nNone of the six wild-type MITF RCC samples analysed in this study\nshowed MITF labelling.\n\nMi-E318K occurs at a conserved position in MITF within a consensus\nmotif (IKQE) that matches perfectly with the consensus sequence\nYKXE for covalent binding of SUMO10 (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).\nBecause SUMOylation is critically dependent on the acidic residue at\n12 (E) of the acceptor lysine (K), we tested whether Mi-E318K affects\nMITF SUMOylation. Co-expression of histidine-tagged (His)–SUMO1\nwith wild-type MITF and western blot analysis revealed a 120-kDa band\nand a doublet above 95 kDa, in addition to the 55–65 kDa native doublet\n(Fig. 1b). The p.K182R mutation introduced within the second MITF\nSUMOylation site led to complete disappearance of the 120-kDa MITF\nform, but had little effect on the 95-kDa doublet. When glutamic acid\nresidue 318 was replaced by a lysine, mimicking the germline mutation,\nwe observed a strong decrease in the levels of all the SUMO-\nmodified forms of MITF. Lastly, no SUMOylated forms were seen with\nthe double-mutant [p.K182R;p.E318K]. Similar observations were\nmade with co-expression of haemagglutinin-tagged (HA)–SUMO2\n(Supplementary Fig. 4a), demonstrating that Mi-E318K affected both\nSUMO1 and SUMO2 modifications. Western blot analysis with anti-\nMITF antibody, after affinity purification of His–SUMO1-containing\nproteins on Ni-NTA columns, confirmed that the high molecular\nweight bands were indeed SUMO-modified MITF proteins and that\nMi-E318K markedly reduced all the MITF SUMOylated forms\n(Fig. 1c). Altogether, these results demonstrated that codon 316 was\nthe major SUMO acceptor site in MITF and that Mi-E318K severely\nimpaired SUMO conjugation to MITF.\n\nSUMOylation has been shown to orchestrate a variety of cellular\nprocesses, in part through the control of nucleo-cytoplasmic signal\ntransduction.

Indeed, on a synthetic reporter gene com-\nprising three E-boxes, Mi-E318K showed two- to threefold greater\ntranscriptional activity than that of wild type (Fig. 2a). The double\nMITF mutant, [p.E318K;p.K182R], was more effective than Mi-\nE318K, and the single p.K182R mutant exhibited activity comparable\nto that of wild type. We next tested whether Mi-E318K affected MITF\nactivity on physiological target promoters, such as MET and HIF1A,\ntwo MITF-regulated genes involved in cell survival and in melanocyte\nand kidney tumorigenesis. We also tested CDKN2A and TYR promoters,\nwhich are involved in melanocyte proliferation and differentiation\nprocesses, respectively. Wild type and mutant Mi-E318K showed\nsimilar activity on the MET (Fig. 2b), TYR and CDKN2A promoters\n(Supplementary Fig. 5), but Mi-E318K more efficiently activated the\nHIF1A promoter than wild type (Fig. 2c). This observation suggests\nthat Mi-E318K alters MITF transcriptional activity on a subset of its\ntarget genes. To determine the global transcriptional effects of Mi-\nE318K, we performed pan-genomic expression profiling of A375 mel-\nanoma and RCC4 cells infected with adenoviruses that encoded either\nwild-type MITF or Mi-E318K (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b, c, d). Analysis\nof the genes regulated differentially by wild type and Mi-E318K in\n\nA375 cells failed to identify a specific Mi-E318K signature. However,\nin RCC4 cells, we identified a Mi-E318K signature composed of 32\ngenes (Supplementary Table 4). On the basis of the bioinformatic\nanalysis using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (IPA) software, these genes\nwere associated with cell growth, proliferation and inflammation\n(Supplementary Fig. 7). Among the genes downregulated by Mi-\nE318K compared to wild type, IRAK2 (ref. 11), EGR1 (ref. 12) and\nIL6 (ref. 13) have tumour suppressor functions. The upregulated genes\nincluded CCR7, a HIF-1a target gene14 and activator of the NFkB\npathway15; ABCB5, one of the most well-documented markers for\nmelanoma initiating cells16; GADD45G, a member of the GADD45\nfamily of stress sensors, which connects NFkB to the MAP kinase\npathway17; and TRIM63, which was one of the top five upregulated\ngenes and was the major gene found to be differentially expressed in\npatients with TFE3/TFEB translocation RCC as compared to other\nsubtypes of RCC8. These experiments confirmed the different tran-\nscriptional potentials of wild type and Mi-E318K, particularly on genes\ninvolved in proliferation and inflammation.\n\nTo investigate whether SUMOylation influenced genome-wide\nMITF occupancy of its target sites, we performed chromatin immuno-\nprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq)\nexperiments in 501mel human melanoma cell lines expressing wild\ntype or Mi-E318K. Data analysis shows that 22,157 sites are occupied\nby Mi-E318K, whereas only 9,107 were detected for wild type, the\ndifference being the presence of a large number of weakly occupied\nsites in the Mi-E318K data set. Comparative analysis of the ChIP-seq\ndata sets using read density matrix clustering identified sites that are\noccupied by both wild type and Mi-E318K (Fig. 2d, sets B and E),\nwhereas some promoter sites are uniquely or preferentially occupied\nby Mi-E318K (Fig. 2d, sets A and D; Supplementary Table 5). For\nexample, a higher occupancy of the HIF1A promoter by Mi-E318K\ncompared to wild type is observed (Fig. 2e). Mi-E318K also showed\nincreased binding to the ABCB5 locus (Fig. 2e), the expression of\nwhich is increased in RCC4-expressing Mi-E318K. Of note, Mi-\nE318K binds more efficiently than wild type to the HMOX1 promoter\n(Supplementary Table 5), a gene involved in both kidney cancer18 and\nmelanoma cell growth19. Although the HIF1A promoter was better\noccupied and activated (in a gene promoter assay) by Mi-E318K\nthan by wild type, we observed equal amounts of HIF1A messenger\nRNA in Mi-E318K- or wild-type-infected A375 and RCC4 cells.\nHIF1A transcripts are subjected to post-transcriptional regulation that\ncontrols their stability20; this may mask the transcriptional effect of Mi-\nE318K. Alternatively, the cellular context or the chromatin landscape\nin RCC4 or A375 cells may not permit increased transcription. Indeed,\nthis was observed for MITF target genes such as TYR, TYRP1 and DCT,\nwhich were not upregulated by MITF overexpression in A375 cells.\nTaken together, our data indicate that the naturally occurring Mi-\nE318K severely impaired MITF SUMOylation and showed higher\nglobal transcriptional activity, in agreement with the currently accepted\nmodel of SUMO-mediated transcriptional repression21. The global\nincrease in Mi-E318K-occupied loci coupled with the existence of sites\nexclusively bound by the mutant protein indicate that SUMOylation\nregulates the repertoire of MITF target genes. SUMOylation-deficient\nMi-E318K protein may therefore result in the regulation of distinct sets\nof genes, hence leading to gain-of-function properties.\n\nTo evaluate the tumorigenic potential of Mi-E318K, we tested its\neffect on migration, invasion and colony formation of stable melanoma\ncells (501mel) expressing wild-type MITF or Mi-E318K (Fig. 3a). We\nobserved increased migration (Fig. 3b) and invasion (Fig. 3c) in two\ndifferent Mi-E318K clones compared to wild-type clones. Similar\nresults were obtained in VHL-deficient RCC4 cells (Fig. 3d, e) infected\nwith adenoviruses encoding wild type or Mi-E318K. In contrast, Mi-\nE318K caused barely significant effects in A375 cells (used also for\nexpression profiling) (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Overall, these data indicated that Mi-E318K was more potent than\nwild type for promoting invasive and tumorigenic behaviours in mel-\nanoma and RCC cells. However, Mi-E318K did not significantly stimu-\nlate melanoma or RCC cell growth (data not shown). These features are\nreminiscent of melanoma cell populations with increased invasive and\ndivision potential but with a slow growth rate, which are considered to\nbe melanoma-initiating cells22. Thus, Mi-E318K might favour a pheno-\ntypic switch of melanoma cells towards a tumour-initiating cell pheno-\ntype, possibly in synergy with hypoxia23.\n\nIndeed, both the epidermis (where melanocytes are located) and the\ninner renal medulla are physiologically hypoxic tissues24,25. Hypoxia is\ncapable of rapidly inducing HIF1A to initiate a cell-survival response26.\nOf note, several genes identified by expression profiling or ChIP-seq\n(HIF1A, CCR7, HMOX1) function in the hypoxia pathway. Both ultra-\nviolet exposure and hypoxia generate radical oxygen species (ROS). In\nturn, oxidative stress activates inflammatory pathways that can lead to\ncellular transformation, proliferation and stem cell survival, among\nother features27. Our IPA analysis associated the Mi-E318K signature\nwith inflammation, cell proliferation and cancer. Various environ-\nmental stresses, including hypoxia and ROS, were previously shown\nto induce global protein SUMOylation28. In this context, Mi-E318K,\nwhich prevents MITF SUMOylation, could impair the adaptation of\ncells to stress and initiate tumour formation. Our study has wide impli-\ncations for understanding the role of MITF and its SUMOylation in the\nphysiology and tumorigenesis of melanocytes and kidney cells.\n\nWe have identified a rare oncogenic germline substitution, Mi-\nE318K, that predisposes to both melanoma and RCC. Interestingly,\nMITF loss-of-function mutations are responsible for an inherited dis-\norder in neural crest cell development, the type 2a Waardenburg syn-\ndrome7. This is reminiscent of the RET oncogene, in which activating\ngermline mutations predispose to medullary thyroid carcinoma, but\nloss-of-function germline mutations predispose to Hirschsprung’s dis-\nease, a congenital absence of enteric neurons in the gastrointestinal\ntract29. Our data indicate that mutation screening in genetically\nenriched patients is a powerful strategy to identify rare genetic vari-\nation that confers a moderate risk of cancer30. Lastly, it highlights the\nrelevance of hereditary tumour models for shedding light on cell-\ngrowth-related signals and identifying cancer driver genes.\n\nMETHODS SUMMARY\nParticipants were included with the approval of an institutional review board.\nSanger sequencing of MITF isoforms was performed in 62 melanoma 1 RCC\ncases. Mutations numbering referred to NCBI accession NM_000248.3. Wild-type\nor Mi-E318K genotyping was performed in 1,659 controls and 829 cases by\nTaqMan; positive samples were checked by Sanger sequencing. Genome-wide\n\nSNP data were genotyped by the Centre National de Génotypage (CNG, CEA)\nusing Illumina technology. PCA was applied to the SNP data using EIGENSTRAT\nsoftware. Immunohistochemistry was performed on melanoma and kidney fixed\nsamples with anti-MITF antibody (Abcam, clone D5). Mutations in the two\nSUMO1 fixation sites, p.K182R and p.E318K, were generated with the\nQuickChange method in wild-type MITF-M and MITF-A isoforms and verified\nby sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into HEK293, 501mel, Melan-a and\nRCC4 cells with FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science). Western blotting\nand immunofluorescence were performed with antibodies to MITF (Abcam, clone\nC5), HA-tag, SUMO1 or ERK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Reporter assays were\nperformed by transient transfection in triplicate with lipofectamine (Invitrogen),\nand pCMVbGal was included to control transfection efficiency. Gene expression\nmicroarray assays were performed with Agilent technology by the Institut de\nCancérologie Gustave Roussy (IGR) genomics platform. ChIP-seq experiments\nwere performed by the Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et\nCellulaire (IGBMC) microarray and sequencing platforms. Colony forming assays\nwere performed after 14 days of culture; cells were fixed, stained with 0.4% crystal\nviolet, and photographed. Statistical analyses for comparison of allele frequencies\nbetween cases and controls were performed with Fisher’s exact test. All computa-\ntions were performed with Stata software, version 11. For functional assays, stat-\nistical significance was evaluated with the Student’s t-test. Results were considered\nsignificant when the Student’s t-test, *P value # 0.05, **P # 0.01, ***P # 0.001.\n\nFull Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of\nthe paper at www.nature.com/nature.\n\nReceived 1 February; accepted 2 September 2011.\n\nPublished online 19 October 2011.\n\n1.

Patients with melanoma and RCC. Sixty-two patients that\nhad developed both melanoma and RCC were included in the MELARISK col-\nlection at the Institut de Cancérologie Gustave Roussy (IGR) and other French\nhospitals, 71% were males. None of these patients carried a germline CDKN2A,\nCDK4 or VHL pathogenic mutation.\n\nPatients with melanoma only. The patients with melanoma were enrolled\nthrough a nationwide network of French dermatology and oncogenetic clinics that\nconstituted the Familial Melanoma Project and the MELARISK collection. The\npresent study investigated a total of 371 index cases from independent pedigrees\nwith a family history of melanoma (at least two melanoma cases) and/or pancreatic\ncancer, and 232 sporadic cases diagnosed with multiple primary malignant mel-\nanomas. A subset of the families (N 5 34) included a melanoma patient and\nrelatives with pancreatic cancer. These were part of the CDKN2A mutation testing\nprocedure; carriers of the CDKN2A mutation have high risk of developing pan-\ncreatic cancer31. All cases had confirmed diagnoses of malignant melanoma\nthrough medical records, review of pathological material, and/or pathological\nreports. For all these patients, mutation screening for CDKN2A (exon 1b, 1a, 2\nand 3) and CDK4 (exon 2) had been undertaken for molecular diagnosis purposes.\nNone of these patients carried a known CDKN2A or CDK4 pathogenic mutation.\n\nPatients with RCC only. Overall, 164 patients included in this study had\ndeveloped RCC only. Those patients had been recruited through French urology\nand oncogenetic clinics, within the French National Cancer Institute’s ‘Inherited\nPredisposition to Kidney Cancer’ network. They were considered ‘genetically\nenriched’ based on the following criteria: familial aggregation, young age of onset\nand rare histological subtypes. Out of the total of 164 patients, 79 had sporadic\nccRCC, 54 had papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC; with 6 type I PRCC, 19 type\nII PRCC, 1 mixed type PRCC and 28 unknown histological subtypes of PRCC), 1\nhad a mixed RCC phenotypes (that is, papillary and ccRCC), 5 had juvenile RCC\nand 25 had RCC of unknown histological subtype. None of the 79 patients with\nccRCC carried a VHL pathogenic germline mutation; none of the 19 patients with\nPRCCII carried a FH germline mutation; and none of the 6 patients with PRCCI\ncarried a MET germline mutation.\n\nControl subjects. Controls were supplemented by a population-based sample of\n1,659 French subjects that had participated in the Supplementation in Vitamins\nand Mineral Antioxidants (SU.VI.MAX) study32. We confirmed that these sub-\njects had not developed any cancer at the time of the present study.\n\nThe study was approved by an institutional review board (CCPPRB no. 01-09-\n05, Paris Necker) for the MELARISK collection and by the Ethical Committee of\nLe Kremlin-Bicêtre University Hospital, for the kidney cancer collection. It was\nconducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki Principles. All participating\nsubjects signed informed consent and provided blood samples. After informed\nconsent had been obtained from the subjects, DNA was extracted from peripheral\nblood lymphocytes with the QIAamp DNA Blood mini kit (QIAGEN), according\nto manufacturer guidelines.\nMITF gene sequencing. Sanger sequencing of MITF coding sequence, the intron–\nexon boundaries and the 8 alternative promoters was performed in DNA extracted\nfrom the blood of 62 patients affected with melanoma 1 RCC (primers available\nupon request) on a 3730 DNA Analyser (Applied Biosystems; ABI). Nucleotide\nnumber refers to the wild-type cDNA sequence of MITF (NM_000248.3) as\nreported in GenBank.\nGenotyping of Mi-E318K. Genotyping was carried out with Taqman according\nto the manufacturer recommendations. Primers and probes were supplied in the\nAssay-by-Design by Applied Biosystems (ABI). PCR reactions were performed\nwith 10 ng genomic DNA and 0.2mmol l21 TaqMan MGB probes. Probe 59-VIC-\nATCAAGCAAGAACCCG-39 was designed to match the wild-type allele, and\nprobe 59-6-FAM-CAAGCAAAAACCCG-39 was designed to match the mutant\nallele (underlined bold indicates the nucleotide at the mutation site). PCR thermo-\ncycling was performed on ABI thermocyclers, as follows: 95 uC for 15 min; 30\ncycles of 95 uC for 15 s and 60 uC for 1 min. Assays were carried out in 96-well\nplates that included a negative control (with no DNA) and positive controls (DNA\nfrom subjects with Mi-E318K). Plates were read on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR\nSystem (ABI) with Sequence Detection Software (ABI). Carriers of Mi-E318K\nwere confirmed by Sanger sequencing with the above protocol and primers for\nMITF exon 9.\nPCA of genome-wide SNP data. To verify that the association of Mi-E318K with\nmelanoma and/or RCC was not influenced by population stratification, we carried\nout PCA of SNP data across the genome in cases and controls that had been\ngenome-wide genotyped and satisfied stringent quality control criteria. A total\nof 1,628 controls and 569 cases affected with melanoma, RCC or both cancers were\ngenotyped by the Centre National de Génotypage (CNG) using Illumina\nHumanHap300 Beadchip version 2 duo array for controls and Illumina\nHumancnv370k and Human660W-Quad arrays for cases. Samples were excluded\n\nfor any of the following reasons: (1) a call rate of less than 97% of the total number\nof SNPs on the chip (222 samples); (2) sex as ascertained by genotyping not\nmatching reported sex (10 samples); (3) heterozygosity on autosomes departing\nfrom the estimated expected value (7 samples); (4) relatedness with another sam-\nple (4 samples). This resulted in exclusion of 243 samples. PCA was then applied to\n1,954 subjects that passed quality control using EIGENSTRAT software33. To\nidentify individuals of non-European ethnicity, SNPs were thinned to reduce\nlinkage disequilibrium and combined with the HapMap data of wide-ranging\nethnicity. The first two principal components (PCs) clearly separated the\nHapMap data into distinct clusters according to ethnicity and identified 29 study\nsamples of non-European ancestry who were excluded. The remaining 1,925\nEuropean ethnicity samples (1,389 controls, 536 cases) were analysed similarly\nwithout the Hapmap data. Plotting the first two principal components showed\nappropriate clustering of cases and controls (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nMITF immunohistochemistry. Briefly, 4-mm tissue sections were cut from par-\naffin-embedded blocks, deparaffinized and rehydrated. RCC (patient ID numbers\n10276, 24976, 11473, 21309, 21939, 25220, 26534; all in Supplementary Table 2)\nimmunohistochemistry was performed with a three-step, avidin–biotin–peroxidase\nmethod. Staining was performed in an automated Dako Autostainer. Heat-mediated\nantigen retrieval was performed in 0.1 mol l21 pH 6.0 citrate, and samples were\nheated in a water bath for 30 min in a Dakolink processor (Dako). Monoclonal\nmouse anti-human MITF (Clone D5, Dako, 1/100) was incubated with the samples\nfor 30 min at room temperature (22 uC). SSM immunohistochemistry (patient ID\nnumbers 19525, 24976, 10254, 15168, 15012, 21000, 22112, 27708 all in\nSupplementary Table 2 except number 27708 in Supplementary Fig. 1) was per-\nformed with a three-step avidin–biotin–alkaline-phosphatase method. Staining was\nperformed in a Roche Diagnostics Benchmark XT automated stainer. Heat-\nmediated antigen retrieval was performed in the automat in cell conditioning solu-\ntion 1 (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h (Dako). Monoclonal mouse anti-Human MITF\n(Clone D5, Roche Diagnostics, pre-diluted) was incubated with samples for 16 min\nat room temperature. All slides were then counterstained with haematoxylin.\nAppropriate negative and positive controls were prepared in parallel.\nFunctional assays. Plasmids. The pcDNA3-Mi construct, which carried the\nM-MITF isoform and the 3M vector have been described previously34. The\nA-MITF isoform was a gift from H. Arnheiter (NIH). The MITF mutations,\np.K182R and/or Mi-E318K, were generated with the QuickChange method\n(Stratagene) with the following sense primers and their reverse complements:\nMi-K182R 59-CTTCCCAACATAAGAAGGGAGCTCACAGC-39; MI-E318K\n59-GGATCATCAAGCAAAAACCAGTTCTTGAG-39. Mutations were con-\nfirmed by DNA sequencing. His–SUMO1 and HA–SUMO2 were a gift from A.\nDejean and have been described elsewhere35.\n\nCell cultures, transfections, and immunoblots. Human 501mel and A375 mel-\nanoma cells, human RCC4 cells and HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM supple-\nmented with 7% FBS. Melan-a cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, 7% FCS, 200 nM\nTPA and 200 pM cholera toxin. All the cells were maintained at 37 uC in a humidi-\nfied atmosphere containing 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes\n(104 cells per well) and transfected with the above-mentioned plasmids (2mg of\ntotal DNA per well) and FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Forty-eight hours\nlater, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed at 95 uC in 13 loading buffer\n(41.6 mM Tris, pH 6.8, 1.5% SDS, 6.7% glycerol). Proteins were resolved by elec-\ntrophoresis in 10% SDS–polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF mem-\nbranes. Proteins were detected with ECL (Amersham) and antibodies to MITF\n(Abcam), HA-tag (Abcam), SUMO1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or ERK2 (Santa\nCruz Biotechnology).\n\nReporter assays. Human 501mel melanoma cells and HEK293 cells were seeded\nin 24-well dishes (25 3 103 cells per well). Subsequently, cells were transiently\ntransfected with 0.3mg reporter plasmid (3M, pHIF1A, pMET), 0.05mg of\nMITF-encoding plasmids or empty, control pcDNA3 (EV), 2ml of lipofectamine\nreagent (Invitrogen) and 0.05mg of pCMVbGal for controlling the variability in\ntransfection efficiency. Cells were lysed 48 h later and assayed for luciferase and\nb-galactosidase activities. Transfections were repeated at least three times.\n\nImmunofluorescence. HEK293 cells were seeded on glass coverslips (100 3 103\n\ncells) in 6-well dishes, and transfected with 3mg of the different MITF mutants and\n10ml lipofectamine. Forty-eight hours later, cells were fixed for 10 min with 4%\nparaformaldehyde, permeabilized for 2 min with 0.1% Triton X-100/1% bovine\nserum albumin (BSA), and treated for 2 min with NH4Cl 50 mM . Then, samples\nwere washed three times in PBS and stained for 1 h with monoclonal anti-MITF\nantibody (Abcam, clone D5) in 1% BSA/PBS. Next, samples were washed three\ntimes in PBS for 5 min each and then stained secondarily for 1 h with Alexa-594-\nconjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Molecular probes) in 1% BSA. Cells were\ncounterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), mounted with\nFluoromount-G (Southern Biotech), and examined with a Zeiss Axiophot micro-\nscope equipped with epifluorescent illumination.\n\nRESEARCH LETTER\n\nMacmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved©2011\n\n\n\nColony forming assay. Immortalized Melan-a mouse melanocytes, A375\nhuman melanoma cells and RCC4 human cells (8 3 104 cells per well) were\ntransfected with wild type or Mi-E318K (3mg total DNA per well and 10%\npBABE-puro) with the FuGENE 6 Transfection reagent (Roche Applied\nScience). Puromycin (1mg ml21) was added to media at 48 h post-transfection.\nFourteen days later, the cells were fixed and stained with 0.4% crystal violet, and\nthe plates were photographed.\n\nEstablishing stable 501mel cells that expressed tagged MITF. 501mel cells were\ntransfected with FuGENE 6 reagent, a vector encoding puromycin resistance, and\na pCMV vector that was either an empty, control vector or a vector encoding\n33HA-tagged MITF (wild type or Mi-E318K). Transfected cells were selected\nwith puromycin; the expression of MITF was verified by western blot analysis\nwith anti-MITF (Abcam, C5) or anti-HA (Roche, 12CA5) antibodies.\n\nMigration and invasion assays. Migration (on uncoated filters) and invasion (on\ncoated filters with matrigel) were investigated in a Boyden chamber system that\ncomprised 24-well plates and 8-mm pore filter inserts (BD Bioscience). Stable\n501mel melanoma cells (2 3 105 cells), A375 melanoma cells (1.5 3 105 cells)\nand RCC4 renal cancer cells (5 3 104 cells) were infected with control vector or\nadenovirus that encoded wild type or Mi-E318K at a multiplicity of infection\n(MOI) of 20 for 24 h, were then resuspended in serum-free DMEM and seeded\non the upper chamber inserts. DMEM with 7% FCS was placed into the lower\nchamber. Twenty-four hours (501mel and RCC4) or 6 h (A375 cells) later, cells\nadherent to the underside of the filters were fixed with 4% PFA and stained with\n0.4% crystal violet. Adherent cells were counted in five random fields at 3200\nmagnification. Results represented the average of duplicate samples from three\nindependent experiments.\nGene expression arrays. Three replicates were performed for both RCC4 and\nA375 cells. mRNA was isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen) from A375 melanoma\ncells and from RCC4 cells infected with either control, wild type or Mi-E318K,\naccording to standard procedures. Briefly, probes were synthesized from 500 ng of\ntotal RNA in two steps, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The two\nsamples to be compared were labelled separately with different fluorescent dyes,\ncyanine-3 (Cy3) and cyanine-5 (Cy5). For each sample, 1mg of purified cRNA\nlabelled in cy5 was mixed with the same amount of cRNA labelled in cy3. Label\nincorporation was checked on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. Hybridizations\nwere performed with a dye-swap strategy on whole-human-genome dual colour\n8 3 60K oligonucleotide microarrays (design 028004; Agilent Technologies).\nFeature extraction software provided by Agilent (version 10.7.3.1) was used to\nquantify the intensity of fluorescent images and to apply a linear/lowess normal-\nization to correct for artefacts caused by nonlinear rates of dye incorporation and\ninconsistent relative fluorescence intensities between some green and red dyes. All\ndata were imported into Resolver software (Rosetta Biosoftware) for database\nmanagement, quality control, computational re-\ncombination of dye-swaps and statistical analysis. Mi-E318K specific signature\nwas generated using the following parameters: intensity .50; fold change .1.5; P\nvalue ,0.05. Functional analysis was carried out with the Ingenuity Pathway\nAnalysis (Ingenuity System, http://www.ingenuity.com).\n\nChIP-seq. ChIP-seq was performed as previously described36. Briefly, chro-\nmatin was prepared from native 501mel cells or cells that stably expressed\nHA-tagged wild type or Mi-E318K. The isolated chromatin was HA-immu-\nnoprecipitated and sequenced with an Illumina GAIIx sequencer. The raw\ndata were analysed with the Illumina Eland pipeline V1.6 programme.\nPeak detection was performed with MACS software (http://liulab.dfci.har-\nvard.edu/MACS/), and the peaks were annotated with GPAT software (http://\nbips.u-strasbg.fr/GPAT/Gpat_home.html). Peak annotations were performed\nwith a window that included 620 kb from the coordinates at the beginning and\nend of RefSeq transcripts. The total number of reads for the wild-type data set was\n1.7 fold higher than for the Mi-E318K data set. To facilitate quantitative compar-\nisons, an appropriate number of reads was randomly removed from the wild-type\ndata set to match the number present in the Mi-E318K data set. Subsequently,\na quantitative comparison of the ChIP-seq data sets was performed with\nseqMINER37. Clustering was performed by counting the number of tags in a 36-\nbp sliding window for each ChIP-seq data set based on the coordinates of wild-type\nor Mi-E318K binding sites or on a reference sequence (RefSeq TSS). Only peaks\nwith $10 reads were used for comparison. A matrix of binding sites and densities\nwas generated and subjected to K-means clustering with the seqMINER pro-\ngramme.\nStatistical analysis. Fisher’s exact test was used to compare Mi-E318K allele\nfrequencies between cases and controls and among different groups of cases.\nThe odds ratios and confidence intervals associated with Mi-E318K carrier status\nwere estimated by exact logistic regression. Logistic regression was also used to test\nfor the effect of Mi-E318K on melanoma and/or RCC with and without adjusting\nfor the first ten principal components estimated from genome-wide SNP data in\npatients and controls who were genome-wide genotyped and passed quality con-\ntrol. All computations were performed with Stata software, version 11 (StataCorp\nLP). For functional assays, results were considered significant when the Student’s\nt-test, *P value was #0.05, **P # 0.01, ***P # 0.001.\n\n31. Goldstein, A. M. et al.
