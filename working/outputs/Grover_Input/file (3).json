Several regulatory\nmechanisms are involved in the development of sepsis. The\ndiscovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) suggests a novel regulatory\nmechanism for this process.\n\nmiRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules with\ncritical roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis\n[1]. Ample evidence suggests that miRNAs are key regulators\nin animal development and are involved in a variety of human\ndiseases [2]. The transcription of primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs)\nby RNA polymerase II is the first step of miRNA biogenesis. In\nthe nucleus, pri-miRNAs are converted into hairpin precursor\nmiRNAs (pre-miRNAs). Pre-miRNAs are transported into the\ncytoplasm where they are further processed into mature\nmiRNAs consisting of 22 nucleotides; Dicer is involved in these\nfinal processing events. Mature miRNAs have the ability to bind\nto the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of their target mRNAs in a\nsequence-specific manner [3], initiate partial or full degradation\nof mRNA transcripts, and regulate the expression of protein-\n\ncoding genes at the post-transcriptional level. The effects of\nmiRNAs are mediated by inhibiting the translation or\ndegradation of the target mRNA. TNF-α, an important\ninflammatory factor, is inhibited indirectly by miRNA-146a,\nwhich targets TRAF6 and IRAK1 [4], and directly by\nmiRNA-125b, which targets the 3’UTR of TNF-α mRNA[5].\nMore than 700 miRNAs have been identified in mammals to\ndate. These miRNAs are associated with diverse biological\nprocesses, such as the regulation of insulin secretion, viral\ninfection, and tumorigenesis. Previous studies have indicated\nthat most miRNAs play a role in innate immune responses and\ninflammation. In response to inflammation, some miRNAs are\nup-regulated, while some others are down-regulated. For\nexample, the expression of miRNA-146a, miRNA-155and\nmiRNA-21 are up-regulated in monocytes challenged by LPS\n[4,6,7], whereas that of miRNA-125b is down-regulated [5].\n\nmiRNA-155 was initially discovered as a proto-oncogene in\nlymphoma [8]. The overexpression of miRNA-155 has been\ndetected in B-cell lymphomas[9][10] and chronic lymphocytic\nleukemia[11]. It is also overexpressed in various solid tumors,\nincluding lung[12], breast[13], pancreatic[14], and thyroid\ncancers[15]. The roles of miRNA-155 in various physiological\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80547\n\n\n\nand pathological processes, such as hematopoietic lineage\ndifferentiation, inflammation and immunity, have been identified\nrecently [16]. miRNA-155 is required for the development of T\ncells, B cells, and dendritic cells. Previous studies have shown\nthat miRNA-155 plays an important role in immunoglobulin\nclass switching to IgG in B cells via the targeted repression of\nthe transcription factor PU.1 [17] and activation-induced\ncytidine deaminase (AID) [18]. Other validated target genes of\nmiRNA-155, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), IkappaB kinase ε\n(IKKε), Ets-1, and Meis1, are associated with the hematopoietic\nand immune systems [19–21]. miRNA-155 gene knockout mice\ndisplayed severe immune response deficiencies after pathogen\nexposure. In antigen-specific inflammatory responses against\nautologous tissue, miRNA-155 has been shown to promote\nautoimmune inflammation [22]. Furthermore, miRNA-155 has\nbeen found to be up-regulated in macrophages following\nstimulation by a broad range of inflammatory mediators [6].\nLPS induces the expression of miRNA-155 in the spleens of\nmice [5], but this increase in expression is not observed in\nother organs. The LPS-induced expression of miRNA-155\nshould be investigated in the liver because this organ is\ncommonly damaged in mice with sepsis.\n\nDexamethasone (DXM), a potent synthetic member of the\nglucocorticoid family, has anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic, anti-\nshock, and anti-endotoxin effects. DXM has been widely used\nto treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, including\nsevere sepsis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma,\nand systemic lupus erythematosus. In the cytoplasm, DXM\ninteracts with the glucocorticoid receptor and forms a ligand-\nreceptor complex, which subsequently translocates to the\nnucleus. In the nucleus, the complex binds to genomic DNA\nand regulates the expression of both anti-inflammatory and\ninflammatory genes at the transcriptional level. Moreover, DXM\nmay impact the activities of signal-dependent transcription\nfactors, including members of the activator protein 1 (AP-1) and\nnuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) families [23], to negatively regulate\ninflammatory responses. To elucidate the mechanism of DXM\nin regulating the inflammatory and immune response in mice\nwith sepsis, we established a mouse model of sepsis and\ndetermined the effect of DXM on the expression of miRNA-155\nin the liver.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals and treatment\nAnimal experiments were performed in strict accordance with\n\nthe Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of Sun\nYat-sen University. The protocol was approved by the\nCommittee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of the First\nAffiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. A total of 350\nfemale BALB/c mice (6-8 weeks of age and weighted 20-25 g)\nwere purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Sun\nYat-sen University (Guangzhou, China). Mice were housed in a\npathogen-free animal facility that was maintained at 24°C, 55%\nhumidity, and had a 12 h light/dark cycle. All mice had free\naccess to food and water, and they received humane care in\naccordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines\nand the legal requirements of China. The mouse model of\n\nsepsis was developed by intraperitoneal injections of LPS as\npreviously described[24].\n\nThree hundred mice were divided randomly into five groups,\nwith 60 mice in each group: <1> the normal saline (NS) control\ngroup received an intraperitoneal injection of 50 μl of NS; <2>\nthe LPS group received an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg\nE. coli LPS (Escherichia coli O55:B5, Sigma, St. Louis, MO,\nUSA); <3> the NS-LPS group received an intraperitoneal\ninjection of 50 μl NS 1 hour prior to LPS exposure; <4> the\nDXM-LPS group received an intraperitoneal injection of 5\nmg/kg DXM (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) dissolved in 50 μl NS\n1 hour prior to LPS exposure; and <5> the DXM group received\nan intraperitoneal injection of 5 mg/kg DXM dissolved in 50 μl\nNS. We prepared the DXM according to the manufacturer’s\ninstruction. The LPS and DXM were dissolved in sterile saline\nsolution under aseptic condition before injection. Ten mice from\neach group were killed at each indicated time point following\nLPS treatment (0, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours), and the liver\ntissue and peripheral blood were collected.\n\nThe remaining 50 mice were divided equally into five groups\nwhich received injection of 0, 0.5, 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg DXM,\nrespectively, dissolved in 50 μl NS 1 hour prior to LPS\nexposure and were killed at 12 h following LPS treatment. The\nliver tissues were collected.\n\nMeasurements of serum ALT, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10\nlevels\n\nThe serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TNF-α,\nIL-6, and IL-10 were measured. Blood samples from the NS\nand LPS groups were centrifuged at 1,000 ×g at 4°C for 20\nminutes. Serum ALT was determined using a commercial kit\n(Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Serum\nlevels of TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-6 were quantified using an ELISA\nkit (R&D Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, USA). Initially, the serum\nfrom each mouse was added to 96-well plates (10 μl/well)\ncontaining capture antibodies specific to mouse TNF-α, IL-6,\nand IL-10. Next, 100 μl of HRP-conjugated reagent was added\nto each well. The plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 hour,\nwashed, and a substrate solution was added to each well. The\nplates were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C, and\nsubsequently, a stop solution was added to each well. Finally,\nthe plates were read at 450 nm.\n\nMeasurement of tissue TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-10 levels\nLiver tissues were homogenized in ice-cold sterile saline at a\n\nratio of 1 ml per 100 mg tissue using an Ultra-turrax T18\nhomogenizer (IKA, Germany ). The homogenates were\ncentrifuged at 1,000 ×g at 4°C for 15 minutes. The supernatant\nwas transferred to a new tube and stored at -80°C. The amount\nof total protein was detected using the Bradford reagent\n(Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer's\ninstructions. A total of 50 μg of protein was used to examine\ntissue TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 levels with an ELISA Kit (R&D\nSystems, Inc, Minneapolis, USA).\n\nHistopathologic evaluation\nThe liver tissues were subjected to histological examination.\n\nAll liver tissues were immersed in 4% formaldehyde and\n\nDexamethasone Down-Regulates microRNA-155\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80547\n\n\n\nembedded in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded samples were\nthen cut into 4 μm thick sections, deparaffinized with xylene,\nrehydrated through a series of decreasing concentrations of\nethanol, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE). All samples\nwere examined and photographed using an OLYMPUS\nBX51WI optical microscope (Olympus, Japan).\n\nExtraction and measurement of miRNA\nTotal RNA was extracted from 100 mg of liver tissue with\n\nTrizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol\n(Invitrogen, California, USA). A total of 2 μg RNA was used to\nsynthesize first-strand cDNA using the One Step PrimeScript\nmiRNA cDNA Synthesis Kit (Takara, Japan). The miRNA-155\nlevel was quantified by real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using SYBR\nPremix Ex Taq II (Takara, Japan) with U6 small nuclear RNA\nas the internal normalized reference. Real-time PCR primers\nwere provided by RiboBio (Guangzhou, China). The expression\nof miRNA-155 was measured using the Roche Light Cycler 480\nReal-Time PCR system. PCR reactions were performed at\n95°C for 10 minutes followed by 40 cycles of denaturing at\n95°C for 15 seconds and an annealing/extension at 60°C for 60\nseconds. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The qRT-\nPCR data were analyzed and expressed as relative miRNA\nlevels of the cycle threshold value, which was subsequently\nconverted to fold change with 2–△△CT method[25] .\n\nStatistical analysis\nStatistical changes in cytokine and ALT expression were\n\ndetermined with the two-tailed student T test; the changes of\nmiRNA expression were analyzed by analysis of variance\n(ANOVA). Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.\n\nResults\n\nAn acute inflammatory response was induced in mice\nwith LPS-induced sepsis\n\nAfter LPS exposure, the expression of inflammatory\ncytokines TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 were dramatically increased in\nserum (Figure 1A-C) and liver tissues of BALB/c mice (Figure\n2A-C). Serum and tissue TNF-α levels simultaneously peaked\nat approximately 2 hours after LPS exposure and quickly\ndeclined to baseline levels over 12 hours (Figure 1A and 2A).\nSerum and tissue IL-6 levels peaked at 6 hours and declined\nby 12 hours, but IL-6 could still be detected at 24 hours after\nLPS exposure (Figure 1B and 2B). Serum and tissue IL-10\nlevels as well as serum ALT level increased with time after LPS\ninjection (Figure 1C, 2C, and 1D).\n\nLiver tissues were observed under a microscope with HE\nstaining to investigate the inflammatory reaction. Compare to\nthe normal liver tissue pathology (Figure 3A), The recruitment\nof inflammatory cells into the liver was observed 2 hours after\nLPS injection. A large number of leukocytes infiltrated in the\nportal tracts and sinusoids. Furthermore, hepatocyte\nvacuolation, architectural distortion, and nodular necrosis were\nevident at 12 hours after LPS injection (Figure 3B).\n\nExpression of miRNA-155 was up-regulated in the\nlivers of mice with LPS-induced sepsis\n\nThe expression of miRNA-155 in the liver peaked at 12 hours\nafter LPS exposure, approximately 70-fold (72.56 ±\n9.34 )higher than the level observed in the NS group, and\nreturned to the baseline level after 48 hours (Figure 4A).\n\nEffect of DXM on the expression of inflammatory\ncytokines and miRNA-155 in liver tissue\n\nCompared with the increased levels of TNF-α, IL-6, and\nIL-10 in liver tissues in the LPS group, those levels in the NS-\nLPS group were similar, whereas those in the DXM-LPS group\nwere significantly decreased (Figure 2). Moreover,\npretreatment with DXM appeared to prevent most of the\npathological damages induced by LPS in the livers (Figure 3C).\nCompared with the increased expression of miRNA-155 in the\nLPS and NS-LPS groups, the LPS-induced overexpression of\nmiRNA-155 was suppressed in the DXM-LPS group at 2 hours\nafter treatment, and the greatest reduction occurred at 12\nhours (Figure 4A). The expression level of miRNA-155 in the\nDXM group was significantly down-regulated from 6 to 12\nhours after treatment (Figure 4A). Furthermore, we found that\nDXM suppressed miRNA-155 expression in a dose-dependent\nmanner (Figure 4B).\n\nDiscussion\n\nTo investigate the role of miRNA-155 during sepsis, we\ndetected the dynamic changes in miRNA-155 expression in the\nliver of mice with LPS-induced sepsis and determined the\nregulatory effect of DXM on LPS-induced miRNA-155\noverexpression. We found that the expression of inflammatory\nmediators TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 significantly increased in the\nserum and liver after LPS exposure, which initiated the\nsystemic inflammatory response and tissue injury. As a\nbiomarker of liver injury, ALT expression increased at 2 hours\nfollowing LPS challenge, and hepatocyte vacuolation,\narchitectural distortion and nodular necrosis became evident\nover time. The expression of miRNA-155 was also up-\nregulated, coincident with the up-regulation of inflammatory\ncytokines. These observations were consistent with our\nprevious research [26].\n\nThe simultaneous increase in the expression of miRNA-155\nand inflammatory cytokines in mice with LPS-induced sepsis\nmay attribute to their interactions. Previous study found that\nTNF-α stimulated the expression of miRNA-155[27]. On the\nother hand, Eμ-miRNA-155 transgenic mice, which\noverexpress miRNA-155 in cells from the B-cell lineage,\nproduce more TNF-α when compared with wild-type mice after\nLPS exposure, indicating that miRNA-155 may increase the\nproduction of inflammatory mediators [5]. Similarly, Jiang et al.\n[28] stimulated the breast cancer cells with IL-6 and found that\nexpression of miRNA-155 increase, suggesting that IL-6 also\ninduces the miRNA-155 expression. Compared with the pro-\ninflammatory cytokines TNF-α or IL-6, IL-10, which service as\nan important anti-inflammatory cytokine, prevents\ninflammation-mediated tissue damage by targeting various\nleukocytes and repressing excessive inflammatory responses\n\nDexamethasone Down-Regulates microRNA-155\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 November 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 11 | e80547\n\n\n\n[29]. It has been found to inhibit miRNA-155 transcription by\nToll-like receptors in a STAT3-dependent manner[30,31], and\nmiRNA-155-deficient CD4+ T cells have been shown to\nproduce more IL-10[32]. However, we observed simultaneous\nup-regulation of miRNA-155 and IL-10. This may be related to\nthe complex internal environment.\n\nDXM can induce anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit pro-\ninflammatory cytokines at the transcriptional level, and thus\ncould be used to treat sepsis. Consistent with previous studies,\nour data showed that the increased serum and tissue TNF-α\nand IL-6 levels in mice with early stages of sepsis were down-\nregulated by DXM. miRNA-155 and DXM are both regulators of\ninflammation and immunity, but the relationship between them\nrequires further investigation. Moschos et al [7] have found\nlimited effect of DXM on LPS-induced expression of miRNAs in\nthe lungs of mice. We found that the expression level of\nmiRNA-155 in the liver tissues from the LPS group was\napproximately 70 folds higher than the NS group, but this\nincrease was impaired by DXM pretreatment. DXM may inhibit\nLPS-induced miRNA-155 expression indirectly by reducing the\nexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. On other hand, the\nexpression level of miRNA-155 in the DXM group was even\nlower than that in the NS group. DXM reduced the basal\n\nexpression level of miRNA-155 in mouse liver without LPS\nexposure, but did not reduce the basal expression of pro-\ninflammatory cytokines, indicating that other mechanisms may\nbe involved in this process. In addition, we found that DXM\nsuppressed miRNA-155 expression in the liver tissues in a\ndose-dependent manner. This change in miRNA-155\nexpression may be related to the levels of inflammatory\ncytokines. LPS may induce the expression of miRNA-155 by\npromoting the expression of inflammatory factors. A wide\nvariety of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, can\nup-regulate miRNA-155 expression. This up-regulation can be\nexplained by the functions of pro-inflammatory transcription\nfactors, such as NF-κB and AP-1, which promote the\ntranscription of BIC genes. BIC genes contain the pri-\nmiRNA-155 transcription gene [33]. However, DXM may\nreduce the production of TNF-α by activating multiple signaling\npathways, such as the PI3K, NF-κB, Akt/PKB, and MAPK\nsignaling pathways [34,35]. Therefore, DXM may reduce\nmiRNA-155 expression in the liver by inhibiting pro-\ninflammatory cytokine expression. DXM reduced the baseline\nexpression of miRNA-155 but did not suppress the baseline\nlevels of TNF-α and IL-6, suggesting that down-regulation of\nmiRNA-155 by DXM may not depend completely on the ability\n\nFigure 1.
