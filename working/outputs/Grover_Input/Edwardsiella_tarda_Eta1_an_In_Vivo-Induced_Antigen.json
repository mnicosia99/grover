tarda Eta1, an In Vivo-Induced Antigen That Is Involved\nin Host Infection\n\nYun Sun,a,c Wen-Jiang Zheng,a,b,c Yong-Hua Hu,a Bo-Guang Sun,a and Li Suna\n\nKey Laboratory of Experimental Marine Biology, Institute of Oceanology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Qingdao, Chinaa; Lanzhou Branch, National Science Library,\nChinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou, Gansu, Chinab; and Graduate University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Chinac\n\nEdwardsiella tarda, a Gram-negative bacterium, is a severe fish pathogen that can also infect humans. In this study, we identi-\nfied, via in vivo-induced antigen technology, an E. tarda antigen, Eta1, and analyzed its function in a Japanese flounder\n(Paralichthys olivaceus) model. Eta1 is composed of 226 residues and shares homology with putative bacterial adhesins. Quanti-\ntative real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis indicated that when cultured in vitro, eta1 expression was growth phase\ndependent and reached maximum at mid-logarithmic phase. During infection of flounder lymphocytes, eta1 expression was\ndrastically increased at the early stage of infection. Compared to the wild type, the eta1-defective mutant, TXeta1, was unaffected\nin growth but exhibited attenuated overall virulence, reduced tissue dissemination and colonization capacity, and impaired abil-\nity to invade flounder lymphocytes and to block the immune response of host cells. The lost virulence of TXeta1 was restored\nwhen a functional eta1 gene was reintroduced into the strain. Western blot and immunodetection analyses showed that Eta1 is\nlocalized to the outer membrane and exposed on the surface of E. tarda and that recombinant Eta1 (rEta1) was able to interact\nwith flounder lymphocytes. Consistent with these observations, antibody blocking of Eta1 inhibited E. tarda infection at the\ncellular level. Furthermore, when used as a subunit vaccine, rEta1 induced strong protective immunity in flounder against lethal\nE. tarda challenge. Taken together, these results indicate that Eta1 is an in vivo-induced antigen that mediates pathogen-host\ninteraction and, as a result, is required for optimal bacterial infection.\n\nEdwardsiella tarda is a Gram-negative, motile, rod-shaped bac-terium of the family Enterobacteriaceae. It is a pathogen with a\nbroad host range that includes fish, birds, reptiles, and humans. E.\ntarda infection of humans can cause gastrointestinal symptoms\nand other disorders, such as myonecrosis and wound infections\n(9, 21). In aquaculture, E. tarda is considered a severe pathogen\nbecause of its ability to infect a wide range of marine and freshwa-\nter fish, including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), tur-\nbot (Scophtalmus maximus), tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), eels\n(Anguilla japonica), and channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) (17,\n37). E. tarda infection of fish may lead to the development of a\nsystemic disease called edwardsiellosis, which in Japanese floun-\nder is often manifested in hemorrhage, septicemia, skin lesions,\nand necrosis of liver, gut, and kidney (19, 26).\n\nFunctional studies have identified a number of E. tarda systems\nand factors that are involved in pathogenesis (14, 24). It is known\nthat E. tarda enters host fish through the gastrointestinal tract, the\ngills, and the body surface and is able to resist the immune defense\nmediated by host complements and phagocytes (16, 23). Studies\nin fish models, such as blue gourami and flounder, have indicated\nthat effective E. tarda infection requires two virulence-associated\nsystems, i.e., type III (T3SS) and type VI (T6SS) secretion systems,\nwhich are vital to E. tarda invasion and intracellular replication\n(22, 35, 42, 46). Other factors known to be involved in E. tarda\npathogenicity are hemolysin (8, 29, 40, 41), catalase (25), super-\noxide dismutase (4), heat shock proteins (5, 6), Dps (47), and the\nLuxS/AI-2 quorum-sensing system (43, 44). A recent study based\non genomic subtractive hybridization identified an autotrans-\nporter adhesin, AIDA, in atypical strains of fish-pathogenic E.\ntarda (27). However, the precise functions of these virulence fac-\ntors during E. tarda infection and the mechanism of disease oc-\ncurrence are unclear.\n\nIn previous studies, we have utilized the approach of in vivo-\n\ninduced antigen technology (IVIAT) to discover potential viru-\nlence factors associated with E. tarda infection (10, 11). In the\ncurrent study, we examined the biological properties and function\nof a putative adhesin, Eta1, identified via IVIAT. We found that\nexpression of eta1 was drastically enhanced during infection of\nhost cells and that mutation of eta1 attenuates E. tarda virulence at\nthe cellular and tissue levels. In addition, we also observed inter-\naction between recombinant Eta1 and host lymphocytes, and\nblocking of this interaction inhibits the infectivity of E. tarda.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and growth conditions. E. coli BL21, BL21(DE3), and\nDH5� were purchased from Tiangen (Beijing, China). E. coli S17-1�pir\nwas purchased from Biomedal (Sevilla, Spain). E. tarda TX01 was isolated\nfrom the kidneys of diseased flounder (31) and is naturally resistant to\nrifampin. All strains were grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) (28) at 37°C\n(for E. coli) or 28°C (for E. tarda). Where indicated, appropriate antibiot-\nics were supplemented as follows: chloramphenicol, 30 �g/ml; polymyxin\nB, 100 �g/ml; and rifampin, 20 �g/ml. All antibiotics were purchased\nfrom Sangon, Shanghai, China.\n\nFish used for infection study. Japanese flounder (average weight, 12.1\ng) were purchased from a local fish farm and maintained at 22°C in aer-\nated seawater. The fish were acclimatized in the laboratory for 2 weeks\n\nReceived 24 January 2012 Returned for modification 16 February 2012\nAccepted 4 May 2012\n\nPublished ahead of print 14 May 2012\n\nEditor: B.

The putative amino acid\nsequence of Eta1 was analyzed using the BLAST program at the National\nCenter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Expert Protein\nAnalysis System. Domain search was performed with the conserved do-\nmain search program of NCBI. The signal peptide search was performed\nwith SignalP 3.0. The theoretical molecular mass and theoretical isoelec-\ntric point were predicted using EditSeq in the DNASTAR software pack-\nage (Madison, WI).\n\nPreparation of flounder HK lymphocytes. To prepare flounder head\nkidney (HK) lymphocytes, HK was removed from three flounder (average\nweight, 796 g) under aseptic conditions and washed 3 times with phos-\nphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 U of penicillin and strepto-\nmycin (Solarbio, Beijing, China). The tissue was passed through a metal\nmesh, and the cell suspension was overlaid on 1.070 and 1.077 discontin-\nuous density of Percoll solution (Solarbio, Beijing, China). After centrif-\nugation at 300 � g for 30 min at 4°C, the interface fraction containing\nlymphocytes was collected and washed 3 times with PBS. The lymphocytes\nwere resuspended in L-15 medium (Thermo Scientific HyClone, Beijing,\nChina), and the viability of the cells was examined by the trypan blue dye\nexclusion method. The cells were adjusted to 2 � 105 viable cells/ml in\nL-15, distributed into 96-well tissue culture plates, and cultured at 22°C.\n\nqRT-PCR analysis of eta1 expression. To examine eta1 expression in\nLB medium, E. tarda TX01 was grown in LB medium at 28°C to optical\ndensities at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.25, 0.5, 0.9, 1.25, and 1.5. The cells were\nharvested by centrifugation and used for total RNA extraction with an HP\nTotal RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek). One microgram of total RNA was used\nfor cDNA synthesis with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen,\nCarlsbad, CA). Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-\nPCR) was carried out as described previously (48) in an Eppendorf Mas-\ntercycler (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) using the SYBR ExScript\nqRT-PCR Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) with 16S rRNA as a reference, as\ndescribed previously (43). The PCR primers for eta1 were RT-F1 (5=-GT\nCAGGAAAGTGATTGGTGGC-3=) and RT-R1 (5=-TCCAATACTCCTT\nCTCGGTGC-3=). The PCR primers for the 16S rRNA gene were 16S933F\n(5=-GCACAAGCGGTGGAGCAT-3=) and 16SRTR2 (5=-GCCATGCAG\nCACCTGTCTC-3=). The PCR analysis was performed four times. All data\nare given in terms of relative mRNA expressed as means plus or minus\nstandard errors of the means (SE).\n\nTo examine eta1 expression during infection of host cells, TX01 was\ncultured in LB medium to an OD600 of 0.8; the cells were collected by\ncentrifugation and resuspended in PBS to 107 CFU/ml. For cellular infec-\ntion, TX01 (106 CFU/well) was added to HK lymphocytes cultured in\n96-well culture plates (105 cells/well) or, as controls, to 96-well culture\nplates containing L-15 medium without lymphocytes. The plates were\nincubated at 25°C for 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h at 25°C. After the\nincubation, the plates containing lymphocytes were washed 3 times with\nPBS to remove unattached bacteria, and the cells were then used for total\nRNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis of eta1 expression as described\nabove. The TX01 in the control plates was collected by centrifugation and\nused for total RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis as described above.\n\nPlasmid and strain construction. To construct pEtEta1, which ex-\npresses eta1, eta1 was amplified by PCR with primers 81F1 (5=-CGCATA\nTGGAGAATAATTTACTCGGCGA-3= [underlined sequence, NdeI site])\nand 81R1 (5=-CTCGAGTTCCCCCACTTCCTTATTTCT-3= [underlined\nsequence, XhoI site]); the PCR products were ligated with the T-A cloning\nvector pBS-T (Tiangen, Beijing, China), resulting in pBSEta1, which was\ndigested with NdeI/XhoI, and the fragment containing eta1 was retrieved\nand inserted into pET258 (32) between NdeI and XhoI sites. To construct\nthe eta1-defective strain TXeta1, an internal fragment of eta1 (positions 67\nto 303) was generated by PCR with primers KOF1 (5=-GGATCCGCACA\nATCCTAGAATCAGTA-3= [underlined sequence, BamHI site]) and\nKOR1 (5=-GGATCCTAACTTCCATTGGCTATCT-3= [underlined se-\n\nquence, BamHI site]). The PCR products were inserted into the suicide\nplasmid pDM4 (18) at the compatible BglII site, resulting in pDMEta1.\nS17-1�pir was transformed with pDMEta1, and the transformants were\nconjugated with TX01 as described previously (43). The transconjugants\nwere selected on LB agar plates supplemented with polymyxin B and\nchloramphenicol. One of the selected mutants was named TXeta1. Muta-\ntion of eta1 in TXeta1 was confirmed by PCR analysis and subsequent\nsequencing of the PCR products and by Western blot analysis. To con-\nstruct TXeta1C, pBSEta1 was digested with NdeI/XhoI, and the fragment\ncontaining eta1 was retrieved and inserted into the expression plasmid\npBT3 (45) between NdeI and XhoI sites, resulting in pBT3Eta1. TXeta1\nwas transformed with pBT3Eta1 via electroporation, and the transfor-\nmants were selected on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (re-\nsistance marker of pBT3Eta1). One of the transformants was named\nTXeta1C.\n\nPurification of recombinant protein and preparation of antiserum.\nRecombinant Eta1 (rEta1) was purified as follows. E. coli BL21(DE3) was\ntransformed with pEtEta1; the transformants were cultured in LB me-\ndium at 37°C to mid-logarithmic phase, and expression of eta1 was in-\nduced by adding isopropyl-�-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final\nconcentration of 1 mM. After growing at 37°C for an additional 5 h, the\ncells were harvested by centrifugation, and His-tagged rEta1 was purified\nunder native conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid columns (GE\nHealthcare, Piscataway, NJ) as recommended by the manufacturer. The\npurified protein was dialyzed in PBS and concentrated with Amicon Ultra\nCentrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated\nprotein was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-\ntrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and visualized after staining with Coomassie\nbrilliant blue R-250. The concentration of the protein was determined\nusing the Bradford method (3) with bovine serum albumin as the stan-\ndard. Preparation of rat anti-rEta1 serum and determination of the titers\nand specificities of anti-rEta1 antibodies were performed as described\npreviously (32).\n\nDetermination of the subcellular location of Eta1. (i) Western blot-\nting. TX01 and TXeta1 were grown in LB medium to an OD600 of 0.5 and\nharvested by centrifugation at 6,000 � g for 10 min at 4°C. Extracellular\nproteins were prepared by concentrating the supernatant 100 times using\nAmicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Cyto-\nplasmic and periplasmic proteins were prepared as reported previously\n(45). To prepare outer membrane proteins, the cell pellet was washed 3\ntimes with PBS and resuspended in ice-cold buffer I (50 mM Tris · Cl, 1\nmM EDTA, pH 7.5). The cells were broken by sonication on ice, followed\nby centrifugation as described above. The supernatant was collected and\ncentrifuged at 100,000 � g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.1\nM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM dithiothre-\nitol (DTT), and 2% Sarkosyl and incubated at 37°C for 1 h with mixing\nevery 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 � g for 1 h at 4°C,\nand the pellet was resuspended in buffer I. The concentration of the pu-\nrified proteins was determined using the Bradford method (3). Western\nblotting was performed as follows. The proteins were subjected to electro-\nphoresis in 0.1% SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the\nproteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes\nwere blocked for 3 h with 2% (wt/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA)-0.1%\n(wt/vol) azide-PBS containing 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (PBS-T), fol-\nlowed by washing with PBS-T three times. The blocked membranes were\nincubated for 2 h with antiserum against rEta1 or antiserum against re-\ncombinant LuxS (rLuxS), an intracellular protein of E. tarda (43). The\nantisera were diluted in PBS-T containing 2% (wt/vol) BSA to 1/500. The\nmembranes were washed three times with PBS-T. Primary antibodies\nwere detected by incubating the membranes with anti-rat IgG-horserad-\nish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (Tiangen, Beijing, China) (1/1,000 dilu-\ntion in PBS-T) for 1 h in PBS-T–BSA. The membranes were washed three\ntimes with PBS-T, and the antibody was detected with the HRP-DAB kit\n(Tiangen, Beijing, China). The color reaction was stopped after 30 min by\nseveral washes with water, and the membranes were air dried.\n\nAn E. tarda Antigen Involved in Host Infection\n\nAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2949\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\n(ii) immunofluorescence study. TX01 and TXeta1 were cultured in\nLB medium to an OD600 of 0.5. The cells were washed and diluted in PBS\nto 108 CFU/ml. Three hundred microliters of bacterial suspension was\ndropped onto a glass slide, and the slide was incubated at room tempera-\nture for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min,\nfollowed by washing 3 times with PBS. Rat anti-rEta1 serum, preimmune\nserum, and rat anti-rLuxS serum were diluted 500 times in PBS, and 300\n�l diluted serum was added to the bacterial cells on the slide. The slide was\nincubated at 30°C for 2 h and washed 3 times with PBS. Fluorescein iso-\nthiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rat IgG (Bioss, Beijing, China) was\ndiluted 1,000 times, and 300 �l of the diluted antibody was added to the\nslide. The slide was incubated and washed as described above and ob-\nserved with a fluorescence microscope (Nikon E800; Japan).\n\nTissue dissemination and mortality analysis. For tissue dissemina-\ntion analysis, TXeta1, TXeta1C, and TX01 were cultured in LB medium to\nan OD600 of 0.8. The cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in\nseawater. Japanese flounder were divided randomly into four groups (n �\n35) and immersed in seawater containing or not containing (control) 108\n\nCFU/ml of TXeta1, TXeta1C, or TX01. The blood, liver, kidney, and\nspleen were taken aseptically from the fish (five from each group) at 12 h\npostinfection. Bacterial recovery from the tissues was determined as re-\nported previously (43). The rest of the infected fish were monitored daily\nfor mortality for 20 days.\n\nE. tarda infection of host cells and bacterial-recovery analysis. To\nexamine E. tarda infection, TXeta1 and TX01 were cultured in LB me-\ndium to an OD600 of 0.8. The cells were washed in PBS and resuspended in\nL-15 to 107 CFU/ml. HK lymphocytes cultured in 96-well cell culture\nplates were supplemented with TXeta1 or TX01 (106 CFU/well). The\nplates were incubated at 30°C for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 5 h, followed by washing\n3 times with PBS. The cells were incubated with penicillin and streptomy-\ncin (100 U) for 2 h at 25°C to kill extracellular bacteria. Bacterial recovery\nwas determined as reported previously (43). The experiment was per-\nformed four times.\n\nqRT-PCR analysis of the expression of immune genes in E. tarda-\ninfected flounder. Flounder were infected with TXeta1 or TX01 as de-\nscribed above for tissue dissemination analysis. Total RNA was extracted\nfrom HK at 1 h and 4 h postinfection with an HP Total RNA kit (Omega\nBio-Tek) and used for qRT-PCR as described above with 18S rRNA and\nubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCE) as internal references (48). The\nprimers used to amplify the genes of interleukin 1� (IL-1�), IL-6, IL-8,\ngamma interferon (IFN-�), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-�), inter-\nferon-induced Mx protein (Mx), major histocompatibility complex\n(MHC) class I�, CD40, and CD8� have been reported previously (12).\n\nInteraction between rEta1 and flounder lymphocytes. Flounder HK\nlymphocytes (�105) were placed onto a glass slide, and the slide was\nincubated at room temperature for 4 h. The cells were fixed with 4%\nparaformaldehyde for 10 min, followed by washing 3 times with PBS.\nThree hundred microliters of 10 �M rEta1 or recombinant EthR, an in-\ntracellular protein of E. tarda (40), was added to the lymphocytes, fol-\nlowed by incubation at 30°C for 1 h. After the incubation, the slide was\nwashed 3 times with PBS and supplemented with 300 �l of 1/1,000 mouse\nanti-His antibody (Bioss, Beijing, China) or serum from an unvaccinated\nmouse (negative-control serum). The slide was incubated at 30°C for 2 h\nand washed as described above, followed by adding 300 �l of 1/1,000\nFITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Bioss, Beijing, China). The slide was\nincubated and washed as described above and observed with a fluores-\ncence microscope (Nikon E800, Japan). The ability of anti-His antibody\nto react with rEthR was demonstrated by Western immunoblot analysis\n(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).\n\nEffect of anti-Eta1 antibodies on E. tarda infection. TX01 was di-\nluted in PBS to 108 CFU/ml. Anti-Eta1 serum and preimmune serum were\ndiluted 1,000 times, 500 times, and 100 times in PBS. TX01 suspension\nwas mixed with each of the diluted sera at an equal volume, followed by\nincubation at room temperature for 0.5 h. As a control, TX01 was mixed\nand incubated in the same manner with an equal volume of PBS. After the\n\nincubation, the TX01-containing mixture was added to flounder HK lym-\nphocytes cultured in 96-well cell culture plates as described above (5 � 105\n\nCFU bacterial cells/well). The plates were incubated at 30°C for 4 h, fol-\nlowed by washing 3 times with PBS. The number of bacterial cells associ-\nated with lymphocytes was determined as described above by plate count.\nThe assay was performed four times.\n\nVaccination. rEta1 was resuspended in PBS to a concentration of 200\n�g/ml and mixed at an equal volume with aluminum hydroxide as de-\nscribed previously (12). As a control, PBS was also mixed similarly with\naluminum hydroxide without rEta1 (PBS-aluminum hydroxide). Floun-\nder (as described above) were divided randomly into two groups (n � 35)\nand injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 100 �l of rEta1 suspension or\nPBS-aluminum hydroxide (control). At 1 month postvaccination, 25 fish\nwere taken from each group and challenged via i.p. injection with 100 �l\nTX01 that had been cultured as described above to an OD600 of 0.8,\nwashed with PBS, and resuspended in PBS to 2 � 106 CFU/ml. The fish\nwere monitored for mortality for a period of 20 days. Dying fish (5 from\nthe PBS-injected group and 3 from the rEta1-vaccinated group) were\nexamined for bacterial recovery from liver, kidney, and spleen as de-\nscribed above (see “Tissue dissemination and mortality analysis”). The\nrelative percent survival (RPS) was calculated according to the following\nformula: RPS � [1 \t (percent mortality in vaccinated fish/percent mor-\ntality in control fish)] � 100 (1). The vaccination trial was conducted in\nduplicate.\n\nELISA. Sera were taken from vaccinated fish and control fish at 4\nweeks postvaccination and diluted 20-fold in PBS. Serum antibody\nagainst rEta1 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay\n(ELISA) analysis as described previously (34).\n\nStatistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of\nvariance (ANOVA) of the SPSS 15.0 package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). In\nall cases, the significance level was defined as a P value of \n 0.05.\n\nNucleotide sequence accession number. The nucleotide sequence of\neta1 has been deposited in the GenBank database under accession number\nJN802138.\n\nRESULTS\nCharacterization of the sequence of Eta1. The deduced amino\nacid sequence of Eta1 contains 226 amino acid residues and is\npredicted to have a molecular mass of 23.6 kDa and an isoelectric\npoint of 4.7. In silico analysis identified no apparent conserved\ndomain in Eta1. No putative signal peptide sequence was found in\nEta1. BLAST analysis showed that Eta1 shares the highest se-\nquence identities (60% and 53%, respectively) with the C-termi-\nnal 217-residue region of the putative adhesins of Erwinia sp.\nstrain Ejp617 (GenBank accession no. ADP11523) and Escherichia\ncoli strain CL3 serovar O113:H21 pathogenicity island I (GenBank\naccession no. AAQ19127). These data suggest the possibility that\nEta1 is a novel type of adhesin.\n\neta1 expression under in vitro conditions and during infec-\ntion. To examine eta1 expression under in vitro conditions, E.\ntarda TX01 was cultured in LB medium to OD600 of 0.25, 0.5, 0.9,\n1.25, and 1.5, and eta1 expression was determined by qRT-PCR.\nThe results showed that eta1 expression peaked at an OD600 of 0.5\nand dropped afterward, reaching the lowest level at OD600 of 1.25\nand 1.5 (Fig. 1A). Compared to the expression level at an OD600 of\n0.25, which, for convenience of comparison, was set as 1, the ex-\npression levels at OD600 of 0.5, 0.9, 1.25, and 1.5 were 2.3-, 0.7-,\n0.5-, and 0.5-fold, respectively. To examine eta1 expression during\ninfection, flounder HK lymphocytes were infected with TX01, and\neta1 expression was determined by qRT-PCR at 0 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h,\nand 5 h postinfection. The results showed that, compared to eta1\nexpression before infection (0 h), eta1 expression after infection\nwas significantly induced and reacheda maximum (69-fold) at 1 h\n\nSun et al.\n\n2950 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=JN802138\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=ADP11523\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=AAQ19127\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\npostinfection (Fig. 1B). The eta1 expression level dropped as in-\nfection progressed but remained significantly higher at 2 h and 3 h\npostinfection than before infection. In contrast, in TX01 incu-\nbated under the same conditions but without host cells, no appar-\nent alteration in eta1 expression was observed at all the examined\ntime points.\n\nSubcellular localization of Eta1. To examine the subcellular\nlocalization of Eta1, TX01 was cultured in LB medium to an OD600\nof 0.5, which, as shown above, is the growth point at which a\nrelatively high level of eta1 expression was observed. Proteins were\nprepared from the cytoplasm, periplasm, outer membrane, and\nextracellular fractions of the culture and subjected to Western blot\nanalysis using polyclonal antibodies raised against recombinant\nEta1 (rEta1), which was prepared as a His-tagged protein from E.\ncoli (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). The results showed\nthat Eta1 was found in the preparations of the cytoplasm,\nperiplasm, and outer membrane proteins but not in that of the\nextracellular proteins (Fig. 2A and B). To examine whether the\nouter membrane preparation had been contaminated with cyto-\nplasmic proteins, the preparations of the outer membrane and\ncytoplasmic proteins were blotted with antibodies against recom-\nbinant LuxS (rLuxS), a cytoplasmic protein of E. tarda (43). The\nresults showed that LuxS was detected in the cytoplasmic prepa-\nration but not in the outer membrane preparation (Fig. 2C), sug-\ngesting that the outer membrane faction was not contaminated\nwith cytoplasmic proteins. These results indicated that the Eta1\nobserved in the outer membrane preparation was most likely due\nto natural outer membrane localization. To further examine\n\nwhether Eta1 was exposed on the cell surface, TX01 was incubated\nwith rat anti-rEta1 serum or preimmune serum, and the bound\nantibodies were detected with FITC-labeled goat anti-rat IgG.\nSubsequent microscopic examination showed that fluorescence\nwas detected in TX01 treated with anti-rEta1 serum, but not in\nTX01 treated with preimmune serum (Fig. 3). In contrast, TX01\ntreated with antibodies against rLuxS failed to show fluorescence.\nThese results suggest that Eta1 was exposed on the surface of E.\ntarda and able to interact with anti-rEta1 antibodies.\n\nEffect of eta1 mutation. (i) Effect on tissue dissemination and\ngeneral bacterial virulence. To examine the biological impor-\ntance of Eta1, a genetic variant of TX01, TXeta1, which bears an\ninsertion mutation at eta1, was constructed. Western blot analysis\nshowed that, unlike the wild type, TXeta1 was unable to produce\nEta1 (Fig. 2B). Compared to the wild-type strain TX01, TXeta1\nwas unaffected in growth when cultured in LB medium. To exam-\nine whether the eta81 mutation affected pathogenicity, flounder\nwere infected via immersion with or without (control) TXeta1 or\nTX01, and bacterial infection of host tissues was analyzed by bac-\nterial-recovery analysis, which showed that at 12 h postinfection,\nthe numbers of bacterial cells recovered from the blood, liver,\nkidney, and spleen of TXeta1-infected fish were significantly less\nthan those recovered from TX01-infected fish (Fig. 4A). No bac-\nteria were recovered from the control fish. These results suggest\nthat TXeta1 was impaired in its ability to disseminate into and\ncolonize host tissues. Furthermore, in TX01-infected fish, mortal-\nity began to occur at 3 days postinfection, and 90% accumulated\nmortality was reached before the fish became stabilized, whereas in\nTXeta1-infected fish, no mortality was observed (Fig. 4B). In contrast\nto TXeta1, TXeta1C, a variant of TXeta1 that expresses eta1 in trans\nfrom a plasmid, was able to disseminate into and colonize flounder\ntissues and to cause mortality in the infected fish in a manner similar\nto that of TX01 (Fig. 4), suggesting that the defect in the virulence of\nTXeta1 could be rescued by eta1 complementation.\n\n(ii) Effect on infection of host cells and on cellular immune\nresponse. To examine the effect of eta1 mutation on the infectivity\n\nFIG 1 Expression of eta1 under different conditions.

The results showed that bacterial recovery rates from\nTXeta1-infected cells at all the examined time points were sig-\nnificantly lower than those from TX01-infected cells (Fig. 5).\nqRT-PCR analysis of immune gene expression in flounder HK\nat 1 h and 4 h after TXeta1 and TX01 infection showed that,\ncompared to TX01, which is known to inhibit the host immune\n\nresponse, TXeta1 infection induced a significant increase in the\nexpression of IL-1�, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-�, IFN-�, Mx, MHCI�,\nCD8�, and CD40 in a manner that was dependent on the in-\nfection time (Fig. 6).\n\nBinding of recombinant rEta1 to flounder lymphocytes.\nSince Eta1 is a surface-exposed protein and its production is re-\nquired for effective infection of host cells, we wondered whether\nEta1 was capable of direct interaction with host cells. To investi-\ngate this question, the His-tagged rEta1 or rEthR, an intracellular\nE. tarda protein prepared under the same conditions as those un-\nder which rEta1 was prepared, was incubated with flounder HK\nlymphocytes, and the cells were subsequently subjected to fluores-\ncence immunodetection with anti-His antibody or serum from an\nunvaccinated mouse (control serum). The results showed that for\ncells treated with anti-His antibody, fluorescence was detected in\ncells preincubated with rEta1, but not in cells preincubated with\nrEthR (Fig. 7). In contrast, for cells treated with the control serum,\n\nFIG 3 Exposure of Eta1 on the surface of E. tarda.

To fur-\nther examine whether the interaction between Eta1 and host cells\nwas required for bacterial infection, flounder HK lymphocytes\nwere infected with TX01 in the presence or absence of anti-rEta1\nserum or preimmune serum in different dilutions. The results\nshowed that the presence of anti-rEta1 serum significantly re-\nduced the number of bacterial cells that invaded lymphocytes in a\nmanner that was dependent on the dose of the antiserum (Fig. 8).\nIn contrast, the presence of preimmune serum had no effect on\ncellular infection.\n\nImmunoprotective potential of rEta1. The above results, i.e.,\nthat Eta1 is a surface-exposed protein that is highly induced dur-\ning infection and interacts directly with host cells, led us to wonder\nwhether rEta1 could induce protective immunity if used as a vac-\ncine. To examine this possibility, flounder were vaccinated with\nrEta1 and challenged with a lethal dose of TX01 at 4 weeks post-\nvaccination. The fish were subsequently monitored for mortality\nfor 20 days, and the results showed that the accumulated mortal-\n\nities of rEta1-vaccinated fish and the control fish were 12% and\n72%, respectively. Hence, the protective efficacy, in terms of RPS,\nof rEta1 was 83.3%. Comparable results were obtained in the du-\nplicate vaccination trial. Microbiological examination of dying\nfish indicated that TX01 was the only type of bacterium recovered\nfrom the liver, spleen, and blood of the fish, suggesting that mor-\ntality was caused by TX01 infection. ELISA analysis showed that\nspecific serum antibodies were produced in rEta1-vaccinated fish\n(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). These results indicate\nthat rEta1 is a protective antigen.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn this study, we analyzed the function of an in vivo-induced an-\ntigen, Eta1, from the pathogenic E. tarda strain TX01 isolated\nfrom diseased flounder. Expression analysis showed that when\nTX01 was cultured under in vitro conditions in the rich LB me-\ndium, the eta1 expression level changed with the growth phase.\nHowever, the magnitude of the change was relatively small, as the\npeak expression level was only 4.6-fold that of the bottom level. In\ncontrast, expression of eta1 was significantly induced during in-\nfection of host lymphocytes, particularly at the early stage of in-\n\nFIG 6 Effect of TXeta1 and TX01 infection on the expression of immune\ngenes.

These results indicate that eta1 expression is strongly in-\nduced during the process of host cell invasion, which is consistent\nwith the identification of Eta1 as an in vivo-induced antigen in the\nfirst place, and they suggest a potential involvement of Eta1 in host\ninfection.\n\nTo examine whether Eta1 was required for E. tarda pathogen-\nesis, an Eta1-deficient mutant, TXeta1, was constructed. TXeta1\nwas comparable to the wild type in growth when cultured in LB\nmedium, suggesting that Eta1 is not an essential protein during in\nvitro growth. It is known that E. tarda possesses a strong tissue\ninvasion and dissemination capacity that enables the pathogen to\novercome the innate immunity barrier and eventually reach the\ninternal organs of the host (16, 33). In this study, we found that\nfollowing immersion infection of flounder, both TXeta1 and\nTX01 were able to spread to the liver and spleen; however, the\nnumbers of TXeta1 bacteria recovered from these tissues were\nmore than 10-fold less than those of recovered TX01, suggesting\nthat mutation of eta1 impairs the ability of TXeta1 to disseminate\ninto and colonize host tissues. Consistent with these observations,\nTX01 infection induced 90% accumulated mortality, while no\nmortality was observed in TXeta1-infected fish. These results in-\ndicate that TXeta1 was attenuated in overall virulence. The obser-\nvation that introduction of a functional eta1 gene into TXeta1\nrestored the virulence of TXeta1 suggests that the virulence atten-\nuation of TXeta1 was indeed due to eta1 mutation. In agreement\nwith these observations made in a live-fish model, cellular-infec-\ntion analysis showed that, compared to TX01, TXeta1 exhibited\nsignificantly reduced ability to invade host lymphocytes.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that one of the prominent viru-\nlence features of E. tarda is its capacity to interfere with the normal\nimmune response of host phagocytes, and this capacity is essential\nto the intracellular survival of E. tarda (23, 47). In this study, we\nfound that the expression profiles of the immune genes in TX01-\nand TXeta1-infected flounder HK differed remarkably. Com-\npared to TX01, TXeta1 stimulated the expression of a wide spec-\ntrum of immune genes that are involved in proinflammatory and\nspecific immune responses, which probably accounts for the re-\nsistance of the host to TXeta1 infection. Hence, it appears that\nunlike the wild-type TX01, the eta1-defective mutant TXeta1 is no\nlonger able to inhibit the general immune response of the host.\n\nAccumulating studies have indicated that for many human\npathogens, adhesins play a vital role in infection by mediating host\ncell adhesion and invasion (7, 15, 20, 30, 36). These proteins bind\nto receptors on the surfaces of host cells, thereby facilitating bac-\nterial translocation into the targeted cells (13). In our study, we\nfound that recombinant Eta1 was localized to the cell surface.\nSince no apparent signal peptide was identified in Eta1, it is pos-\nsible that translocation of Eta1 may be through a nonclassical\npathway. Eta1 was able to interact with flounder lymphocytes,\nwhich, together with the observation that Eta1 expression was\nupregulated during lymphocyte infection, suggests a possibility\nfor Eta1 to act as an adhesin. Consistent with this hypothesis, the\npresence of anti-rEta1 antibodies reduced TX01 invasion into\nlymphocytes. Since preimmune serum had no effect on TX01 in-\nfection, it is likely that the reduced infectivity of TX01 observed\nin the presence of anti-rEta1 antibodies is due to specific binding\nof the antibodies to Eta1 on the pathogen, which may have masked\nthe region of Eta1 that is essential to host cell interaction.\n\nIt is known that in some bacterial pathogens, surface proteins,\nsuch as invasins, that are involved in direct interactions with the\n\nhost system possess vaccine properties (2, 38, 39). In our study, we\nfound that rEta1 induced a protection rate of 83.3% upon lethal E.\ntarda challenge, suggesting that rEta1 is a strong protective im-\nmunogen. The immunoprotective property of rEta1 is in line with\nits virulence role played during infection. It is likely that, as shown\nby ELISA analysis, vaccination of rEta1 induced production of\nspecific antibodies, which upon E. tarda infection bind to the in-\nfected pathogen via Eta1, which is highly expressed in vivo and\nlocalized on the cell surface. Since Eta1 is essential to effective host\ncell infection, binding of Eta1 by its antibodies very likely inter-\nferes with the normal function of Eta1, as was observed under in\nvitro conditions with flounder lymphocytes, resulting in a marked\nelevation in the survival rate of the vaccinated fish.\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study indicate that Eta1 is an in\nvivo-induced antigen that is highly expressed upon encountering\nthe host system during infection. With flounder as a model, it was\nfound that mutation of eta1 reduces the ability of E. tarda to infect\nhost cells, disseminate into host tissues, and cause mortality of the\ninfected fish. Purified recombinant Eta1 is able to interact with\nflounder lymphocytes, and blocking this interaction inhibits cel-\nlular infection. Consistent with these observations, Eta1 induces\nstrong immunoprotection in flounder when used as a subunit\nvaccine. These results suggest that Eta1 possibly functions as an\nadhesin during E. tarda infection and, as a result, is required for\noptimal bacterial invasion.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Natural Science\nFoundation of China (31025030), the Ministry of Science and Technology\n(2011AA10A216), the Knowledge Innovation Program of the Chinese\nAcademy of Sciences (KZCX2-EW-Q213), and the Taishan Scholar Pro-\ngram of Shandong Province.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
