Schlesinger1*\n\n1 Center for Microbial Interface Biology, Department of Microbial Infection and Immunity, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America,\n\n2 Mathematical Biosciences Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nComplement receptor 3 (CR3, CD11b/CD18) is a major macrophage phagocytic receptor. The biochemical pathways\nthrough which CR3 regulates immunologic responses have not been fully characterized. Francisella tularensis is a remarkably\ninfectious, facultative intracellular pathogen of macrophages that causes tularemia. Early evasion of the host immune\nresponse contributes to the virulence of F. tularensis and CR3 is an important receptor for its phagocytosis. Here we confirm\nthat efficient attachment and uptake of the highly virulent Type A F. tularensis spp. tularensis strain Schu S4 by human\nmonocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) requires complement C3 opsonization and CR3. However, despite a.40-fold\nincrease in uptake following C3 opsonization, Schu S4 induces limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared\nwith non-opsonized Schu S4 and the low virulent F. novicida. This suggests that engagement of CR3 by opsonized Schu S4\ncontributes specifically to the immune suppression during and shortly following phagocytosis which we demonstrate by\nCD11b siRNA knockdown in hMDMs. This immune suppression is concomitant with early inhibition of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK\nand NF-kB activation. Furthermore, TLR2 siRNA knockdown shows that pro-inflammatory cytokine production and MAPK\nactivation in response to non-opsonized Schu S4 depends on TLR2 signaling providing evidence that CR3-TLR2 crosstalk\nmediates immune suppression for opsonized Schu S4. Deletion of the CD11b cytoplasmic tail reverses the CR3-mediated\ndecrease in ERK and p38 activation during opsonized Schu-S4 infection. The CR3-mediated signaling pathway involved in\nthis immune suppression includes Lyn kinase and Akt activation, and increased MKP-1, which limits TLR2-mediated pro-\ninflammatory responses. These data indicate that while the highly virulent F. tularensis uses CR3 for efficient uptake, optimal\nengagement of this receptor down-regulates TLR2-dependent pro-inflammatory responses by inhibiting MAPK activation\nthrough outside-in signaling. CR3-linked immune suppression is an important mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of F.\ntularensis infection.\n\nCitation: Dai S, Rajaram MVS, Curry HM, Leander R, Schlesinger LS (2013) Fine Tuning Inflammation at the Front Door: Macrophage Complement Receptor 3-\nmediates Phagocytosis and Immune Suppression for Francisella tularensis.

F. novicida is normally\n\nconsidered to be the fourth subspecies of F. tularensis; however,\n\nrecent genome-wide polymorphism analysis indicates that it is an\n\nindependent species [5]. F. novicida rarely causes disease in humans\n\nbut is virulent in mice, manifesting a disease that is similar to\n\ntularemia in humans, and has been widely used in the mouse\n\nmodel of tularemia. Because F. tularensis can be easily disseminat-\n\ned, results in a high mortality rate among untreated pulmonary\n\ncases, and has the potential to cause public panic, it is given the\n\nhighest priority classification by the Centers for Disease Control\n\nand Prevention (CDC) as a Category A select agent and is a\n\npotential bioweapon [1].\n\nMacrophages are the first line of defense against invading\n\nmicroorganisms. However, as is the case for many other intracel-\n\nlular pathogens, F. tularensis is able to avoid and/or suppress\n\nmacrophage host defense mechanisms to enable survival and\n\nintracellular replication following phagocytosis. F. tularensis infects\n\nprimarily alveolar macrophages in pneumonic tularemia [6].\n\nMacrophages combat F. tularensis infection by generating TLR2-\n\ndependent pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-1b\n[7–12]. However, this cytokine response is largely muted at the early\n\nstage of F. tularensis infection. In fact, several studies have indicated\n\nthat F. tularensis infection leads to broad immune suppression in\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\ninfected cells [13–16]. Compared with the low virulent F. novicida,\n\ninfection of human phagocytes with the highly virulent Type A F.\n\ntularensis subsp. tularensis strain Schu S4 leads to significantly reduced\n\npro-inflammatory cytokine production [17,18]. This immune\n\nsuppression is believed to be critical for the success of F. tularensis\n\nas a human pathogen, allowing for its replication and dissemination\n\nwithin the host early on. However, the molecular mechanisms\n\ninvolved in the early F. tularensis-induced immune suppression are\n\nnot completely understood.\n\nMultiple receptors, such as complement receptors, Fcc recep-\ntors, mannose receptor, scavenger receptor and surface nucleolin\n\nhave all been implicated in F. tularensis phagocytosis [19–24].\n\nComplement C3 deposition on the bacterial surface, and\n\ncomplement receptors, specifically complement receptor 3 (CR3)\n\non the macrophage surface play important roles in the uptake of\n\nthe highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis by human\n\nmacrophages [20,21,25]. CR3 (CD11b/CD18, aMb2) belongs to\nthe b2-integrin family. Complement receptors, particularly CR3,\nhave long been postulated to allow for safe passage for intracellular\n\npathogens [26–28]. CR3’s function is dependent on the activation\n\nof outside-in and inside-out two way signals [29]. There is\n\nincreasing evidence for signaling crosstalk between complement\n\nreceptors and TLRs [30–32]. For example, TLR2 is able to trans-\n\nactivate CR3 through inside-out signaling including the activation\n\nof Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34]. b2-integrin signaling can\nalso negatively regulate TLR responses [32,35]. Specifically, CR3\n\ncan inhibit TLR4 signaling by promoting the degradation of\n\nMyD88 and TRIF [36]. In addition, engagement of CR3 has been\n\nshown to down-regulate IL-12 production [37] and avoid\n\ninitiation of the oxidative burst in macrophages following\n\nphagocytosis of apoptotic cells [38,39]. A few pathogens such as\n\nPorphyromonas gingivalis [33], Mycobacterium bovis BCG [34] and\n\nBacillus anthracis spores [40] can activate CR3 through inside-out\n\nsignaling via TLR2 to facilitate bacterial uptake. However, to the\n\nbest of our knowledge, nothing is known about how the\n\nengagement of CR3 by a pathogen (i.e. outside-in signaling) can\n\nmediate regulation of TLR signaling pathways.\n\nHere we hypothesized that the initial interaction of F. tularensis\n\nwith human macrophage receptors will greatly impact the\n\ngeneration of early signals and consequent biological responses\n\nby the macrophage. We show that C3-opsonized virulent F.\n\ntularensis subsp. tularensis utilizes CR3 to gain access into host\n\nmacrophages while at the same time inhibits TLR2-mediated host\n\nimmune responses, resulting in a relatively ‘‘silent’’ mode of entry\n\nfollowed by robust intracellular replication. We also report the key\n\nsignaling pathways involved. Thus, we provide the first evidence\n\nfor linkage between a key phagocytic receptor for F. tularensis and\n\npost-phagocytic signaling events important in immunosuppression.\n\nThe involvement of complement receptors in immune suppression\n\nmay be an important mechanism for F. tularensis pathogenesis, and\n\nthe pathways involved are likely to be broadly applicable to other\n\nintracellular pathogens that use CR3-mediated entry.\n\nResults\n\nSerum opsonization, specifically C3 deposition, is critical\nfor F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 phagocytosis by\nhuman macrophages\n\nSerum components, specifically complement C3, and CR3 play\n\na major role in efficient macrophage uptake of F. tularensis Live\n\nVaccine Strain (LVS) and a clinical isolation (RCI) of subsp.\n\ntularensis [21]. We first set out to confirm the role of C3 and C3\n\nreceptors in Schu S4 phagocytosis by human monocyte-derived\n\nmacrophages (hMDMs). We infected hMDMs with Schu S4 in the\n\npresence or absence of serum, or in C3-depleted or C3-repleted\n\nserum. As shown in Fig. 1, in the absence of serum, Schu S4\n\nuptake by hMDMs was very limited. In contrast, in the presence of\n\nserum, the uptake was significantly increased ,40 fold confirming\nthat serum opsonization is critical for efficient phagocytosis of\n\nSchu S4 by human macrophages. Moreover, when we used C3-\n\ndepleted serum the uptake of Schu S4 was limited, equivalent to\n\nthat seen in the absence of serum. Repletion of C3-depleted serum\n\nwith C3 led to a significant increase in uptake akin to that seen\n\nfollowing serum opsonization. This result provides further\n\nevidence that serum components, especially C3 deposited on\n\nbacterial surface, are critical for efficient phagocytosis of Schu S4\n\nby human macrophages.\n\nC3 opsonization is associated with immune suppression\nduring Schu S4 phagocytosis by macrophages\n\nIn order to examine whether the initial interaction between F.\n\ntularensis and macrophages impacts host cell immune responses, we\n\nmeasured the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, i.e. TNFa, IL-6\nand IL-1b in the culture supernatant of hMDMs infected with\nSchu S4 in the absence or presence of fresh autologous serum.\n\nSurprisingly, despite the fact that there was a dramatic increase in\n\nbacterial uptake in the presence of serum, there was very limited\n\npro-inflammatory cytokine production suggesting that serum\n\nopsonization has an immunosuppressive effect during Schu S4\n\nphagocytosis. This effect is mainly contributed by C3 since\n\nincubation in C3-depleted serum led to relatively high levels of\n\ncytokine production comparable to those observed in the absence\n\nof serum, while the cytokine levels were decreased when C3 was\n\nrepleted (Fig. 2A, B and C). Recent studies have shown that the\n\nlow virulent F. novicida induces high pro-inflammatory responses in\n\nhuman phagocytic cells [17,41]. In order to exam whether serum\n\nincubation has an immunosuppressive effect during the phagocy-\n\ntosis of human macrophages by F. novicida, we performed assays\n\ncomparing F. novicida and Schu S4 in the presence and absence of\n\nserum. Consistent with previous studies [17,18], phagocytosis of F.\n\nnovicida by hMDMs was accompanied by much higher pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine production than that of Schu S4 (Fig. 2 D,\n\nE and F). In addition, serum did not have a significant immune\n\nsuppressive effect, indicating that C3 opsonin-mediated immune\n\nsuppression is specific to the highly virulent Schu S4.\n\nRecent studies have indicated that host adaptation can affect the\n\nnature of Francisella surface carbohydrates, which can in turn affect\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nThe highly virulent Francisella tularensis can cause respi-\nratory disease in humans with less than 10 bacteria. In vivo,\nit replicates mainly within macrophages. Evasion and/or\nsuppression of the host protective immune response is\nessential to Francisella’s virulence in mammals. However,\nthe detailed molecular mechanisms for this immune\nsuppression are not clear. Here we demonstrate that this\npathogen manipulates the crosstalk between two impor-\ntant receptor-mediated pathways during entry in human\nmacrophages: CR3-mediated phagocytosis and TLR2-me-\ndiated pro-inflammatory responses. By optimally engaging\nCR3, Francisella not only gains efficient access to macro-\nphages but also dampens TLR2-mediated immune re-\nsponses, leading to a relatively ‘‘silent’’ entry that allows it\nto replicate intracellularly to high numbers early on. Thus,\nwe have identified an important mechanism that is critical\nfor the success of F. tularensis as a human pathogen during\nprimary infection.\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

To\n\nexamine the effect of host adaptation on the immune suppression\n\nobserved here, we used Schu S4 that had been passaged through\n\nTHP-1 cells (Ft-T). As shown in Fig. S1, although host adapted Ft-\n\nT induced slightly less pro-inflammatory cytokine production\n\ncompared with Ft that had not been passaged, serum-opsonization\n\nstill significantly inhibited pro-inflammatory responses with Ft-T.\n\nThis result provides further support that the inhibition mechanism\n\nobserved here does not depend on host adaptation. Thus, the\n\nfollowing experiments were carried out with Ft Schu S4 only.\n\nC3 opsonization inhibits MAPK activation during\nphagocytosis of Schu S4 by human macrophages\n\nF. tularensis LPS interacts poorly with TLR4 [43]. Instead, host\n\ninflammatory responses to F. tularensis are mediated primarily by\n\nTLR2 which leads to the activation of MAPK and NF-kB\nsignaling pathways, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production\n\n[44–49]. In order to explore the underlying mechanism for the\n\nsuppressed immune responses seen in the presence of serum and\n\nC3 opsonization, we examined the activation of MAPKs during\n\nSchu S4 synchronized phagocytosis. Schu S4 was either non-\n\nopsonized or pre-opsonized with fresh autologous serum, C3-\n\ndepleted or C3-repleted serum, and then incubated with hMDMs\n\nin the absence of serum. As shown in Fig. 3A, consistent with our\n\nobservations of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, activation\n\nof MAPKs (i.e. ERK1/2 and p38) was inhibited during\n\nphagocytosis of serum-opsonized or C3-repleted serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4, whereas there was robust activation of ERK1/2 and p38\n\nin the absence of either serum or C3. This inhibition on MAPK\n\nactivation was only observed for ERK1/2 and p38, but not for\n\nJNK (Fig. 3B) In order to confirm the role of complement in the\n\nimmune suppression observed, we also infected hMDMs with\n\nSchu S4 pre-opsonized with heat-inactivated autologous serum.\n\nPhagocytosis of these bacteria was accompanied by levels of\n\nERK1/2 and p38 activation equivalent to those seen with non-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 (data not shown). Together, these data indicate\n\nthat the immune suppression during C3-opsonized Schu S4\n\nphagocytosis is mediated, at least in part, by reduced ERK1/2 and\n\np38 activation.\n\nSince we observed a much greater pro-inflammatory response\n\nduring F. novicida phagocytosis than during Schu S4 phagocytosis\n\n(which was not affected by serum or C3), we also included F.\n\nnovicida in parallel with Schu S4 in our experiments to assess\n\nMAPK activation. As expected, phagocytosis of F. novicida was\n\naccompanied by high levels of ERK1/2 and p38 activation both in\n\nthe presence and absence of serum, especially at the later time\n\npoint (Fig. 3C) and was much less affected by serum opsonization.\n\nThis indicates that C3-mediated MAPK inhibition is relatively\n\nspecific to the highly virulent Schu S4.\n\nC3 opsonization inhibits NF-kB p65 activation and\ntranslocation during phagocytosis of Schu S4 by human\nmacrophages\n\nPhosphorylation of MAPKs leads to activation of many\n\ntranscription factors, including NF-kB, that are important in\ninflammatory cytokine production. Since we observed significantly\n\ndecreased activation of ERK 1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4 infection, we examined whether this decreased activation\n\nleads to a reduction in downstream NF-kB activation. We infected\nhMDMs with non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4 for\n\ndifferent time points and analyzed NF-kB p65 activation (phos-\nphorylation) by Western blot. As predicted, phagocytosis of serum-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 led to significantly reduced phosphorylation of\n\nthe NF-kB p65 subunit (Fig. 4A and B). Activation of the NF-kB\np65 subunit leads to translocation of p65 into the nucleus where it\n\nbinds to the promoter region of various genes to induce their\n\nexpression. We measured NF-kB p65 translocation into the nucleus\nby immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4C). Our results show that\n\ninfection with serum-opsonized Sch S4 is accompanied by\n\nsignificantly reduced p65 translocation compared to that of non-\n\nopsonized bacteria. These data provide strong evidence that C3\n\nopsonization of bacteria leads to early suppression of the host cell\n\nimmune response through inhibition of MAPKs and downstream\n\nNF-kB activation.\n\nC3 opsonin-mediated immune suppression during\nphagocytosis is not due to a difference in the kinetics of\nuptake of Schu S4 or to bacterial factors\n\nOne possible mechanism for the enhanced pro-inflammatory\n\ncytokine response seen during phagocytosis of non-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 is that limited CR3 engagement slows phagocytosis (through\n\nCR3 or potentially other receptors) allowing for a proportionately\n\nincreased number of attached bacteria to engage TLR2 for a\n\nlonger period of time. In order to test for this possibility, we\n\nsynchronized phagocytosis of non-opsonized or serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4 as in the MAPK activation assay, and fixed the samples at\n\ndifferent time points. We used a differential immunofluorescence\n\nstaining protocol [50] to quantify the attachment and uptake of\n\nSchu S4 by hMDMs (Fig. 5A). At all time points examined (5, 15\n\nand 30 min) there were much greater numbers of serum-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 both attached to and taken up by hMDMs\n\ncompared with non-opsonized bacteria, indicating that a differ-\n\nence in the kinetics of phagocytosis was not the reason for the\n\nobserved immune suppression. The fact that F. tularensis can also\n\nsignal through TLR2 from within phagosomes following phago-\n\ncytosis [51] also argues against the hypothesis that in the case of\n\nnon-opsonized bacteria, prolonged cell surface binding results in\n\nenhanced cytokine production.\n\nBacterial virulence factors, e.g. RipA, represent an alternate\n\nmechanism of immune suppression by C3-opsonized bacteria\n\n[52]. In this scenario, we expect cytokine production to decline as\n\nbacterial loads increase because the concentration of virulence\n\nfactors produced from viable bacteria within a macrophage is\n\ndirectly proportional to its bacterial load. In order to test this\n\nhypothesis, we infected hMDMs with non-opsonized or serum pre-\n\nopsonized Schu S4. In both cases we achieved an incremental\n\nincrease in bacterial uptake by increasing the MOI. However,\n\ninstead of resulting in increased immune suppression, increased\n\nuptake resulted in a stepwise increase in pro-inflammatory\n\ncytokine production (Fig. 5B) and MAPK activation (Fig. 5C).\n\nThis effect was more pronounced in the case of non-opsonized\n\nbacteria [i.e., A 20 fold increase in MOI resulted in a 3 to 12 fold\n\nincrease in cytokine production for non-opsonized bacteria, and\n\nonly a 30% to 70% increase in cytokine production for opsonized\n\nbacteria (Fig. 5B)]. These results indicate that early immune\n\nsuppression by Schu S4 during phagocytosis is not primarily\n\nmediated by virulence factors produced from viable bacteria. We\n\ncarried out experiments with paraformaldehyde (PFA)-killed Schu\n\nS4 to further support this claim. In parallel with untreated Schu\n\nS4, PFA-killed Schu S4 was either non-opsonized or serum pre-\n\nopsonized, and used for infection. As shown in Fig. 5D, PFA-killed\n\nserum-opsonized Schu S4 was able to inhibit MAPK activation.\n\nTogether, these results provide evidence that the immune\n\nsuppression observed during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 is not due to actively produced bacterial factors. However,\n\nthese factors are predicted to play an important role during\n\nsubsequent stages of infection.\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nCR3 is the major receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis by\nhuman macrophages\n\nWe next examined the role of C3 receptors and the possible\n\ncrosstalk between C3 receptors and TLR2 in mediating the\n\nimmune suppression during phagocytosis of C3-opsonized Schu\n\nS4. We elected to focus on CR3 (CD11b/CD18) which is the\n\nmajor receptor for C3 opsonins, and has been implicated as the\n\nimportant receptor for Schu S4 phagocytosis by human phago-\n\ncytes [21]. We transfected hMDMs with scramble siRNA (control)\n\nor siRNA targeting CD11b, the latter to knockdown the a chain of\nthe CR3 heterodimer (Fig. 6A and B). We then performed\n\nexperiments that quantify attachment and uptake of Schu S4 by\n\ncontrol and CD11b knockdown macrophages. Compared to\n\ncontrol siRNA transfected hMDMs, Schu S4 attachment and\n\nuptake were nearly abolished in CD11b knockdown cells,\n\nproviding strong confirmatory evidence that CR3 is the major\n\nreceptor for phagocytosis of the highly virulent Schu S4 strain by\n\nhuman macrophages (Fig. 6C and D).\n\nSeveral studies have indicated crosstalk between complement\n\nreceptor pathways and TLR pathways, especially for the\n\ninvolvement of TLRs in inside-out activation of CR3 [33,34,40].\n\nTherefore, we tested the possible involvement of TLR2 in Schu S4\n\nphagocytosis by hMDMs, since TLR2 is responsible for most of\n\nthe cell surface TLR-driven host inflammatory responses following\n\nFigure 3. Serum components, specifically C3 opsonization, inhibit ERK1/2 and p38 activation during Schu S4 phagocytosis by\nmacrophages. (A) Schu S4 was either non-opsonized, or pre-opsonized with 10% autologous serum, C3-depleted serum (C3d) or C3-repleted serum\n(C3r), and then used to infect hMDM monolayers at an MOI of 50:1 in RHH in the absence of serum.

We knocked down TLR2 in\n\nhMDMs using siRNA as we have described previously [53] and\n\nexamined Schu S4 attachment and uptake by these cells.\n\nCompared with control siRNA transfected cells, there was an\n\napproximately 40% reduction in the attachment and uptake of\n\nSchu S4 in TLR2 siRNA transfected cells (thus less than that\n\nobserved with CD11b knockdown cells) at 15 min (Fig. 6C and D),\n\nwhich is consistent with the involvement of TLR2 in F. tularensis\n\nphagocytosis, possibly through inside-out activation of CR3.\n\nSimilar data were seen at 5 min and a similar trend was seen at\n\n30 min, although at the later time point the high number of\n\nbacteria per cell reduced the accuracy of the counting (Fig. S2).\n\nInside-out signaling is further supported by an experiment showing\n\nthat the cytoskeletal, actin-binding protein Talin co-localizes with\n\nCR3, particularly in macrophages infected with serum pre-\n\nopsonized Ft (Fig. S3) [54].\n\nPhagocytosis-associated immune suppression of C3-\nopsonized F. tularensis is mediated by CR3\n\nIn order to test the hypothesis that engagement of C3 receptors\n\nenables outside-in crosstalk with the TLR2 pathway to inhibit\n\nTLR2-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory responses, we\n\nexamined cytokine production in CD11b or TLR2 knockdown\n\nmacrophages following phagocytosis of serum-opsonized versus\n\nnon-opsonized Schu S4 or F. novicida. We observed a significant\n\nreduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in TLR2 knock-\n\ndown cells following non-opsonized or serum-opsonized Schu S4\n\ninfection, consistent with a role for TLR2 in mediating host pro-\n\ninflammatory immune responses (Fig. 7A). However, even in\n\nTLR2 knockdown cells, cytokine production in response to serum-\n\nopsonized bacteria remained depressed as compared to non-\n\nopsonized bacteria, indicating that the immunosuppressive effects\n\nof complement C3 in conjunction with Schu S4 do not depend on\n\nTLR2. In contrast, in CD11b knockdown cells, we observed that\n\nthe selective immune suppression seen with opsonized bacteria was\n\nabolished, providing evidence for CR3 in mediating immune\n\nsuppression following optimal engagement by C3-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 (Fig. 7B). As observed before, there was robust pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine production following phagocytosis of F.\n\nnovicida independent of opsonization status.\n\nWe next examined MAPK activation upstream of cytokine\n\nproduction following phagocytosis of Schu S4 by control, CD11b or\n\nTLR2 knockdown hMDMs. In order to detect and examine the\n\nsignaling events immediately after receptor ligation, we increased\n\nthe MOI to 250:1 and collected samples at 5, 15 and 30 min post\n\ninfection. As shown in Fig. 7C, in control siRNA transfected cells,\n\nboth ERK and p38 activation were selectively inhibited upon\n\ninfection with serum pre-opsonized bacteria compared with non-\n\nopsonized bacteria, although maximal inhibition of each occurred\n\nat different time points (ERK and p38 activation were significantly\n\nlower at 5 min and 30 min post infection, respectively). Similar to\n\nthe results in Fig. 7A, in TLR2 knockdown cells MAPK activation\n\nwas reduced and the overall pattern between opsonized and non-\n\nopsonized bacteria was maintained; whereas in CD11b knockdown\n\nFigure 4.

Remarkably this\n\noccurred despite the fact that there was minimal phagocytosis by\n\nthese cells. Together, these results are consistent with a positive role\n\nfor TLR2 and a negative role for CR3 in MAPK activation upon\n\nSchu S4 infection of human macrophages.\n\nPhagocytosis-associated immune suppression of serum-\nopsonized Schu S4 is mediated by the CR3 cytoplasmic\ntail\n\nThe cytoplasmic tail of CR3 plays an important role in CR3-\n\nmediated signaling [55]. To directly assess the role of the CR3\n\ncytoplasmic tail in mediating immune suppression pathway(s)\n\nduring the phagocytosis of serum-opsonized Schu S4, we used\n\nCHO cells stably expressing full length heterodimeric CR3\n\n(CD11b/CD18) or a tail less mutant of CR3 (tail less CD11b\n\nalong with CD18) and transiently transfected with functional\n\nTLR2 [56]. Following incubation of serum-opsonized or non-\n\nopsonized bacteria for 15 or 30 min, CHO cell lysates were\n\nharvested and analyzed for activation of ERK and p38 activation\n\n(phosphorylation) by Western blot. We found that the tail less\n\nmutant form of CR3 was not able to inhibit the activation of\n\nERK1/2 and p38 during serum-opsonized Schu-S4 phagocytosis\n\n(Fig. 8A). To further validate that CR3 is an important receptor\n\nfor serum-opsonized Schu S4, we performed a cell association\n\nassay with serum-opsonized or non-opsonized bacteria and CHO\n\ncells expressing full length or tail less mutant CR3.

The\n\nhighly virulent Schu S4 exploits host defense mechanisms by using\n\nCR3 as the phagocytic receptor which suppresses host defense\n\nimmune responses by inhibiting MAPK activation. However, the\n\nquestion still remained as to the signaling cascade downstream of\n\nCR3 that leads to MAPK inhibition.\n\nA recent study [29] showed that CD11b can negatively regulate\n\nTLR signaling by activating Syk and promoting the degradation of\n\nMyD88 and TRIF. To explore this possibility, we examined the\n\nactivation of Syk upon infection with serum-opsonized or non-\n\nopsonized Schu S4. Our results indicated that Syk is transiently\n\nactivated upon Schu S4 infection, but there is no difference\n\nbetween serum-opsonized and non-opsonized Schu S4 infection at\n\nall time points studied (5, 15 and 30 min). Also MyD88 and TRIF\n\nprotein levels following serum-opsonized and non-opsonized Schu\n\nS4 infection are not changed (data not shown). Thus, these data\n\nsuggested that neither Syk nor Syk-mediated degradation of\n\nMyD88 and TRIF is involved in CR3-mediated immune\n\nsuppression in human macrophages.\n\nCR3 belongs to the b2 integrin family. Src family kinases (SFKs)\nHck, Fgr and Lyn are known to control b2 integrin signal\ntransduction in leukocytes [57]. Among these we were particularly\n\ninterested in Lyn since it has been shown to play an important role\n\nin host defense. Lyn deletion led to impaired phagocytosis,\n\nelevated inflammatory cytokine production and increased apop-\n\ntosis following Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection [58]. Lyn also\n\nnegatively regulates TLR4 and TLR2 signaling in mouse\n\nmacrophages and in vivo, which is partially mediated by the\n\nPI3K pathway [59].\n\nIn order to answer the question whether Lyn is involved in\n\nCR3-mediated host immune suppression following Schu S4\n\ninfection, we first explored whether Lyn is activated downstream\n\nof CR3 and if so, whether its activation is affected by TLR2\n\nactivation which can activate CR3 through inside-out signaling.\n\nhMDMs were transfected with control siRNA, or siRNA targeting\n\nCD11b or TLR2, and then infected with either serum-opsonized\n\nor non-opsonized Schu S4. Lyn activation was measured by\n\nWestern blot. As shown in Fig. 9A, in control siRNA transfected\n\ncells, Lyn was activated only when hMDMs were infected with\n\nserum pre-opsonized Schu S4 but not with non-opsonized Schu\n\nS4, consistent with the importance of C3 opsonization in Lyn\n\nFigure 6. CR3, partially activated by TLR2 inside-out signaling, is critical for Schu S4 phagocytosis by hMDMs. (A) hMDMs were\ntransfected with scrambled siRNA or siRNAs targeting CD11b or TLR2. 48 hrs later, the level of CD11b and TLR2 were examined by Western blot.

Moreover, when CR3 was knocked down, Lyn was no\n\nlonger activated, whereas TLR2 knockdown had no effect. These\n\nresults demonstrated that Lyn is activated downstream of CR3 but\n\nnot TLR2.\n\nIn order to explore whether CR3-mediated host immune\n\nsuppression is mediated by Lyn, we selectively knocked down Lyn\n\nby siRNA as described previously [60] (Fig. 9B). As shown in Fig\n\nS4, Lyn knockdown greatly impaired the uptake of Schu S4 by\n\nhMDMs, providing evidence that Lyn is required for CR3-\n\nmediated phagocytosis. The effect of Lyn on the host immune\n\nresponse was assessed by inflammatory cytokine production\n\nfollowing Schu S4 infection. Compared with the limited immune\n\nresponse in control siRNA transfected cells, Lyn knockdown led to\n\na significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production,\n\nincluding TNFa, IL-6 and IL-1b, following serum-opsonized Schu\nS4 infection (Fig. 9C) despite the impaired uptake, providing\n\nevidence for a critical role of Lyn in CR3-mediated host immune\n\nsuppression following Schu S4 infection.\n\nCR3 engagement leads to Akt activation and increased\nMKP-1 expression\n\nThe PI3K/Akt pathway has been shown to play a central role in\n\nthe host immune response during F. novicida infection [18],\n\nincluding the production of TNFa [61]. In contrast, a recent study\nindicated that this pathway is involved in the immune suppression\n\nfollowing LVS infection of mouse macrophages [62]. In support of\n\na role of PI3K/Akt in F. tularensis immune modulation, Lyn has\n\nbeen shown to form a complex with PI3K/Akt in different cell\n\ntypes [63,64] while TLR2 can also activate the PI3K/Akt pathway\n\nthrough Rac1 [65]. In order to examine whether the PI3K/Akt\n\npathway is involved in CR3-mediated immune suppression and\n\ncrosstalk with the TLR2 signaling pathway we infected control\n\nsiRNA, CD11b siRNA or TLR2 siRNA-transfected hMDMs with\n\nserum pre-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 and then\n\nexamined the activation of this pathway by Western blot. As\n\nshown in Fig. 9A, 30 min after infection, the phospho-Akt level\n\nwas consistently greater in hMDMs infected with serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4, compared with hMDMs infected with non-opsonized\n\nbacteria, indicating that optimal engagement of CR3 at least\n\ntransiently activates Akt. This was further supported by CD11b\n\nknockdown, which abolished the enhanced Akt activation seen in\n\ncells infected with serum pre-opsonized Schu S4 (below the level\n\nseen with non-opsonized bacteria). Besides CR3, TLR2 is also\n\ninvolved in Akt activation following Schu S4 infection (Fig. 9A).\n\nThis was indicated by the increased level of phospho-Akt when\n\ncells are infected with non-opsonized bacteria which will engage\n\nCR3 in a limited fashion. Moreover, the increase seen following\n\nserum pre-opsonization was reduced in TLR2 siRNA transfected\n\ncells. As Akt is downstream of both pathways this could be an\n\nimportant point where the two pathways crosstalk.\n\nFigure 7.

MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) can dephos-\n\nphorylate both phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine residues\n\nthus serving as important negative regulators of MAPKs [66]. In\n\norder to examine if MKPs are involved in CR3-mediated immune\n\nsuppression, we assessed MKP-1 levels during Schu S4 infection of\n\nhMDMs. Consistent with our observation of increased Akt and\n\ndecreased MAPK levels upon infection with serum-opsonized\n\nSchu S4, the MKP-1 level also increased rapidly after serum pre-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 infection but not following infection with non-\n\nopsonized bacteria, suggesting a role for CR3 engagement.\n\nConsistent with this possibility, the increased MKP-1 level was\n\nabolished when CD11b was knocked down (Fig. 9A). In contrast,\n\nthere was no effect following TLR2 knockdown. Together, these\n\ndata map a pathway for CR3-mediated immune suppression that\n\nincludes activation of Lyn and Akt, and an increased level of\n\nMKP-1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nF. tularensis is highly virulent with a very low dose of infection,\n\nwhich is often lethal before a fully effective adaptive immune\n\nresponse can be mounted [67,68]. This high virulence and rapid\n\nlethality are at least partially due to the ability of F. tularensis to\n\nsubvert or suppress host pro-inflammatory immune responses\n\n[16,69]. F. tularensis infection of macrophages and dendritic cells\n\nleads to very limited secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines\n\nIL-1b, IL-6 and TNFa [13–15,70] and unresponsiveness to\nsubsequent stimulation by TLR agonists [14,15]. In the current\n\nstudy, we provide evidence for a pathway that links CR3-mediated\n\nphagocytosis for F. tularensis with immune suppression that involves\n\ncrosstalk with TLR2.\n\nComplement component C3 deposition on the F. tularensis\n\nsurface has been previously characterized [25,71], and optimal\n\nuptake of the highly virulent strain by human macrophages\n\nrequires C3 deposition and its receptor CR3 [21]. Despite the fact\n\nthat significantly more bacteria are phagocytosed by human\n\nmacrophages in the presence of serum or C3, to our surprise we\n\nobserved very limited pro-inflammatory cytokine production along\n\nwith decreased activation of MAPK ERK1/2 and p38, and NF-\n\nkB under this condition. We excluded the possibilities that this C3-\nmediated immune suppression was due to a difference in the\n\nkinetics of phagocytosis or possible involvement of certain bacterial\n\ncomponents/virulence factors, and confirmed the role of CR3 in\n\nthis immune suppression via siRNA knockdown of the receptor.\n\nFurther we provide direct evidence for the requirement of the\n\nCR3 cytoplasmic tail for C3 opsonized F. tularensis-mediated\n\nsuppression of immune function in human macrophages. In\n\naddition we identify a pathway downstream of CR3 leading to\n\nimmune suppression that includes Lyn, Akt and MKP-1. The\n\nengagement of CR3 leads to activation of Lyn, and the role of Lyn\n\nin immune suppression was confirmed by siRNA knockdown.\n\nCR3 engagement also led to transient activation of Akt and an\n\nincreased level of MKP-1. These findings are consistent with the\n\ninhibition of ERK1/2 and p38 activation as well as limited pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine production following Schu S4 infection.\n\nThus, we identify a key pathway that links a receptor critical for F.\n\ntularensis phagocytosis with post-phagocytic signaling events\n\nimportant for immune suppression following Schu S4 infection,\n\nand the crosstalk downstream of two critical receptors in innate\n\nimmunity: CR3 and TLR2 (Fig. 10).\n\nThe crosstalk revealed here is complex and involves interactions\n\nbetween TLR2 signaling and both inside-out and outside-in\n\nsignaling of CR3 by F. tularensis. First, CR3 is required for efficient\n\nF. tularensis phagocytosis while TLR2 is also partially involved.\n\nThis is likely through inside-out activation of CR3 which proceeds\n\nthrough Rac1, PI3K and cytohesin-1 [33,34] and involves the\n\nactin cytoskeleton-binding protein talin (Fig. S3). The activated\n\nCR3 will then efficiently bind C3bi-coated bacteria, generate CR3\n\noutside-in signaling involving Lyn and Akt, and negatively regulate\n\nTLR2-mediated immune responses by limiting the activation of\n\nMAPKs through increased MKP-1. Another possibility we cannot\n\nexclude from our studies is that the inhibition of TLR2 signaling\n\nhappens at the level of receptor ligation. For example, it is possible\n\nthat C3 deposition on F. tularensis can block the recognition of\n\nTLR2 ligands on the bacterial surface. In this regard, a recent\n\nstudy showed that F. tularensis grown in different media has distinct\n\nbacterial surface structures, which in certain cases shields TLR2\n\nligands on the bacterial surface and consequently blocks the host\n\nimmune response [42]. The net result of CR3 engagement by F.\n\ntularensis is efficient phagocytosis and limited immune response.\n\nAlthough CR3 is present on the very cells that are meant to\n\ncontrol F. tularensis infection, it allows for a relatively ‘‘silent’’\n\nmeans of entry to macrophages.\n\nWe consistently observed a difference in the kinetics of ERK1/2\n\nand p38 inhibition in our study. While the inhibition of ERK1/2\n\noccurred as early as 5 min post infection, inhibition of p38 was not\n\noptimal until 30 min (Fig. 7B). This difference in kinetics has\n\nimplications for MKP-1 regulation and function. In our study, the\n\nlevel of MKP-1 was not increased until 15 to 30 minutes post\n\ninfection. In addition, although MKP-1 can deactivate ERK1/2\n\nwhen it is highly induced, p38 is its preferred substrate [66].\n\nTherefore taken together, although our current model of the\n\nsignaling cascade can explain the inhibition of p38 activation,\n\nother mechanisms are likely to be involved in the early inhibition\n\nof ERK1/2. Further studies are underway to characterize the\n\nmechanisms enabling early ERK1/2 inhibition. Insight is provid-\n\ned by the modeling of C3-opsonized F. tularensis engagement of\n\nCR3 [72].\n\nThe observed CR3-mediated immune suppression is relatively\n\nspecific to Schu S4. This is different from the immune suppression\n\nmediated by RipA, a Francisella protein that is conserved in all\n\nsubspecies [52]. In our studies, F. novicida induced a much more\n\nrobust immune response than Schu S4. In addition, serum or C3\n\nhad very little suppressive effect. F. novicida always has a much\n\nhigher phagocytosis rate than Schu S4 in the absence and presence\n\nof serum (data not shown) suggesting the two strains use different\n\nmeans of cellular entry. Thus, differences in the early immune\n\nresponse to Schu S4 and F. novicida can be at least partly due to\n\ntheir engaging different receptors during phagocytosis. For\n\nexample, it is possible that F. novicida more efficiently engages\n\nboth CR3 and Fcc receptors during phagocytosis, leading to a\nmore robust immune response. Abundant natural antibody has\n\nbeen found on the surface of F. novicida that is capable of engaging\n\nFcc receptors [19]. Consistent with the notion that immune\nsuppression is critical for the success of F. tularensis as a human\n\npathogen, Schu S4 is highly virulent in humans whereas F. novicida\n\nis not. Beyond this, our studies do not rule out differences in\n\nbacterial surface-exposed ligands between Schu S4 and F. novicida\n\nthat would still be present after PFA treating bacteria that could\n\nengage different receptors. We believe that differences in receptor-\n\nligand interactions at the macrophage surface will lead to\n\nsignificant differences in the host cell response due to associated,\n\nunique, combinatorial signaling events.\n\nThe negative regulatory role of the PI3K/Akt pathway on pro-\n\ninflammatory immune responses has been demonstrated in other\n\nstudies [73–75] including a recent study with LVS infection of\n\nmouse macrophages, which identified the role of Akt and MKP-1\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 11 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nin the immune suppression [62]. As LVS has a similar level of\n\nphagocytosis as Schu S4 (which is lower than that seen with F.\n\nnovicida), and efficient uptake also requires serum-opsonization\n\n[19], it is possible that LVS uses a similar pathway as Schu S4 for\n\nimmunosuppression. At a later stage of infection (24 h post\n\ninfection), F. novicida activates while Schu S4 inhibits the PI3K/Akt\n\npathway by differentially regulating SHIP-1 through induction of\n\nmiR-155 [41]. Our studies support the idea that the induction of\n\nbroad immune suppression by F. tularensis in the host occurs at\n\nmultiple levels and by different mechanisms during the course of\n\ninfection. The current study provides evidence that immune\n\nsuppression mechanisms are initiated at the earliest state of\n\ninfection, i.e. during the phagocytic process itself.\n\nIn addition to CR3, other complement receptors might also\n\nplay a role during F. tularensis phagocytosis. C3bi can also be\n\nrecognized by CR4 (CD11c/CD18) and CRIg [76]. These\n\nreceptors might also be involved in the immune suppression\n\nobserved during F. tularensis infection in the presence of serum. In\n\naddition, C1q is deposited on the F. tularensis surface (Clay CD &\n\nSchlesinger LS, manuscript in preparation). Interestingly, C1q\n\nsuppresses LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by\n\nNF-kB inhibition and CREB activation [77–79]. Opsono-phago-\ncytosis of C1q-bound apoptotic cells occurs via CD91/calreticulin\n\n[80] and is immunosuppressive. Thus, it is intriguing to\n\nhypothesize that C1q receptors might also be involved in the\n\nimmune suppression observed here. We are further exploring this\n\npossibility.\n\nSignaling events associated with the complement system\n\nhave been examined in the case of other pathogens. For exam-\n\nple, P. gingivalis can cleave C5 to release C5a, which activates\n\nFigure 10. Model of CR3-mediated immune suppression and crosstalk with TLR2 signaling during the phagocytosis of Schu S4 by\nhuman macrophages. In the absence of serum, pathogen associated molecular determinants such as lipoproteins will be recognized by TLR2\nwhich activates MAP kinase (ERK1/2 and p38) and NF-kB signaling pathways, and induces host pro-inflammatory responses. Phagocytosis is limited\nwithout the optimal engagement of CR3. In the presence of serum C3bi is deposited on the Ft Schu S4 surface, which optimally engages CR3 and\nenhances phagocytosis. At the same time, TLR2 is activated at least to some degree, leading to inside-out activation of CR3, which contributes to\nenhanced outside-in CR3 signaling and increased phagocytosis. CR3-mediated signaling activates Lyn and AKT, and leads to an increased MKP-1 level\nwhich results in inhibition of MAPK activity. This allows for increased phagocytosis simultaneously with a dampened host immune response.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003114.g010\n\nCR3 Mediates Immune Suppression for Francisella\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003114\n\n\n\nintracellular Ca\n2+\n\nsignaling and cAMP, leading to impaired\n\niNOS-dependent killing in macrophages [81]. P. gingivalis can\n\nactivate CR3 through inside-out activation downstream of\n\nTLR2 signaling, induces ERK1/2, and selectively down-\n\nregulates IL-12 expression [82,83]. Blastomyces dermatitidis uses\n\nBAD1, a virulent factor on the pathogen surface to engage CR3\n\nfor TNFa suppression and immune evasion by unknown\nmechanisms [84]. In addition to its role in the phagocytosis of\n\nbacteria, CR3 is also responsible for clearance of C3bi-coated\n\napoptotic cells without initiating vigorous immune responses\n\n[85]. In this context, CR3 ligation is immunosuppressive [86]\n\nand can inhibit IL-12 production [37,87]. Although inside-out\n\nactivation of CR3 through TLR2 has been reported for other\n\npathogens [33,34,40], our data provide evidence that F. tularensis\n\nis able to take advantage of both inside-out and outside-in\n\nsignaling of CR3 to achieve efficient entry as well as immune\n\nsuppression for its own survival. Thus, we provide new\n\ninformation on how outside-in signaling of CR3 by a pathogen\n\ncan negatively regulate TLR signaling. CR3 is a major receptor\n\nfor intracellular pathogens such as Mycobacteria [88], Leishmania\n\n[89,90] and Legionella [91]. Therefore it will be interesting to\n\ninvestigate whether these pathogens also employ similar\n\nsignaling mechanisms related to CR3 in order to enhance their\n\nsurvival during infection. In this regard, during infection of\n\nmurine macrophages with Mycobacterium avium, C3-depletion\n\nresults in a significantly higher level of TNFa production [92].\nTLR2, PI3K and cytohesin-1 mediated inside-out activation of\n\nCR3 has also been found to play a role in the phagocytosis of\n\nMycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) [34]. In the\n\ncase of Leishmania, ligation of CR3 has been shown to inhibit the\n\nproduction of IL-12 [93].\n\nDuring the course of our studies, we entertained the idea of\n\nextending them to the mouse model using CR3 knockout mice.\n\nWe first examined the activation of ERK, p38 and Akt during\n\nserum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 synchronized\n\nphagocytosis by mouse bone marrow derived macrophages\n\n(BMDMs) from wild type C57/Bl mice. In stark contrast to the\n\nresults obtained with human macrophages, the activation of\n\nERK and p38 was significantly enhanced in mouse BMDMs\n\nincubated with serum-opsonized Schu S4 compared to non-\n\nopsonized Schu S4 (Fig. S5). This result indicates that the C3\n\nopsonin-mediated inhibitory effect of Schu S4 on MAPKs is\n\nspecific to human macrophages. In this regard, there is\n\ngrowing evidence that the mouse model does not recapitulate\n\nhuman disease for a number of infectious agents. In fact, both\n\nSchu S4 and F. novicida are highly virulent in mice whereas\n\nonly the former is highly virulent in humans. Beyond this, we\n\nand others are beginning to see major differences between\n\nmice and man (and their cells), particularly in the innate\n\nimmune system, where the array of PRRs on macrophages, for\n\nexample, and their signaling cascades are quite different\n\n[94,95].\n\nIn summary, our results demonstrate a pathway that links an\n\nimportant phagocytic receptor, CR3, on human macrophages\n\nwith the down-regulation of host immune responses that allows\n\nfor an efficient, but relatively ‘‘silent’’ mode of entry of the\n\nhighly virulent F. tularensis. This involves active crosstalk\n\nbetween CR3- and TLR2-mediated signaling pathways. CR3-\n\nmediated immune suppression can be an important strategy\n\nused by F. tularensis for its success as a human pathogen. These\n\nresults have broader implications in understanding the patho-\n\ngenesis of other intracellular pathogens as well as the crosstalk\n\nbetween different PRRs and phagocytic receptors, especially\n\nTLRs and integrins.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nBacterial strains\nF. novicida U112 (Fn) was obtained from ATCC and F. tularensis\n\nsubspecies tularensis Schu S4 strain (Ft) was generously provided by\n\nDr. Rick Lyons (Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO).\n\nThe bacteria were cultured on Chocolate II plates (Becton\n\nDickinson, Sparks, MD).

These represent optimized concentrations based upon\n\npreliminary experiments where lower concentrations of siRNAs\n\nled to lesser effects on the target proteins and higher concentra-\n\ntions led to cell toxicity.

Bacteria were incubated with hMDM monolayers at an\n\nMOI of 50 in RHH (RPMI 1640 with L-glutamine, 10 mM\n\nHEPES and 0.25% human serum albumin) or RHS (RPMI 1640\n\nwith L-glutamine, 10 mM HEPES and serum) with 10%\n\nautologous serum, 10% C3-depleted serum (C3-dpl) or 10% C3-\n\nrepleted serum (C3-rpl) for 15 min on a nutator for equal\n\ndistribution, and then under stationary condition for another\n\n45 min at 37uC, 5% CO2.

This allowed for the\n\ndifferential staining of extracellular (stained with both AF488 and\n\nAF546, shown as yellow or green) and intracellular (stained with\n\nonly AF546, shown as red) bacteria. Host cell nuclei were stained\n\nwith 0.05 mg/ml of 49, 69-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at\nroom temperature for 5 min.\n\nThe coverslips were mounted on glass slides and viewed using\n\nan Olympus FluoView 1000 confocal microscope. For quantifica-\n\ntion purposes, triplicate samples of at least 300 cells per group\n\nwere counted on an Olympus BX51 epi-fluorescence microscope,\n\nand the results are presented as mean 6 SD of representative data\n\nof at least three independent experiments.\n\nFor Talin co-localization experiments, hMDMs were infected\n\nwith serum-opsonized or non-opsonized Schu S4 at MOI of 50 for\n\n30 min at 37uC using the synchronized phagocytosis assay. Cells\nwere washed three times with PBS and fixed with 2% parafor-\n\nmaldehyde followed by antibody staining for CD11b and Talin.\n\nBriefly, cells were then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in\n\nPBS at room temperature for 15 min, blocked with 5% goat serum\n\nand 0.5% BSA in PBS, incubated with CD11b antibody for 3 hrs,\n\nwashed 3 times, and incubated with Talin antibody for 3 hrs at\n\nroom temperature. After washing, the cells were incubated with an\n\nanti-mouse AF488 (CD11b) and anti-rabbit AF594 (Talin)\n\nsecondary antibodies for 1 hr at room temperature. The nuclei\n\nwere stained with DAPI. For NF-kB p65 translocation studies in\nhMDMs, infected cells were fixed, permeabilized and blocked as\n\ndescribed above, and incubated with NF-kB p65 antibody for\n3 hrs at room temperature followed by anti-rabbit AF594\n\nsecondary antibody. The nuclei were stained with DAPI.\n\nStatistical analysis\nExperiments were carried out independently at least 3 times\n\nwith different donors. Results varied among donors but the\n\npatterns were the same with internal controls in each experiment.\n\nRepresentative results are shown. Prism software (GraphPad) was\n\nused to determine the statistical significance of differences in the\n\nmeans of experimental groups. An unpaired, two-tailed Student t-\n\ntest was used when comparing the means from two groups of data\n\nand a 1-Way ANOVA and Tukey’s Multiple Comparison Test\n\nwas used when comparing three or more groups. The p\n\nvalue,0.05 were considered significant (*p,0.05, **p,0.005,\n\nand ***p,0.001).\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Host adaptation does not affect serum-\nmediated immune suppression by human macrophages.\nHost adapted Schu S4 (Ft-T) was obtained by passaging bacteria\n\nthrough THP-1 cells. hMDMs were infected with Ft-T or non-\n\npassaged Ft Schu S4 at an MOI of 50:1 in RHH or RHS with\n\n10% autologous serum. Extracellular bacteria were killed with\n\n50 mg/ml gentamycin at 37uC for 30 min. Media was replenished\nand cell-free culture supernatants were collected at 16 hrs post\n\ninfection. TNFa (A) and IL-1b (B) concentrations were measured\nby ELISAs. Uninfected resting cells (R) were included as a control.\n\nData are representative of 3 independent experiments.
