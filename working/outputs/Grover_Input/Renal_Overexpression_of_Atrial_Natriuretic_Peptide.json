Both atrial natriuretic\npeptide (ANP) and hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1ùõº) exert cytoprotective effects. We tested the hypothesis that renal expression\nof ANP and HIF-1ùõº is involved in a mechanism responding to the oxidative stress produced in the kidneys of rats chronically fed a\nhigh sodium diet. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with a normal salt (0.4%NaCl) (NS) or a high salt (8%NaCl) (HS) diet for 3 weeks,\nwith or without the administration of tempol (T), an inhibitor of oxidative stress, in the drinking water. We measured the mean\narterial pressure (MAP), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and urinary sodium excretion (UVNa). We evaluated the expression of\nANP, HIF-1ùõº, and transforming growth factor (TGF-ùõΩ1) in renal tissues by western blot and immunohistochemistry. The animals\nfed a high salt diet showed increased MAP and UVNa levels and enhanced renal immunostaining of ANP, HIF-1ùõº, and TGF-ùõΩ1.\nThe administration of tempol together with the sodium overload increased the natriuresis further and prevented the elevation of\nblood pressure and the increased expression of ANP, TGF-ùõΩ1, and HIF-1ùõº compared to their control. These findings suggest that\nHIF-1ùõº and ANP, synthesized by the kidney, are involved in an adaptive mechanism in response to a sodium overload to prevent\nor attenuate the deleterious effects of the oxidative stress and the hypoxia on the development of fibrosis.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated\nto play an important pathophysiological role in the kid-\nney [1‚Äì4]. ROS can activate the mitochondrial uncoupling\nprotein 2 (UCP-2), leading to inefficient renal O\n\n2\nusage\n\nand contributing to renal hypoxia [5]. Changes in cellular\noxygen concentrations induce tightly regulated response\npathways that attempt to restore oxygen supply to cells\nand modulate cell function in hypoxic conditions. Most of\n\nthese responses occur through the induction of the tran-\nscription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) which\ncoordinates the expression of diverse adaptive genes against\nthe hypoxic injury [6, 7]. HIF-1 transcriptionally upregulates\nthe expression of metabolic proteins (GLUT-1), adhesion\nproteins (integrins), soluble growth factors (TGF-ùõΩ and\nVEGF), and extracellularmatrix components (type I collagen\nand fibronectin), which enhance the repair process. For these\nreasons, HIF-1 is viewed as a positive regulator of organ repair\nand tissue fibrosis [8, 9].\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nBioMed Research International\nVolume 2014, Article ID 936978, 10 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/936978\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/936978\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\nIn the kidney, a predominant enzyme involved in\noxidative stress development is NADPH-oxidase, which\nis upregulated by increased sodium tubular transport,\nluminal flow, or cytokines release [10, 11]. In turn, the\nsuperoxide anion increases tubular NaCl transport, fur-\nther enhancing oxidative stress [12]. It is well known that\na high salt intake increases the oxidative stress in the\nkidneys of normal and salt-sensitive rats [1‚Äì4]. In this\nregard, we have reported that a high salt diet in Sprague-\nDawley rats is able to increase the oxidative stress. We\nalso showed that the administration of tempol (4-hydroxy-\n2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl), which is a permeate\nsuperoxide dismutase mimetic commonly used to inhibit the\noxidative stress, prevented those changes and produced a\npotent natriuretic and diuretic effect. Thus, we concluded\nthat the increase of the oxidative stress induced by sodium\noverload could account for antinatriuresis [1]. It has also\nbeen described that, in models of experimental salt-sensitive\nhypertension, tempol improved the renal hemodynamic\nresponse and electrolyte excretory function, while abolish-\ning salt-sensitive hypertension and renal oxidative stress\n[13].\n\nA growing number of mammalian genes have been\nidentified to play a key role in the cellular adaptive response\nto counter-regulate the renal hypoxia and the consequent\nprocess of fibrosis, among which is atrial natriuretic peptide\n(ANP). ANP is a member of a natriuretic peptide family\nwhich, besides its role in the regulation of volume homeosta-\nsis, has been noted to exert protective effects in several cell\ntypes in response to oxidative stress [14] and fibrosis [15] and\non the adaptation to hypoxia [16].\n\nBased on these data, we hypothesized that endogenous\nrenal ANP andHIF-1ùõº could constitute endogenous adaptive\nmechanisms in response to the oxidative stress produced in\nthe kidney of rats chronically fed with a high sodium diet.\nTherefore, in the current study we determined the effect\nof a high-salt diet on the regulation of renal expression\nof HIF-1ùõº, ANP, and TGF-ùõΩ1 in Sprague-Dawley rats. In\naddition, we evaluated whether tempol administration, by\ninhibiting oxidative stress, prevents the increase of these\nmolecules. Understanding these endogenous mechanisms\ncan lead to finding a better therapeutic approach in salt-\nsensitive hypertension.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Animal Protocol and ExperimentalMeasurements. Exper-\niments were conducted in accordance with the care and use\nof research animals of international guiding principles and\nlocal regulations concerning the care and use of laboratory\nanimals for biomedical research (ANMAT, 6344/96; Institute\nof Laboratory Animal Resources, 1996) (14), as well as the\n‚ÄúInternational Ethical Guiding Principles for Biomedical\nResearch onAnimals‚Äù established by theCIOMS (Council for\nInternational Organizations of Medical Sciences) (15). These\nprotocols were approved by Universidad de Buenos Aires\n(UBACYT B113) and the National Scientific and Technical\nResearch Council (CONICET, PIP 1337/09).\n\nMale Sprague Dawley rats, 5-6 weeks old (180‚Äì200 g body\nweight), were used in the experiments. The animals were\nhoused in steel cages in a controlled temperature animal\nroom at 23 ¬± 2‚àòC, exposed to a daily 12-hour light-dark\ncycle (light on from 07:00 a.m. to 07:00 p.m.), fed the diets\ndescribed below for three weeks, andwere given free access to\ntap water. The experiments were performed in rats randomly\ndivided into four groups (ùëõ = 6 for each group): (a) NS\n(control): fed a normal salt diet (0.4 g% NaCl); (b) HS:\nfed a high salt diet (8% g NaCl); (c) NS-T: fed a normal\nsalt diet (0.4 g% NaCl) plus 1mM tempol (Sigma-Aldrich\nInc, St. Louis, Missouri, USA), administered in the drinking\nwater; (d) HS-T: fed a high salt diet (8% g NaCl) plus 1mM\ntempol administered in the drinking water. After 3 weeks,\nthe rats were anaesthetized intraperitoneally with urethane\n(1.2 g‚ãÖkg‚àí1) and a PE-90 tube (3 cm long) was inserted into\nthe trachea to maintain an open airway. The left femoral vein\nwas catheterized with a Silastic cannula (0.12mm i.d.) for\ncontinuous infusion.The right carotid arterywas catheterized\nwith a T4 tube for blood sampling and for continuous mean\narterial pressure recording (MAP) by means of a Statham\nGOULD P23ID transducer coupled to a Grass Polygraph\n79D during all the procedures. The bladder was cannulated\nfor urine collection using a PE-75 cannula. A femoral vein\ninfusion with isotonic saline solution (ISS, 0.15M NaCl)\nwas performed at a rate of 0.04mL‚ãÖmin‚àí1 (Syringe Infusion\nPump, Sage, Orion) for 60 minutes to allow for a steady\ndiuresis and to permit urine collection in all groups.Then, ISS\ninfusion continued for another 60min at the same rate during\nthe experimental period. From each animal, a blood sample\nwas collected at 30 minutes and a urine sample was collected\nfrom 0 to 60 minutes for sodium, potassium, and creatinine\nmeasurements. At the end of the experimental period, other\nblood samples were obtained from the abdominal cava vein,\nimmediately placed into plastic tubes containing 15% EDTA,\nand kept on ice for ANP dosage. The kidney was rapidly\nexcised, decapsulated, longitudinally cut, and harvested for\nimmunohistochemical studies.\n\n2.2. ANP Radioimmunoassay. The plasma ANP extraction\nprocedure was followed as described by Cavallero et al.\n[17]. The radioimmunoassay (RIA) was performed using\nan ANP-rat RIA commercial kit (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals,\nBurlingame, CA) [18].\n\n2.3. Urine and Blood Measurements. Urinary and plasma\nsodium and creatinine were measured by standard methods\nusing an autoanalyzer. Creatinine clearance was assessed\nin order to evaluate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).\nGFR and sodium fractional excretion (FENa) were calculated\naccording to a standard formula. Urinary flow (UV) is\nexpressed as ùúáL‚ãÖmin‚àí1, plasmatic sodium (PLNa) concen-\ntration as mEq‚ãÖL‚àí1, sodium urinary excretion (UVNa) as\nùúámol‚ãÖmin‚àí1, GFR as mL‚ãÖmin‚àí1, and FENa as percentage.\n\n2.4. Kidney Processing for Histological Examination. Renal\ntissues were fixed in phosphate-buffered 10% formaldehyde\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 3\n\n(pH 7.20) and embedded in paraffin. For immunohisto-\nchemistry, sections were deparaffinated and rehydrated, and\nendogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by treatment\nwith 0.5% H\n\n2\nO\n2\nin methanol for 20 minutes. Local ANP,\n\nHIF-1ùõº, and TGF-ùõΩ1 were detected using the following\nspecific antibodies: rabbit anti-ANP (Phoenix Pharmaceuti-\ncal; dilution 1 : 500), rabbit anti-HIF-1ùõº (Novus Biologicals,\nInc., Littleton, CO; dilution 1 : 1000), and rabbit anti-TGF-\nùõΩ1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; dilution 1 : 200). Immunos-\ntaining was performed with a commercial modified avidin-\nbiotin-peroxidase complex technique (Vectastain ABC kit,\nUniversal Elite, Vector Laboratories, CA) and with coun-\nterstaining with haematoxylin. Histological sections were\nobserved in a Nikon E400 light microscope (Nikon Instru-\nment Group, Melville, New York, USA). All measurements\nwere carried out using image analysis software (Image-Pro\nPlus ver. 4.5 for Windows, Media Cybernetics, LP. Silver\nSpring,MD,USA). Immunoreactivities for ANP, HIF-1ùõº, and\nTGF-ùõΩ1 are expressed as percentage of positive stained area\n¬± standard error of the mean (SEM) in proximal convoluted\ntubules (PT), distal tubules (DT), thick ascending limb of the\nloop of Henle (THAL), cortical collecting ducts (CCD), and\nmedullary collecting ducts (MCD). Tissue samples of all the\nanimals were evaluated in a blinded fashion and separately by\ntwo researchers regarding knowledge of treatments.\n\n2.4.1. Preparation of RenalHomogenates forWestern Blot. The\nright kidney from all groups was extracted, dissected, and\nseparated. Tissue samples were homogenized on ice with\na Tissue Tearor (Biospec Products Inc.) in a buffer mix-\nture (50mmol‚ãÖL‚àí1 Tris, 0.1mmol‚ãÖL‚àí1 EDTA, 0.1mmol‚ãÖL‚àí1\nEGTA, 1% Triton, 1mmol‚ãÖL‚àí1 PMSF, 1 ùúámol‚ãÖL‚àí1 pepstatin,\n2 ùúámol‚ãÖL‚àí1 leupeptin, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail\n(Roche Diagnostics). Protein concentration in the Triton-\nsoluble supernatant was determined by the Lowry technique.\n\n2.4.2. Western Blot Analysis for HIF-1ùõº and ANP. Pooled\nsamples of renal tissue from five animals of each group and\ncontaining similar amounts of protein (150ùúág protein/lane)\nwere separated by electrophoresis in 10% SDS polyacry-\nlamide gels (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose\nmembrane (Bio-Rad) and incubated with mouse polyclonal\nanti-ANP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. 1 : 800 dilution)\nor rabbit monoclonal-anti-HIF-1ùõº (Abcam; 1 : 1000 dilution).\nFor ANP, a secondary immune reaction followed with a\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) conjugated with horseradish\nperoxidase (dilution of 1 : 10000). For HIF-1ùõº a secondary\nimmunereaction followed with a biotinylated anti-rabbit\n(dilution of 1 : 1000) and a 3rd antibody conjugated with\nhorseradish peroxidase (dilution of 1 : 1000). The samples\nwere revealed by chemiluminescence using ECL reagent\n(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2‚Äì4min. The density\nof the respective bands was quantified by densitometric\nscanning of Western blots using a Hewlett-Packard scanner\nandTotallab analyzer software (BiodynamicsCorp.). To avoid\ninaccuracies in protein loading, beta-tubulin was measured\nas internal standard (anti-beta tubulin, Ab 6046, rabbit\npolyclonal antibody) for each blot and protein levels were\n\ncalculated and expressed as the ratio between the optical\ndensities of the bands corresponding to ANP or HIF-1ùõº and\nùõΩ-tubulin.\n\n2.5. Statistical Analysis. Results from urine and blood mea-\nsurements andMAP are expressed as mean ¬± SEM. Gaussian\ndistribution was evaluated by the Kolmogorov and Smirnov\nmethod and the comparison among groups was carried out\nusing ANOVA followed by the Bonferroni test. ùëÉ values <\n0.05 were considered significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Body Weight and Mean Arterial Pressure. There were no\nsignificant differences in body weight between control and\nexperimental groups (grams; NS: 330 ¬± 9; HS: 320 ¬± 6; NS-\nT: 314 ¬± 13; HS-T: 320 ¬± 7).\n\nTheMAPwas increased in the HS fed group compared to\nthe NS-fed group (mmHg; NS: 94 ¬± 3 versus HS: 107 ¬± 3‚àó).\nTempol administration did not modify MAP levels in NS\nanimals but normalized MAP in the HS-T group, reaching\nMAP levels very similar to those observed inNS rats (mmHg;\nNS-T: 97 ¬± 2 versus HS-T: 95 ¬± 3‚Ä†) ‚àóùëÉ < 0.05 versus\nrespective NS group, ‚Ä†ùëÉ < 0.05 versus respective group\nwithout tempol.\n\n3.2. Plasma Sodium and Urinary Sodium Excretion (Table 1).\nHigh salt diet and tempol administration did not alter plasma\nsodium in any experimental group.\n\nThe administration of a high salt diet did not alter\nthe GFR, which was increased by tempol in HS-T group\nwith respect to the HS group. Tempol administration also\nincreased GFR in the NS-T group as compared with the NS\ngroup.\n\nThe administration of a high salt diet led to a greater\nUVNa, which was further increased in HS-T group with\nrespect to the NS-T and HS groups. Moreover, tempol\nincreased UVNa in NS fed rats.\n\nThe administration of a high salt diet raised FENa in HS\ngroup with respect to the NS group. Tempol administration\nincreased the FENa further in the HS-T group as compared\nwith NS-T and to the HS group. FENa was not altered in the\nNS-T group.\n\n3.3. Plasmatic ANP. Plasma ANP concentration (pg‚ãÖmL‚àí1)\ndid not differ significantly between the NS (325.75 ¬± 66.69)\nand HS (260.00 ¬± 7.38) groups, as measured by RIA.\n\n3.4. Intrarenal ANP Expression. Figure 1 shows quantified\nlevels of ANP immunoexpression in renal tissues. Repre-\nsentative images of ANP positive staining are shown in\nFigure 2(a) renal cortex and Figure 2(b) renal medulla. The\nanalysis of renal sections obtained from the HS group\nrevealed increased positive staining for ANP in glomeruli,\nTHAL, and CCD with respect to the NS group.

Tempol did not\nshow additional effects in the NS-T group as compared with\nits control and prevented the increase of TGF-ùõΩ1 staining in\nHS-T group.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nOur results showed that a high salt diet in normal rats resulted\nin a greater ANP expression in glomeruli, THAL and CCD,\nwhere the profibrotic marker TGF-ùõΩ1 was also increased.\nIn addition, enhanced HIF-1ùõº expression was observed not\nonly in the renal medulla as it has been previously described\n[19], but also in renal cortex. We found that tempol admin-\nistration, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, favored urinary\nsodium excretion, prevented the increase of ANP and TGF-\nùõΩ1 expression, and normalized HIF-1ùõº expression, the latter\nexcept in THAL. Western blot analysis confirmed our data,\nshowing increased positive staining of HS group for ANP\nand HIF-1ùõΩ and decreased the expression of tempol groups\ncompared to their respective controls. These results suggest\nthat increased ANP and HIF-1ùõº expression in renal cortex\nand medulla could be involved in an adaptive response to the\noxidative stress resulting from a high salt diet.\n\nAs we have previously reported, a chronic salt overload\n(8% NaCl diet during 3 weeks) does not alter body weight\nor plasma sodium but causes higher MAP levels as well\nas urinary sodium excretion [1]. Even though the animals\nused in this study have their blood pressure taken under\nanesthesia, we have recently reported the same effect of a\nhigh salt diet on theMAP in conscious animals [20], allowing\nus to conclude that the anesthesia does not affect the blood\npressure when the different diet groups are compared. On the\n\nother hand, the administration of tempol normalized MAP\nlevels observed in the HS group, and it also increased further\nurinary sodium excretion. These results are in agreement\nwith previous studies, where treatmentwith tempol improved\nrenal hemodynamic and electrolyte excretory function in\nsalt-sensitive hypertension models [1, 21]. The effects of\ntempol, promoting natriuresis and preventing endogenous\nincrease of ANP, could suggest that, by inhibiting oxidative\nstress, tubular sodium transport decreases and thus prevents\nthe endogenous ANP expression as natriuretic hormone.\nHowever, we observed a clear raise in ANP expression\nalso in glomeruli from rats fed a high salt diet, in which\nsodium transport does not occur. Therefore, in addition to\na natriuretic effect, endogenous ANP could be exerting other\neffects in glomeruli and tubules. Furthermore, the increase\nof renal ANP levels coincided with TGF-ùõΩ1 over-expression\nin glomeruli, THAL and CCD. In this regard, it is known\nthat TGF-ùõΩ1 upregulates the transcription of the serum and\nglucocorticoid-dependent kinase hSGK1, involved in the reg-\nulation of two important factors for cell volume regulation,\nthat is, the renal epithelial Na+ channel ENaC and the thick\nascending limb Na+, K+, and 2Cl‚àí cotransporter NKCC\n[22]. The increase of cell volume stimulates protein synthesis\nand inhibits protein degradation, contributing to enhancing\nthe net formation and deposition of matrix proteins. In\naddition, TGF-ùõΩ1 transduces intracellular signals through\ntype 1 (TGF-ùõΩR1) and type 2 (TGF-ùõΩR2) receptors, via the\nnuclear translocation of Smad3 proteins, thus contributing\nto a fibrotic response [23]. It has been demonstrated that\nthe activation of ANP/cGMP/PKG signaling phosphorylates\nSmad3 and disrupts TGF-ùõΩ1-induced nuclear translocation\nof pSmad3 and later downstream events, including myofi-\nbroblast transformation and the proliferation and expression\nof extracellular matrix molecules [24, 25]. Moreover, we\nhave previously demonstrated that an increase in TGF-\nùõΩ1 expression produced by an acute saline overload was\nprevented and reversed by the administration of low and\nnonhypotensive doses of ANP [26]. Taking this into account,\n\n\n\n8 BioMed Research International\n\nFigure 6:Quantitative representation of positive intrarenal transforming growth factor (TGF-ùõΩ1) immunostaining/ùúám2. Values are expressed\nas percentage ¬± SEM, ùëõ = 5-6. ‚àóùëÉ < 0.05 versus respective control NS; #ùëÉ < 0.05 versus respective control without tempol. NS: normal salt\ndiet group, HS: high salt diet group, NS-T: normal salt diet plus tempol group, HS-T: high salt diet plus tempol group, PT: proximal tubule,\nCCD: cortical collecting duct, THAL: thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, and MCD: medullary collecting duct.\n\nthe present results suggest that the raise of ANP expression in\nrats fed a high salt diet could constitute a counter-regulatory\nmechanism against antinatriuretic and/or profibrotic TGF-ùõΩ1\nactions.\n\nMeanwhile, the plasmatic concentration of ANP was not\naffected by dietary salt, suggesting that these animals did not\nchange cardiac ANP secretion [17]. Several reports provide\nevidence that plasmatic ANP increases after a chronic salt\nloading given by drinking 1‚Äì18% NaCl solutions [27, 28]\nor by a rat chow with high salt content [29]. However, the\n\nliterature also shows conflicting results reporting that ANP\nmRNA expression and circulating levels of ANP remained\nunaltered after the ingestion of high sodium diets [30]. The\npresent results show that renal ANP expression levels are\nindependent of circulating ANP levels and are subjected to\na different regulation. These findings are in accordance with\nSun et al. who have previously demonstrated that a dietary\nsalt supplementation may selectively increase ANP levels in\nthe kidney by downregulating its clearance receptor (NPR-C)\n[31].\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 9\n\nNS HS\n\nNS-T HS-T\n\nG\n\nG\nG\n\nG\nG\n\nG\n\n(a)\n\nNS HS\n\nNS-T HS-T\n\nMCD\n\nMCD\n\nMCDMCD\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 7: (a) Representative images of positive staining of TGF-ùõΩ1 in renal cortex.

NS: normal salt diet group, HS: high salt diet group, NS-T: normal salt diet plus tempol group,\nHS-T: high salt diet plus tempol group, G: glomerulus, and MCD: medullary collecting duct.\n\nOur study also shows that a high salt intake increased\nHIF-1ùõº expressionnot only in the renalmedulla, as it has been\ndescribed before [18], but also in renal cortex. Considering\nthat a high salt intake increases oxidative stress, renal tubular\ntransport, and hypoxia, it may constitute one of the possible\nfactors involved in the upregulation of HIF-1ùõº expression in\nrenal tissues [6, 32]. Additionally, it has been reported that a\nhigh salt intake inhibits PHD-2 expression, the predominant\nisoform in renal medulla of prolyl-hydroxylase enzyme,\nwhich promotes the degradation of HIF-1ùõº, increasing its\nexpression level [33]. In this way, recent studies have shown\nthat HIF-1ùõº may regulate the encoding genes of some\nenzymes in the THAL, as those of nitric oxide synthase\n(NOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and hemeoxygenase-1\n(HO-1), which are highly expressed in renal medulla [34,\n35]. However, the tempol administration, which prevents\noxidative stress and enhanced urinary sodium excretion,\nnormalized HIF-1ùõº expression in the HS group, except in\nTHAL from both groups fed a normal or a high salt diet.\nThese data suggest that tempol could prevent the hypoxia\nproduced by the oxidative stress as it has been described\n[5, 20], but not the hypoxia produced by greater sodium\ntransport in THAL, where the enhancement of sodium\nreabsorption in this tubular segment may be compensat-\ning the inhibition of sodium transport in PT, elicited by\ntempol.\n\nIn summary, the present findings suggest that HIF-1ùõº\nand ANP could represent a main adaptive mechanism in\nnormal rats, in response to a salt overload, counter-regulating\nthe hypoxia and fibrosis produced by oxidative stress, and\nplaying a crucial role in the maintenance of sodium balance.\nThe administration of tempol, as a scavenger of superoxide\nanion, prevents overexpression of ùõº and ANP.The disruption\nof this salt adaptive pathway in salt-sensitive rats could be\nthe cause of sodium retention, oxidative stress, inflammation,\nand fibrosis in these animals. The pharmacological poten-\ntiation of endogenous ANP may be a therapeutic approach\nfor the management of oxidative stress in salt-sensitive\nhypertension.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThe authors do not have direct financial conflict of interests.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by Grants from the Consejo\nNacional de Investigaciones CientÃÅƒ±ficas y TeÃÅcnicas (National\nCouncil for Scientific and Technical Research of Argentina)\n(CONICET PIP 112-1337) and Universidad de Buenos Aires\n(UBACYT 2002010100688).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] M.
