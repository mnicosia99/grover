Although the drug has long been considered to be an effective and safe therapeutic regime against\ninflammatory and cardiovascular disorders, consequences of its cyclooxygenase-independent attributes on platelets, the\nkey players in thrombogenesis, beg serious investigation. In this report we explored the effect of aspirin on platelet lifespan\nin murine model and its possible cytotoxicity against human platelets in vitro. Aspirin administration in mice led to\nsignificant reduction in half-life of circulating platelets, indicative of enhanced rate of platelet clearance. Aspirin-treated\nhuman platelets were found to be phagocytosed more efficiently by macrophages, associated with attenuation in platelet\nproteasomal activity and upregulation of conformationally active Bax, which were consistent with enhanced platelet\napoptosis. Although the dosage of aspirin administered in mice was higher than the therapeutic regimen against\ncardiovascular events, it is comparable with the recommended anti-inflammatory prescription. Thus, above observations\nprovide cautionary framework to critically re-evaluate prophylactic and therapeutic dosage regime of aspirin in systemic\ninflammatory as well as cardiovascular ailments.\n\nCitation: Nayak MK, Dash A, Singh N, Dash D (2014) Aspirin Delimits Platelet Life Span by Proteasomal Inhibition.

The\n\ncentral role of platelets in pathogenesis of occlusive coronary and\n\ncerebral thrombotic events has prompted in-depth investigations\n\ninto molecular underpinnings of aspirin action. Platelets generate\n\nthromboxane A2 (TXA2) in response to diverse physiological\n\nstimuli like collagen, thrombin and ADP that cause amplification\n\nof platelet aggregation and vasoconstriction [3,4]. Aspirin and\n\nother non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively\n\nattenuate activity of the enzyme cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), which\n\ncatalyzes biosynthesis of cyclic prostanoids like TXA2, prostacyclin\n\nand other prostaglandins (PG) [5]. Although this accounts for\n\nstrong anti-thrombotic potential of aspirin, inhibition of prosta-\n\nglandin synthesis, too, results in altered functions of normally\n\nprotective prostaglandins with potentially serious consequences.\n\nAspirin-induced inhibition of COX results in loss of cytoprotective\n\neffects of PGE2 on gastric mucosa, which partly accounts for\n\ngastrointestinal side effects associated with aspirin therapy [5–8],\n\nespecially during high dosage of aspirin administered for treatment\n\nof systemic inflammatory ailments including rheumatoid arthritis\n\n[9].\n\nAspirin also elicits effects that are independent of COX\n\ninhibition [10–17]. Prolonged use of NSAIDs has been reported\n\nto reduce the risk of malignancies, though their anti-cancer activity\n\nhas not been fully established [18–22]. Aspirin induces shedding of\n\nGPIba and GPV from platelet surface through activation of the\nmetalloproteinase ADAM17 and cell death [23,24]. Clinical trials\n\nhave indicated that chemopreventive properties of NSAIDs could\n\nbe due to induction of apoptosis [6–8]. Several mechanisms have\n\nbeen proposed to explain aspirin-induced apoptosis, which include\n\nupregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins [7,8,25,26] and oxidative\n\nstress [27,28]. Aspirin has been shown to induce decrement in\n\nmitochondrial transmembrane potential and stimulate intrinsic\n\npathway of apoptosis in mouse Neuro 2a cells [29]. There have\n\nbeen few clinical studies to suggest decrease in platelet count in\n\nindividuals under aspirin medication [30–32]. Although aspirin\n\nhas long been considered to be an effective and safe therapeutic\n\nregime against cardiovascular disorders, consequences of its pro-\n\napoptotic attributes on platelets, the key players in thrombogen-\n\nesis, demand serous investigation.\n\nProteasome, the protein degradation machinery of the cell,\n\ncleaves intracellular proteins in order to regulate essential cellular\n\nprocesses like antigen processing, cell cycle, transcription and\n\nsignal transduction [33–36]. We have recently demonstrated a\n\ncentral role of proteasome in determination of platelet life span\n\n[37] and the factors regulating its enzymatic activity in human\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://dbtindia.nic.in/index.asp\nhttp://www.dst.gov.in\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0105049&domain=pdf\nhttp://www.icmr.nic.in/\nhttp://www.csir.res.in/\nhttp://www.csir.res.in/\n\n\nplatelets [38]. In the present study, we have evaluated effect of\n\naspirin on platelet survival in murine as well as human models.\n\nAspirin induced apoptosis in human platelets in a dose-dependent\n\nmanner, which was associated with concomitant inhibition of\n\nplatelet proteasomal activity in presence of the drug. Platelet half\n\nlife was found to be significantly lowered in aspirin-treated mice as\n\ncompared to control animals. Thus, above observations provide\n\ncautionary framework to critically re-evaluate prophylactic and\n\ntherapeutic dosage regime of aspirin in clinical practice. Despite\n\nwidespread use of aspirin against cardiovascular ailments, its\n\npreventive administration in susceptible individuals on routine\n\nbasis is not recommended [39–41]. Aspirin has been reported to\n\nbe safe for primary prevention at coronary event risk .1.5%/year\n\nthough it is not recommended due to associated side effects at\n\ncoronary event risk 0.5%/year [42]. In standard doses (325 mg)\n\naspirin poses less threat of gastrointestinal bleeding; however, the\n\nbleeding risk is still twice as high as without aspirin [43].\n\nEthics Statement\nThe animal study was approved by the Central Animal Ethical\n\nCommittee of Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu\n\nUniversity, Varanasi. Swiss Albino mice weighing between 18 and\n\n20 gm (20 control and 40 aspirin-treated) were used in the entire\n\nstudy. All efforts were made to minimize the number of animals\n\nused and their suffering.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nABT-737 was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. Anti-CD61-\n\nPE and annexin V-PE were from BD Pharmingen. Proteasome\n\ninhibitor PSI [Z-Ile-Glu(OtBu)-Ala-Leu-CHO] procured from\n\nCalbiochem. N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (NHS-biotin), PE-stre-\n\npatvidin, 5,59-6,69-tetrachloro-1,19,3,39 tetraethylbenzimidazolyl-\n\ncarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), thiazole orange, carbonyl cyanide 3-\n\nchlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 6-carboxy-29,79- dichlorodihy-\n\ndrofluorescein (H2DCFDA), acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amido-4-\n\nmethylcoumarin (AC-DEVD-AMC), apyrase, ethylene glycol tetra\n\nacetic acid (EGTA), ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA),\n\nsodium orthovanadate, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), bovine serum\n\nalbumin (fraction V), Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, mouse\n\nmonoclonal anti-Bax (6A7) were purchased from Sigma. RPMI\n\n1640 was purchased from HiMedia. Reagents for electrophoresis\n\nwere products of Merck. PVDF membranes were from Millipore.\n\nSuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate was from\n\nPierce. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled secondary antibod-\n\nies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories and Banga-\n\nlore Genei, respectively. All other reagents were of analytical\n\ngrade. Type 1 deionized water (18.2 MV.cm, Millipore) was used\nfor preparation of solutions.\n\nPlatelet preparation\nPlatelets were isolated from fresh human blood by differential\n\ncentrifugation, as already described [44]. Briefly, blood was\n\ncollected from healthy volunteers (majority male) under informed\n\nconsent and centrifuged at 1806g for 10 min. PRP (platelet-rich\nplasma) thus obtained was incubated with 1 mM acetylsalicylic\n\nacid for 15 min at 37uC. After addition of EDTA (ethylenedi-\naminetetraacetic acid) (5 mM), platelets were sedimented by\n\ncentrifugation at 8006g for 15 min. Cells were washed in buffer\nA (20 mM HEPES, 138 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2,\n\n0.36 mM NaH2PO4, 1 mM EGTA (ethylene glycol tetraacetic\n\nacid), supplemented with 5 mM glucose and 0.6 ADPase units of\n\napyrase/ml, pH 6.2) and were finally resuspended in buffer B\n\n(20 mM HEPES, 138 mM NaCl, 2.9 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2,\n\n0.36 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4). The final cell count was adjusted to\n\n0.52.86109/ml. All steps were carried out under sterile conditions\nand precautions were taken to maintain the cells in resting\n\ncondition.\n\nProteasome activity assay\nPlatelets were incubated at 37uC for 30 min with aspirin (2, 5\n\nand 10 mM) or vehicle (ethanol) and washed twice in buffer A (see\n\nabove). Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 125 ml of 26\npermeabilization buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.2% Triton X-100,\n\n300 mM NaCl and 2 mM EGTA, pH 7.7) followed by addition of\n\n125 ml of 26 proteasome assay buffer (40 mM HEPES, 1 mM\nEDTA and 0.07% SDS, pH 7.8). Permeabilized cells were added\n\nto the wells of microplates in a fluorescence microplate reader\n\n(BioTek model FLx800) at 37uC. Reaction was started by the\naddition of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC (25 mM) in DMSO and\nwas monitored for 10 min (excitation, 360 nm; emission, 460 nm)\n\n[37]. Proteasome peptidase activities were determined from Suc-\n\nLLVY-AMC-hydrolyzing activity (chymotrypsin-like activity).\n\nCytofluorimetric analysis of mitochondrial\ntransmembrane potential\n\nMitochondrial transmembrane potential (Dy) was measured\nusing the potential-sensitive fluorochrome JC-1, which selectively\n\nmoves across polarized mitochondrial membrane and forms\n\naggregates (red). As membrane potential collapses, color changes\n\nfrom red to green due to release of monomeric dye [37]. In order\n\nto study Dy, platelets were pre-treated with aspirin (2, 5 and\n10 mM) or ethanol (vehicle) for 30 min, followed by incubation\n\nwith 2 mM JC-1 for 15 min at 37u C in dark. Cells were washed in\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and JC-1 fluorescence was\n\nanalyzed in FL1 and FL2 channels of flow cytometer (FACSCa-\n\nlibur, Becton Dickinson) for detection of dye monomer and\n\naggregates, respectively. The ratio of red to green (FL2/FL1)\n\nfluorescence reflected mitochondrial transmembrane potential.\n\nFlow cytometric measurement of reactive oxygen species\n(ROS)\n\nPlatelets were treated with aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM) or ethanol\n\n(vehicle) as above, washed with PBS and incubated with\n\nH2DCFDA (1 mM) for 30 min at 37uC in dark. Cells were next\nwashed twice with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry as\n\ndescribed previously [45].\n\nMeasurement of annexin v and P-selectin binding by\nflow cytometry\n\nPlatelets (16108 cells in 100 ml) were incubated at 37uC for\n30 min in the presence aspirin or vehicle as stated above. For\n\npositive control the washed platelets were treated with thrombin (1\n\nU/ml) for 10 min without stirring. Then equal amount of 4%\n\nparaformaldehyde was added to the cells and incubated for\n\n30 min, which was followed by washing. Post-fixed resuspended\n\nplatelets were labeled with 5 ml FITC-labeled P-selectin antibody,\n5 ml PE-labeled anti-CD61 antibody and 10 ml FITC-labeled\nannexin V (in preseance of 5 mM CaCl2 to promote binding).\n\nSamples were incubated for 30 min at RT in dark and analyzed\n\non the flow cytometer [45]. After compensation between FITC\n\nand PE, all fluorescence data were collected using four-quadrant\n\nlogarithmic amplification. Data from CD61-positive 10,000 events\n\nwere collected for each sample.\n\nCaspase-3 activity assay\nTo determine cytosolic caspase-3 activity, samples were pre-\n\ntreated with 2, 5 and 10 mM of aspirin or vehicle (ethanol) and\n\nAspirin Delimits Platelet Life Span\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049\n\n\n\nlysed with equal amount of 26 RIPA buffer. After 10 min\nincubation in ice, equal volume of 26 substrate buffer (20 mM\nHEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mM EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mM DTT and\n\n10 mM caspase substrate AC-DEVD-AMC) was added to each\nlysate and further incubated for 30 min at 37uC [45]. Caspase-3\nactivity was determined from the extent of cleavage of fluorogenic\n\nsubstrate measured at 460 nm emission (excitation, 360 nm).\n\nWestern blotting\nProteins were separated by 13% SDS-PAGE and electropho-\n\nretically transferred onto PVDF membrane (0.8 mA/cm\n2\n, 2 h) in\n\na semi-dry blotter (TE 77 PWR, GE Healthcare) for subsequent\n\nprobing as described previously [37]. Blots were incubated for 1 hr\n\nwith 5% (w/v) BSA in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05%\n\nTween 20 (TBST) to block residual protein binding sites.\n\nMembranes were incubated overnight at 4uC with the primary\nantibody (anti-Bax, 1:500). Blots were incubated with the\n\nappropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted\n\n1:10,000) and exposed to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents\n\nfor 5 min. Blots were exposed to photographic films and\n\ndensitometrically scanned. For protein loading control, mem-\n\nbranes containing whole cell lysates were reprobed with the anti-\n\nactin antibody (1:1000).\n\nPlatelet clearance analysis\nMice were orally administered with aspirin (10 and 15 mg/kg/\n\nday, respectively, in two groups) for 4 days. The control animals\n\nwere administered with vehicle. In different experiments mice\n\nwere intravenously injected with 50 and 75 mg/kg of aspirin.\n\nNHS-biotin (600 mg) was injected in tail vein of either ethanol\n\n(control) or aspirin administered mice [46]. At various time points\n\n50 ml retro-orbital blood was drawn from both control as well as\ntreated mice, mixed with 200 ml buffered saline-glucose-citrate\nbuffer (116 mM NaCl, 13.6 mM trisodium citrate, 8.6 mM\n\nNa2HPO4, 1.6 mM KH2PO4, 0.9 mM EDTA, 11.1 mM glucose)\n\nand followed by 1 ml balanced salt solution (149 mM NaCl,\n\n3.7 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 7.4 mM HEPES,\n\n1.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.8 mM K2HPO4, 3% bovine calf serum).\n\nCells were pelleted at 14006g for 10 min, and resuspended in\n300 ml sheath fluid. They were stained with FITC-conjugated rat\nanti-CD41, which label only platelets, followed by PE-streptavidin\n\nfor 1 h on ice, washed in balanced salt solution and analyzed by\n\nflow cytometry to determine the fraction of platelet population\n\nlabeled with PE.\n\nMonocyte isolation, culture and phagocytic recognition\nof platelets\n\nHuman monocytes were isolated and cultured as described\n\n[47,48]. Briefly, blood from healthy donors was collected in citrate\n\nand peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated\n\nusing Hysep, according to manufacturer’s instructions. Monocytes\n\nwere further isolated by plating the PBMCs on polystyrene-coated\n\ntissue culture flasks for 4 h at 37uC, followed by 3 washes with PBS\nto remove non-adherent lymphocytes. Monocytes (250,000 in\n\n500 ml volume) were then plated on 6-well plates in RPMI 1640\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured for 7\n\ndays to obtain the monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs).\n\nPlatelets labeled with calcein-AM were incubated with a mono-\n\nlayer of autologous monocyte-derived adherent human macro-\n\nphages for 45 min. Following incubation period, the phagocyte\n\nmonolayer was washed free of non-interacting platelets, and any\n\nadherent platelets were removed by treatment with trypsin at 37uC\nfor 5 min followed by 5 mM EDTA at 4uC. MDMs were\n\nrecovered by trypsin/EDTA treatment for 15 min at 37uC and\nsubjected to flow cytometric and epifluorescent microscopic\n\nanalysis.\n\nIn different experiments, aspirin (10 mg/kg/day) was adminis-\n\ntered orally to mice for 7 days, following which macrophages were\n\nisolated from the peritoneal cavity of animals. Platelets were\n\nisolated from control as well as aspirin-administered mice and\n\nstained with calcein-AM. Equal number of platelets from either\n\ngroup was co-incubated ex vivo with respective pre-isolated\nmacrophages for 45 min in CO2 incubator. Macrophages were\n\ngated and analyzed by flow cytometry for fluorescence signal\n\n(FL1).\n\nStatistical methods\nStandard statistical methods were used. Parametric methods (t\n\ntest) were used for evaluation and tests were considered significant\n\nat P,0.05 (2-tailed tests). Data are presented as means 6 SD of at\nleast five individual experiments from different blood donors.\n\nResults\n\nAspirin induces apoptosis-like phenotype in human\nplatelets associated with upregulation of Bax and\nproteasomal inhibition\n\nNSAIDs have been reported to induce apoptosis presumably\n\nindependent of their ability to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity [5–\n\n8]. In order to evaluate aspirin action on platelets, we investigated\n\nmitochondrial transmembrane potential (Dym) and surface expo-\nsure of phosphatidylserine (PS) in aspirin-treated human platelets.\n\nJC-1, a lipophilic cation, was employed to determine alterations in\n\nDym. As expected, high aggregate to monomer fluorescence ratio\n(FL2/FL1) of the fluor was observed in untreated (control) cells\n\nindicative of stabilized Dym, which dropped drastically in carbonyl\ncyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (protonophore)\n\n(30 mM)-treated platelets (Fig. 1A). Incubation of platelets with\ndifferent concentrations of aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM) was\n\nassociated with significant decrements in Dym (by 25%, 61%\nand 93%, respectively) as compared to control (Fig. 1A).\n\nExternalization of PS, an anionic phospholipid, from the inner\n\nleaflet to outer layer of cell membrane is an invariable feature in\n\nthe apoptotic process [37,49]. PE-annexin V binding to cell\n\nsurface was studied as a measure of cells undergoing apoptosis. As\n\nexpected, surface membrane was found to be significantly\n\nenriched with PS in thrombin-stimulated platelets as compared\n\nto the resting cells. Remarkably, pretreatment of platelets with\n\nincreasing concentrations of aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM) resulted in\n\ndramatic increase (by 1.69-, 7- and 11-folds, respectively) in\n\nannexin V binding as compared to the untreated (control) cells,\n\nindicative of induction of apoptosis-like changes upon aspirin\n\ntreatment (Fig. 1B). Salicylic acid (10 mM) did not elicit increment\n\nin annexin V binding, which indicated that aspirin caused PS\n\nexposure by acetylation-dependent mechanism. To rule out the\n\npossibility of platelet activation in response to different dosages of\n\naspirin, we examined surface expression of P-selectin, a marker for\n\nplatelet activation, in aspirin-treated platelets. Aspirin had no\n\neffect on surface level of P-selectin, which was found to be\n\nsignificantly elevated on surface membrane in thrombin-stimulat-\n\ned platelets (Figure S1).\n\nAs apoptosis is known to be associated with cellular reactive\n\noxygen species (ROS) generation [50], we sought to determine\n\nwhether aspirin induced ROS production in platelets. Using the\n\ncell-permeable dye 29,79-dichlorofluorescein diacetate\n\n(H2DCFDA), intracellular ROS was found to be significantly\n\nAspirin Delimits Platelet Life Span\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

BH3-mimetic ABT737 and specific proteasome\n\ninhibitors like epoxomicin (1 mM), PSI (20 mM) and bortezomib\n(25 mM) were used as a positive control, which induced significant\nBax activation in platelets (Fig. 2A & B).\n\nThe pro-apoptotic members of Bcl-2 family induce release of\n\nmitochondrial cytochrome c into cytosol, which eventually leads to\n\ncaspase-3 activation through constitution of apoptosome complex\n\nwith Apaf-1 and caspase-9 [48]. As reported earlier [46], ABT737\n\ninduced significant activation of caspase-3 in platelets (Fig. 2C). A\n\nconcentration-dependent upregulation in caspase-3 activity (by 2-,\n\n2.8- and 3- folds) (Fig. 2C) was observed in platelets exposed to\n\nincreasing doses of aspirin (2, 5 and 10 mM, respectively).\n\nProteasome is involved in the degradation of many short-lived\n\nproteins that are required for cell survival. We have recently\n\ndemonstrated a central role of proteasome in delimiting platelet\n\nlife span through constitutive elimination of the conformationally\n\nactive Bax and inducing apoptosis-like changes in platelets [37]. In\n\norder to explore the effect of aspirin on proteasome in human\n\nplatelets, we analyzed proteasomal peptidase activity in presence\n\nof different concentrations of aspirin. We found a concentration-\n\ndependent attenuation (by 15%, 44% and 61%) in proteasome\n\nfunction in human platelets pre-treated with aspirin (2, 5 and\n\n10 mM, respectively) (Fig. 2D). Aspirin treatment did not induce\n\nany change in the total protein content in platelets.\n\nAspirin leads to decreased platelet life span\nPlatelet life span is determined by opposing activities of anti-\n\nand pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins [46]. As proteasomal\n\nactivity in tumor cells influences cellular level of these proteins and\n\naspirin attenuated proteasome function in platelets (our earlier\n\nfigure), we investigated if aspirin can regulate platelet lifespan in\nvivo in a rodent model. Consistent with earlier findings [30,31]\noral administration of aspirin to mice led to significant lowering in\n\nplatelet count by 18% and 32% (on 7\nth\n\nand 15\nth\n\nday, respectively,\n\nat 10 mg/kg/day) and 28% and 48% (on 7\nth\n\nand 15\nth\n\nday,\n\nrespectively, at 15 mg/kg/day) (n = 5) (Fig. 3A). When adminis-\n\ntered intravenously in tail vein in mice, 50 and 75 mg/kg of\n\naspirin decreased platelet count by 50% and 72%, respectively,\n\nreflective of aspirin-induced decrease in platelet count (data not\n\nshown).\n\nReduction in platelet count could either be due to increase in\n\nplatelet clearance or decreased platelet production. In order to\n\nstudy former possibility we conjugated mice platelets with biotin\n\nby intravenous administration of NHS-biotin and tracked the\n\nlabeled platelets ex vivo by incubating cells with PE-streptavidin\n[44]. Consistent with earlier observation by Berger et al. (1998),\nplatelet half-life (t1/2 = clearance of 50% biotin-conjugated plate-\n\nlets) was found to be 80 h in control mice, which dropped\n\nsignificantly to 65 h and 54 h, respectively, in mice administered\n\norally with aspirin at 10 and 15 mg/kg/day for 4 days (Fig. 3B).\n\nIntravenous administration of 50 and 75 mg/kg of aspirin to the\n\ntail vein of mice decreased half life of platelets by 21 and 37 h,\n\nrespectively (data not shown). Salicylic acid (75 mg/kg) did not\n\naffect the platelet life span, suggesting that aspirin lowered platelet\n\nlife span via acetylation-dependent mechanism.\n\nAspirin enhances uptake of platelets by macrophages\nPlatelets undergoing apoptosis-like changes are known to be\n\nremoved by phagocytes in the reticulo-endothelial system [52].\n\nHence, we evaluated macrophage-assisted clearance of platelets\n\nfollowing aspirin treatment. Calcein-stained platelets, either\n\npretreated with aspirin (5 mM) or ethanol (vehicle), were\n\nincubated with a monolayer of autologous monocyte-derived\n\nadherent human macrophages for 45 min. The phagocyte\n\nmonolayer was next washed free of non-interacting platelets, and\n\nsubjected to flow cytometry as well as epifluorescence microscopy\n\nto examine phagocytic uptake of platelets by macrophages.\n\nMacrophages were gated and analyzed by flow cytometry for\n\nfluorescence signal (FL1). The cells exhibited significantly higher\n\ncalcein fluorescence following incubation with aspirin-treated\n\nfluorescently labeled platelets, which was reflective of enhanced\n\nphagocytic uptake of these platelets (Fig. 3C). This finding was\n\nfurther corroborated from epifluorescence microscopy of macro-\n\nphages. Significantly higher mean fluorescence intensity (per high\n\npower field) was found to be associated with macrophages co-\n\nincubated with aspirin-treated platelets than the control cells,\n\nwhich reflected facilitated phagocytic uptake of platelets upon\n\nexposure to aspirin (Fig. 3D). In different experiment, platelets\n\nfrom mice administered orally with aspirin (10 mg/kg/day for 7\n\ndays) were incubated with macrophages obtained from the same\n\nanimals. Cells from experimental mice exhibited significantly\n\nhigher calcein fluorescence than the control counterparts (data not\n\nshown), which was reflective of enhanced phagocytic uptake of\n\nthese cells.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAspirin is one of the most widely used medications worldwide,\n\nwith more than 100 billion tablets consumed each year [53].\n\nAspirin is extensively used under clinical settings as an anti-\n\ninflammatory drug and for prevention of thrombus formation/\n\npropagation in myocardial infarction as well as stroke by inhibition\n\nof platelet COX-1 activity. Apart from above functions, aspirin\n\nand other NSAIDs also reportedly exhibit antiproliferative effect.\n\nIn this study we have investigated apoptosis-like changes in human\n\nplatelets elicited by aspirin and explored its effect on murine\n\nplatelet lifespan in vivo.\nHere we found that, platelets exhibited features of apoptosis\n\nfollowing aspirin treatment, which included drop in mitochondrial\n\ntransmembrane potential, enhanced surface exposure of PS, rise in\n\ncytosolic ROS and activation of caspase-3. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-\n\n2 family protein Bax and Bax-specific mRNA are known to be\n\nabundantly expressed in platelets [54,55]. Aspirin treatment\n\nprovoked significantly higher expression of conformationally active\n\nBax in platelets compared to their control (untreated) counter-\n\nparts. Bax being a known substrate of proteasome [56,57] we next\n\nexamined effect of aspirin on proteasomal peptidase activity in\n\norder to understand mechanistic underpinning of aspirin effects on\n\nplatelets. The drug was found to elicit concentration-dependent\n\nattenuation in proteasomal function in human platelets (Fig. 2D),\n\nwhich was in line with an earlier study on murine Neuro 2a cells\n\n[29]. However, above observations did not formally establish a link\n\nbetween proteasome inhibition and Bax activity. A limitation of\n\nthis study is high dose of aspirin administered in mice. Although\n\neffective therapeutic dosage of aspirin against coronary artery\n\ndisorders is lower than that employed in this study, drug regime\n\nagainst rheumatoid arthritis [9] and other systemic inflammatory\n\nAspirin Delimits Platelet Life Span\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e105049\n\n\n\ndiseases is higher by 5–10 fold, which is fairly comparable with\n\naspirin orally administered in mice in our study. Salicylic acid\n\n(10 mM) did not evoke any apoptotic response, which indicated\n\nthat effect of aspirin could be due to acetylation-dependent\n\nprocess.\n\nWe have recently shown that, proteasome plays critical role in\n\nplatelet survival through constitutive elimination of the conforma-\n\ntionally active Bax [37]. As aspirin inhibited proteasome activity in\n\nhuman platelets, we next asked whether the drug would adversely\n\naffect platelet life span in an in vivo rodent model. Administration\nof mice with aspirin led to thrombocytopenia. This was associated\n\nwith significant reduction in half-life of circulating platelets,\n\nindicative of enhanced rate of platelet clearance in aspirin-\n\nadministered mice. Consistent with this, aspirin-treated human\n\nplatelets were found to be phagocytosed more efficiently by\n\nmacrophages, as demonstrated in vitro by flow cytometry as well\nas epifluorescence microscopy\n\nFigure 2.

Our observations support the contention that, platelets\n\nshould not be collected from donors under NSAID cover for\n\npurpose of transfusion. A recent report has implicated platelets\n\nwith cancer cell proliferation [58] and aspirin has been directly\n\nlinked to prevention of cancer [59]. Thus, the observed drop in\n\nlongevity of aspirinized platelets suggests a novel mechanistic\n\ninsight of therapeutic benefit of this drug in cancer management.\n\nAspirin is widely used as an anti-inflammatory drug against\n\nrheumatoid arthritis and towards prevention of occlusive platelet\n\nthrombi in coronary as well as cerebral thrombotic events\n\nincluding myocardial infarction. Therefore, observations from this\n\nstudy provide cautionary framework to critically re-evaluate\n\ntherapeutic dosage regime of aspirin especially against systemic\n\ninflammatory ailments though it is a relatively safe drug in general\n\nclinical practice.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Study of P-selectin exposure in aspirin\ntreated platelets and thrombin (1 U/ml) was used as\npositive control.\n\n(DOCX)\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: DD.
