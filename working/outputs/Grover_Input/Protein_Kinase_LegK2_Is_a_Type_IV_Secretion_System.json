Crucial to the pathogenesis of this\nintracellular pathogen is its ability to subvert host cell defenses, permitting intracellular replication in\nspecialized vacuoles within host cells. The Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocates a large\nnumber of bacterial effectors into host cell, is absolutely required for rerouting the Legionella phagosome. Many\nLegionella effectors display distinctive eukaryotic domains, among which are protein kinase domains. In silico\nanalysis and in vitro phosphorylation assays identified five functional protein kinases, LegK1 to LegK5,\nencoded by the epidemic L. pneumophila Lens strain. Except for LegK5, the Legionella protein kinases are all\nT4SS effectors. LegK2 plays a key role in bacterial virulence, as demonstrated by gene inactivation. The legK2\nmutant containing vacuoles displays less-efficient recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum markers, which\nresults in delayed intracellular replication. Considering that a kinase-dead substitution mutant of legK2\nexhibits the same virulence defects, we highlight here a new molecular mechanism, namely, protein phosphor-\nylation, developed by L. pneumophila to establish a replicative niche and evade host cell defenses.\n\nLegionella pneumophila is the most common causative agent\nof the atypical and severe pneumonia legionellosis. Pathogenic\nLegionella strains emerge from the environment after intracel-\nlular multiplication in phagocytic protozoans. It has been pro-\nposed that its ability to exploit the basic cellular mechanisms of\nnumerous protozoal hosts also enables Legionella to infect\nhuman macrophages of alveolar lungs and consequently to\ncause disease (29, 63).\n\nMechanisms of infection of protozoans and macrophages by\nL. pneumophila are quite similar (24). Upon internalization of\nL. pneumophila, the bacteria containing phagosome avoids fu-\nsion with lysosomes and recruits mitochondria and endoplas-\nmic reticulum (ER) to establish a replication niche. The Dot/\nIcm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which translocates\nbacterial proteins called “effectors” into host cell, is absolutely\nrequired to reprogram the endosomal-lysosomal degradation\npathway of the phagocytic cell and to lead to bacterial intra-\ncellular survival and successful replication (3, 5, 64, 67). Mul-\ntiple approaches have successfully identified more than 100\neffector proteins (reviewed by reference 22). Many Legionella\neffectors display distinctive eukaryotic domains, such as those\ninvolved in protein-protein interactions (e.g., ankyrin repeats,\nleucine-rich repeats, and coiled coils), and domains with more\ndefined activities (protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases, sphin-\n\ngosine-1-phosphate lyases, phospholipases, and guanine nucle-\notide exchange factors). In spite of the fact that L. pneumo-\nphila seems well equipped with proteins adapted to interfere\nwith a wide variety of host cell processes, only a minority of\nthese effectors have been functionally characterized (7, 18, 21,\n30, 40, 44, 48, 49, 54, 56, 61, 72, 73).\n\nThe genomes of the five sequenced L. pneumophila strains—\nPhiladelphia, Lens, Paris, Corby, and Alcoy—have been re-\nported to encode four eukaryote-like serine/threonine kinases\n(8, 15, 16, 26). Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of proteins\nat serine/threonine/tyrosine residues represents a powerful\nregulatory mechanism of cellular activity. Indeed, intensive\nresearch has revealed that eukaryotes contain numerous inter-\nconnected signal transduction networks in which protein phos-\nphorylation plays a dominant role. For many years, however,\nphosphorylation at serine/threonine/tyrosine has been consid-\nered a new addition to the cell’s regulatory arsenal and be-\nlieved to be exclusive to eukaryotes. Due in large part to\ngenomic sequencing programs, some “classical” serine/threo-\nnine/tyrosine protein kinases have been identified in several\nbacterial genomes, but the function of most of them remains\nunknown (13, 19). Interestingly, some of these enzymes have\nbeen recently described to play a critical role in virulence of\nseveral pathogenic bacteria: PknG of Mycobacterium tubercu-\nlosis (71), YpkA of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (4), and SteC of\nSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (59) are translocated\ninto the host cell cytoplasm to modulate eukaryotic signal\ntransduction to the bacteria advantage and thus contribute to\nvirulence. Moreover, StkP of Streptococcus pneumoniae is a\nglobal regulator of gene expression that positively controls\nvirulence for lung infection and bloodstream invasion (20, 66),\nSP-STK of Streptococcus pyogenes has been reported to have\n\n* Corresponding author.

We report that the five putative\nprotein kinases identified by in silico analysis of the L. pneu-\nmophila genomes are functional in terms of phosphorylation;\nactually, they can autophosphorylate and undergo in vitro\nphosphorylation of classical eukaryotic protein kinase sub-\nstrates. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the protein kinase\nLegK2 plays a key role in the virulence of Legionella toward\namoebae. More precisely, we observed that the legK2 mutant is\nimpaired in ER recruitment and intracellular replication. Since\nLegK2 is translocated into the host cell cytoplasm during in-\nfection, we assume that this protein kinase would interfere with\nhost cell signal transduction pathways to subvert host cell de-\nfenses to the bacteria benefit, thus resulting in an effective\ninfectious cycle and virulence.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nGrowth of bacteria and phagocytes. The bacterial strains and plasmids used in\nthe present study are summarized in Table 1.\n\nL. pneumophila strains were grown at 30°C either on buffered charcoal yeast\nextract (BCYE) agar or in BYE liquid medium; each medium was supplemented\nwith kanamycin at 10 �g ml�1 or chloramphenicol at 5 �g ml�1 when appropri-\nate. Escherichia coli strains were grown at 37°C in LB medium supplemented\nwith ampicillin at 100 �g ml�1, kanamycin at 20 �g ml�1, or chloramphenicol at\n5 �g ml�1. E. coli XL1-Blue was used to maintain plasmids and strain E. coli\nBL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL) was used for recombinant protein overproduction.\n\nAxenic Acanthamoeba castellanii cells were grown on PYG medium (proteose-\nyeast extract-glucose medium) at 30°C and split once a week. Dictyostelium\ndiscoideum expressing calnexin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (DBS0236184)\nwas obtained from the Dicty Stock Center (depositor A. Müller-Taubenberger\n[55]). D. discoideum cells were axenically grown in HL5 medium at 22°C, sup-\nplemented with G418 at 20 �g ml�1 when necessary.\n\nJ774A.1 macrophages were maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640\nmedium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum.\n\nGeneral DNA techniques. The oligonucleotides used in the present study are\nshown in Table 2.\n\nStandard techniques were used for nucleic acid cloning and restriction analy-\nsis. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Fermentas\n(Saint Rémy-les-Chevreuses, France). Plasmid DNA from E. coli was prepared\nby rapid alkaline lysis (31). PCR amplifications were carried out with Phusion\npolymerase as recommended by the manufacturer (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland).\nPurification of DNA fragments from agarose gels for subcloning was carried out\nwith a QIAquick gel purification kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France).\n\nExpression and purification of recombinant proteins. DNA fragments corre-\nsponding to the coding sequences of legK1 (lpl1545), legK2 (lpl2066), legK3\n(lpl2481), legK4 (lpl0262), and legK5 (lpl2476) were PCR amplified using genomic\nDNA of L. pneumophila Lens as the template and the following oligonucleotide\npairs: for legK1, 1/2; for legK2, 3/4; for legK3, 5/6; for legK4, 7/8; and for legK5,\n9/10. The amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and SalI or with\nSacI and PstI for legK5 and then inserted into PGEX-6P-3 for legK1, legK2, and\nlegK3 or pQE30 for legK4 and legK5. The resulting plasmids—pGEX-legK1,\npGEX-legK2, pGEX-legK3, pQE30-legK4, and pQE30-legK5—were introduced\ninto E. coli strain BL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL). Transformants were grown at\n37°C until cultures reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.7. Gene\nexpressions were induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl-�-D-thiogalactopyrano-\nside) for 4 h at 20°C, and cell lysates were prepared by using a French pressure\ncell (SLM, Urbana, IL). GST and 6His recombinant proteins were purified under\nnative conditions by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose beads\n(GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) and a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen), respectively,\naccording to the manufacturers’ recommendations. The purity of the eluted\nprotein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and protein concentrations were deter-\nmined by using a protein assay dye reagent concentrate (Bio-Rad, Marnes-la-\nCoquette, France).\n\nIn vitro phosphorylation assay. In vitro phosphorylation of about 2 �g of\npurified recombinant protein was performed for 30 min at 37°C in 20 �l of a\n\nbuffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol,\n10 �M ATP, and 5 �Ci of [�-32P]ATP (Perkin-Elmer, Courtaboeuf, France). In\nsome assays, MgCl2 was replaced with MnCl2. In eukaryotic substrate phosphor-\nylation assays, 1 �g of myelin basic protein (MBP) was added. In each case, the\nreaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 2� Laemmli loading\nbuffer (41).\n\nTEM translocation assays. J774A.1 cells grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10%\nfetal calf serum were seeded in a black, clear-bottom 96-well plate at 105 cells per\nwell 24 h prior to infection. L. pneumophila strains carrying the various TEM\n�-lactamase fusions were grown on BCYE plates containing chloramphenicol.\nSingle colonies were then streaked onto BCYE plates containing chloramphen-\nicol and 0.5 mM IPTG and grown for 24 h to induce production of the hybrid\nproteins. Then, 10 �l of bacteria resuspended in RPMI at 5 � 108 cells ml�1 was\nused to infect J774A.1 cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] � 50). After cen-\ntrifugation (600 � g, 10 min) to initiate bacterium-cell contact, the plate was\nshifted to 37°C, followed by incubation for 1 h with CO2 exchange. Cell mono-\nlayers were loaded with the fluorescent substrate by adding 20 �l of 6�\nCCF4/AM solution (LiveBLAzer-FRET B/G loading kit; Invitrogen, Cergy Pon-\ntoise, France) containing 15 mM Probenecid (Sigma, St. Quentin Fallavier,\nFrance). The cells were incubated for an additional 2 h at room temperature.\nFluorescence was quantified on a Victor microplate reader (Perkin-Elmer) with\nexcitation at 405 nm (10-nm band-pass), and emission was detected via 460 nm\n(40-nm band-pass, blue fluorescence) and 530 nm (30-nm band-pass, green\nfluorescence) filters. The cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using\nan inverted microscope equipped with the �-lactamase ratiometric filter set\n(Chroma, Bellows Falls, VT) (17).\n\nGene inactivation in L. pneumophila. To obtain L. pneumophila Lens mutants\ndefective for legK genes, a homologous recombination strategy was chosen as\npreviously described (23). The 400-bp upstream and downstream regions of the\ngene of interest were amplified by PCR, digested by NotI and SalI, and then\ncloned into pAV695. A kanamycin resistance cassette was amplified from pKD13\n(with the primers 11 and 12), digested by SalI, and cloned inside the encoding\nsequence of each legK gene in pAV695. The resulting construct was introduced\ninto L. pneumophila for chromosomal recombination.\n\nConstruction of a kinase-dead LegK2-producing strain. In order to obtain the\ncatalytic mutant of LegK2, namely, LegK2(K112M) defective in phosphate do-\nnor ATP binding, substitution in the legK2 gene was performed with a\nQuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using primers 40 and\n41 listed in Table 2, and the pXDC50 derivative vector in which legK2 is cloned\nunder its own promoter, namely, plegK2 plasmid, as a template (Table 1). The\nfinal construct was used to transform the L. pneumophila �legK2 mutant strain.\n\nPigment production. For quantifying pigment accumulation, 1-ml portions of the\nsamples, obtained from 5-day-old BYE cultures grown at 30°C, were centrifuged at\n16,000 � g for 10 min, and the OD550 of the supernatants was measured (65).\n\nCytotoxicity to A. castellanii. For measurement of the number of viable A.\ncastellanii cells remaining after infection, the monolayers were treated with 10%\nAlamar blue (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France). At the time point indicated, the\nmonolayers were washed four times with protease-yeast extract (PY), and then 100\n�l of PY containing 10% (vol/vol) of Alamar blue was added to each well. After an\novernight incubation, the OD570 values were determined. The relative degree of amoeba\nmortality was expressed as the ratio of the OD value of infected monolayer to that of\nuninfected one, calculated as [1 � (mean ODinfected/mean ODuninfected)] � 100.\n\nMeasurement of released extracellular bacteria. L. pneumophila was grown on\nBCYE agar for 5 days at 30°C prior to infection. A. castellanii cells were seeded\nin multiwell plates to a final concentration of 5 � 105 cells ml�1. After adhesion,\nthe cells were infected at an MOI of 10 with L. pneumophila. The plates were\ncentrifuged at 880 � g for 10 min, followed by incubation for 1 h at 30°C.\nMonolayers were then washed four times with PY to remove extracellular bac-\nteria. The time at the end of the final wash was the initial time point. After 24 h,\nextracellular bacteria were numbered by plating them on BCYE.\n\nIntracellular growth in A. castellanii. Intracellular growth was monitored as\npreviously described (36). L. pneumophila cells harboring a fluorescent mCherry\nprotein-producing plasmid were grown on BCYE agar containing 0.5 mM IPTG\nand chloramphenicol for 5 days at 30°C. A. castellanii cells were grown as\nadherent cells in 96-well microplates (105 cells/well) and then infected with 106\n\nfluorescent legionellae (MOI � 10). Infection was synchronized by spinning the\nbacteria at 880 � g for 10 min. Intracellular growth was automatically monitored\nby measuring the fluorescence of mCherry at an excitation of 587 nm and an\nemission of 610 nm in a Xenius Safas plate reader every hour for 66 h (Safas,\nMonaco). Fluorescence data were subjected to background subtractions (unin-\nfected cells).\n\nBacteria uptake assay by trypan blue quenching. L. pneumophila phagocytosis\nwas measured by trypan blue quenching as previously described (10). Briefly,\n\nVOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1937\n\n\n\nbacteria from overnight cultures in BYE were labeled with 5,6-carboxyfluores-\ncein succinimidyl ester. A. castellanii cells were grown as adherent cells in 96-well\nmicroplates (5 � 105 cells/well) and then infected with 107 fluorescent legionellae\n(MOI � 20). After centrifugation (880 � g for 10 min) to initiate cell-bacterium\ncontact, the plate was incubated at 30°C for 30 min. The medium was then\nreplaced by 50 �l per well of trypan blue solution to quench the fluorescence of\n\nnoninternalized bacteria.

D. discoideum cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in\n6-well plates at 5 � 106 per well in HL5 and allowed to adhere overnight.\nMonolayers were infected at an MOI of 100 with bacteria grown for 5 days at\n30°C. The plates were spun at 880 � g for 10 min, followed by incubation at 25°C.\nThe monolayers were then washed two times with 2 ml of SorC buffer (2 mM\nNa2HPO4, 15 mM KH2PO4, 50 mM CaCl2; pH 6.0) and fixed with 3.7% para-\nformaldehyde (30 min, 4°C). Coverslips were examined with an inverted confocal\nmicroscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss, Thornwood, NJ) equipped with a �63 phase-\ncontrast objective lens (Plan Neofluar [Zeiss]; aperture, 1.4, oil).\n\nLocalization of LegK2 within the host cell. The �legK2 mutant strain was\ncotransformed with p3041 and pEP73 plasmids (Table 1), which encode mCherry\nand the GFP-LegK2 hybrid protein, respectively. The obtained strain was used to\ninfect D. discoideum DH1 at an MOI of 100 for 1 h. Fluorescent GFP-LegK2\nprotein and mCherry-labeled bacteria were observed with an inverted confocal\nmicroscope (Axiovert 200M; Zeiss) equipped with a �63 phase-contrast objec-\ntive (Plan Neofluar). Alternatively, D. discoideum DH1 harboring pEP46 vector\n(Table 1), which ectopically express legK2(K112M)-c-myc, were seeded onto\ncoverslips and infected with mCherry-labeled L. pneumophila legK2 and dotA\nmutant strains or E. coli XL1-Blue as described above. After 1 h of infection, the\ncells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked with phosphate-buffered saline\nsupplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The coverslips were then\n\nstained with \r-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (1/5,000, clone 9E10; Sigma) for 1 h\nand visualized with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular\nProbes, Eugene, OR) at a 1/300 dilution for 30 min. Microscopic observations of\nmCherry-labeled bacteria and LegK2 protein were performed with an inverted\nconfocal microscope (Axiovert 200M).\n\nStatistical analysis. The results were statistically analyzed by using a Student\nt test. The t test results obtained correspond to the comparison between legK\nmutants with the parental strain values in the same conditions.\n\nRESULTS\n\nL. pneumophila Lens genome encodes five putative protein\nkinases.

Alignment with several prokaryotic and\neukaryotic protein kinases revealed residues that are highly\nconserved in the Hanks subdomains characterizing the eu-\nkaryote-like protein kinase family (28). These include the gly-\ncine-rich loop and the invariant lysine in subdomains I and II,\nwhich are essential for binding and correct orientation of the\nphosphate donor ATP (Fig. 1A). Consensus sequences in sub-\ndomains VI, VII, and VIII, involved in phosphotransfer and\nsubstrate recognition are also conserved in LegK1, LegK3, and\n\nLegK4; LegK2 and LegK5 lack subdomain VIII (Fig. 1A).\nFurther primary sequence analysis predicted an EF-hand do-\nmain in LegK5, which is known to be involved in calcium\nbinding (53). Moreover, hydropathy profiles suggest a trans-\nmembrane helix between amino acids 478 and 498 of LegK1,\nwhich is consistent with a membrane location of LegK1,\nwhereas LegK2 to LegK5 are likely cytoplasmic (Table 3).\n\nThe protein kinases encoding genes legK1 to legK5 are dis-\ntributed in various regions of the L. pneumophila Lens chro-\n\nTABLE 3.

The GC content of each gene of the region is indicated in the upper scheme. The genes\nconserved in the five sg1 L. pneumophila strains Lens, Paris, Philadelphia, Corby, and Alcoy are represented in gray, while the genes specific to\nL. pneumophila Lens are represented in black. Encoded proteins are named below.\n\n1940 HERVET ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nmosome. Organization of the legK4 region is remarkable: legK4\nis located immediately upstream a gene (lpl0263) that encodes\na protein with a high degree of similarity (39% identity) with\nthe C-terminal domain (from amino acid 323 to amino acid\n910) of LegK4. This genetic organization is conserved in the\nfive sequenced L. pneumophila strains and suggests a partial\nduplication of legK4 homologous genes. On the other hand,\nwhereas genes legK1 to legK4 are conserved in all L. pneumo-\nphila sequenced strains, legK5 is specific of strain Lens. It is\nlocated in a chromosomal region containing four genes that\nare absent in Philadelphia, Paris, Corby, and Alcoy genomes\n(Fig. 1B). Compared to the average genomic GC content of\n38.4% for Lens strain (8), legK5 and its neighboring genes have\na significantly lower GC content of 35% (legK5), 34%\n(lpl2477), and 36% (lpl2478). Moreover, lpl2478 gene encodes\na putative transposase, and the region is flanked by two ho-\nmologous genes, namely, lpl2475 and lpl2479 (Fig. 1B). These\nobservations suggest that the legK5 chromosomal region has\nbeen acquired in Lens genome by a small insertion event as-\nsociated with horizontal transfer.\n\nLegK2 to LegK5 display autokinase and protein kinase ac-\ntivities. To determine whether LegK1 to LegK5 are functional\nprotein kinases, each protein was overproduced and purified as\na recombinant protein fused to either six-histidine or glutathi-\none S-transferase tags. The legK4 and legK5 genes were PCR\namplified using genomic DNA of L. pneumophila strain Lens\nand cloned into the expression vector pQE30 to allow the\nsynthesis of N-terminal six-histidine-tagged proteins. The re-\ncombinant proteins, with respective molecular masses of 110\nand 52 kDa, were overproduced in the E. coli strain\nBL21(DE3)(pREP4-groESL) and highly enriched by a single-\nstep chromatography on Ni-NTA matrix (Fig. 2A). The full-\nlength legK2 and legK3 genes were synthesized by PCR ampli-\nfication and cloned into pGEX-6P-3 plasmid to produce GST\nN-terminal fused proteins. The truncated legK1 gene (nucleo-\ntides 4 to 1431) lacking the DNA fragment encoding the pu-\ntative transmembrane helix was cloned into the same expres-\nsion vector. The GST-tagged recombinant LegK1 (87 kDa),\nLegK2 (88 kDa), and LegK3 (79 kDa) proteins were purified\nto partial homogeneity from the E. coli strain BL21(DE3)\n(pREP4-groESL) by using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B matrix\n(Fig. 2A).\n\nThe purified tagged LegK1-LegK5 proteins were then sep-\narately assayed for autokinase activity. Each recombinant pro-\ntein was incubated with the phosphate donor [�-32P]ATP and\nthen separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiogra-\nphy (Fig. 2B). Except for GST-LegK1, all Legionella recombi-\nnant kinases were significantly radiolabeled and thus undergo\nautophosphorylation. Their autokinase activities are differently\ndependent of magnesium or manganese ions. Although LegK4\nused these ions as cofactor with the same efficiency, LegK2 and\nLegK5 autophosphorylated more efficiently in the presence of\nmanganese; conversely, the radiolabeling of LegK3 was higher\nin the presence of magnesium (Fig. 2B).\n\nThe recombinant LegK1 to LegK5 proteins were further\ncharacterized by studying their ability to phosphorylate pro-\nteins. They were assayed for in vitro phosphorylation of the\ngeneral eukaryotic protein kinase substrate, myelin basic pro-\ntein (MBP), in the presence of [�-32P]ATP. Except for GST-\nLegK1, a radiolabeled signal corresponding to the expected\n\nFIG. 2.

Phosphopro-\nteins were visualized by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE separation.\n\nVOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1941\n\n\n\n18-kDa molecular mass of MBP was detected, thus demon-\nstrating that LegK2, LegK3, LegK4, and LegK5 are able to\nphosphorylate protein substrates such as MBP (Fig. 2C).\n\nLegK1 to LegK4 proteins are effectors of the Dot/Icm T4SS.\nMost of the eukaryote-like proteins encoded by L. pneumo-\nphila genome are translocated into the host cell cytoplasm,\nwhere they may interfere with host cell functions, thus allowing\nbacterial evasion of the endosomal pathway (17). Although\nLegK1, LegK2, and LegK3 have been recently identified as\nDot/Icm T4SS effectors (17, 25, 68), the translocation of LegK4\nand LegK5 has not been documented yet. In order to deter-\nmine whether these protein kinases are translocated during the\ninfectious cycle, the TEM-1 reporter system (�-lactamase) was\nused (17). Briefly, the TEM-1 was fused to the N-terminal of\nLegK4 and LegK5, and L. pneumophila strains efficiently ex-\npressing these fusions (Fig. 3A) were used to infect J774 mac-\nrophages. Host cells were then loaded with CCF4, which emits\ngreen fluorescence (520 nm) due to fluorescence resonance\n\nenergy transfer between the two fluorophores of this substrate\nwhen excited at 409 nm (Fig. 3B, uninfected). When the hybrid\nprotein was translocated, as expected for the fusion with the\nknown Dot/Icm effector VipA, it cleaved the �-lactam ring of\nCCF4, thus resulting in fluorescence changing from green to\nblue (447 nm), when excited at the same wavelength (Fig. 3B,\nTEM-VipA). Conversely, when TEM-1 was fused to the\nhousekeeping protein enoyl-acyl coenzyme A reductase FabI,\ncells still developed green fluorescence (Fig. 3B, TEM-FabI).\nEmission of blue fluorescence was observed when cells were\ninfected with wild-type L. pneumophila strains expressing the\nTEM-LegK4 fusion protein, while green fluorescence was still\nemitted when cells were infected with bacteria containing\nTEM-LegK5 fusion. These analyses establish that LegK4, but\nnot LegK5, is translocated into host macrophages during L.\npneumophila infection. When a dotA mutant L. pneumophila\nstrain producing TEM-LegK4 infected macrophages, no\nchange in fluorescence was observed [Fig. 3B, �dotA(TEM-\nLegK4)]. This result demonstrates that translocation of the\nLegK4 protein kinase is Dot/Icm T4SS dependent.\n\nInactivation of legK1 to legK5 genes has no effect on medium\ngrowth neither intracellular life cycle switch of Legionella. To\nidentify the physiological role of Legionella protein kinases,\neach legK gene was separately inactivated, as described in Ma-\nterials and Methods. Genes were partially deleted and re-\nplaced by a unique insertion of a kanamycin cassette\n(legK::kan), verified by PCR and Southern hybridization (data\nnot shown). The five isogenic mutants displayed similar growth\ncharacteristics in liquid medium compared to the parental\nstrain L. pneumophila Lens, and analysis of mutant cell mor-\nphologies by light microscopy did not reveal any major differ-\nences (data not shown).\n\nSuccessful infection of host cells is strictly linked to a precise\ntiming of the life cycle of Legionella, namely, to the switch from\nthe replicative to transmissive bacteria. Intracellular acquired\ntransmissive traits can be mimicked by stationary medium\ngrowth phase (52). To check whether the LegK protein kinases\nare involved in the regulatory processes that control the intra-\ncellular life cycle of Legionella, each legK mutant was assayed\nfor the characteristic trait of the postexponential growth phase,\npigment production (65). The five legK mutants accumulated\npigment during growth, as did the wild-type strain (data not\nshown).\n\nLegK2 protein kinase activity plays a key role in the viru-\nlence of Legionella toward amoeba. In order to assess the vir-\nulence of each legK mutant strain, Acanthamoeba castellanii\namoebae were infected at an MOI of 10 with the wild-type L.\npneumophila Lens or the isogenic legK::kan mutants, and the\nviability of amoeba cells present in infected monolayers at 48 h\npostinfection was quantified by using the Alamar blue dye. The\ncytotoxicity of the legK2 mutant strain toward amoeba, esti-\nmated at 30%, was significantly lower (P � 0.01) than the value\nof 90% measured for the parental strain. Conversely, legK1,\nlegK3, legK4, and legK5 mutants displayed similar cytotoxicity\ntoward amoebae compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 4A).\n\nTo further evaluate the virulence of each Legionella strain,\nextracellular released bacteria were numbered after one infec-\ntious cycle, i.e., at 24 h postinfection. Compared to the parental\nstrain, 1.5-log fewer bacteria of the mutant strain legK2 (P �\n0.04) were released from A. castellanii at 24 h postinfection. In\n\nFIG. 3. Dot/Icm-dependent translocation of LegK4 into J774 cells.\n(A) Western blot analysis of TEM fusion expression detected with an\n\r-TEM antibody. (B) J774 cells were infected with L. pneumophila\nwild-type or dotA mutant strains harboring TEM-FabI, TEM-VipA,\nTEM-LegK4, and TEM-LegK5 expression plasmids at an MOI of 50.\nInfected cells were loaded with CCF4/AM, and translocation was de-\ntermined by a comparison of cleaved to uncleaved CCF4 that gives\nblue and green fluorescence, respectively. Images were obtained by\nusing epifluorescence microscopy on individual assay wells.\n\n1942 HERVET ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nFIG. 4. Role of LegK proteins in virulence toward A. castellanii. (A) Cytotoxicity of L. pneumophila. Cells were infected at an MOI of 10. The\nviability of amoeba cells present in infected monolayers at 48 h postinfection was quantified by using the Alamar blue dye. These data are\nrepresentative of two independent experiments done in triplicate. (B) Release of bacteria from amoebae infected with L. pneumophila. After 24 h\nof infection, the number of extracellular bacteria was evaluated by the standard plate count assay. The results are expressed in CFU ml�1 and are\nrepresentative of two independent experiments performed in triplicate. Error bars represent the standard deviations. (C) Intracellular growth of\nL. pneumophila in amoebae. Amoebae were infected at an MOI of 10 by L. pneumophila cells expressing the mCherry gene on a plasmid. Bacteria\nmultiplication was automatically monitored by measuring the fluorescence of mCherry at an excitation of 587 nm and an emission of 610 nm every\n2 h for 66 h. Fluorescence data were subjected to background subtractions (uninfected cells).\n\nVOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1943\n\n\n\ncontrast, extracellular bacteria quantified for the legK1, legK3,\nlegK4, and legK5 mutants were similar to the wild-type strain\n(Fig. 4B).\n\nTo check whether the legK2 phenotype is related to a defect\nof bacteria egress or intracellular multiplication, the Lens\nstrain or its legK mutant derivatives expressing the fluorescent\nmCherry protein on a plasmid were used to infect amoebas at\nan MOI of 10. Bacterial intracellular growth was monitored by\nfluorescence measurement during a 66 h-time course (Fig. 4C).\nAs expected, wild-type L. pneumophila started efficient intra-\ncellular growth (an �40-fold increase in fluorescence) from\n15 h postinfection, whereas the T4SS dotA mutant failed to\nreplicate. The legK1, legK3, legK4, and legK5 mutants showed\nintracellular multiplication from the same time, with the same\nor lightly reduced growth rates compared to Lens strain. On\nthe contrary, legK2 mutant was delayed for intracellular mul-\ntiplication since it started replicating 48 h after infection. After\nthat, its growth rate was not significantly different (P � 0.02)\nfrom that measured for the wild-type strain.\n\nTo confirm the link between legK2 deletion and the virulence\ndefect observed, complementation experiments were carried\nout. Complementation of the legK2 mutant by introducing a\n�mobA RSF1010 derivative vector expressing the intact legK2\ngene restored the cytotoxicity and the released extracellular\nbacteria of the parental strain (Fig. 5A and B). Complemen-\ntation assays of the legK2 intracellular multiplication defect\nwere performed by introducing the same vector, producing\nboth the intact LegK2 and the fluorescent mCherry proteins.\nThe intracellular replication kinetics observed for the comple-\nmented legK2 strain was similar to that observed for the Lens\nstrain (Fig. 5C).\n\nTo determine whether the protein kinase activity of LegK2\nis critical for Legionella intracellular multiplication, a substitu-\ntion kinase-dead mutant of LegK2, namely, LegK2(K112M)\ndefective in phosphate donor ATP binding, was generated by\nsite-directed mutagenesis of the legK2 gene cloned on the\nRSF1010 derivative vector. This construct, which stably pro-\nduces the same level of kinase-dead LegK2 compared to the\nwild-type protein (as checked by Western blotting experiments\n[data not shown]), was used to complement the �legK2 mutant\ndefects in cytotoxicity (Fig. 5A), extracellular bacteria release\n(Fig. 5B), and intracellular multiplication (Fig. 5C). The sub-\nstitution legK2 mutant is not able to complement the defects of\nthe deletion legK2 mutant strain, suggesting that the protein\nkinase activity of LegK2 plays a key role in the virulence of L.\npneumophila.\n\nThus, L. pneumophila encodes five functional protein ki-\nnases that play a variable role in bacterial virulence toward\namoebae: a nondetectable role for LegK1, LegK3, LegK4, and\nLegK5, but a key role for LegK2. These results suggest that\nLegionella protein kinases are differentially expressed during\nthe Legionella infectious cycle or that they are not functionally\nequal, and they would control various host or bacterial func-\ntions. To answer this question, legK gene expression during the\nexponential and stationary bacterial growth phases, which\nmimic the replicative and transmissive bacterial forms, respec-\ntively, was established by performing real-time quantitative\nPCR experiments. All the five legK genes were expressed in\nlaboratory growth conditions, and expression patterns dis-\nplayed a similar slight downregulation of legK1, legK2, legK3,\n\nand legK4 genes when bacteria entered the postexponential\ngrowth phase (data not shown). Moreover, the legK2 virulence\ndefect was assayed for complementation by vectors expressing\nlegK1, legK3, legK4, or legK5 under the control of the endogenic\npromoter of the legK2 gene. None of these legK genes express-\ning plasmids can reverse the virulence phenotype of legK2\nmutant, as observed with the cytotoxicity of the corresponding\nstrains (Fig. 5A), the extracellular bacteria numeration (Fig.\n5B), and the intracellular replication (Fig. 5C). Surprisingly,\nexpression of these genes even led to an additional loss of\nvirulence. To check whether this observation is restricted to a\nlegK2 genetic background, the same legK genes expressing vec-\ntors were transformed into the wild-type strain Lens. Expres-\nsion of each legK gene on this plasmid resulted in a loss of\nvirulence (data not shown). Further experiments are under way\nto mechanistically examine this result, but we assume that this\neffect most likely results from nonspecific factors, such as the\nelevated expression level of legK genes, which may interfere\nwith the translocation of other T4SS substrates. Taken to-\ngether, these data demonstrate that LegK2 plays a unique role\nin the virulence of L. pneumophila and is not functionally\nredundant with the four tested Legionella protein kinases.\n\nLegK2 protein kinase activity is required for ER recruit-\nment on the LCV. To further characterize the virulence defect\nof legK2 mutant strain, the infectious cycle step altered was\ninvestigated. Intracellular survival at the onset of the A. cas-\ntellanii infection was assessed by counting the viable intracel-\nlular bacteria at 1 h 20 min, 2 h, and 4 h postinfection. The\nlevel of viable intracellular legK2 cells in amoebae corresponds\nto �10% of the parental strain (P � 0.02), as early as 1 h 20\npostinfection (Fig. 6A). This result points out the major role of\nthe protein kinase LegK2 in the early steps of the infectious\ncycle of L. pneumophila, namely, in bacterial uptake or in\nbacterial intracellular survival.\n\nBacteria uptake in amoebae was measured by trypan blue\nquenching of fluorescein-labeled L. pneumophila. Wild-type\nstrain or legK2 derivative were fluorescein-labeled and used to\ninfect A. castellanii. After contact, trypan blue was added to\nquench the fluorescence of noninternalized bacteria. Mea-\nsured fluorescence is representative of bacterial uptake, as\ndemonstrated by the effect of the actin polymerization inhibi-\ntor, cytochalasin D (Fig. 6B). The fluorescence of internalized\nlegK2 mutant was similar to that measured for the wild-type\nstrain (Fig. 6B), thus suggesting that LegK2 is not required for\nbacterial uptake but is more likely required for subsequent\ninfectious cycle steps, namely, host cell vesicular trafficking\ncontrol.\n\nThe unique intracellular fate of L. pneumophila involves ER\nrecruitment to the LCV to evade the endocytic pathway and\nreside in a specialized vacuole, allowing intracellular replica-\ntion. Recruitment of the ER by L. pneumophila was observed\nin the model amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum expressing the\nspecific marker of ER, namely, calnexin fused to the GFP.\nAmoebae were infected at an MOI of 100 with wild-type or\nlegK2 mutant strains that express the red fluorescent protein\n(mCherry), and calnexin-positive LCVs were visually scored by\nconfocal microscopy at 1 and 4 h postinfection. In D. discoi-\ndeum infected with the parental Legionella strain Lens, ca. 70%\nof the LCVs stained positive for calnexin-GFP as early as 1 h\nafter infection. On the contrary, only 12 and 13% (P � 0.01) of\n\n1944 HERVET ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nthe legK2 mutant containing vacuoles were positive for cal-\nnexin at 1 and 4 h postinfection, respectively. The legK2 ER\nrecruitment defect is partially complemented by legK2-express-\ning RSF1010 derivative vector, since 49 and 51% (P� 0.01) of\n\nthe legK2(plegK2) strain containing vacuoles were labeled by\ncalnexin at 1 and 4 h postinfection, respectively. The incom-\nplete complementation of the mutant could result from an\nelevated level of legK2 gene expression on the plasmid, which\n\nFIG. 5.

LegK2 is required for ER recruitment on LCV. (A) Uptake and survival ability of legK2 mutant strain. A. castellanii cells were infected\nat an MOI of 10 with wild-type, dotA mutant, and legK2 mutant strains. After different periods of contact with L. pneumophila, monolayers were\ntreated for 1 h with gentamicin to kill adherent bacteria and disrupted with 0.04% Triton X-100. Viable intracellular bacteria were diluted and\nplated onto BCYE agar plates for colony enumeration. The results are expressed as a relative value (%) compared to a control invasion experiment\nwith the wild-type strain. These data are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate; error bars represent the standard\ndeviations. (B) Bacterial uptake assay. A. castellanii cells were infected with fluorescein-labeled Legionella at an MOI of 20, in the presence of\ncytochalasin D when indicated (\n CytoD). After 30 min of incubation, the medium was replaced by trypan blue solution to quench the fluorescence\nof noninternalized bacteria. The fluorescence of internalized bacteria was measured using an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 530 nm.\nFluorescence data were corrected for differences in labeling efficiency between the tested strains. Labeling efficiencies between strains varied by\nca. 10%. (C) Recruitment of calnexin-GFP. Fifty Legionella containing vacuoles were scored from each sample by confocal laser scanning\nmicrographs of calnexin-GFP-labeled D. discoideum AX3 infected at an MOI of 100 with mCherry-labeled L. pneumophila. Calnexin-positive\nvacuoles were numbered for amoeba cells infected by the wild-type L. pneumophila Lens strain, its derivative dotA and legK2 mutant strains, and\nthe complemented legK2(plegK2) and legK2(plegK2K112M) mutant strains.

Together, these results indicate\nthat in the absence of LegK2, ER is recruited to LCVs less\nefficiently. To identify whether the protein kinase activity of\nLegK2 is involved in ER recruitment, complementation assays\nof the deleted legK2 mutant defect were performed with the\nsubstitution mutant legK2(K112M)-expressing vector. About\n11% of the legK2(plegK2K112M) mutant-containing vacuoles\nwere stained with the ER marker calnexin at 1 and 4 h postin-\nfection, which is very similar to that observed for the legK2\nmutant (Fig. 6C). The lack of complementation by the legK2\ncatalytic mutant points out the major role of LegK2 protein\nkinase activity in ER recruitment on the LCV.\n\nTo determine whether LegK2 anchors to the phagosomal\nmembrane to recruit ER on the LCV, cellular localization of\nLegK2 during infection was investigated. Legionella cells pro-\nducing the hybrid protein GFP-LegK2 were used to infect\namoeba cells, and cellular localization of the hybrid protein\nwas observed by confocal microscopy. Despite a good level of\ngfp-legK2 expression in bacteria, we could not detect GFP-\nLegK2 protein either in the host cell cytoplasm or on the LCV,\nprobably due to a low level of translocation into host cells (data\nnot shown). To circumvent this difficulty, a strain of the\namoeba D. discoideum that ectopically produces the C-termi-\nnal c-Myc-tagged LegK2(K112M) protein was constructed. Ec-\ntopic expression of the catalytic legK2 mutant, rather than the\nwild-type legK2 strain, was preferred to avoid possible aspecific\neffects of an active protein kinase overproduction on the\namoeba physiology and to facilitate stable binding of LegK2\nto its putative host cell interactants (35, 58), which may be\ncrucial for LegK2 localization. Immunofluorescence obser-\nvations suggested a diffused host cell cytoplasm localization\nof LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc (Fig. 6D). To determine whether\nthe localization of LegK2(K112M) could be dependent on\nother T4SS effectors, localization of LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc\nwas investigated during infection of amoebae by a �legK2\nstrain of L. pneumophila. Interestingly, infection triggered\nthe localization of LegK2(K112M)-c-Myc into the plasma\nmembrane (Fig. 6D). Surprisingly, the same observation was\nmade by incubating amoebae with Escherichia coli, suggest-\ning that localization of LegK2(K112M) to the plasma mem-\nbrane may be dependent on bacterial phagocytosis rather\nthan on T4SS effector translocation and efficient Legionella\ninfection (Fig. 6D). Thus, when LegK2 is ectopically over-\nproduced in amoebae, it is associated with the plasma mem-\nbrane but not with the phagosomal membrane.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe genomes of the five sequenced L. pneumophila strains\nare characterized by an unusual abundance of eucaryote-like\nproteins encoding genes; among them four protein kinases\nencoding genes have been identified (8). Our extensive in silico\nanalysis of the epidemic strain Lens genome identified one\nmore protein kinase encoding gene, namely, legK5 gene. It is\nnoteworthy that legK5 is specific to this strain. Interestingly, the\nLegK5 protein is homologous (50.99% identity) to a protein\n(UniprotKB entry number C6N1E1) from the strictly intracel-\nlular amoebal pathogen Legionella drancourtii (42). Moreover,\nlpl2477, located immediately downstream legK5, encodes a\n\nprotein that displays 27% identity with an uncharacterized\nprotein (UniProtKB entry number Q1RJU6) from Rickettsia\nbelii, another intracellular bacteria that infects amoebae. Fi-\nnally, the GC content of the legK5 genomic region and the\noccurrence of a transposase-encoding gene strongly suggest\nthat legK5 has been acquired by a small insertion event asso-\nciated with horizontal transfer during co-evolution with other\nbacteria in amoebae; it might represent a new instance of\ngenomic recombination in amoebae, which have been consid-\nered a gene melting pot for evolution in a recent review (50).\nMultiple sequence comparisons of the kinase domains of\nLegK1 to LegK5 with eukaryotic and procaryotic protein ki-\nnase domains revealed that LegK1 and LegK3 cluster in the\ngroup of eukaryotic protein kinases, close to protein kinases\nfrom protozoa (data not shown), as previously reported (8, 46).\nThis observation raises the possibility of their initial acquisition\nby L. pneumophila from the distant eukaryotic organisms that\nare natural hosts for Legionella. In contrast, LegK2, LegK4,\nand LegK5 are not closely similar to eukaryotic protein kinases\nor prokaryotic enzymes. It is noteworthy that protein kinases\nhave been identified in intracellular bacteria such as Mycobac-\nterium tuberculosis (1, 9) and nonpathogenic species such as\nMyxococcus xanthus and Anabaena cyanobacteria (47, 57, 74).\nThe occurrence of protein kinase-encoding genes in free non-\npathogenic bacterial species and in-depth analysis of GC content\nof various protein kinase encoding genes led researchers previ-\nously to conclude that bacterial protein kinases (“eukaryote-like”)\nexisted before the divergence between eukaryotes and pro-\nkaryotes during evolution (27). Thus, even though the presence of\nhorizontally acquired eukaryotic genes in amoeba pathogens such\nas L. pneumophila appears increasingly evident, the precise origin\nof protein kinase-encoding genes in L. pneumophila genomes has\nnot been completely deciphered.\n\nThe eukaryotic kinase family is characterized by 11 con-\nserved sequences, described as the Hanks subdomains, which\nare involved in ATP binding, and in phosphorylation reaction.\nLegK2 and LegK5 lack the Hanks subdomain VIII required for\nsubstrate recognition and phosphotransfer. However, both\nLegK2 and LegK5 are able to autophosphorylate and phos-\nphorylate the eukaryotic protein kinase substrate myelin basic\nprotein (MBP). More than 600 bacterial protein kinases have\nbeen identified through genome sequencing projects and ho-\nmology-based comparisons with eukaryotic kinases and, less\nfrequently, through direct experimental evidence (38, 39).\nGenerally, protein kinases from bacteria conserve the nucleo-\ntide binding region (subdomains I to III) and the core catalytic\ndomain (subdomain VII known as Brenner’s motif H-X-D-\nX4-N [6]), but some of them display less homology as con-\nserved enzymatic activity; for instance, SteC, which is required\nfor host cell actin remodeling by Salmonella, is a functional\nprotein kinase that exhibits only subdomains I to III involved in\nATP binding (59). Moreover, although YihE from E. coli\nclearly possesses protein kinase activity, sequence analysis re-\nveals little similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases, whereas\ntridimensional structure analysis reveals a kinase-like fold sim-\nilar to that of choline kinase and aminoglycoside phospho-\ntransferase (75). Likewise but to a lesser extent, LegK2 and\nLegK5 are functional in terms of phosphorylation even though\nthey do not display all of the consensus domains of the eukary-\notic protein kinase family. In contrast, LegK1 was not in vitro\n\nVOL. 79, 2011 TRANSLOCATED PROTEIN KINASES AND LEGIONELLA VIRULENCE 1947\n\n\n\nlabeled by autophosphorylation and could not phosphorylate\nthe MBP in standard in vitro assay conditions. It can be hy-\npothesized that LegK1 must be activated to be functional.\nIndeed, it was previously shown that YpkA from Y. pestis is\nproduced as an inactive protein kinase. This essential virulence\nfactor is then translocated by a T3SS into the host cell, where\nit is activated by the host cell actin (33). On the other hand, we\ncan assume that LegK1 cannot use the MBP as substrate but\ncould phosphorylate other specific protein substrates. Indeed,\nit has been recently reported that LegK1 can specifically phos-\nphorylate in vitro the eukaryotic I�B\r protein but not MBP in\ncells, thus activating the NF-�B pathway (25).\n\nThe bacterial protein kinases LegK1 to LegK4 are translo-\ncated into the host cell cytoplasm by the Dot/Icm T4SS during\ninfection of L. pneumophila. Conversely, LegK5 appeared not\nto be translocated. It is noteworthy that another intracellular\npathogen, M. tuberculosis, encodes 11 different protein kinases,\namong them one that is translocated into the host cell to\nsubvert the host cell defenses (70, 71), while others are tailored\nfor bacterial signal transduction pathways (1, 51). Likewise,\nLegK5 may be involved in bacterial transduction signaling\npathways that control Legionella metabolism rather than in the\ncontrol of host cell functions.\n\nInterestingly, inactivation and/or kinase-dead substitution of\nthe legK2 gene resulted in a significant decrease in the viru-\nlence of L. pneumophila toward amoebae. It is noteworthy that\nT4SS effectors mutants are usually not altered in Legionella\nvirulence, probably due to the high redundancy of these effec-\ntors genes (22). The legK2 mutant virulence defect is not com-\nplemented by other legK gene expression vectors, thus showing\na unique and key role for the LegK2 protein kinase in the\ncontrol of the infectious cycle of L. pneumophila. Although\nthe four other LegK proteins did not interfere individually with\nthe overall ability of Legionella to replicate in the host, they\nmight modulate subtle pathways of Legionella infectivity and/or\nhave complementary or redundant cellular and functional tar-\ngets. Indeed, although LegK1 has been reported to activate the\nNF-�B pathway and likely plays an important role in modulat-\ning macrophages defenses during L. pneumophila infection,\ndeletion of the legK1 gene has no notable effects on its intra-\ncellular replication (25, 45).\n\nThe legK2 mutant strain is defective for recruiting the ER to\nthe LCV, which results in delayed bacterial intracellular rep-\nlication. Remodeling its phagosome by the recruitment of ER\nis a characteristic trait of the unique intracellular fate of L.\npneumophila to evade the endocytic pathway (11, 34). Inter-\nestingly, two other Dot/Icm substrates, namely, SidC and SidJ,\nwhich do not display any homology with protein kinases, have\nbeen recently shown to be involved in ER recruitment (43, 62).\nMutation in sidJ results in a phenotype very similar to that of\nthe legK2 mutation, i.e., a sidJ mutant is considerably delayed\nin both ER recruitment on the LCV and intracellular growth.\nMoreover, SidJ was not associated with the phagosomal mem-\nbrane. These results led researchers to conclude that SidJ\nmodulates as-yet-unknown host cellular pathways to control\nthe trafficking or the retention of ER-derived vesicles to the\nLCV (43). It would be interesting to determine whether SidJ\nand LegK2 function synergistically and target the same or\nparallel pathways. On the other hand, SidC is an L. pneumo-\nphila effector protein that anchors to the host cell lipid phos-\n\nphatidylinositol-4 phosphate and could act as a “tethering do-\nmain” for ER vesicle recruitment to the LCV (62). Indeed, as\nwith sidJ and legK2 mutants, an LCV harboring the sidC mu-\ntant recruits ER less efficiently than does the wild type. How-\never, sidC mutant replicates at the same rate as the wild type,\nwhile localizing in calnexin-negative LCVs, thus indicating that\nthe interaction with the ER might not be a prerequisite to form\na L. pneumophila replication-permissive compartment. In a\nsimilar manner, ralF and drrA mutants replicate normally de-\nspite an inability to recruit the host GTPase ER-Golgi regula-\ntors Rab1 and Arf1 to the LCV, respectively (49, 54). This\nindicates that L. pneumophila simultaneously targets multiple\nand yet unknown functionally redundant pathways to contrib-\nute to the formation of replication-permissive LCVs, leading to\nthe absence of a phenotype when any single pathway is dis-\nrupted. If we consider that a kinase-dead legK2 mutant is\naltered both in ER recruitment and in intracellular Legionella\nreplication, it can be proposed that the LegK2 protein kinase\nplays a key role for modulating one or several of the host cell\nsignal transduction pathways that contribute to the formation\nof the LCV. Interestingly, this result highlights a new molec-\nular mechanism, namely, protein phosphorylation, developed\nby L. pneumophila to subvert host cell defenses. The relation-\nship between protein phosphorylation and virulence of L.\npneumophila will be investigated further by characterizing the\nhost cell pathways controlled by LegK2. Indeed, deciphering\nthe individual contribution of each Legionella effector to the\nintracellular lifestyle of the bacteria remains a major and per-\nhaps the principal challenge to understanding the molecular\nbasis of Legionella virulence.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was supported by the PEPS program from the Centre\nNational de la Recherche Scientifique and the Université Lyon 1.
