GSI I (Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) induces apoptosis of some tumor cells by inhibiting proteasome and Notch activity.\n\nAlterations in these two cell survival regulators contribute to apoptosis resistance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells.\n\nHere, we investigated the mechanisms whereby GSI I increases apoptosis of primary CLL cells. Time-course studies indicate\n\nthat initial apoptotic events are inhibition of proteasome activity, concomitant with an increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER)\n\nstress apoptotic signaling, and a consistent Noxa protein up-regulation. These events precede, and some of them contribute\n\nto, mitochondrial alterations, which occur notwithstanding Mcl-1 accumulation induced by GSI I. In CLL cells, GSI I inhibits\n\nNotch1 and Notch2 activation only in the late apoptotic phases, suggesting that this event does not initiate CLL cell\n\napoptosis. However, Notch inhibition may contribute to amplify GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, given that Notch activation\n\nsustains the survival of these cells, as demonstrated by the evidence that both Notch1 and Notch2 down-regulation by small-\n\ninterfering RNA accelerates spontaneous CLL cell apoptosis. Overall, our results show that GSI I triggers CLL cell apoptosis by\n\ninhibiting proteasome activity and enhancing ER stress, and amplifies it by blocking Notch activation. These findings suggest\n\nthe potential relevance of simultaneously targeting these three important apoptosis regulators as a novel therapeutic strategy\n\nfor CLL.\n\nKey words: chronic lymphocytic leukemia cell apoptosis, c-secretase inhibitor I, proteasome, endoplasmic reticulum stress, Notch\n\nAbbreviations: ASK1: apoptosis signal-regulating kinase1; Bak: Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer; Bap 31: B-cell receptor-association\n\nprotein 31; Bax: Bcl-2-associated X protein; Bcl-2: B-cell lymphoma protein-2; Bfl/A1: Bcl-2-related protein A1; BH3: Bcl-2 homology\n\ndomain; Bim: Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death; CHOP/GADD153: C/EBP homologous protein/Growth Arrest and DNA Damage 153;\n\nCHX: cicloheximide; CLL: chronic lymphocytic leukemia; COX IV: cytochrome oxidase IV; DMSO: dimethyl sulfoxide; DSHB:\n\nDevelopmental Studies Hybridoma Bank; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERAD: ER-associated degradation; GAPDH: glyceraldehyde 3-\n\nphosphate dehydrogenase; GSI: c-secretase inhibitor; Hes1: hairy and enhancer of split 1; IRE1: inositol-requiring enzyme1; Mcl-1: myeloid\n\ncell leukemia-1; NICHD: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Omi/HtrA2: high temperature requirement serine\n\nprotease A2; PARP: poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase; PI: propidium iodide; SAPK/JNK: stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase;\n\nSmac/DIABLO: second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase/direct IAP binding protein with low pI; TRAF2: TNF receptor-associated\n\nfactor2; ZAP-70: f-chain-associated protein-70; z-LEVD-fmk: Z-Leu-Glu (OMe)-Val-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethylketone; z-VAD-fmk:\n\nbenzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethylketone.\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online version of this article.\n\n*R.S. and F.D.F. contributed equally to this study\n\nGrant sponsor: Progetti di Ricerca di Interesse Nazionale-PRIN (2008); Grant number: Prot. 2008YSSL7B_003; Grant sponsor: Fondazione\n\nCassa di Risparmio di Perugia, Italy (2009); Grant number: 2009.020.0086; Grant sponsor: Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.27863\n\nHistory: Received 29 Mar 2012; Revised 31 Aug 2012; Accepted 3 Sep 2012; Online 24 Sep 2012\n\nCorrespondence to: Emanuela Rosati, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, General Pathology and Immunology Section, Via\n\nEnrico dal Pozzo, Padiglione-W, 06126, Perugia, Italy, Tel.: þ39-075-5855830, Fax: þ39-075-5855827, E-mail: erosati@unipg.it\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\nInt.

Given that in CLL,\nmultiple pathways are dysregulated,1,3 and considering that\ntargeting one single pathway is often not sufficient to elimi-\nnate tumor cells,4,5 it is necessary to develop novel strategies\nable to activate multiple apoptotic pathways and, simultane-\nously inhibit dysregulated survival pathways.\n\nc-Secretase inhibitors (GSIs) include a wide range of small\nmolecules proposed for therapy of malignancies driven by an\naberrant Notch activity.6 A dysregulated Notch signaling has\nbeen associated with the pathogenesis of several malignan-\ncies,7 and GSIs have been shown to inhibit the growth and/\nor survival of several tumor cells,8 including CLL cells.9 Some\nGSIs have also been tested in phase I trials for patients with\nbreast cancer10 and T-cell acute leukemias.11 However, in\nthese malignancies, minimal clinical responses have been\nobserved, and other studies have also suggested that Notch\ninhibition is therapeutically effective only when combined\nwith inhibition of other relevant pathogenic pathways.12–14 It\nhas been recently shown that GSI I (Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), a\ntripeptide aldehyde inhibiting chymotryptic and aspartyl pro-\ntease activity, chemically similar to the proteasome inhibitor\nMG132 (Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-CHO),15 induces apoptosis in\nbreast16,17 and glioblastoma tumor cells,18 and in precursor-B\nacute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells19 by inhibiting both\nc-secretase and proteasome activity or only proteasome activ-\nity.17 The ability of GSI I to target both Notch and protea-\nsome can render it more effective in inducing antitumor\nactivity in those tumor cells where dysregulated survival and/\nor growth are associated with alterations in both Notch sig-\nnaling and proteasome activity. This might be also the case\nof CLL cells, given that both a constitutive Notch activation9\n\nand an up-regulated activity of ubiquitin-proteasome path-\nway20 contribute to their apoptosis resistance. Furthermore,\nthe evidence that in CLL, the clinical use of the highly spe-\ncific proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has been associated\nwith poor antitumor responses,21 suggests that the only inhi-\nbition of proteasome is not sufficient to kill CLL cells.\n\nOne mechanism by which proteasome inhibitors mediate\nantitumor activity is that they prevent the clearance of mis-\nfolded proteins by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated\ndegradation (ERAD) pathway,22 resulting in protein accumu-\nlation in the ER and ER stress-induced apoptosis.23 Impor-\ntantly, CLL cells have a functional ER stress-associated\n\napoptotic signaling, and are susceptible to both pharmaco-\nlogic and genetic ER targeting strategies.24,25\n\nBased on all the above observations and our previous\nfindings that GSI I increased CLL cell apoptosis and inhibited\nNotch activation,9 we investigated whether an inhibited pro-\nteasome activity and an increased ER stress signaling are also\ninvolved in GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, and examined\nhow these events and Notch inhibition contribute to this ap-\noptosis. Clarifying the effects of GSI I on these three critical\nregulators of CLL cell survival may be important to design\nmore effective therapies for this leukemia. Results show that\ninhibition of proteasome activity, concomitant with an\nincreased ER stress signaling and a consistent Noxa protein\nup-regulation, are critical initial events for GSI I-induced\nCLL cell apoptosis. After these effects, GSI I also inhibits\nNotch activation, event that contributes to amplify CLL cell\napoptosis.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nPatients\n\nTwenty-two CLL patients entered this study. Diagnoses of\nCLL were performed according to the National Cancer Insti-\ntute-sponsored Working Group guidelines,26 and clinical\nstaging was based on the Binet classification.27 This study\nwas approved by the local Ethics Committee, and all patients\nsigned informed consent in accordance with the Helsinki\nDeclaration.\n\nCell purification and culture\n\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from\nheparinized blood of CLL patients by Ficoll density-gradient\ncentrifugation (Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). Monocytes were\nremoved by plastic adherence, and T cells by sheep erythro-\ncyte rosetting. All CLL samples contained more than 96%\nCD19þ/CD5þ CLL cells, as assessed by flow cytometry\n(EPICS-XL-MCL; Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).\n\nFreshly isolated CLL cells, resuspended at 2 � 106 cells/ml\nin complete medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented\nwith 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone\nLaboratories, Logan, UT), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml peni-\ncillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin (all from Invitrogen, Mi-\nlan, Italy), were incubated in culture tubes (3 ml/tube) at\n37�C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The c-secretase inhibitor I\n(GSI I; Z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO), the pan-caspase inhibitor\nz-VAD-fmk, the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (all from\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nGSI-I is a c-secretase inhibitor (GSI) that can induce apoptosis in some tumor cells. In this study of primary chronic\n\nlymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, the authors report that GSI I can increase apoptosis in apoptosis-resistant cells via three\n\nkey cell-survival regulators: proteasome, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and Notch. Given that several apoptotic pathways are\n\ndysregulated in CLL, this type of multi-targeted agent may prove to be more effective than highly selective drugs in blocking\n\ntumor-cell growth and survival. These findings may thus have important therapeutic implications.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\nRosati et al. 1941\n\nInt. J.

The National Center for Biotechnology\nInformation (NCBI) Ig Blast database and sequence align-\nment tool was used to identify and compare sequences with\nthe most homologous germline VH gene family. VH gene\nsequences deviating more than 2% from the corresponding\ngermline gene were defined mutated. CD38 surface expres-\nsion and ZAP-70 intracellular expression in CLL cells were\nexamined as previously described.24,29\n\nSupporting Information Table 1 gives clinical laboratory\ncharacteristics and the Binet stage of CLL patients.\n\nMutation analysis of NOTCH1\n\nThe NOTCH1 exon 34 mutation previously identified in\nCLL30 was analyzed by PCR amplification as described else-\nwhere31 and frequencies were determined using the NCBI\ndatabase. Cycling conditions were: 95�C for 5 min (one\ncycle); 95�C for 45 sec; 58�C for 45 sec; 72�C for 1 min for\n36 cycles; 72�C for 6 min (one cycle). After direct sequencing\nfrom both strands, purified amplicons were compared with\ncorresponding germline sequences, and germline polymor-\nphisms in the NCBI SNP database were excluded.\n\nOP9 coculture\n\nOP9 bone marrow stromal cell line was maintained in\nIMDM containing 20% FBS, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM sodium\npyruvate, 1 mM L-glutamine, 30 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 100\nU/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. One day before\nthe experiment, OP9 cells were plated in 6-well plates (1 �\n105/well). Cocultures were initiated by seeding in each well,\nprecoated with OP9, CLL cells resuspended at 3 � 105/ml in\ncomplete medium (3 ml/well) containing GSI I. After 36 hr\nof coculture, CLL cells were removed from the monolayer.\nContamining OP9 cells were eliminated filtering the har-\nvested CLL cells through a 70-mm cell strainer (BD Falcon;\nBecton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). CLL cell purity was greater\nthan 99%, as revealed by flow cytometric analysis of CD45\nexpression. Neither DMSO nor GSI I affected the OP9\nmonolayer integrity.\n\nMTS assay\n\nThe effect of GSI I on viability of OP9 cells was assessed\nby 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-\n2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay,\nusing CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution reagent (Promega,\nMadison, WI). OP9 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (5 �\n103/well), allowed to adhere for 1 day and then exposed to\nGSI I or DMSO as control. After 36-hr incubation, MTS rea-\ngent was added to the wells and after 2-hr incubation at\n37�C, absorbance was measured in a plate reader at 490 nm.\n\nApoptosis assay\n\nApoptosis was assessed by flow cytometric analysis (EPICS-\nXL-MCL) of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/\npropidium iodide (PI)-stained cells.

In Mcl-1 experiments,\ncells were cultured for 24 hr in 12-well plates in complete\nmedium. In Notch1 and Notch2 experiments, cells were cul-\ntured for 72 hr in 12-well plates in supernatants harvested\nfrom 48-hr cultures of OP9 cell line, to minimize spontane-\nous apoptosis of siControl transfected cells that could obscure\nthe effect of Notch1 and Notch2 silencing.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical differences between mean values were evaluated\nusing the Student’s t test. The minimal level of significance\nwas p < 0.05.\n\nResults\nGSI I increases apoptosis of CLL cells\n\nCLL cells from 22 patients were exposed for 24 hr to increas-\ning GSI I concentrations, and apoptosis was evaluated by\nAnnexin V/PI staining. GSI I increased CLL cell apoptosis in\na dose-dependent manner, with 0.1 mM which had a very\nmarginal effect, 1 mM which increased apoptosis but not in a\nsignificant manner, and 2.5 and 5 mM which caused the high-\nest effects (Supporting Information Figs. S1a and S1b). GSI I\ninduced apoptosis in CLL cells from all examined patients,\nregardless of clinical stage and biological characteristics.\nNOTCH1 mutational status of CLL samples does not seem\nto affect the susceptibility of CLL cells to GSI I-induced apo-\nptosis. Indeed, the NOTCH1 PEST domain mutation\n(c.7544_7545delCT) previously identified in CLL,30 occurred\nin 2 of the 22 examined patients (3 and 14), and in these\ntwo samples, reduction of cell viability by GSI I was similar\nin extent to that observed in unmutated samples (Supporting\nInformation Table 2).\n\nWe then determined the time-course of GSI I-induced\napoptosis. In these and several of the next time-course experi-\nments, CLL cells from 12 samples (1–12), including patients\nwith different characteristics, were exposed to 2.5 mM GSI I\nfor 1, 4, 8 and 24 hr. GSI I, after 1 hr, had a marginal effect on\nCLL cell apoptosis, which began to increase after 4 hr and pro-\ngressively increased up to 24 hr (Figs. 1a and 1b).\n\nGSI I increases CLL cell apoptosis in the presence of bone\n\nmarrow stromal support\n\nSince bone marrow microenvironment provides survival\nadvantage and confers chemoresistance to CLL cells,32 we\n\ninvestigated whether GSI I is able to induce CLL cell apopto-\nsis in the presence of OP9 bone marrow stromal cells. We\ncocultured CLL cells for 36 hr with OP9 cells with or without\nGSI I, and evaluated CLL cell viability and apoptosis by\nAnnexin V/PI staining. We performed these experiments in\nCLL cells from six samples (2–7), selected to include patients\nwith different characteristics. Results show that GSI I, at both\n2.5 and 5 mM, decreased CLL cell viability also in the pres-\nence of OP9 cells, although they triggered pro-survival signals\nto CLL cells (Fig. 1c). To exclude that GSI I overcomes the\npro-survival effect of OP9 cells on CLL cells because of a\ndirect toxicity on stromal support, we examined the effect of\nGSI I on OP9 cell viability using MTS assay. Results show\nthat OP9 cell viability was not affected by GSI I, either at 2.5\nor 5 mM (Fig. 1d).\n\nGSI I rapidly inhibits proteasome activity in CLL cells\n\nTo investigate whether GSI I inhibits proteasome activity in\nCLL cells, we analyzed (patients 1–12) the accumulation of\npolyubiquitinated proteins, which is an indicator of protea-\nsome inhibition and a cause of proteasome inhibitor-induced\napoptosis.33 Time-course analysis shows that GSI I, already\nafter 1 hr, induced, compared with controls, a strong accu-\nmulation of polyubiquitinated proteins, which further\nincreased at 4 and 8 hr and to a lesser degree at 24 hr\n(Fig. 2a). These results show that GSI I rapidly inhibits pro-\nteasome activity in CLL cells, and suggest that proteasome\ninhibition may be one of the initial triggering events for GSI\nI-induced CLL cell apoptosis.\n\nGSI I rapidly increases apoptotic ER stress signaling\n\nin CLL cells\n\nBased on our recent findings that ex vivo CLL cells have a\nfunctional ER stress-triggered caspase cascade initiated by\ncaspase-4 and involving caspase-8 and -3,24 we first investi-\ngated whether GSI I potentiates the activation of these cas-\npases (patients 1–12). Time-course analysis shows that the\ncleavage of caspase-4 into its active 20-kDa subunit was\nincreased by GSI I, compared with controls, already after 1\nhr and continued to be increased until 24 hr (Fig. 2b). GSI I\nalso enhanced caspase-8 and -3 activation and PARP degra-\ndation, with effects evident from 4 hr onward (Fig. 2b). To\nexamine the role of caspase-4 and the overall contribution of\ncaspases to GSI I-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect\nof the caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk and the pan-caspase\ninhibitor z-VAD-fmk on the viability and apoptosis of CLL\ncells treated with GSI I (patients 2–7). Results show that the\ndecrease of cell viability induced by GSI I compared with\ncontrols, was partially prevented by z-LEVD-fmk and com-\npletely prevented by z-VAD-fmk (Supporting Information\nFig. S2a). Caspase-4 inhibitor z-LEVD-fmk also reduced the\nGSI I-induced processing of caspase-8 and -3 to their active\n18- and 17-kDa subunits, respectively (Supporting Informa-\ntion Fig. S2b), suggesting that GSI I-induced caspase-4 activa-\ntion acts upstream of caspase-8 and -3.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\nRosati et al. 1943\n\nInt. J. Cancer: 132, 1940–1953 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nWe next examined the effect of GSI I on other proapop-\ntotic events associated with ER stress, including the expres-\nsion of the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153,34 the\ncleavage of the ER membrane protein Bap31 into the proa-\npoptotic ER membrane-embedded fragment Bap20, event\nknown to be induced by caspase-8 and important in propa-\ngating apoptotic signals from ER to mitochondria,35 and the\nphosphorylation of JNK1/2, a kinase activated by the IRE1-\nTRAF2-ASK1 branch of the ER stress response,36 and\ninvolved in connecting ER to mitochondria37 (patients 1–12).\nResults show that CHOP/GADD153 levels, which in controls\nincreased from 1 hr onward, were not further increased by\nGSI I, whereas Bap31 cleavage into Bap20, which also pro-\ngressively increased in controls, was further enhanced by GSI\n\nI, with evident effects observed at 8 and 24 hr (Fig. 2c).\nJNK1/2 phosphorylation was also enhanced by GSI I from 1\nup to 8 hr and decreased at 24 hr, however, remaining higher\nthan in controls, where it had almost completely decreased\n(Fig. 2c). IRE1a expression, which in controls, increased from\n1 hr onward, was further enhanced by GSI I after 1 and 4 hr\nand decreased at later time-points (Fig. 2c). Altogether, these\nresults show that GSI I increases CLL cell apoptosis activat-\ning several pathways associated with ER stress.\n\nGSI I increases the activation of the mitochondrial\n\napoptotic pathway in CLL cells\n\nTo determine whether mitochondrial alterations are involved\nin GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, we examined, in CLL\n\nFigure 1.

J. Cancer: 132, 1940–1953 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nJNK1/2 signaling activated by GSI I is involved in\n\nconverging ER stress apoptotic signals to the mitochondria.\n\nIt is known that JNK1/2 activation connects ER stress with mi-\ntochondrial apoptosis by several mechanisms.37 To determine\nwhether the increased JNK1/2 phosphorylation induced by\nGSI I contributes to mitochondrial alterations, we analyzed the\neffect of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 on cytochrome c and\nSmac/DIABLO release to the cytosol, induced by GSI I in CLL\ncells (patients 2–7). In all examined samples, SP600125 com-\npletely abrogated the increase in JNK1/2 phosphorylation\ninduced by GSI I (Fig. 3c) and partially prevented the cytosolic\naccumulation of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO (Fig. 3d), as\nwell as the decrease of CLL cell viability induced by GSI I\n(Fig. 3e). These results suggest that JNK1/2 activation by GSI I\ncontributes, at least in part, to CLL cell apoptosis by converg-\ning ER stress apoptotic signals to the mitochondria.\n\nGSI I-induced apoptosis of CLL cells is associated with\n\nNoxa up-regulation and occurs notwithstanding Mcl-1\n\naccumulation\n\nHaving shown that, in CLL cells, GSI I activates the mitochon-\ndrial apoptotic pathway, and given the crucial role of Bcl-2 fam-\nily members in controlling mitochondrial apoptosis,38 we inves-\ntigated the effect of GSI I on some of these molecules (patients\n1–12). Analysis of the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1,\ncritical mediators of CLL cell survival,39 showed that whereas\nBcl-2 expression remained unchanged after GSI I treatment,\nMcl-1 levels were rapidly increased, compared with controls, al-\nready after 1 hr. Mcl-1 levels were maintained high by GSI I up\nto 24 hr, time at which, in control cells, they were reduced (Fig.\n4a). We next examined the proapoptotic proteins Bax, known\nto directly affect the outer mitochondrial membrane permeabil-\nity to apoptogenic factors, and the BH3-only proteins Noxa and\nBim, which function, the former, by neutralizing the antiapop-\ntotic Mcl-1 and Bfl/A1 thereby releasing Bax and Bak, and the\nlatter, by directly inducing Bax oligomerization.38 Analysis of\ncytosolic and mitochondria-enriched fractions revealed that\nGSI I, from 4 hr onward, induced a time-dependent reduction\nof cytosolic Bax levels accompanied by an increase in the mito-\nchondrial levels (Fig. 4b). Analysis of Noxa and Bim proteins\nshowed that Noxa levels were strongly up-regulated, as early as\n1 hr following treatment, and continued to increase with time\n(Figs. 4c left panel and 4d), whereas Bim EL, L and S isoform\nlevels remained unchanged after GSI I treatment (Fig. 4c right\npanel). This high Noxa expression suggests that it is a critical\neffector in GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis and prompted us\nto examine whether Noxa increase was due to transcriptional\nup-regulation (patients 2-7). GSI I induced, already after 1 hr, a\nweak increase in Noxa mRNA levels which progressively\nincreased with time, exceeding, after 24 hr, a ninefold increase\ncompared with untreated cells (Fig. 4e). Therefore, GSI I, espe-\ncially in the late phases of apoptosis, up-regulates Noxa protein\nby increasing its transcription. Noxa up-regulation by GSI I\nalso depends on protein synthesis, given that treating CLL cells\n\nwith GSI I in the presence of the translation inhibitor CHX\n(patients 2–7) strongly prevented GSI I-induced Noxa increase\n(Fig. 4f). These results along with the evidence that CHX pre-\nvented the decrease of CLL cell viability induced by GSI I (Fig.\n4g) suggest that GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis requires the\nsynthesis of proapoptotic protein(s), including Noxa.\n\nNext, in an attempt to discover the mechanisms impli-\ncated in Noxa up-regulation by GSI I, we investigated the\npossible involvement of JNK1/2 signaling. Noxa protein\nexpression was analyzed in CLL cells pretreated with the JNK\ninhibitor SP600125 and then exposed to GSI I (patients 2–7).\nIn all examined samples, inhibition of JNK1/2 phosphoryla-\ntion induced by SP600125 (Fig. 4h left panel) resulted in\ndecreased Noxa expression (Fig. 4h right panel), and suggests\nthat JNK signaling contributes, at least in part, to Noxa\nprotein up-regulation by GSI I, thus further contributing to\nmitochondrial pathway activation.\n\nSilencing of Mcl-1 enhances apoptotic activity\n\nof GSI I in CLL cells\n\nHaving shown that GSI I rapidly induced accumulation of\nMcl-1 protein, a critical factor for CLL cell survival and\nchemoresistance,40 we investigated whether Mcl-1 accumula-\ntion affects proapoptotic activity of GSI I. Therefore, we exam-\nined the effect of Mcl-1 down-regulation by siRNA on GSI I-\ninduced CLL cell apoptosis. CLL cells were transfected with\ncontrol nontargeting (siCtrl) or Mcl-1 siRNA (siMcl-1), and\n24 hr after transfection were exposed for 4 hr to 2.5 mM GSI I\nor DMSO. We performed these experiments in CLL cells from\nfive samples, including patients with different characteristics\n(2, 13–16). Western blot analysis performed after transfection\nshowed that, in siMcl-1 CLL cells of the different patients,\nthere was a significant reduction of Mcl-1 (Fig. 5a) which,\nconsistent with previous studies,41 resulted in decreased CLL\ncell viability, as indicated by increased PARP degradation (Fig.\n5a) and reduced percentage of viable Annexin V�/PI� cells\n(Fig. 5b). When transfected CLL cells were exposed to GSI I or\nDMSO, we found that in siCtrl cells treated with GSI I, there\nwas a substantial accumulation of Mcl-1 which reached high\nexpression levels, whereas in siMcl-1 cells, Mcl-1 levels\nremained low in response to GSI I, even if in some patients,\nthey increased compared with siMcl-1 cells in DMSO (Figs. 5c\nand 5d). Analysis of Annexin V/PI staining shows that\nwhereas in siCtrl cells, GSI I decreased cell viability by only\n19.9 6 7.2% (p < 0.01) compared with DMSO, in siMcl-1\nCLL cells, GSI I decreased cell viability by 64.5 6 10.2% (p <\n0.01) (Figs. 5e and 5f). These data show that Mcl-1 down-reg-\nulation enhances GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis suggesting\nthat Mcl-1 accumulation induced by GSI I may slow down,\nbut does not impede, mitochondrial pathway activation.\n\nNotch inhibition by GSI I contributes to amplify\n\nCLL cell apoptosis\n\nDuring previous studies involving Notch in CLL cell survival,\nwe found that GSI I, after 24 hr, increased CLL cell apoptosis\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\nRosati et al. 1947\n\nInt.

Data shown for patient 2 are\n\nrepresentative of six patients.\n\n\n\nand inhibited Notch signaling.9 Here, to define how this\nevent contributes to GSI I-induced CLL cell apoptosis, we\nfirst examined the time-course effect of GSI I on Notch1 and\nNotch2 processing and Hes1 protein expression, a target of\nNotch2 in CLL cells.9 We performed these experiments in\nCLL cells from 12 samples (2–7, 17–22), including patients\nwith different characteristics. In all samples, GSI I inhibited\nthe generation of Notch1 and Notch2 intracellular domains\n(IC), as well as the expression of the precursors (P) and the\ntransmembrane/cytoplasmic portion (TM), only after 24 hr,\nwhereas up to 8 hr, the levels of the three forms of both\nreceptors appeared slightly increased or unchanged compared\n\nwith controls (Fig. 6a). Hes1 expression was also reduced by\nGSI I after 24 hr, whereas up to 8 hr, Hes1 levels appeared\nstable (Fig. 6b). The evidence that GSI I inhibits Notch sig-\nnaling at the time of maximum CLL cell apoptosis indicates\nthat Notch inhibition is not critical for initiating apoptosis.\nHowever, this event contributes to amplify CLL cell apopto-\nsis, because Notch signaling has a pro-survival role in these\ncells. This was demonstrated in genetic inhibition studies, in\nwhich Notch1 and Notch2 were down-regulated by siRNA\n(patients 2, 18–22). Results show that siRNA down-regulation\nof both Notch1, as demonstrated for the first time here (Figs.\n6c and 6d), and Notch2, as previously reported9 and shown\n\nFigure 5.

Cancer: 132, 1940–1953 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nin Supporting Information Figures S3a and S3b, increased\nCLL cell apoptosis compared with siCtrl treatment.\n\nDiscussion\nThe major finding of our study is that GSI I triggers apopto-\nsis of primary CLL cells by inhibiting proteasome activity\nand enhancing ER stress signaling and amplifies it by block-\ning Notch activation. This is the first evidence that in CLL,\nGSI I simultaneously targets three key apoptosis regulators to\ninduce apoptosis, even if the dual activities of GSI I on pro-\nteasome and Notch has also been demonstrated in other tu-\nmor cells.16–18 These findings may have important therapeu-\ntic implications for CLL, considering the emerging interest in\ngenerating new anticancer multitarget agents, based on the\ncurrent opinion that anticancer drugs, able to interfere simul-\ntaneously with multiple altered pathways, might be more\neffective than highly selective drugs.4,5\n\nOur results show that GSI I increases CLL cell apoptosis\nalso in the presence of pro-survival signals triggered by OP9\nstromal cells, suggesting the potential to reverse cytoprotec-\ntion by the microenvironment.\n\nWe demonstrate that proteasome inhibition by GSI I\noccurs concomitant with an increased activation of some ER\nstress-associated apoptotic pathways and a strong up-regula-\ntion of the proapoptotic BH3-only protein Noxa. In CLL\ncells, GSI I rapidly potentiates a specific ER stress-triggered\ncaspase cascade, initiated by caspase-4 and involving caspase-\n8 and -3, which is already functional in ex vivo CLL cells and\nplays an important role in their spontaneous apoptosis.24 GSI\nI also rapidly increases JNK1/2 phosphorylation and the\nexpression of IRE1a, an ER membrane kinase known to acti-\nvate the ASK1/JNK pathway of the ER stress response.36 The\ncleavage of the ER stress regulator Bap31 into the pro\napoptotic Bap20 fragment is also increased by GSI I, further\nconfirming the involvement of ER stress in GSI I-induced\nCLL cell apoptosis.\n\nTime-course studies indicate that proteasome inhibition\nand all ER stress apoptotic events induced by GSI I in CLL\ncells precede, and some of them contribute to, the activation\nof the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, characterized by Bax\ntranslocation to mitochondria, release of cytochrome c,\nSmac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2 to the cytosol, and caspase-9\nactivation. In this context, pharmacologic inhibition studies\nshow that JNK1/2 activation induced by GSI I contributes, at\nleast in part, to the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c\nand Smac/DIABLO to the cytosol, suggesting its involvement\nin converging ER stress signals to mitochondria.\n\nMitochondrial integrity is tightly regulated by a wise bal-\nance between proapoptotic and antiapoptotic members of the\nBcl-2 family.38 In CLL cells, GSI I increases mitochondrial\nalterations without down-regulating Bcl-2 expression, and in\nthe presence of a rapid accumulation of the short-lived pro-\ntein Mcl-1, which can be due either to an inhibited proteaso-\nmal degradation42 or an adaptive response to ER stress, as\nalso observed in other tumor cells.43 However, the evidence\n\nthat restraining Mcl-1 accumulation by siRNA increases GSI\nI-induced CLL cell apoptosis, along with the evidence that\nGSI I induces mitochondrial perturbations, suggests that\nMcl-1 persistence induced by GSI I slows down, but does not\nimpede them. This is probably due to the fact that Mcl-1\ncould be sequestered by Noxa so allowing Bax and/or Bak to\npermeabilize mitochondria, as reported elsewhere.44,45 Con-\nsistent with this observation, we show that, in CLL cells, GSI\nI rapidly induces a strong Noxa protein up-regulation which\nprecedes Bax translocation to mitochondria, thus suggesting\nthat Noxa plays a critical role in GSI I-induced CLL cell apo-\nptosis. We show that Noxa increase depends on new protein\nsynthesis and, especially in the late apoptotic phases, on tran-\nscriptional up-regulation. Pharmacologic inhibition studies\nsuggest that a contribution to up-regulating Noxa protein lev-\nels is made by the increased JNK1/2 activation induced by\nGSI I. However, Noxa up-regulation by GSI I may also\ndepend on protein stabilization as a consequence of protea-\nsome inhibition, as occurs in CLL cells treated with the pro-\nteasome inhibitors bortezomib and MG132.46 Since Noxa is a\ntarget of p5347 and p53 is regulated by the proteasome,48 the\npossibility that GSI I increases Noxa mRNA by increasing\ncellular pools of p53 cannot be excluded.\n\nAnother observation of our study is that GSI I inhibits\nNotch signaling when CLL cell apoptosis has reached the\nmaximum level, whereas in the early apoptotic phases, CLL\ncells show an accumulation of Notch1 and Notch2 proteins\nand a stabilization of Hes1 levels. This is probably due to\nproteasome inhibition because various Notch pathway com-\nponents have a fast turnover rate and are tightly regulated by\nthe ubiquitin/proteasome system.49 The evidence that GSI I\ninhibits Notch signaling in the late apoptotic phases suggests\nthat Notch inhibition is not crucial in initiating CLL cell apo-\nptosis and therefore, that the key events induced by GSI I to\ntrigger CLL cell apoptosis are the proteasome inhibition and\nthe increase in ER stress. Notch inhibition by GSI I contrib-\nutes to amplify CLL cell apoptosis because Notch signaling\nhas a pro-survival role in these cells, as demonstrated by the\nevidence that silencing either Notch1 or Notch2 accelerates\nspontaneous CLL cell apoptosis.\n\nThe extent to which the inhibition of Notch and protea-\nsome by GSI I contributes to apoptosis has also been inves-\ntigated in other malignancies. In breast cancer cell lines17\n\nand in glioblastoma tumor cells,18 the main target of GSI I\nis the proteasome. In precursor-B ALL cells, GSI I induces\napoptosis by inhibiting Notch signaling and through Notch-\nindependent mechanisms including, besides proteasome inhi-\nbition, the increase of reactive oxygen species production\nand the disruption of the AKT pro-survival pathway.19 The\nability of GSI I to target Notch, AKT and other pro-survival\npathways, has also been shown in cutaneous T-cell lym-\nphoma.50 All these findings have led to an in-depth under-\nstanding of the mechanisms of action of GSI I in tumor\ncells which is essential to define the potential clinical use of\nGSI I.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\nRosati et al. 1951\n\nInt.
