Stokes VA Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio, USAe\n\nPlasmodium vivax invasion of human erythrocytes requires interaction of the P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) with its\nhost receptor, the Duffy antigen (Fy) on the erythrocyte surface. Consequently, PvDBP is a leading vaccine candidate. The bind-\ning domain of PvDBP lies in a cysteine-rich portion of the molecule called region II (PvDBPII). PvDBPII contains three distinct\nsubdomains based upon intramolecular disulfide bonding patterns. Subdomain 2 (SD2) is highly polymorphic and is thought to\ncontain many key residues for binding to Fy, while SD1 and SD3 are comparatively conserved and their role in Fy binding is not\nwell understood. To examine the relative contributions of the different subdomains to binding to Fy and their abilities to elicit\nstrain-transcending binding-inhibitory antibodies, we evaluated recombinant proteins from SD1�2, SD2, SD3, and SD3�,\nwhich includes 24 residues of SD2. All of the recombinant subdomains, except for SD2, bound variably to human erythrocytes,\nwith constructs containing SD3 showing the best binding. Antisera raised in laboratory animals against SD3, SD3�, and SD2�3\ninhibited the binding of full-length PvDBPII, which is strain transcending, whereas antisera generated to SD1�2 and SD2 failed\nto generate blocking antibodies. All of the murine monoclonal antibodies generated to full-length PvDBPII that had significant\nbinding-inhibitory activity recognized only SD3. Thus, SD3 binds Fy and elicits blocking antibodies, indicating that it contains\nresidues critical to Fy binding that could be the basis of a strain-transcending candidate vaccine against P. vivax.\n\nPlasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) is a 140-kDaprotein secreted by micronemes, a parasite organelle at the\napical end of the merozoite as it invades erythrocytes (2). The\nbinding domain of PvDBP has been narrowed to a cysteine-rich\nregion (referred to as region II or PvDBPII) of the protein (6, 7)\nand comprises the prototypic Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain\nfound in other erythrocyte-binding Plasmodium proteins (e.g.,\nEBA-1, JESEBL, and BAEBL) and in cytoadherence proteins (e.g.,\nPfEMP-1) (1). PvDBPII and the Plasmodium knowlesi DBP�\n(PkDBP�) DBL domain, an ortholog of PvDBPII with 71% se-\nquence identity, appear to be the only known parasite DBL do-\nmain ligands that bind Fy (18, 39).\n\nRegion II of PvDBP (PvDBPII) is 330 amino acids (aa) in\nlength and contains 12 cysteines that are conserved among differ-\nent DBL domains. PvDBPII is one of the most promising vaccine\ntargets because binding to its cognate receptor on erythrocytes,\nthe Duffy antigen (designated Fy), is vital for erythrocyte invasion\n(4, 23). Individuals who fail to express Fy on their erythrocytes are\ngenerally resistant to infection with P. vivax and to the related\nsimian malaria parasite P. knowlesi, which also infects humans\n(23, 24). The observation that both artificially induced and natu-\nrally acquired antibodies (Abs) to PvDBPII block the invasion of\nerythrocytes by P. vivax (16) and correlate with protection against\nP. vivax infection in populations where malaria is endemic (22)\nsupports PvDBPII as an attractive vaccine candidate.\n\nThe recently determined crystal structure of the P. knowlesi\nDBP� (PkDBP�) DBL domain (34) and PvDBPII (5) indicates\nthat the 12 conserved cysteine residues form intradomain disul-\nfide bridges that can be used to divide the DBL domain into three\nsubdomains. Subdomain 1 (SD1), the smallest, includes cysteines\n1 to 4, SD2 includes cysteines 5 and 6, and SD3, the largest, com-\nprises cysteines 7 to 12. SD2 is highly polymorphic, whereas the\n\nother subdomains are relatively conserved (40), suggesting that\nSD2 is a target of immune selection. Alanine mutagenesis of se-\nlected residues in PvDBPII demonstrated critical binding residues\nin SD2, although mutagenesis of residues outside the SD2 area can\nalso impair binding to Fy (17, 37). It has recently been proposed\nthat PvDBPII forms a dimer that is driven by engagement with its\nreceptor and SD2 contains the critical binding residues (5). In the\nstudy upon which this model is based, PvDBPII was cocrystallized\nwith sodium selenate in the absence of its natural ligand, the N-\nterminal binding domain of Fy. Thus, this crystal structure may\nnot represent the conformation of PvDBPII when it is complexed\nwith the N-terminal domain of Fy. In contrast, cocrystallization of\nthe DBL3x domain of P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane pro-\ntein 1, which bears close structural homology to PvDBPII, with its\nnatural ligand chondroitin A sulfate (CSA), showed that SD3 con-\ntained the minimal binding region (31, 32). Since the actual bind-\ning mechanism of PvDBPII remains unknown, it would not be\nsurprising if the interaction with the receptor involved more than\none interaction or if this interaction required conformational in-\nduction for recognition of a secondary receptor.\n\nHere we postulate that SD3 is essential for PvDBPII binding to\n\nReceived 25 February 2012 Returned for modification 22 March 2012\nAccepted 11 May 2012\n\nPublished ahead of print 21 May 2012\n\nEditor: J.

We cloned and\nexpressed subdomains of PvDBPII and demonstrated that SD3\nbinds to Fy and can elicit strain-transcending binding-inhibitory\nAbs (BIAbs) to full-length PvDBPII. Moreover, we show that\nbinding-inhibitory monoclonal Abs (MAbs) to PvDBPII target\nresidues in SD3, supporting the critical role of SD3 in binding\nto Fy.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBlood samples. Erythrocytes from finger stick or peripheral venous blood\nwas obtained from healthy normal volunteers after informed consent was\nobtained. The ethical review boards of the University Hospitals of Cleve-\nland approved the protocol for blood drawing.\n\nExpression of DBPII subdomains. Expression of full-length PvDBPII\nof strain Salvador, SalI, and other major variants of PvDBPII referred to as\nAH, O, and P (their sequences in relationship to SalI are shown in supple-\nmental Table 1 of reference 22) was performed as previously described\n(16). The AH, O, and P variants represent haplotypes that account for\n57% of the P. vivax infections isolated from Papua New Guinean children\n(12), and polymorphic residues (n � 14) occurred in �1% of over 100\nPvDBPII sequences worldwide. Expression of SD1�2, SD2, SD3, SD3�,\nand SD2�3 of PvDBPII was performed in the Gateway expression system\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) by following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nThe sequences corresponding to SD1�2, SD2, SD3, SD3�, and SD2�3\nwere amplified by using a PvDBPII (SalI) recombinant plasmid (11, 33) as\nthe template with primers SD1�2F and SD2R, primers SD2F and SD2R,\nprimers SD3F and SD3R, primers SD3�F and SD3�R, and primers SD2F\nand SD3R, respectively. The forward and reverse primers used for differ-\nent SD constructs are as follows: SD2F, CACCATGAAGGAACTTACGA\nATTTGGTAAATAATACAGAC; SD2R, CTAGTGATGGTGAT GGTGA\nTGTATATTTACCGCAAC; SD3F, CACCATGCCGCAGATATATAGAT\nGGATTCGAGAA; SD3R, CTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCTCTTCA\nACGGAACA; SD3�F, CACCATGTACTCAGTTAAAAAAAGATTA\nAAG; SD3�R, CTAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGTGTCACAACTTCCT\nGAGT; SD2�3F, CACCATGAAAAACTGTAATTATAAGAGAAAACG\nTCGG; SD2�3R, same as SD3R.\n\nThe first four extra bases in the forward primers were added to facili-\ntate the directional TOPO cloning in the pENTR vector, and in the reverse\nprimer, additional bases were included to create a C-terminal 6�His tag\nfor affinity purification of the recombinant protein on Ni-nitrilotriacetic\nacid agarose. The expression of the recombinant proteins was done in the\npDEST42 expression vector, followed by their induction in codon-opti-\nmized Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL host cells.\n\nRefolding and purification. Refolding and purification of P. vivax\nDBPII subdomains followed a modified method previously described\n(33). Briefly, the cell pellet from 1 liter of culture was resuspended in 40 ml\nof lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 1% Triton\nX-100). The sample was lysed by two alternate cycles of freezing at �70°C\nand thawing in cold water, followed by six cycles of sonication on ice. The\nlysate was centrifuged at 10,000 � g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant\nwas removed, and the pellet containing inclusion bodies was solubilized in\na buffer consisting of 50 mM 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propane sulfonic\nacid (CAPS) (pH 11.0), 0.6% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.1 mM dithiothre-\nitol (DTT) at a final concentration of 10 to 20 mg/ml and incubated on a\nshaking platform for 15 to 20 min at room temperature (RT). The product\nwas again centrifuged as stated above to clarify the supernatant. This sol-\nubilized preparation was then diluted 1:1 with urea buffer (8 M urea, 100\nmM NaH2PO4, 10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0]) and partially purified on a 1-ml\nHisTrap HP column. The bound protein was eluted with urea buffer\ncontaining 250 mM imidazole.\n\nFor refolding, the eluted protein was rapidly diluted 1:100 with refold-\ning buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mM reduced glutathione,\n0.1 mM oxidized glutathione, 1 M urea, 0.5 M arginine) at RT and stirred\nfor at least 36 h at 4°C prior to dialysis against 50 mM sodium phosphate,\n\npH 6.5, containing 1 M urea, with three changes. Passing of the resulting\nprotein preparation over a 1-ml HiTrap FF cation-exchange chromatog-\nraphy column further purified the protein. The eluted product was then\ndesalted and concentrated with an Amicon Ultra-4 column with a 10,000\nmolecular weight cutoff (MWCO; Millipore Inc.). Refolded proteins un-\nder reducing and nonreducing conditions (with and without DTT) mi-\ngrated at different sizes on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that all of the refolded\nproteins acquired a tertiary shape.\n\nImmunization of rats with DBP subdomains. The recombinant and\npurified subdomains were used to immunize rats in duplicate with 50 �g\nof antigen emulsified with an equal volume of the adjuvant TiterMax gold\n(Sigma-Aldrich) in a 100-�l final volume. All injections were subcutane-\nous. Two boosters of the same dose were administered at a 2-week inter-\nval, and final blood samples were collected a week following the adminis-\ntration of the final booster.\n\nAntibody purification. One milliliter of rat antiserum raised against\nrecombinant PvDBPII, SD1�2, SD2, SD3, SD3�, or SD2�3 was affinity\npurified by passage over a column prepared by coupling 5 mg of PvDBPII\n(SalI) to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare). Af-\nter the column was washed three times with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,\ncontaining 0.5 M NaCl, the bound antibody was eluted with 0.1 M glycine,\npH 2.4. One-milliliter fractions were collected in tubes containing 30 �l of\n3 M Tris-HCl at pH 8.8 and 20 �l of 5 M NaCl to neutralize the eluate. The\nfractions containing Abs, as measured by optical density at 280 nm, were\npooled and concentrated by Amicon Ultra-15 with a 30,000 MWCO and\nstored at �20°C.\n\nAssays of PvDBPII binding to erythrocytes. PvDBPII binding to red\nblood cells (RBCs) was assessed using a flow cytometry-based assay (16,\n35) and a conventional erythrocyte-binding assay where antigen binding\nwas determined by a Western blotting approach (33). For the flow cytom-\netry assay, finger prick blood was collected (�100 �l) directly into 0.5 ml\nof phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed twice in PBS using a mi-\ncrocentrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 1 min. Following the final wash, 10 �l of\npacked RBCs was resuspended in 40 �l of PBS (1:5 dilution). One micro-\nliter of the 1:5-diluted RBCs was further diluted into 100 �l PBS–1%\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) to yield a total of �106 erythrocytes. Re-\ncombinant PvDBPII (0.2 �g total) was added to the 100-�l erythrocyte\nsuspension, which was incubated for 2 h at RT or overnight at 4°C. Pro-\nduction of recombinant PvDBPII and the different variants was per-\nformed as described previously (16). Following binding to PvDBPII, each\nsample was washed three times with PBS–1% BSA and incubated (1 h in\nthe dark at 4°C) with rabbit anti-PvDBPII (1:8,000; a concentration that\nhad no inhibitory effect on PvDBPII binding to erythrocytes [personal\nobservation]), washed, and then incubated with a phycoerythrin-conju-\ngated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).\nThe amount of antibody was titrated to obtain the optimal signal with\neach lot of antibody (dilutions ranging from 1:5 to 1:50). LSRII-based\n(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) flow cytometry evaluated 50,000\nerythrocytes (using a 488-nm laser). Relative binding was determined by\nmultiplying the mean fluorescence index by the percentage of erythro-\ncytes bound. Binding inhibition was performed by adding polyclonal Abs\nor MAbs at the specified concentrations for 30 min at 37°C with recom-\nbinant PvDBPII prior to the addition of RBCs. For most monoclonal and\npolyclonal sera, blocking of binding occurred almost immediately when\nthey were added to erythrocytes; however, a few MAbs showed slower\nblocking kinetics (e.g., MAbs 2D10 and 2H2 required 15 to 30 min of\npreincubation to achieve maximal blocking activity [data not shown]).\nTherefore, all of the Abs were preincubated with PvDBPII for 30 min prior\nto addition to RBCs.\n\nFor the conventional erythrocyte-binding assay, 1 ml heparinized pe-\nripheral venous blood was washed three times with RPMI medium at RT\nby centrifugation for 5 min at 1,200 rpm and 33% hematocrit was pre-\npared by adding 1 ml of RPMI medium to 0.5 ml of packed RBC pellet.\nDuffy-negative individuals were used as controls. To measure subdomain\nbinding, 10 �g of purified protein in a final volume of 400 �l of RPMI\n\nMechanisms of P. vivax DBPII Binding to Duffy\n\nAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2921\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nmedium containing 60 �l of fetal bovine serum was incubated at RT for 15\nmin, and then both of the suspensions (Duffy positive and Duffy negative)\nwere added separately and the mixtures were incubated at RT on a rocking\nplatform for 1 h to allow binding. After incubation, the suspensions were\nlayered on 600 �l of dibutyl phthalate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and\ncentrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The supernatant was carefully aspi-\nrated and discarded (or saved for protein analysis), keeping the RBC pellet\nintact and making sure that there was no residual unbound protein or oil\ndroplets left. Twenty microliters of 1.5 M NaCl was added to 100 �l of\npacked RBCs to elute the bound protein. Tubes were kept at RT for 1 min\nand centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to collect the supernatant con-\ntaining the eluted protein (�40 �l). The supernatants were subjected to\n12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using the anti-PvDB-\nPII or anti-His MAb.\n\nPhagemid expression system. Preparation of phagemids was adapted\nfrom previously described protocols for the expression of other malarial\nantigens (14). Briefly, the portions of the genes encoding the five PvDBPII\nsubdomain constructs (SD1, SD1�2, SD1�2�3, SD2�3, and SD3) were\ncloned into the phagemid pHEN-H6 via PstI and NotI for display on the\nsurface of an M13 bacteriophage. After purification, the ligation products\nwere used to transform electrocompetent E. coli TG1 and then cultured\novernight on 2� yeast extract-tryptone (YT) agar containing 50 �g ml�1\n\nampicillin. The resulting colonies were screened by PCR for the presence\nof an insert of the correct size. These PCR products were sequenced to\nconfirm correct sequence integrity, orientation, and frame. TG1 clones\ncontaining the pHENH6/DBPII subdomains were grown to an optical\ndensity of 2.0 in 10 ml of 2� YT broth with 50 mg ml�1 ampicillin.\nM13K07 helper phage (1 � 1012 PFU) was added and allowed to infect the\ncells, and then 10 ml of the culture was added to 200 ml of broth contain-\ning 70 �g ml�1 kanamycin and 50 �g ml�1 ampicillin and incubated at\n37°C for 16 h with shaking to allow phage production. The constructs\nwere each expressed as chimeras, fused with the pIII minor coat protein of\nthe phage. As with other coat proteins, pIII is translocated to, folded, and\npackaged in the gel-like, oxidizing environment of the bacterial\nperiplasm. Following packaging, the nonlytic phage particles are secreted\nfrom the bacteria into the culture supernatant. The phage particles were\npurified by centrifugation at 8,000 � g for 15 min to pellet the bacteria,\nand 50 ml 5� polyethylene glycol-NaCl solution was added to the super-\nnatant containing the phage. The phage-polyethylene glycol was incu-\nbated on ice for 4 h to allow the phage to precipitate. Following phage\nprecipitation, the preparation was centrifuged at 8,000 � g for 15 min in\norder to pellet the phage. The supernatant was discarded, and the phage\nwas resuspended in 1 ml PBS and stored at �70°C. Phage clones were\nnormalized for insert concentrations using the c-Myc epitope tag imme-\ndiately downstream from the NotI site in the pHENH6 vector. An en-\nzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was performed using MAb\n9E10 (anti-Myc) on serial dilutions of individual phage preparations dis-\nplaying the various PvDBPII subdomains to be analyzed. The phage prep-\narations were then diluted such that they all produced similar titration\ncurves when the ELISA was repeated with those dilutions. At that point,\nthe preparations all possessed similar levels of Myc epitope tag and there-\nfore equivalent levels of the respective PvDBPII subdomains.\n\nComputer modeling of PvDBPII. The protein models were created by\nhomology model building based upon the crystal structure of P. knowlesi\n(Protein Data Bank [PDB] code 2C6J) (34) by using SWISSMODEL, re-\nfined with CNS, and displayed with program O (20). The programs\nMOLSCRIPT and Raster3D were used to display the models in ribbon\ndiagrams with selected side chains in ball-and-stick representations.\n\nRESULTS\nPvDBPII subdomain structure. PvDBPII is a cysteine-rich region\nthat lies in the DBP extracellular domain and is responsible for the\nbinding of Fy on host erythrocytes (Fig. 1A). A homology-built\nmodel of PvDBPII (Fig. 1B) based on a recent crystal structure of\nthe P. knowlesi DBP� domain with 71% sequence identity to\n\nPvDBPII (34). There are 12 conserved cysteine residues that are all\npredicted to be involved in intradomain disulfide bridges that can\nbe used to divide the DBL domain into three subdomains. SD1,\nSD2, and SD3 have two, one, and three disulfide bonds, respec-\ntively, and are composed of 12 alpha helices. The three disulfide\nbridges in SD3 appear to stabilize the two long helical “towers.”\nAlso shown are the 14 common polymorphic amino acid residues\n(13), 12 of which are expressed on the surface of the molecule.\nNotable is the polymorphic residue at position 437, which is only\npartially surface exposed near the junction of SD2 and SD3. None\nof the polymorphic residues examined occur within SD1, 11 occur\nin SD2, and 3 occur in SD3.\n\nFunctional analysis of PvDBPII subdomains. Previous stud-\nies of PkDBPII have suggested that the entire DBL domain may\nnot be required for receptor recognition, but PvDBPII may be\ndifferent (28). To examine the functional roles of each PvDBPII\nsubdomain and their combinations in binding to their receptor,\nwe generated several recombinant molecules corresponding to the\ndifferent subdomains. These molecules were cloned from the par-\nent plasmid PvDBPII (SalI), expressed, purified, and refolded to a\n\nFIG 1 The DBL ligand domain (region II) is the part of the DBP extracellular\ndomain that binds to the erythrocyte receptor. Region II is divided into three\nsubdomains (A). SD1 is composed of residues Asn257 to Leu299 and has two\nintrasubdomain disulfides, Cys263-Cys292 and Cys276-Cys283. SD2 is com-\nposed of residues Tyr317 to Glu432 and has one intrasubdomain disulfide,\nCys346-Cys423. SD3 is composed of residues Pro433 to Ser554 and has three\nintrasubdomain disulfides, Cys461-Cys478, Cys473-Cys553, and Cys482-\nCys551. (B) Homology-built models of PvDBPII based on the PkDBP� crystal\nstructure (PDB code 2C6J) (12). The model designated PvDBPII shows 11 of\nthe 14 polymorphic residues (residues 385, 386, and 417 are hidden in this\nview). N and C are the two termini of the molecule. Also indicated are sub-\ndomains. Disulfide bridges are indicated by thick black bonds between yellow\nspheres (sulfur atoms). Of note, the amino acid numbering system used for\nPvDBPII is based on our previous studies and differs from that of the published\nPvDBPII crystal structure (5). Subtraction of 46 from the amino acid residue\nnumbering in the present report will produce numbering that corresponds to\nthat of Batchelor et al. (5).\n\nSiddiqui et al.\n\n2922 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nhomogeneity identical to that of full-length PvDBPII. All of the\nproteins migrated to their approximate molecular sizes, including\ntheir poly-HIS tags and linkers (PvDBPII, �42 kDa; SD2�3, �32\nkDa; SD2, �14 kDa; SD3, �18 kDa; SD3�, �20 kDa; SD1�2,\n�22 kDa), on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2A) and were recognized by rabbit\npolyclonal sera generated to full-length PvDBPII (Fig. 2B).\n\nPvDBPII subdomains show differential binding to RBCs.\nThe ability of PvDBPII subdomains to bind the Fy antigen on the\nsurface of erythrocytes was assessed by flow cytometry (Fig. 3A)\nand the conventional erythrocyte-binding assay (Fig. 3B). We\nhave recently shown that PvDBPII binds Duffy-positive erythro-\ncytes expressing the Fyb phenotype (a single amino acid substitu-\ntion that is the major Fy polymorphism within the PvDBPII bind-\ning motif) better than Fya (21). Therefore, all of the binding\nexperiments were performed with erythrocytes expressing Fyb. All\nconstructs failed to bind Duffy-negative cells (Fig. 3A, open cir-\ncles). We observed a consistent pattern in which constructs con-\ntaining SD3 bound better than constructs with only SD2, although\nnone of the constructs bound as well as full-length PvDBPII. Most\nsurprisingly, SD3�, which contains SD3 plus 24 aa of SD2, bound\nFy� erythrocytes better than did SD2�3, which contains all of\nSD2. At least in the recombinant constructs, SD3� may present a\nmore accessible, conformationally correct structure for erythro-\ncyte binding than recombinant SD2�3.\n\nAbs to SD3-containing proteins block PvDBPII-erythrocyte\nbinding. We evaluated affinity-purified polyclonal Abs directed\nto PvDBPII and the various subdomains for their ability to func-\ntionally block the binding of PvDBPII to erythrocytes (Fig. 4).\nAffinity-purified rat Abs to PvDBPII and the different constructs\nhad similar ELISA endpoint titers (defined as the concentration of\nAb which gives an optical density 2-fold higher than that of pre-\nimmune serum). The endpoint titers were 260 pg/ml for SD2�3,\n260 pg/ml for full-length PvDBPII, 380 pg/ml for SD1�2, 380\npg/ml for SD3�, 420 pg/ml for SD3, and 460 pg/ml for SD2. The\nbinding of PvDBPII (SalI variant) (26) was blocked best by Abs\ndirected to full-length PvDBPII (Fig. 4A), followed by Abs to\nSD3�, SD2�3, and SD3. Comparatively little blocking activity\nwas observed with Abs raised to SD1�2 and SD2 (Fig. 4A). Of\nnote, inhibitory Abs (anti-SD3 and anti SD3�) were affinity pu-\n\nrified against full-length PvDBPII and thus likely recognize\nepitopes on the surface of total PvDBPII.\n\nWe then wanted to examine how blocking Abs generated to the\ndifferent constructs inhibited binding to other common and nat-\nurally occurring PvDBPII variants. We selected three haplotypes\n\nFIG 2 (A) Coomassie-stained purified recombinant PvDBPII and the different subdomain constructs.

These PvDBPII\nhaplotypes are common in populations in Papua New Guinea in\nwhich P. vivax infection is endemic and vary from the SalI variant\n(the likely basis for a vaccine) by 5 aa (O variant), 8 aa (AH vari-\nant), and 11 aa (P variant). Blocking Abs raised to full-length\nPvDBPII (SalI) inhibited the binding of the homologous PvDBPII\nvariant SalI better than that of heterologous haplotypes AH, O,\nand P (Fig. 4B). In contrast, Abs generated to SD3� equally in-\nhibited the binding of the AH and O variants but showed a slight\nreduction in inhibition for variant P (Fig. 4C). Affinity-purified\nAbs to SD3 (SalI variant) also show blocking activity against ho-\nmologous SalI PvDBPII (46% \t 6% inhibition) similar to that\nagainst heterologous AH (39% \t 5% inhibition), O (44% \t 5%\ninhibition), and P (41% \t 7% inhibition). Similarly, affinity-pu-\nrified Abs to SD2�3 (SalI variant) demonstrated blocking activity\nagainst homologous SalI PvDBPII (63% \t 5% inhibition) similar\nto that against heterologous AH (60% \t 7% inhibition), O\n(58% \t 6% inhibition), and P (52% \t 9% inhibition). This sug-\ngests that BIAbs directed to constructs containing SD3 can be\nstrain transcending. Of note, the blocking activity of serum raised\nto SD3� that was not affinity purified was similar to that of affin-\nity-purified Abs, with an overall trend toward higher blocking\nactivity against both heterologous and homologous PvDBPII vari-\nants (percent inhibition: SalI, 80% \t 7%; AH, 76% \t 9%; O,\n78% \t 5%; P, 71% \t 11%). Similar trends were observed with\nnon-affinity-purified blocking Abs induced by SD3 and SD2�3\n(data not shown).\n\nMAbs that block the binding of PvDBPII target SD3. A panel\nof MAbs produced in response to two variants of DBPII was re-\ncently characterized (26). There were eight hybridoma clones\nfrom PvDBPII variant C (2A6, 3A4, 2C6, 3C9, 1D2, 2D10, 2F12,\nand 2H2) and one from PvDBPII-SalI (3D10) that secreted spe-\ncific IgG MAbs. Secreted MAbs were purified by protein G affinity\nchromatography. The ELISA endpoint titers of the MAbs at 17\nng/ml to variant SalI of PvDBPII were similar, with the exception\n\nof 3D10 and 1D2, which were 2 and 167 ng/ml, respectively. Five\nof the nine MAbs demonstrated significant blocking of PvDBPII\n(SalI) binding to erythrocytes, whereas four did not (Fig. 5A). To\ndetermine which regions of PvDBPII are recognized by the MAbs,\nwe examined their reactivities to the different subdomain con-\nstructs (Fig. 5B). Five of the nine MAbs tested recognized only\nconstructs containing SD3, suggesting that they recognize\nepitopes contained within SD3. In contrast MAb 3D10 most\nstrongly recognized the construct containing SD1 and MAb 1D2\nprimarily recognized constructs containing SD2, suggesting that\nthese MAbs contain epitopes that include SD1 and SD2, respec-\ntively. Importantly, MAbs that block the binding of PvDBPII to\nerythrocytes (2C6, 3C9, 2D10, 2H2, and 2F12) recognized only\nproducts containing SD3. This demonstrates that neutralizing\nepitopes also occur within SD3 and that these more conserved\nepitopes could form the basis of a strain-transcending vaccine.\n\nTo confirm the binding domain targeted by the MAbs, we gen-\nerated five PvDBPII subdomain constructs (SD1, SD1�2,\nSD1�2�3, SD2�3, and SD3) by cloning the genes encoding the\nvarious subdomains of PvDBPII into phagemid pHEN-H6 for\ndisplay on the surface of an M13 bacteriophage. The constructs\nwere each expressed as chimeras and fused with the pIII minor\ncoat protein of the phage, and the concentrations were normalized\n(Fig. 6A). None of the PvDBPII constructs reacted with IgG con-\ntrol MAb 1F9 at the highest concentration of phage used in the\nsame ELISA. Eight of the nine MAbs tested bound well to the three\nconstructs possessing SD3 (Fig. 6B) and bound poorly to other\nconstructs. The MAbs that blocked the binding of PvDBPII to\nerythrocytes (2C6, 3C9, 2D10, and 2H2) again only recognized\nconstructs containing SD3. This confirmed that epitopes for these\nMAbs consist mainly of sequences contained within SD3. In con-\ntrast, MAb 3D10 again bound well to constructs containing SD1,\nconfirming our previous results. Interestingly, nonblocking MAbs\n3A4 and 2A6 failed to recognize E. coli-expressed and refolded\nconstructs (Fig. 5) yet recognized similar constructs generated us-\n\nFIG 4 Inhibition by Abs of the erythrocyte binding of various constructs of PvDBPII.

Each circle represents the mean inhibition (tested in duplicate) of a single erythrocyte donor. Inhibition of binding to\nthe different variants was tested with erythrocytes from the same donor. Statistical testing was done with Student’s t test. Affinity-purified Abs to the\nfull-length construct were used at 2 �g/ml, and those to the other constructs were used at 5 �g/ml. These concentrations represent the optimal blocking\nactivities for all of the sera tested by titration curves.\n\nSiddiqui et al.\n\n2924 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\ning the phagemid system (Fig. 6), suggesting that these two expres-\nsion systems do not generate identically configured proteins. In\nconclusion, these results show that binding-inhibitory MAbs rec-\nognize residues in SD3.\n\nBlocking activity of anti-SD3 MAbs against PvDBPII can be\nstrain transcending. We next examined whether the specific\nMAbs that block PvDBPII binding and target epitopes on SD3 are\nstrain specific or strain transcending. Of the four MAbs with the\ngreatest blocking activity, three showed blocking activity similar\nto that of the three PvDBPII variants examined, whereas MAb 2C6\nshowed comparatively poor blocking of the AH variant (Fig. 7).\nThe SalI variant differed from the AH and O variants at three and\ntwo residues, respectively, in the SD3� construct, one at position\nN417K (in SD2 but included in SD3�), two in SD3 at positions\nW437R and I503K (with AH), and one in SD3 at position S447K\n(with O). Therefore, MAb 2C6 likely recognizes an epitope that\ncontains one or more of these polymorphisms. This suggests that\nmost of the binding-inhibitory MAbs tested recognize epitopes\nthat are strain transcendent.\n\nThe lysines of PvDBPII are required for binding to erythro-\ncytes. Based on a previous report by Singh et al. (32) that the\nminimum domain for the binding of DBL3x to CSA involves\n\nlysine-rich regions of SD3, we chemically modified lysines for\nboth PvDBPII and SD3 by reductive methylation of free amino\ngroups. This modification of PvDBPII reduced its binding to\nerythrocytes by 60%, compared with that of the unmethylated\nprotein, and reduced that of SD3 by 85% (Fig. 8). Methylation of\nlysines does not change the charge on the lysine side chains but\nincreases both hydrophobicity and steric bulk and can affect pro-\ntein-protein interactions if the lysines are on an interacting surface\n(38). This demonstrates that the lysines present on SD3 are crucial\nfor binding to erythrocytes.\n\nHuman sera that contain highly BIAbs to PvDBPII also block\nbinding of SD3 to Fy. To determine whether previously charac-\nterized naturally acquired BIAbs to PvDBPII (22) also target SD3,\nblocking experiments were performed in parallel with PvDBPII\nand SD3 (Fig. 9). Overall BIAbs showed greater blocking of\nPvDBPII than of SD3 binding to Fy; however, there was a good\ncorrelation between the blocking activities of the two construc-\ntions. Notably, in some samples, the blocking activity directed\nagainst SD3 was comparable to that against full-length PvDBPII,\nsuggesting that the residues in PvDBPII targeted by naturally ac-\nquired BIAbs likely occur within SD3.\n\nFIG 5 Binding-inhibitory anti-PvDBPII MAbs target epitopes on PvDBPII SD3. (A) MAbs 2C6, 2D10, 2F12, 2H2, and 3C9 block the binding of recombinant\nPvDBPII to erythrocytes in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas MAbs 3D10, 1D2, and 3A4 do not. (B) The five blocking MAbs recognized constructs containing\nSD3 but not recombinant constructs that contain SD1�2 or SD2. Two of the nonblocking MAbs, 3D10 and 1D2, recognize constructs containing full-length SD2\n(1D2) or SD1 (3D10), indicating that part or all of the epitopes recognized by the MAbs are contained in these subdomains. MAbs 3A4 and 2A6 show poor\nreactivity to any of the recombinant subdomain constructs. Percent inhibition was measured as described in Materials and Methods.

Indeed,\nPvDBPII demonstrates the hallmarks of immune evasion proper-\nties of other microbial ligands under strong immune selection\nwhere the most polymorphic region of PvDBPII lies within central\nSD2, which also contains the residues of the ligand domain most\ncritical for binding to Fy (Fig. 1) (5, 37, 41). Indeed, the failure of\ntwo leading P. falciparum blood stage vaccine candidates to pro-\ntect against clinical malaria can be attributed to the limited strain-\nspecific response elicited by vaccination with a monovalent vac-\ncine (15). Several basic approaches have been used to tackle this\nproblem. The first is to immunize with multiple common variants\nof the molecule, as has been done with pneumococcal vaccine (3,\n40) and in the clinical testing of some other blood stage P. falcip-\narum vaccine candidates (27). Therefore, multiple PvDBPII alleles\nmay be required in a vaccine for broader coverage. This is expen-\nsive, it is difficult to produce a consistent formulation, and this\napproach may lead to selection for uncommon variants. Another\n\nalternative, although more challenging, approach is to focus the\nimmune response on conserved epitope targets of strain-tran-\nscending neutralizing immunity. One way to achieve this goal is to\neliminate the immunodominant variant epitopes responsible for\nstrain-specific responses (25). Another way to accomplish this\ngoal has been to identify a minimal motif within the vaccine can-\ndidate that is conserved yet can elicit protective Abs that function-\nally neutralize the native intact target antigen. In this study, we\nshow that a reduced portion of the PvDBPII ligand domain,\nSD3�, represents such a potential minimal motif capable of elic-\niting a broadly neutralizing binding-inhibitory antibody response\nagainst diverse alleles of PvDBPII. These observations are based\non an in vitro binding assay, and it is unknown whether these\ninhibitory epitopes are accessible in the native protein on the par-\nasite surface. This will require confirmation in short-term P. vivax\ninvasion assays (16, 29).\n\nHere we also show that the third discrete subdomain of PvDBPII,\nSD3, is also important for PvDBPII engagement of Fy. Naturally\nacquired BIAbs are directed to SD3, and artificially induced Abs to\nSD3 block the binding of full-length PvDBPII. We also show that\nbinding-inhibitory MAbs raised to full-length PvDBPII target\nepitopes in SD3. Thus, SD3 plays an important role in binding to\nFy and can elicit BIAbs. SD3 is more conserved than highly poly-\nmorphic SD2 and could constitute a strain-transcending subunit\n\nFIG 9 Testing of the relationship of the binding-inhibitory activity of sera\nfrom 18 Papua New Guinean subjects previously exposed to P. vivax directed\nto recombinant PvDBPII and SD3 binding to Duffy� erythrocytes by flow\ncytometry.

The correlation coefficient (r2) determined by linear regression anal-\nysis is 0.77 (P \n 0.0001).\n\nFIG 7 MAbs that block binding of PvDBPII to human erythrocytes and recognize epitopes on SD3 are generally strain transcending.

It is important to note that in prior studies in\nwhich different fragments of PvDBPII were expressed on the sur-\nface of COS7 cells, constructs that contained primarily SD3 failed\nto bind erythrocytes (28, 30). This discrepancy from our findings\nmay arise from the different expression systems used and the dif-\nferent PvDBPII fragments expressed. In the present study, con-\nstructs were based on subdomains determined by the closely ho-\nmologous crystal structure of P. knowlesi (34), whereas the earlier\nconstructs (28, 30) were based on locations of conserved cysteine\nresidues and included sequences from P. knowlesi.\n\nSupporting the possibility that SD3 may contribute to a strain-\ntranscending vaccine is the finding that rats immunized with re-\ncombinant proteins that contained SD3 only or SD3 plus a 24-aa\nsequence of SD2 (SD3�) generated strain-transcending BIAbs. In\ncontrast, full-length PvDBPII generated higher titers of BIAbs but\nthe blocking activity was partially strain specific. It is possible that\nthe expression of the subdomain constructs unmasked epitopes\nnear critical binding residues, which were otherwise hidden in the\nfull-length molecule. The drawback is loss of immunogenicity.\nThis may occur because full-length PvDBPII contains strong B-\nand T-cell epitopes primarily in SD2 and SD1, respectively (41).\nThus, future studies may aim to construct a recombinant mole-\ncule based predominantly on SD3 that includes the strong T-cell\nepitopes that enhance its immunogenicity.\n\nThe poor binding of constructs containing SD1�2 and SD2 to\nhuman erythrocytes, compared to that of those that contain SD3,\nsuggests the importance of the SD3 subdomain in presenting\nPvDBPII to Fy. It is also possible that the expression and refolding\nof SD1�2 and SD2 does not acquire the correct conformation\nnecessary for optimal binding to Fy. Constructs that contained\nSD2 but not SD3 elicited poor blocking Abs in rats, suggesting that\nSD2 may be poorly immunogenic or that functional epitopes are\ncryptic or lack a fixed conformation. These findings are consistent\nwith three-dimensional structure studies of the DBL domains\nshowing that intersubdomain hinge-like regions lack rigid struc-\ntural properties even though they contain residues important for\nerythrocyte binding (5, 19, 32, 34). This suggests that contact-\ninduced conformational changes may occur as PvDBPII engages\nFy. It would not be unexpected that such a conformational in-\nduced fit led to the exposure of a cryptic recognition site for a\nsecond receptor.\n\nThe results of our present study have led us to modify our\ninterpretation of the recently published crystal structure, which\nshows that PvDBPII forms a dimer upon receptor engagement\n(5). According to this model, the dimer forms a binding groove for\nFy. The cocrystallization was performed with ammonium phos-\nphate or sodium selenate as the nidus for dimerization, without\nthe N-terminal region of Fy that contains the binding domain for\nPvDBPII (5). The purpose of using selenate was structure deter-\nmination by anomalous dispersion. Phosphate and selenate are\nstructurally similar to sulfate. A previous study, using a protein\nconstruct comprising the N-terminal 60 aa of Fy linked to human\nIgG heavy chain, indicated that sulfation of Tyr41 in the N-termi-\nnal portion of Fy was critical for binding to PvDBPII (8). Whether\nthis chimeric construct fully represents native Fy on erythrocytes\nis uncertain. Epitopes of naturally acquired Abs (9) map to the\ndimer interface and the Fy-binding groove (5), suggesting that the\nmechanism of action is interference with dimerization. This dimer\ninterface and Fy binding groove is different from the predicted\nbinding site previously reported by Singh et al. (34). SD3 is located\n\naway from the dimer interface. The data presented in this study\ndemonstrate that anti-SD3 Abs inhibit DBPII-Fy binding and the\ninhibitory mouse MAbs map to SD3. The epitope specificity of\nmouse MAbs was different from that of Abs generated by natural\ninfection. This brings into question the mechanisms of action of\nanti-DBP neutralizing Abs. Cocrystallization of DBPII along with\ninhibitory Abs will help to explain better how inhibitory Abs work.\n\nOther studies of P. falciparum binding ligands with high ho-\nmology to PvDBPII show an essential role for SD3 in binding to\ntheir receptors (32). For example, the P. falciparum DBL3x do-\nmain of VAR2CSA (a member of the PfEMP1 family) has a struc-\nture similar to that of PvDBPII, with three similar subdomains\nthat bind CSA. Cocrystallization of the DBL3x domain with CSA\nshows that SD3 is essential for binding (31). Important for this\nbinding are clusters of positively charged residues (arginine and\nlysine) on SD2 and especially SD3. SD2 and SD3 of PvDBPII (pI\n9.4) both contain clusters of 15 lysine and arginine residues similar\nto the orthologous subdomains for the DBL3x domain that may\ncontribute to binding to the overall negatively charged N-terminal\nregion of Fy (pI 3.6, Fig. 1). This possibility is supported by the\nfinding that methylation of lysines on PvDBPII, which impairs\nhydrogen bonding capacity and increases steric bulk, decreased its\nbinding to Fy by 60% (Fig. 8). This is most pronounced for SD3.\nThus, we propose that SD3 participates in an initial low-affinity,\nelectrostatic-charge-mediated binding to Fy, followed by a higher-\naffinity interaction, possibly by the formation of a dimer that cre-\nates a single channel enveloping the N-terminal region of Fy, as\nsuggested by the recent crystal structure of PvDBPII (5).\n\nIn conclusion, SD3 of PvDBPII plays a critical role in binding\nto the Duffy antigen on erythrocytes and it can elicit BIAbs in both\nrats and humans. The importance of this observation is that SD3 is\nrelatively conserved compared to other subdomains of PvDBPII,\nwhich are highly polymorphic and in themselves poorly immuno-\ngenic. This suggests that a subunit vaccine construct that predom-\ninantly includes SD3 linked to strong universal T-cell epitopes\nmay be considered as an alternative to PvDBPII to produce strain-\ntranscending immunity.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported, in part, by the Veterans Affairs Research Service\nand NIH grants R01 A1064478 and AI33656.\n\nWe appreciate the help of Jane Haas in constructing the models of\nPvDBPII.
