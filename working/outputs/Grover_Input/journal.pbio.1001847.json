Upon light exposure, activated rhodopsin 1 (Rh1) in\nDrosophila PRs is internalized via endocytosis and degraded in lysosomes. Whether internalized Rh1 can be recycled is\nunknown. Here, we show that the retromer complex is expressed in PRs where it is required for recycling endocytosed Rh1\nupon light stimulation. In the absence of subunits of the retromer, Rh1 is processed in the endolysosomal pathway, leading\nto a dramatic increase in late endosomes, lysosomes, and light-dependent PR degeneration. Reducing Rh1 endocytosis or\nRh1 levels in retromer mutants alleviates PR degeneration. In addition, increasing retromer abundance suppresses\ndegenerative phenotypes of mutations that affect the endolysosomal system. Finally, expressing human Vps26 suppresses\nPR degeneration in Vps26 mutant PRs. We propose that the retromer plays a conserved role in recycling rhodopsins to\nmaintain PR function and integrity.\n\nCitation: Wang S, Tan KL, Agosto MA, Xiong B, Yamamoto S, et al.

Because vision is not required for animal survival, previous\n\nstudies in Drosophila mostly focused on viable mutations that\n\nspecifically impair PR function [1]. However, it is likely that\n\nnumerous additional players encoded by essential genes have\n\nremained unidentified. We performed an eye-specific mosaic\n\ngenetic screen [6] and found that loss of subunits of the retromer\n\ncauses light-induced PR degeneration.\n\nThe retromer, a hetero-multimeric protein complex, re-\n\ntrieves specific proteins from endosomes, thereby preventing\n\nthe degradation of these proteins in lysosomes [7–9]. The\n\nretromer is composed of Vps26, Vps29, Vps35, and certain\n\nsorting nexins (Snx) (Figure 1A, [7–9]). Most subunits are\n\nevolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7–9]). Mutations in some\n\nsubunits (Vps35 or Snx3) of the retromer have been shown to\n\ndecrease the abundance of Wntless (Wls) and impair the\n\nsecretion of Wingless (Wg), a ligand of the Wnt signaling\n\npathway [10–14]. Wls is a transmembrane protein that binds\n\nto Wg and is required for Wg secretion [15,16]. Impaired\n\nretromer function leads to excessive degradation of Wls in\n\nlysosomes, severely reducing Wg secretion and signaling [10–\n\n14]. The retromer has also been shown to maintain the levels\n\nof Crumbs, a transmembrane protein required for maintaining\n\nthe apicobasal polarity in some tissues [17,18]. More recently,\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001847&domain=pdf\n\n\nmutations in human VPS35 have been shown to cause a\n\ndominant inherited form of Parkinson’s disease (PD) [19,20].\n\nHowever, the retromer has not been implicated in neurons of\n\nthe visual system in flies or vertebrates.\n\nThe Drosophila compound eye comprises ,800 hexagonal units\nnamed ommatidia [1,2,21,22]. Each ommatidium contains eight\n\nPRs (R1–R8) that express rhodopsin proteins [1,2,21–23].\n\nRhodopsin 1 (Rh1) is the major rhodopsin that is primarily\n\nexpressed in R1–R6 [1,2,21,22]. It is synthesized and folded in the\n\nendoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to rhabdomeres, the\n\nstacked membranous structures in PRs, via the secretory pathway\n\n[1,2,21]. The proper transport of Rh1 from ER to rhabdomeres\n\nrequires molecular chaperones [24–30] and Rab GTPases [24–\n\n33]. Binding of opsins to chromophores [34–40] as well as protein\n\nglycosylation and deglycosylation [41–44] are essential for Rh1\n\nfolding and maturation. Mutations in genes involved in Rh1\n\nsynthesis, folding, or transport can result in defective PR\n\ndevelopment or PR degeneration [24,25,32,41–43,45–51].\n\nPhototransduction in the PRs relies on the activation of Rh1 by\n\nphotons (Figure S1A, [52]). Active Rh1 (metarhodopsin, M*)\n\nactivates phospholipase C (PLC) [53], which hydrolyzes phospha-\n\ntidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to produce diacylglycerol\n\n(DAG) [54]. DAG or its metabolites can activate Transient\n\nReceptor Potential (TRP) and TRP-like cation channels that lead\n\nto depolarization of the PRs [55–59]. Similar to fly PRs, the\n\nvertebrate intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells\n\n(ipRGCs) use melanopsin (a homolog of fly Rh1) as the light\n\nsensor and requires PLC and TRPC channels for activation [60–\n\n63]. ipRGCs project their axons to specific brain areas to control\n\ncircadian rhythms [64–67] or pupillary light reflex [64,68,69].\n\nTight regulation of Rh1 activity upon light exposure is required\n\nto maintain the integrity of PR cells [1,2]. M* can be converted\n\ninto its inactive form upon exposure to orange light [52]. In\n\naddition, a significant portion of active Rh1 can be endocytosed\n\nand degraded in lysosomes [70–72]. Mutations that abolish Rh1\n\ndeactivation [72–74] or impair the endolysosomal system\n\n[71,75,76] can cause PR degeneration due to Rh1 accumulation.\n\nHowever, it is unknown whether Rh1 can be retrieved from the\n\nendolysosomal compartments and whether impaired Rh1 recy-\n\ncling leads to PR degeneration.\n\nHere, we show that loss of the fly Vps26 or Vps35 causes early-\n\nonset PR degeneration. We show that retromer subunits are\n\nexpressed in PRs in flies and melanopsin-expressing ipRGCs in the\n\nmouse retina. In fly mutant PRs, the numbers of late endosomes\n\nand lysosomes are significantly elevated. The PR degenerative\n\nphenotypes are dependent on exposure to light and the presence of\n\nRh1. Our data indicate that the fly retromer recycles Rh1,\n\npreventing Rh1 retention in the PR cell bodies and shunting Rh1\n\nfrom being degraded in lysosomes, thereby promoting Rh1\n\nredelivery to rhabdomeres. In summary, the retromer recycles\n\nRh1, prevents an overload of the endolysosomal pathway, and\n\nsalvages a substantial fraction of Rh1 from degradation in flies. It\n\nmay also play a similar role in ipRGCs in the retina of vertebrates.\n\nResults\n\nVps26 Mutant PRs Display Light-Dependent PR\nDegeneration\n\nTo identify mutations that cause PR degeneration, we\n\ngenerated large mutant clones of essential genes in the eyes\n\n(Figure S1B) and screened for mutants that exhibit an age-\n\ndependent decrease in amplitude of electroretinogram (ERG)\n\nrecordings [6,77,78]. Mutations in a complementation group\n\nXE52, which we later mapped to Vps26 (Figure S2A), result in a\n\nprogressive loss of ERG amplitudes compared to the control\n\n(Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). Reduced amplitudes in ERG\n\nrecordings may result from aberrant PR development, a defective\n\nphototransduction pathway, or PR degeneration [1]. To address if\n\nthe ERG defects are due to aberrant PR development, we\n\nexamined the light response of dark-reared control (y w FRT19A\niso\n\n,\n\nthe isogenized y w FRT19A flies, or iso; see Materials and Methods)\n\nand two Vps26 mutant alleles. Upon rearing the flies in the dark,\n\nthe Vps26\n1\n\nand Vps26\n2\n\nmutants exhibit nearly normal ERG\n\nresponses and the ERG amplitude and on- and off-transients in\n\nVps26\n1\n\nmutant PRs are slightly reduced when compared to control\n\n(Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). In addition, imaging of newly\n\neclosed flies (see definition in Materials and Methods) revealed that\n\nthe overall morphology of ommatidia is similar to control,\n\nalthough loss of a rhabdomere is observed at low frequency in\n\nthe Vps26\n1\n\nmosaic clones (Figure 1D–E and Figure S1D–E). These\n\ndata indicate that mutations in Vps26 do not significantly affect PR\n\ndevelopment, allowing nearly normal ERGs in young flies.\n\nTo assess the impact of the Vps26 mutations in aged flies, we\n\nraised the animals either in a 12-h light/dark cycle (LD, L = 1,800\n\nlux) or in constant darkness (DD) and recorded the ERGs at 0, 2,\n\n4, 10, and 21 d. In LD, both alleles show a loss of on- and off-\n\ntransients, indicating a loss of synaptic transmission. They also\n\nexhibit a reduced depolarization by day 2, and a progressive loss of\n\nthe ERG amplitude with age (Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). At\n\nday 21, the light-induced PR depolarization in Vps26\n1\n\nand Vps26\n2\n\nmutant PRs is almost completely absent (Figure 1B–C and Figure\n\nS1C). Strikingly, 3-wk-old DD-reared Vps26\n1\n\nand Vps26\n2\n\nmutants\n\nexhibit nearly normal ERG responses, similar to newly eclosed\n\nflies (Figure 1B–C and Figure S1C). The PR morphology of\n\nVps26\n1\n\nand Vps26\n2\n\nmutants is severely affected in flies kept in LD\n\nfor 21 d (Figure 1D–E and Figure S1D–E). In addition, we\n\nconstructed an EGFP-tagged genomic rescue construct (Vps26-\n\ngEGFP; see below and Figure S2A) that fully rescues the lethality\n\n(Figure S2B), ERG, and morphological defects of both Vps26\n1\n\nand\n\nVps26\n2\n\nalleles (Vps26\n1\n\nGR in Figure 1B–E; Vps26\n2\n\nGR in Figure 1C\n\nand S1C–E). However, PR morphology is nearly wild-type when\n\nthe flies are raised in DD (Figure 1D–E and Figure S1D–E). In\n\nsummary, PR degeneration in the Vps26 mutant clones is light-\n\ndependent.\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nUpon light exposure, rhodopsins—light-sensing proteins\nin the eye—trigger visual transduction signaling to\nactivate fly photoreceptor cells. After activation, rhodop-\nsins can be internalized from the cell surface into\nendosomes and then degraded in lysosomes. This mech-\nanism prevents constant activation of the visual transduc-\ntion pathway, thereby maintaining the function and\nintegrity of photoreceptor cells. It is not known, however,\nwhether these internalized rhodopsins can be recycled.\nHere, we show that the retromer, an evolutionarily\nconserved protein complex, is required for the recycling\nof rhodopsins. We find that loss of key retromer subunits\n(Vps35 or Vps26) causes rhodopsin mislocalization in the\nphotoreceptors and severe light-induced photoreceptor\ndegeneration. Conversely, gain of retromer subunits can\nalleviate photoreceptor degeneration in some contexts.\nHuman retromer components can stand in for depleted\nfruit fly retromer, suggesting that this complex plays a role\nin recycling light sensors in both vertebrate and inverte-\nbrate photoreceptors.\n\nThe Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847\n\n\n\nMutations in XE52 Map to Vps26\nTo identify the mutations in XE52 complementation group\n\nconsisting of two alleles, we performed duplication, deficiency, and\n\nP[acman] rescue mapping (Yamamoto et al., in preparation),\n\nnarrowing the locus to a 21 kb genomic region (Figure S2A). The\n\nXE52 alleles fail to complement the lethality of P{EP}Vps26\nG2008\n\n(Figures S2A–B, [79]), a transposable element inserted in the 59-\n\nUTR of the Vps26 gene. Sanger sequencing revealed mutations in\n\nconserved amino acid residues in both alleles: a nonsense mutation\n\n(K264*) and a missense mutation (V267D) in Vps26\n1\n\nand Vps26\n2\n,\n\nrespectively (Figure 1F). To test if Vps26 is responsible for both the\n\nlethality and PR degenerative phenotypes in XE52 alleles, we\n\ngenerated the Vps26-gEGFP genomic rescue construct mentioned\n\nabove (Figure S2A) as well as a UAS-Vps26 full-length cDNA\n\nconstruct [80]. Both the genomic rescue and ubiquitously\n\nexpressed cDNA (tub-Gal4.UAS-Vps26) rescue all phenotypes\n\n(Figure 1B–E, Figure S1C–E, Figure S2B, and unpublished data),\n\nconfirming that the phenotypes are caused by loss of Vps26.\n\nVps26 is a subunit of the retromer (Figure 1A, [81,82]).

We generated mutant clones of Vps26\n1\n\nin\n\nwing discs of third instar larvae and observed a failure to secrete\n\nWg in the wing margin cells. Furthermore, we observed\n\nconcomitant loss of Senseless (Sens) expression, a downstream\n\neffector of the Wingless pathway (Figure S2C, [83]). These data\n\nconfirm the loss of retromer function in the Vps26 mutants.\n\nVps26 Is Primarily Localized to Early and Late Endosomes\nThe subunits of the retromer complex have been shown to\n\nprimarily associate with endosomes in vertebrates [7–9]. However,\n\nthe in vivo subcellular localization of the retromer in Drosophila has\n\nnot been documented. We therefore raised a polyclonal antibody\n\nagainst the full-length fly Vps26 protein (Figure S2D–E) and\n\ncostained with antibodies against Avalanche (Avl, fly homolog of\n\nSyntaxin 7, an early endosomal marker, [84]), Rab5 (an early\n\nendosomal marker, [85]), Rab7 (a late endosomal marker, [76]),\n\nProtein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI, an ER marker, [86]), GM130 (a\n\ncis-Golgi marker, [87]), Peanut Agglutinin (PNA, a marker for the\n\ntrans-Golgi network (TGN), [88]), or Rab11 (a TGN or post-Golgi\n\nsecretory vesicle marker, [31]). Vps26 shows substantially greater\n\ncolocalization with Avl, Rab5, and Rab7 than the ER, Golgi, and\n\nsecretory vesicle markers (Figure S2F–G). This distribution is seen\n\nin both wing discs and adult PRs (Figure S2F–G and unpublished\n\ndata), indicating that Vps26 associates preferentially with early and\n\nlate endosomes in different tissues in vivo.\n\nLoss of Vps35 Causes PR Degeneration\nVps35 acts as a scaffolding protein and physically interacts with\n\nVps26 in the retromer (Figure 1A, [81,82,89]). RNAi knockdown\n\nof vps35 has been shown to reduce Vps26 protein levels in\n\nHEK293 cells [13]. Consistent with work in cultured cells, we find\n\nthat mutant clones of the Vps35 null allele (Vps35\nMH20\n\n, [13]) in eye\n\ndiscs cause a nearly complete loss of Vps26 (Figure 2A), showing\n\nthat the presence of Vps35 is required for Vps26 in vivo. Next, we\n\nperformed ERG recordings and bright field imaging on large\n\nmutant clones of Vps35\nMH20\n\nin flies aged for 0, 4, 10, and 21 d and\n\nexamined function and morphology of Vps35\nMH20\n\nmutant PRs. As\n\nshown in Figure 2B–C, the ERG phenotypes of Vps35\nMH20\n\nare\n\nvery similar to those of Vps26 shown in Figure 1. In addition,\n\nmutations in the two genes exhibit very similar morphological\n\ndefects in aged PRs (compare Figure 2D–E with Figure 1D–E and\n\nFigure S1D–E). These results indicate that the retromer is required\n\nto maintain PR function and morphology. Loss of the retromer\n\ntherefore leads to light-dependent PR degeneration.\n\nSorting nexins can be involved in retromer-mediated protein\n\ntrafficking [7–9,90,91]. To test whether these proteins are involved\n\nin the maintenance of PRs, we performed ERGs on Snx1\nd1\n\nand\n\nSnx3\nd1\n\nnull alleles (Figure S3, [10]). Upon keeping the flies for 10 d\n\nin LD, we did not observe a difference in ERG amplitudes of\n\nSnx1\nd1\n\nor Snx3\nd1\n\nmutants (Figure S3A–B), although we observed a\n\npartial loss of the on-transient in Snx3\nd1\n\n(Figure S3A,C). The data\n\nindicate that these sorting nexins are not part of the complex or\n\nplay a minor role. In addition, we tested whether the WASH\n\n(Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome protein and SCAR Homolog) com-\n\nplex, a protein complex that has been shown to be required for the\n\ntransport of several retromer cargos in vertebrate cells and the fly\n\ntracheal tubes [8,90,91], is involved in PR degeneration. As shown\n\nin Figure S4, RNAi-mediated loss of a subunit of the WASH\n\ncomplex, Washout (the single WASH ortholog in Drosophila, [92]),\n\ndoes not affect PR maintenance and function. Hence, the retromer\n\ncan have different compositions in different cells.\n\nLoss of Retromer Subunits Leads to an Expansion of the\nEndolysosomal Compartments in PRs\n\nThe retromer retrieves membrane protein cargos from the\n\nendolysosomal pathway [7–9]. To assess whether endosomes and\n\nlysosomes are affected in the absence of the retromer, we\n\nperformed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and examined\n\nthe ultrastructure of Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs. Vps26\n1\n\nand\n\nVps35\nMH20\n\nflies raised in LD for 4 d show obvious ultrastructural\n\ndefects (Figure 3B,D) in PRs when compared to control\n\n(Figure 3A). These defects include a dramatic increase in late\n\nendosomes (inset 1 in Figure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and yellow\n\narrowheads in Figure S5B,D; [93]) and lysosomes (inset 2 in\n\nFigure 3B,D, Figure 3F, and arrows in Figure S5B–C,E; [94]).\n\nHowever, PRs of the dark-reared Vps26\n1\n\nor Vps35\nMH20\n\nflies\n\n(Figure 3C,E–F and Figure S6B–E) do not show an increased\n\nnumber of late endosomes or lysosomes when compared to control\n\n(Figure 3A,F, Figure S5A, and Figure S6A). These data show that\n\nthe endolysosomal pathway is severely affected in retromer\n\nmutants upon light exposure.\n\nInternalized Rh1 Fails to Be Recycled from the\nEndolysosomal Pathway in Vps26 Mutant PRs\n\nTo address whether the trafficking of endocytosed Rh1 is\n\naffected in the retromer mutants, we assessed Rh1 distribution in\n\nPRs that were exposed to light. Two protocols have been used for\n\nRh1 immunostaining in fly PRs: whole mount preparations [76]\n\nand eye sections [41]. Previously, we showed that the whole mount\n\nprotocol is more sensitive than staining of sections for Rh1 present\n\nin the cell body, while sections are better than whole mount\n\nstaining for assessing Rh1 in rhabdomeres [6]. Here, we slightly\n\nmodified the whole mount protocol to increase Rh1 signals in the\n\nPR cell body by treating the tissues with higher concentrations of\n\nTriton X-100. As shown in Figure S7, Rh1 signals are obviously\n\nenhanced upon increasing Triton X-100 concentration (top\n\npanels) compared to low Triton X-100 treatment (bottom panels).\n\nHere, we use the high Triton X-100 protocol for our immuno-\n\nstaining assays.\n\nAs previously reported [6,76], immunostaining of Rh1 in dark-\n\nreared wild-type control PRs reveals a typical crescent-shaped\n\nstaining pattern at the base of the rhabdomeres, due to the densely\n\nstacked rhabdomeric membranes that do not permit antibody\n\npenetration in whole mount preparations (Figure 4A, top panels).\n\nSimilar to this control, we observed that the distribution\n\n(Figure 4A, top panels) and levels (Figure 5A–B) of Rh1 are not\n\naffected in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants prior to light exposure. These data are\n\nin agreement with the observation that dark-reared Vps26\n1\n\nmutants exhibit nearly normal ERGs and PR morphology\n\n(Figure 1B–E). Upon a 12-h light exposure, Rh1 is internalized\n\nin both control and Vps26\n1\n\nmutant PRs, as shown by the dramatic\n\nincrease in Rh1 levels in the PR cell bodies (Figure 4A, middle\n\npanels). This increase in Rh1 is not due to the changes in levels of\n\nRh1 (unpublished data), but rather because Rh1 becomes\n\nthose in DD at the indicated time points.

In\n\naddition, this light exposure is not pathological as control flies\n\nexhibit normal ERGs and PR morphology (Figure S8). However,\n\nupon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is\n\nrestored to the original levels in control but not in Vps26\n1\n\nPRs\n\n(Figure 4A, bottom panels). Similarly, although less obvious, we\n\nalso observed Rh1 accumulation in Vps26\n1\n\nmutant PRs upon light\n\nexposure in the sectioned eye samples (Figure S9). Hence, the Rh1\n\nsubcellular localization is altered in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants.\n\nTo assess where in the cell body Rh1 accumulates in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants, we transiently exposed the flies to light and monitored\n\nthe subcellular localization of Rh1 using markers. We briefly\n\nexposed the flies to blue light for 20 min followed by 5-min\n\nexposure to orange light (Figure 4B) to acutely induce endocytosis\n\nof a small amount of Rh1. This light condition is not pathological\n\nas the ERG responses and morphology of control PRs are normal\n\n(Figure S8). Upon recovery in the dark for 4 h, Rh1 can be\n\ndetected in very bright punctae that often colocalize with Rab7 or\n\nLamp1::GFP, a marker for lysosomes [95], in Vps26\n1\n\nPRs\n\n(Figure 4B–C), implicating that Rh1 is trapped in the endolyso-\n\nsomal compartments.\n\nRh1 retention in the endolysosomal pathway in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants\n\nupon an acute light exposure may be due to reduced Rh1\n\nrecycling and/or decreased lysosomal degradation. If Rh1\n\nrecycling is decreased, one would expect a reduction in Rh1\n\nlevels in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants compared to controls upon light exposure\n\nas an increased amount of internalized Rh1 will be delivered to\n\nlysosomes for degradation. On the other hand, if Rh1 degradation\n\nin lysosomes is impaired, one would predict that Rh1 abundance is\n\nelevated in Vps26 mutant PRs when compared to controls exposed\n\nto light. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we exposed\n\nthe dark-raised flies to white light (1,800 lux) for 16 h. Prior to this\n\nlight exposure, the Rh1 levels are similar in control and Vps26\n1\n\nmutants (Figure 5A–B), indicating that Rh1 expression is not\n\naffected in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants. Upon a 16-h exposure to white light,\n\nRh1 levels in Vps26\n1\n\nmutant PRs are significantly decreased when\n\ncompared to control (Figure 5A–B). Reduced Rh1 levels in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants upon light exposure do not appear to be due to impaired\n\nRh1 synthesis as the Rh1 levels are restored after 6-h recovery in\n\nthe dark (Figure 5A–B). Moreover, the ERG responses of Vps26\n1\n\nmutants are not affected upon this light exposure (Figure 5C–D).\n\nThe data indicate that, in the absence of Vps26, lysosomes are able\n\nFigure 3.

Dark-\nreared control (iso) or Vps261 mutants were kept in the dark, exposed to whole-spectrum light for 12 h, or exposed to light for 12 h and recovered in\nthe dark for 6 h. Both dark-reared control and Vps261 mutant PRs show a normal Rh1 distribution, which is characterized by the crescent-shaped Rh1\nstaining pattern surrounding rhabdomeres (marked by F-actin) (top panels). The localization of Rh1 in the shape of a crescent around the\nrhabdomeres is due to the dense packing of membranes in rhabdomeres. Upon a 12-h light exposure, both genotypes show increased Rh1 protein\nlevels in PR cell body (middle panels) as some Rh1 is endocytosed. However, upon a 6-h recovery in the dark, the Rh1 signal in the cell body is higher\nin Vps26\n\n1\nthan that in wild-type PRs (bottom panels). Scale bar, 2 mm.

However, chronic light exposure (LD for several\n\ndays) severely affects the endolysosomal system (Figure 3 and\n\nFigure S5) because accumulated Rh1 in endosomes and/or\n\nlysosomes persistently challenges the endolysosomal system [2].\n\nTo examine whether the retromer is recruited to Rh1 punctae\n\nupon endocytosis in the PRs, we performed colocalization studies\n\nof Vps26 and Rh1. In the dark, Rh1 and Vps26 signals do not\n\noverlap (Figure 5E). In contrast, numerous Rh1 punctae colocalize\n\nwith Vps26 in the PR cell body upon transient light exposure\n\n(Figure 5E). These data indicate that endocytosed Rh1 is a cargo\n\nof the retromer.\n\nReducing Endocytosis or Rh1 Levels Suppresses PR\nDegeneration in Vps26 Mutants\n\nIf PR degeneration in retromer mutants is caused by aberrant\n\naccumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal pathway, reducing the\n\namount of endocytosed Rh1 or the abundance of Rh1 itself may\n\nsuppress PR degenerative phenotypes. Dynamin (encoded by the\n\nshi gene) is required for Rh1 endocytosis upon light exposure [73].\n\nshi\nts1\n\n, a temperature-sensitive dynamin allele, encodes a mutant\n\nprotein that is functional at 18uC but loses its function at elevated\ntemperature [96]. Although impaired dynamin function leads to\n\ndeath of adult animals at 26uC or higher temperature (unpub-\nlished data), shi\n\nts1\nmutant flies are viable and do not exhibit ERG\n\ndefects at 24uC (Figure 6A–B). This permits us to conditionally\nreduce dynamin function in adult flies without impairing their\n\nlight response. To address whether internalization of Rh1 is\n\ncritical for the PR degeneration in Vps26\n1\n\nflies, we raised the\n\nVps26\n1\n,shi\n\nts1\ndouble mutants at 18uC and shifted the newly eclosed\n\nflies to 24uC to decrease dynamin function. We then performed\nERGs on Vps26\n\n1\n,shi\n\nts1\ndouble mutants kept in LD (Figure 6A). As\n\nshown in Figure 6A–B, reducing dynamin function significantly\n\nsuppresses the loss in ERG amplitude in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants at day 4\n\nin LD, indicating that Rh1 endocytosis plays an important role in\n\nPR degeneration upon loss of retromer function.\n\nTo address if a reduction in Rh1 suppresses the demise of the\n\nPRs, we tested flies that lack one copy of the Rh1 gene. Strong\n\nhypomorphic or null Rh1 alleles impair rhabdomere development\n\nin homozygous animals, as Rh1 plays a key signaling role in\n\nmaintaining the structure of rhabdomeres [97,98]. However, flies\n\nthat are heterozygous for Rh1 loss-of-function alleles do not show\n\naberrant PR development even when the Rh1 protein levels\n\nare reduced by 50% (Figure S10 and [50]). To assess whether\n\na reduction of 50% in Rh1 levels is able to suppress the\n\nVps26-associated PR degenerative phenotypes, we tested ERGs\n\nin mutants that carry a single copy of the Rh1 null allele (ninaE\n17\n\n,\n\n[99]). As shown in Figure 6C–D, flies that carry a single copy of\n\nRh1 exhibit a significant suppression of the ERG defects seen in\n\nVps26\n1\n\nmutant flies that have been kept in LD for 4 d.\n\nTo strongly reduce Rh1 levels, we next raised Vps26\n1\n\nmutants\n\non low vitamin A containing fly food. Vitamin A is a dietary\n\nprecursor of 11-cis 3-hydroxyretinal, the chromophore that is\n\ncovalently linked to the Rh1 opsin [100]. A decrease in vitamin A\n\nleads to loss of the chromophore. Because the chromophore is\n\nessential for Rh1 folding and stability [39,101], absence of vitamin\n\nA leads to reduced Rh1 levels in flies. Although this manipulation\n\nstill allows the formation of rhabdomeres, the size is dramatically\n\nreduced due to the requirement of Rh1 as a major structural\n\ncomponent [102]. Indeed, a reduction in dietary vitamin A leads\n\nto diminished rhabdomere size in both control and Vps26\n1\n\nmutants. Remarkably, vitamin A deprivation leads to a very\n\nstrong suppression of the PR degeneration observed in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants at day 10 in LD (Figure 6E–F). In addition, the reduced\n\nERG amplitudes of Vps26\n1\n\nare strongly suppressed upon vitamin A\n\ndeprivation (Figure 6G). In summary, decreasing Rh1 levels\n\nsuppresses the retinal degeneration associated with Vps26\n1\n. This\n\nalso suggests that elevated levels of Rh1 trapped in the\n\nendolysosomal pathway, rather than alterations in the levels of\n\nRh1 in the rhabdomeres per se, underlie PR degeneration in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants.\n\nIncreased Levels of Vps35 or Vps26 Are Sufficient to\nSuppress PR Degeneration\n\nRh1 accumulation in late endosomes causes PR degenera-\n\ntion in flies that lack PLC activity (encoded by the no receptor\n\npotential A (norpA) gene, [76,103]) (Figure 7A). If the retromer\n\nretrieves Rh1 from endosomes, increasing retromer levels\n\nmight alleviate PR degeneration in norpA flies. We therefore\n\noverexpressed the fly Vps35 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps35,UAS-w\n\nRNAi) or Vps26 (actin-GAL.UAS-Vps26,UAS-w RNAi) in nor-\n\npA\nP24\n\nmutants. Upon continuous exposure to white light for\n\n6 d, norpA\nP24\n\nmutants exhibit reduced numbers of rhabdomeres\n\ncompared to control flies (Figure 7B, left and middle left panels\n\nand Figure 7C). In addition, the ommatidia organization is\n\noften aberrant in norpA\nP24\n\nmutants (Figure 7B, middle left\n\npanel), indicating that the PRs are undergoing a progressive\n\ndemise. Expression of Vps35 or Vps26 significantly restores\n\nrhabdomere numbers (Figure 7B, middle right and right panel\n\nand Figure 7C), suggesting that this manipulation is sufficient\n\nFigure 6. Decreasing Rh1 levels suppresses PR degeneration in Vps26 mutants. (A) Decreasing endocytosis with a temperature-sensitive\ndynamin mutation (shi\n\nts\n) suppresses ERG defects associated with the loss of Vps26. Animals were grown at 18uC in the dark. Newly eclosed flies were\n\nselected and kept in the dark for an additional 12 h at 24uC to reduce dynamin function in shits1 or Vps261,shits1. Subsequently, flies are shifted to LD\nor kept in DD at 24uC. ERG is performed at the end of the fourth LD cycle. shits1 flies exhibit a normal ERG response. ERG defects in Vps261 mutant PRs\nare suppressed when dynamin function is partially reduced, as the Vps261,shits1 double mutants show a stronger depolarization than that in Vps261.\n(B) Quantification of ERG amplitude of the flies tested in (A). Ten flies were measured for each genotype after completing the fourth light cycle. ERG\namplitudes are normalized to control (iso).

Decreasing vitA lowers the levels of\nretinal, which is required for Rh1 maturation [39]. Loss of retinal therefore leads to loss of Rh1. Bright field images show that PR degeneration is\nstrongly suppressed in Vps26\n\n1\nmutants raised on the low vitA–containing food when flies are kept in LD for 10 d. As vitA is a key component for Rh1\n\nmaturation and Rh1 is a key structural component of rhabdomeres, the rhabdomere size is much reduced when the flies were raised on low vitA\nfood.

In\n\naddition, expression of human Vps26B also suppresses the\n\nnorpA\nP24\n\nphenotypes (unpublished data). These data indicate\n\nthat rerouting some of the Rh1 slated for lysosomal degrada-\n\ntion delays PR degeneration.\n\nMutations that impair lysosomal function can also lead to\n\nRh1-induced PR degeneration [76]. We therefore assessed\n\nwhether increasing Vps35 or Vps26 expression suppresses PR\n\ndegeneration in mutants that affect a subunit of the AP-3\n\ncomplex. AP-m3, encoded by carmine (cm), is required for the\nproper biogenesis of lysosomal-related organelles [104]. Upon\n\n6 d of light exposure, cm\n1\n\nmutant PRs showed degenerative\n\nfeatures [76], including loss of rhabdomeres and disruption of\n\nthe ommatidia organization (Figure 7D, bottom left panel and\n\nFigure 7E). In addition, cm\n1\n\nmutant PRs exhibit decreased\n\nERG amplitudes (Figure 7F–G). Similar to norpA\nP24\n\nmutants,\n\nincreasing Vps35 or Vps26 in cm\n1\n\nmutants restores the number\n\nof rhabdomeres (Figure 7D–E) and suppresses ERG defects\n\n(Figure 7F–G). These data indicate that increased retromer\n\nfunction can not only prevent PR degeneration in mutants with\n\nimpaired late endosomal trafficking but also suppress PR\n\ndegeneration caused by defective lysosomal function.\n\nVertebrate Retromer Homologs\nBecause the genes that encode the retromer proteins are\n\nevolutionarily conserved (Figure 1A, [7–9]), we investigated\n\nwhether the vertebrate Vps26 and Vps35 may also function in\n\nthe visual system. As shown in Figure S11A, vps26A is expressed\n\nin the mouse retina based on Northern blots. In addition, we\n\nstained the retina of wild-type control or heterozygous mice\n\ncontaining a lacZ inserted in the vps35 gene [105]. Most of the\n\nmelanopsin-expressing ipRGCs (92%) also express b-GAL\n(Figure S11B). To test whether human Vps26 homologs can\n\nsubstitute for the function of fly Vps26 in PRs, we ubiquitously\n\nexpressed the human vps26A or vps26B cDNA in the Vps26\n1\n\nmutant background. Both human Vps26A and Vps26B were able\n\nto rescue the lethality of Vps26\n1\n\nmutant flies (Figure 8A–D). We\n\nalso recorded ERGs from adult flies kept in LD for 21 d. As\n\nshown in Figure 8A–B, we observed a full rescue of the loss of\n\nERG amplitude and on–off transients. In addition, PR degen-\n\neration in Vps26\n1\n\nmutants is fully suppressed by overexpressing\n\nhuman Vps26 proteins (Figure 8C–D). These results show that\n\nthe human Vps26 homologs are able to perform the same\n\nfunction as the fly Vps26 protein.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Retromer Complex Is Required for Maintenance of\nFly PRs\n\nThe retromer recycles specific proteins from endosomes to the\n\nTGN or plasma membrane [7–9]. Here we show that, although\n\nthe loss of the retromer does not obviously affect eye development,\n\nmutations in Vps26 or Vps35 genes lead to strong light-dependent\n\nPR degeneration (Figure 1B–E, Figure 2B–E, and Figure S1C–E).\n\nThe demise of Vps26\n1\n\nand Vps35\nMH20\n\nPRs is associated with a\n\nsignificant increase in the number of late endosomes and\n\nlysosomes upon light exposure (Figure 3 and Figure S5), showing\n\nthat the endolysosomal pathway is strongly affected when Rh1\n\nrecycling by the retromer is impaired. Indeed, Rh1 accumulates in\n\nlate endosomes or lysosomes in the mutant PRs (Figure 4B–C).\n\nAlthough Rh1 can be degraded and the function of Vps26\n1\n\nmutant\n\nPRs is not abolished upon short light exposure (Figure 5A–D),\n\nchronic exposure to light is detrimental to Vps26\n1\n\nmutants because\n\npersistent Rh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal pathway is\n\ntoxic to PR cells [71,75,76]. Hence, reducing Rh1 endocytosis or\n\nRh1 levels in the rhabdomeres suppresses PR degeneration upon\n\nprolonged light exposure (Figure 6). Interestingly, increasing\n\nVps35 or Vps26 in mutants that show PR degeneration due to\n\nRh1 accumulation in the endolysosomal compartments [76]\n\nsuppresses the degenerative phenotypes (Figure 7). In summary,\n\nthe retromer is required to retrieve Rh1 from endosomes to\n\nmaintain PR function and integrity (Figure 8E).\n\nHow does Rh1 internalization affect the endolysosomal\n\npathway in retromer mutants? One possibility is that lysosomes\n\nin the mutants are unable to cope with the increased levels of\n\ninternalized Rh1 over time as Rh1 is one of the most abundant\n\nproteins in PRs [106,107]. This in turn triggers an increase in the\n\nnumber of lysosomes (Figures 3B,D,F and Figure S5B–C,E), the\n\naccumulation of aberrant lysosomes (Figure S5C), and the\n\naccumulation of endolysosomal intermediates, including late\n\nendosomes (Figure 3B,D,F and Figure S5B,D). Alternatively, loss\n\nof the retromer may increase the flux in the endolysosomal\n\npathway, which overpowers the rate of endolysosomal maturation\n\nand leads to an adaptive response that eventually leads to the\n\nexpansion of these compartments. Both pathways can lead to an\n\napparent accumulation of Rh1 in the cell body when stained and\n\nanalyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4 and Figure S9).\n\nDefective regulation of Rh1 can lead to the demise of PRs via\n\napoptosis [72,108]. Does apoptosis play a critical role in the PR\n\nFigure 7. Increasing the levels of Vps35 or Vps26 suppresses PR degeneration associated with PLC and AP-m3 mutants.

We argue that this is not the\n\ncase based on the following observations. First, the retromer\n\nmutants exhibit progressive PR degeneration over a 3-wk period\n\n(Figure 1B–C, Figure 2B–C, and Figure S1C–E), whereas\n\napoptosis typically occurs within hours [109]. Second, mutants\n\nthat lead to PR loss via apoptosis lose most PRs within ommatidia\n\nby the engulfment of surrounding glial cells [110]. However, the\n\ndegenerating Vps26 and Vps35 mutant PRs are not removed,\n\nalthough their morphology is very severely disrupted. Indeed, they\n\ncan still be identified in 3-wk-old flies (Figure 1D, Figure 2D,\n\nFigure 8C, and Figure S1D), indicating a lack of engulfment by\n\nsurrounding cells [111]. Third, overexpressing p35, a pan-caspase\n\ninhibitor of apoptosis [108], fails to suppress the PR degeneration\n\nin Vps26 mutants upon light exposure (unpublished data). Indeed,\n\nRh1 accumulation in different subcellular compartments triggers\n\ndifferent cellular responses, which leads to PR degeneration of\n\nvarying severity [2]. Accumulation of Rh1 in the endolysosomal\n\npathway seems particularly toxic to PRs but often does not cause\n\nthe removal of PRs for many weeks.\n\nLoss of Wg affects eye development [112], whereas loss of\n\nCrumbs leads to short and/or fused rhabdomeres [113,114].\n\nAlthough the retromer can recycle Wls or Crumbs in some fly\n\ntissues [10–14,17,18], Vps26\n1\n\nor Vps35\nMH20\n\nmutants do not exhibit\n\nobvious eye developmental defects. It is therefore very likely that\n\nthe composition of the eye retromer is different from the wing\n\nretromer. Indeed, loss of Snx3 does not cause obvious degener-\n\native phenotypes when compared to loss of Vps26 or Vps35\n\n(compare Figure S3 with Figures 1 and 2), yet these proteins are all\n\nessential for the recycling of Wls and wing development [10–14].\n\nThe Retromer in Photosensitive Cells in Flies and\nVertebrates\n\nMany players required for phototransduction in Drosophila are\n\nconserved in a phototransduction cascade in vertebrate ipRGCs.\n\nThese include melanopsin, PLC, and the TRP channels [60–63].\n\nThis phototransduction pathway plays a role in photoentrainment\n\nof circadian rhythms [64–67] and the control of the pupillary light\n\nreflex [64,68,69]. We find that vps35 is expressed in 92% of the\n\nmelanopsin-expressing RGCs in the mouse retina (Figure S11B).\n\nThis may be an underestimate due to technical difficulties with b-\nGAL immunostaining in mouse tissues. In addition, the human\n\nVps26 proteins are able to substitute for the function of the fly\n\nhomolog in PRs (Figure 8A–D). Because vertebrate melanopsin\n\nhas very similar photochemical properties to fly rhodopsin\n\n[115,116], the retromer may play a conserved role in vertebrate\n\nipRGCs. As deletion of vps35 leads to early embryonic lethality\n\n[105], a vps35 conditional KO in ipRGCs will need to be\n\nestablished to address its role in ipRGCs.\n\nImplications of the Retromer Complex in Human\nNeurodegenerative Diseases\n\nThe retromer has been implicated in human neurodegenerative\n\ndisease, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and PD [19,20,117].\n\nIn AD, a retromer deficiency has been proposed to affect\n\nsubcellular distribution of b-secretase, which leads to increased\namyloid-beta (Ab) deposits and defective neuronal function\n\n[105,118]. In PD, a missense mutation in VPS35 (D620N) has\n\nbeen shown to cause an autosomal dominant late onset form of the\n\ndisease [19,20]. The Vps35 D620N mutant protein appears to\n\nfunction as a dominant negative, and Vps35 and LRRK2\n\n(Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2) have been shown to interact\n\n[119]. It will therefore be interesting to assess if these mutants\n\naffect ipRGCs as PD patients often have sleep issues [120].\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nFly Strains and Genetics\nVps26\n\n1\nand Vps26\n\n2\nalleles were isolated as described [6,78].\n\nMale large duplications (,1–2 Mb) covering the X chromosome\n[121] were crossed with female y,w,mut*,P{neoFRT}19A\n\nisogenized\nflies\n\nthat were balanced with FM7c,Kr-GAL4,UAS-GFP(Kr.GFP). For\n\nthe XE52 group, the lethality of alleles was rescued by\n\nDp(1;Y)y\n2\n67g19.2 (1A1;2B17-18 + 20A3;20Fh). XE52 alleles\n\ncomplemented all the available deficiencies covered by\n\nDp(1;Y)y\n2\n67g19.2 [122,123]. Therefore, we turned to cross the\n\nXE52 alleles with 80 kb P[acman] duplications that cover the gaps\n\namong deficiencies [124] and found three overlapping duplica-\n\ntions (Dp(1;3)DC446, Dp(1;3)DC033, and Dp(1;3)DC034) that\n\nrescued the lethality of the mutants. These P[acman] duplications\n\nshare a ,21 kb interval. We then performed PCR sequencing for\ngenes localized to this region and identified mutations in Vps26.

For tissue sections, we\n\nfixed fly tissues with 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated the tissues\n\nwith acetone, and embedded them in LR white resin (Electron\n\nMicroscopy Sciences). Images were captured with a Zeiss LSM\n\n710 confocal microscope. Antibodies were used at the following\n\nconcentrations: rabbit anti-Rab5 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-Avl\n\n[84], 1:500; rabbit anti-Rab7 [76], 1:500; mouse anti-PDI\n\n(abcam), 1:100; rabbit anti-GM130 (abcam), 1:500; rabbit anti-\n\nRab11 (abcam, [6]), 1:500; chicken anti-GFP (abcam), 1:1,000;\n\nmouse anti-Rh1 [4C5, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank\n\n(DSHB)], 1:50; mouse anti-Wash (P3H3, [131]), 1:20; guinea pig\n\nanti-Vps26, 1:1,000 (this study); biotin-conjugated PNA (Vector\n\nLabs), 1:1,000; Alexa 488-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen),\n\n1:100; and Alexa 405-, Alexa 488-, Cy3-, or Cy5-conjugated\n\nsecondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:600.\n\nWestern Blotting\nFly heads were homogenized in 16 Laemmli sample buffer\n\n(Bio-Rad) containing 2.5% b-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich).\nTissue samples were loaded into 10% gels, separated by SDS-\n\nPAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad).\n\nAntibodies were as follows: mouse anti-actin (ICN Biomedicals),\n\n1:2,500; mouse anti-Rh1 (4C5, DSHB), 1:1,000; and rabbit anti-\n\nTRP [58].\n\nMolecular Biology\nCloning.

T4 ligase (NEB) was used to ligate the fly\n\nVps26 PCR products with pUAST-attB vector. Full-length fly\n\nVps35 cDNA was cloned from a plasmid (SD03023 from BDGP)\n\nusing primers 59-CTTCTCGAGGCCACCATGTATCCCTG-\n\nGAGCTCC-39 and 59-TTCTCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTG-\n\nGGACGTCGTATGGGTAATTGAGAGTTATGCCCG-39. A\n\nC-terminal HA tag was added to Vps35. Vps35 PCR product\n\nwas digested with XhoI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with\n\nthe pUAST-attB vector. Full-length human vps26A and vps26B\n\nwere cloned from plasmids (HsCD00296497 and HsCD00076427,\n\nrespectively) (Biodesign Institute of Arizona State University). The\n\nfollowing primers were used for PCR cloning: for hvps26A, 59-\n\nGTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGTTTTCTTGGAGGCTT-39\n\nand 59-GCATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCGT-\n\nATGGGTACATTTCAGGCTGTTCGGCAG-39; for hvps26B,\n\n59-GTTGAATTCGCCACCATGAGCTTCTTCGGCTTCGG-\n\n39 and 59-GAATCTAGATTAAGCGTAGTCTGGGACGTCG-\n\nTATGGGTACTGCCTGCAGTTGTTGTCAG-39. A C-termi-\n\nnal HA tag was added to human vps26 isoforms. PCR products\n\nwere digested with EcoRI (NEB) and XbaI (NEB) and ligated with\n\npUAST-attB vectors. Fly Vps26::V5 and Vps35::HA and human\n\nvps26A::HA and vps26B::HA cDNA constructs were purified and\n\ninjected into y,w,WC31 ; VK33 (fly cDNAs) or y,w,WC31 ; VK37\nembryos (human cDNAs), and the transgenic flies were selected.\n\nGenomic tagging. Recombineering was performed to tag\n\nEGFP at the C-terminus of the Vps26 gene. We used primers 59-\n\nGCAATTACGCCCAATACGAAAAAGACCGGTGCAACGC-\n\nCGTTGGCCACCGATGCAGCCCAATTCCGATCATATT-\n\nC-39 and 59-GTTACTACTTATCCCCCTGAAGATGGAAA-\n\nTCCTCTCCAGCTTCCCACTCATTACTTGTACAGCTCG-\n\nTCCATG-39 to amplify a PCR product containing the EGFP tag\n\nfrom the PL452-EGFP template vector [132]. We then electro-\n\nporated the EGFP-tagged PCR products into DY380 bacteria,\n\nwhich had been previously transformed with a 20 kb P[acman]\n\ngenomic rescue construct that covers the entire Vps26 genomic\n\nlocus (clone CH322-92A18 from the BACPAC Resources Center,\n\n[133]). Recombineering and related procedures were performed\n\naccording to the standard protocol [132]. Vps26-gEGFP–tagged\n\ngenomic construct was injected into y,w,WC31 ; VK31 embryos,\nand the transgenic flies were selected.\n\nGeneration of Anti-Fly Vps26 Antibody\nFull-length fly Vps26 cDNA was cloned from LD29140 by PCR\n\nwith primers 59-CTTGGATCCATGAATTTCCTGGGATTC-\n\nGGCCA-39 and 59-CTGGCGGCCGCTCAATCGGTGGC-\n\nCAACGGC-39. PCR products were then digested with BamHI\n\n(NEB) and NotI (NEB) and ligated with a pET28a(+) vector\ncontaining a Hisx6 tag at the N9-terminus (Novagen). The Vps26-\n\npET28a(+) construct was transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS\nbacteria (Invitrogen). Expression of Hisx6-Vps26 was induced\n\nwith 0.5 mM isopropylthio-b-galactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich),\nand the recombinant protein was purified with a Ni-NTA column\n\n(Qiagen) and inoculated into guinea pigs to generate polyclonal\n\nantibodies (Cocalico Biological Inc.).\n\nLight/Dark Cycle and Blue-Orange Light Exposure\nIn general, mosaic flies were grown in the dark at 25uC, and the\n\nnewly eclosed flies were selected and shifted to a 12-h light/dark\n\ncycle (LD, 1,800 lux in the light cycle) or constant darkness (DD) at\n\n25uC for the indicated periods. In the shits suppressor assay,\nanimals were raised in the dark at 18uC to avoid reduced dynamin\nprotein function. Newly eclosed flies were then shifted to 24uC in\nthe dark for 12 h. Flies were then kept in LD or DD at 24uC. For\n\naging experiments, flies were flipped to new vials every 3 d to\n\nmaintain food conditions, and the positions of the vials were\n\nrandomly shuffled to normalize light exposure. For pulse-chase\n\nassays, flies were kept in a box with a blue LED [6] for 20 min and\n\nthen an orange LED for 5 min.\n\nLow Vitamin A–Containing Food\nLow vitamin A–containing food was made according to [134].\n\nIn brief, a solution containing 10% dry yeast, 10% sucrose, 0.02%\n\ncholesterol, and 2% agar was microwaved and poured into fly\n\nvials. After drying at room temperature overnight, fresh low\n\nvitamin A food was used for experiments.\n\nTEM and Bright Field Imaging\nTo prepare fly retina samples for TEM and bright field imaging,\n\nfly heads were dissected and fixed at 4uC in 4% paraformalde-\nhyde, 2% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, and 0.005%\n\nCaCl2 (PH 7.2) overnight; postfixed in 1% OsO4; dehydrated in\n\nethanol and propylene oxide; and then embedded in Embed-812\n\nresin (Electron Microscopy Sciences) with vacuum attachments.\n\nPRs were then sectioned and stained in 4% uranyl acetate and\n\n2.5% lead nitrate. TEM images of PR sections were taken using a\n\nJEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope with an AMT\n\nXR-16 mid-mount 16 mega-pixel digital camera, while bright field\n\npictures were captured using the Zeiss Imager.Z2 light microscope\n\nwith an AxioCamMRm digital camera. The morphology and\n\nquantity of rhabdomeres, endosomes, and lysosomes were\n\ndetermined in Image J.\n\nERGs\nERG recordings were performed as described [6]. Briefly, adult\n\nflies were glued to a glass slide, a recording probe was placed on\n\nthe surface of the eye, and a reference probe was inserted in the\n\nthorax. A 1-s flash of white light was given, and the response was\n\nrecorded and analyzed using the AXON\nTM\n\n-pCLAMPH8 software.\n\nMouse Retina cDNA Preparation and Northern Blot\nAnalysis\n\nMouse retina cDNA was prepared as described [135]. vps26A\n\nwas PCR-amplified using primers 59-GAGTTTTCTTGGAGG-\n\nCTTTTTTGGTCC-39 and 59-TTACATCTCAGGCTGCTC-\n\nCGCAGAGG-39 and a 30 ng cDNA template. The PCR product\n\nwas cloned into pBluescript by blunt-end ligation and verified by\n\nsequencing. DNA probes were generated from gel-purified insert\n\n(excised with EcoRI and HindIII) by random-prime labeling with\n\n[a-\n32\n\nP]dCTP using the DECAprimeII kit (Ambion). Unincorpo-\n\nrated nucleotides were removed with a MicroBio-Spin 30 column\n\n(Bio-Rad).\n\nFor Northern blot analysis, total RNA was prepared from\n\nretinas of 3–4-mo-old CD-1 mice by homogenization in TRI\n\nreagent (Ambion) using a motorized pestle and passage\n\nthrough a 20-gauge needle, extraction with 1-bromo-3-\n\nchloro-propane, and purification with the RNeasy kit (Qiagen).\n\nWe resolved 10 mg of total RNA on a formaldehyde-agarose\ngel and transferred it to a Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (GE\nHealthcare) by capillary transfer. Membranes were prehybrid-\n\nized in ULTRAhyb (Ambion) for 1 h, then incubated at 42uC\novernight with a ,2.56107 cpm denatured probe diluted in\nULTRAhyb. Blots were washed several times in 26SSC+0.1%\nSDS and several times in 0.16 SSC+0.1% SDS. Washes were\nperformed at 42–45uC. For imaging, blots were exposed to a\nstorage phosphor screen and scanned on a Typhoon (GE\n\nHealthcare).\n\nThe Retromer Complex Recycles Rhodopsin\n\nPLOS Biology | www.plosbiology.org 16 April 2014 | Volume 12 | Issue 4 | e1001847\n\n\n\nb-Gal and Melanopsin Detection in Mouse Retina\nFor immunohistochemistry, wild-type or vps35 lacZ KI [105]\n\nmouse eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for\n\n45 min, washed in PBS, then stored overnight in 30% sucrose in\n\nPBS.
