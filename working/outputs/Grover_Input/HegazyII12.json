The type III secretion\nsystem (T3SS)-dependent translocation of S. enterica can be deployed for delivery of heterologous antigens to antigen-\npresenting cells. Here we investigated the efficacy of various effector proteins of the Salmonella pathogenicity island (SPI2)-\nencoded T3SS for the translocation of model antigens and elicitation of immune responses. The SPI2 T3SS effector proteins SifA,\nSteC, SseL, SseJ, and SseF share an endosomal membrane-associated subcellular localization after translocation. We observed\nthat all effector proteins could be used to translocate fusion proteins with the model antigens ovalbumin and listeriolysin into\nthe cytosol of host cells. Under in vitro conditions, fusion proteins with SseJ and SteC stimulated T-cell responses that were su-\nperior to those triggered by fusion proteins with SseF. However, in mice vaccinated with Salmonella carrier strains, only fusion\nproteins based on SseJ or SifA elicited potent T-cell responses. These data demonstrate that the selection of an optimal SPI2 ef-\nfector protein for T3SS-mediated translocation is a critical parameter for the rational design of effective Salmonella-based\nrecombinant vaccines.\n\nThe use of live attenuated bacterial pathogens is a promisingapproach for the rational design of new recombinant vaccines.\nSeveral attenuated carrier strains have been deployed for expres-\nsion and delivery of various viral, bacterial, or parasitic antigens\nfor vaccination (16). Live attenuated strains of Salmonella that\nsynthesize and secrete foreign antigens were developed as vaccines\nfor a number of infectious diseases and cancer treatment (19).\nMoreover, the use of live attenuated Salmonella to deliver recom-\nbinant antigens to the immune system is an attractive strategy for\nthe construction of multivalent vaccines (17). Salmonella-based\nvaccines provide a number of advantages over other antigen de-\nlivery strategies, including low cost of production, oral delivery,\nthe absence of animal products, genetic stability, and safety (3). In\naddition, Salmonella vaccines delivering heterologous antigens\nelicit efficient immune responses via stimulation of both innate\nand adaptive immunity (3). The availability of S. enterica serovar\nTyphimurium for preclinical work in mouse models and favor-\nable clinical experience with the live attenuated vaccines S. enterica\nserovar Typhi Ty21a, CVD908, and CVD909 (20) further facilitate\nthe development of Salmonella-based vaccination approaches.\n\nSalmonella enterica is a facultative intracellular pathogen that\ninhabits a unique membrane-bound host cell compartment,\ntermed the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) (reviewed in\nreference 12). Localization within the SCV prevents delivery of in\nvivo-expressed foreign proteins to the major histocompatibility\ncomplex (MHC) class I-restricted antigen presentation pathway\nand hinders the use of Salmonella as a vaccine carrier to induce\nspecific CD8 T cells, which are crucial for protection against vi-\nruses, intracellular bacteria, and tumors.\n\nThe majority of Gram-negative pathogens deploy complex vir-\nulence factors termed type III secretion systems (T3SS). T3SS me-\ndiate distinct functions that include antiphagocytic and cytotoxic\neffects on host cells (Ysc/Yop system of Yersinia spp.), invasion of\nhost cells (S. enterica SPI1 system, Shigella Mxi/Spa system), and\nintracellular pathogenesis (S. enterica SPI2 system, Chlamydia\nT3SS) (6). T3SS consist of at least 20 different subunits which\n\nenable these bacteria to translocate specific effectors directly into\nthe host cell cytoplasm in order to exert a broad range of virulence\nfunctions. The T3SS assembles needle-like appendages, which\nshare similarity with the flagellar basal body and some of its pro-\nteins, including those which form the core of the central channel\nand are highly conserved between the two systems (2). The T3SS\napparatus, also referred to as the injectisome, spans the inner and\nouter membranes of the bacterial envelope and secretes\ntranslocon and effector proteins. Translocon proteins allow\neffector proteins access to the eukaryotic cells by forming pores\nin the host cell membrane and forming a connecting channel-\nlike complex between the bacterium and the eukaryotic mem-\nbrane. After translocation into eukaryotic host cells, effector\nproteins subvert various host cell functions and immunity,\nthereby promoting bacterial virulence (4).\n\nSeveral important virulence factors of S. enterica are encoded\nby genes within Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPI), and two\nimportant loci are termed SPI1 and SPI2 (9). SPI1 and SPI2 genes\nencode distinct T3SS that translocate bacterial effectors during\ndifferent phases of pathogenesis (5). Salmonella translocates T3SS\neffector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm mediated by either\nthe SPI1 T3SS from the extracellular stage and from within the\n\nReceived 13 October 2011 Returned for modification 6 November 2011\nAccepted 3 January 2012\n\nPublished ahead of print 17 January 2012\n\nEditor: A.

This approach was\nmainly used to direct the expression of the desired antigen to a\nparticular location in the bacterial cell and increase the immuno-\ngenicity of foreign antigens by fusing them to proteins that could\nexert a carrier effect (15). Salmonella T3SS-mediated transloca-\ntion was used for efficient delivery of heterologous antigens into\nthe cytosol of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), leading to promi-\nnent CD8 T cell responses (19, 23). Salmonella T3SS-mediated\ntranslocation can be used for efficient delivery of heterologous\nantigen fusions to SPI2 effector proteins to the cytosol of APC,\nleading to prominent CD8 T cell priming in orally immunized\nmice (21). SPI2 effector proteins, especially those which are syn-\nthesized only when the Salmonella is inside host cells such as den-\ndritic cells (DCs) or macrophages (1), have been thought to be\npromising candidates for carriers of antigens to the MHC class I\npathway.\n\nOur previous studies used the SPI2 T3SS effector protein SseF\nas a fusion partner for the translocation of heterologous antigens\n(11, 23). In addition to SseF, 20 or more effector proteins are\ntranslocated by the SPI2 T3SS. We hypothesized that the translo-\ncation efficacy of effector-antigen fusions might be directly corre-\nlated to the immune response triggered by the vaccine. In this\nstudy, we used genes for five membrane-associated SPI2 effectors\nunder the control of the PsseA promoter for the generation of ex-\npression cassettes with model antigens. We examined the efficacy\nof antigen translocation into the cytosol of APCs and in vivo im-\nmunogenicity of fusion constructs with effector SseJ, SifA, SseL, or\nSteC in comparison with that of the previously described SseF\neffector. We observed that the highest immune response in vitro\nand in vivo was induced by constructs based on the effector SseJ.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and growth conditions. Salmonella enterica serovar Ty-\nphimurium NCTC 12023 was used as the wild-type strain. The purD htrA\ndouble-deficient strain MvP728 (23) was used as the attenuated carrier\nstrain. For the generation of recombinant plasmids, E. coli DH5� was used\nas the host. Plasmids were introduced into Salmonella strains by electro-\nporation, and recombinant strains were cultured in medium containing\n50 �g ml�1 carbenicillin in order to maintain the plasmids.\n\nGeneration of plasmids. For generation of expression cassettes with\ngene fusions consisting of sseJ, sifA, or sseL plus ovalbumin (OVA) and the\nhemagglutinin (HA) tag under the control of the SPI2 promoter PsseA, a\ngene fragment comprising codons 196 to 386 of chicken OVA with the\nCD4 and CD8 epitopes was amplified by PCR using OVA-For-NaeI,\nOVA-HA-Rev-XbaI, and pOMP as a template, which was later digested\nwith NaeI and XbaI. PsseJ::sseJ::hSurvivin (p3550), PsifA::sifA::hSurvivin\n(p3551), or PsseL::sseL::hSurvivin (p3552) was digested with EcoRV and\nXbaI. Digested OVA was ligated to the large fragment of the digested\nplasmids to obtain plasmids PsseJ::sseJ::OVA::HA (p3554), PsifA::sifA::\nOVA::HA, (p3556), and PsseL::sseL::OVA::HA (p3555), and these plasmids\nwere used to amplify sseJ::OVA::HA, sifA::OVA::HA, or sseL::OVA::HA\nusing the forward primers SseJ-For-EcoRI, SifA-For-Effector-EcoRI, and\nSseL-Effector-For-EcoRI and the reverse primer OVA-HA-Rev-XbaI.\nPCR products were digested later by EcoRI and XbaI. Plasmid p3342\nharboring PsseA::sscB sseF::hSurvivin::HA (23) was digested with EcoRI\nand XbaI, and the large fragment was ligated to digested sseJ::OVA::HA,\nsifA::OVA::HA, or sseL::OVA::HA fragments, resulting in PsseA::sseJ::O-\nVA::HA (p3631), PsseA::sifA::OVA::HA (p3632), or PsseA::sseL::OVA::HA\n(p3633). The plasmids obtained were confirmed by colony PCR, diagnos-\n\ntic digestion, and sequencing using T7-Seq and T3-Seq primers. The plas-\nmids used in this study are listed in Table 1 and the sequences of oligonu-\ncleotides are indicated in Table 2.\n\nFor generation of expression cassettes consisting of the gene fusion\nSteC::OVA::HA under the control of SPI2 promoter PsseA, the low-copy-\nnumber plasmid pWSK29 was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and OVA\nwas amplified using the primers OVA595-For-EcoRI and OVA-HA-Rev-\nXbaI and the plasmid pOMP as the template. Amplified OVA digested\nwith EcoRI and XbaI was ligated to digested pWSK29, resulting in plasmid\npWSK29::OVA::HA. The sseA promoter was amplified using the primers\nProB-For-KpnI and ProB-Rev-EcoRI and the plasmid p3342 as the tem-\nplate. Plasmid pWSK29::OVA::HA was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and\nligated to the amplified SseA promoter, which was digested with KpnI and\nEcoRI, yielding plasmid pWSK29::PsseA::OVA::HA. The gene for the effec-\ntor protein SteC was amplified using SteC-Effector-For-EcoRI and SteC-\nRev-EcoRI. pWSK29 PsseA::OVA::HA and amplified SteC were both di-\ngested by EcoRI and ligated, yielding PsseA::steC::OVA::HA (p3634). The\nresulting plasmid was confirmed by colony PCR for the right orientation\nand sequenced using T3-Seq and T7-Seq.\n\nFor generation of expression cassettes consisting of fusions of sseJ, sifA,\nsseL, or steC to a fragment of lisA and the HA tag under the control of SPI2\npromoter PsseA, the fragments PsseA::sseJ, PsseA::sifA, PsseA::sseL, and PsseA::\nSteC were amplified using ProB-For-KpnI as the forward primer and\nSseJ-Rev-EcoRV, SifA-Rev-EcoRV, SseL-Rev-EcoRV, or SteC-Rev-NaeI\nas the reverse primer. PCR products were digested with KpnI and EcoRV\nor NaeI (Table 2). Plasmid p2810 harboring PsseA::sseF::lisA::HA (25) was\ndigested with KpnI and EcoRV, and the large fragment was ligated to\namplified digested PsseA::sseJ, PsseA::sifA, PsseA::sseL, or PsseA::steC, yielding\nplasmids PsseA::sseJ::lisA::HA (p3635), PsseA::sifA::lisA::HA (p3636), PsseA::\nsseL::lisA::HA (p3637), and PsseA::steC::lisA::HA (p3638). All the plasmids\nwere confirmed with colony PCR, diagnostic digestion, and sequencing\nusing T3-Seq and T7-Seq.\n\nAnalysis of synthesis and translocation of recombinant vaccine an-\ntigens. In order to quantify the amounts of recombinant protein pro-\nduced by the various strains, Western blots were analyzed using the Od-\nyssey detection system, and signal levels for model antigens were\nnormalized to the levels of the constitutively synthesized control protein\nDnaK.\n\nFor analyses of translocation, HeLa cells were infected with various\nSalmonella strains harboring plasmids for the expression of effector::\n\nTABLE 1 Plasmids used in this study\n\nPlasmid Relevant characteristics Reference\n\npWSK29 Low-copy-no. vector, Ampr Lab stock\npOMP-OVA lacZ::OVA Lab stock\np2629 pWSK29 PsseA sscB sseF::OVA::M45 11\np2810 pWSK29 PsseA sscB sseF::lisA51-363::HA 11\np3550 pWSK29 PsseJ sseJ::hSurvivin This study\np3551 pWSK29 PsifA sifA::hSurvivin This study\np3552 pWSK29 PsseL sseL::hSurvivin This study\np3553 pWSK29 PsteC steC::hSurvivin This study\np3554 pWSK29 PsseJ sseJ::OVA::HA This study\np3556 pWSK29 PsifA sifA::OVA::HA This study\np3555 pWSK29 PsseL sseL::OVA::HA This study\np3626 pWSK29 PsteC steC::OVA::HA This study\np3631 pWSK29 PsseA sseJ::OVA::HA This study\np3632 pWSK29 PsseA sifA::OVA::HA This study\np3633 pWSK29 PsseA sseL::OVA::HA This study\np3634 pWSK29 PsseA steC::OVA::HA This study\np3635 pWSK29 PsseA sseJ::lisA51-363::HA This study\np3636 pWSK29 PsseA sifA::lisA51-363::HA This study\np3637 pWSK29 PsseA sseL::lisA51-363::HA This study\np3638 pWSK29 PsseA steC::lisA51-363::HA This study\n\nHegazy et al.\n\n1194 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\n o\nn\n F\n\ne\nb\nru\n\na\nry 1\n\n5\n, 2\n\n0\n1\n2\n b\n\ny U\nN\n\nIV\nE\n\nR\nS\n\nIT\nA\n\nE\nT\n\n O\nS\n\nN\nA\n\nB\nR\n\nU\nE\n\nC\nK\n\nh\nttp\n\n://ia\ni.a\n\nsm\n.o\n\nrg\n/\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\n\nlo\na\n\nd\ne\n\nd\n fro\n\nm\n \n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\nlisA::HA or effector::OVA::HA under the control of PsseA.

The preparation and culture of bone mar-\nrow cells from C57BL/6 mice for generation of bone marrow-derived\ndendritic cells (BM-DC) was described previously (13). After 6 days of\nculture in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA, Colbe, Germany) containing\n10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Gibco BRL, Grand Island, NY)\nand granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) at\n37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, the BM-DC were suspended in\nsmall flasks for experiments at a density of 8 � 106 cells per flask and\nallowed to adhere for at least 12 h.\n\nBacterial strains were grown overnight in LB, and the optical density at\n600 nm (OD600) of the cultures was adjusted to 0.2 in 1 ml of phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS). Aliquots of this suspension were added to flasks in\norder to yield the multiplicities of infection (MOI) indicated in the leg-\nends to Fig. 3, 4, and 5. The flasks were centrifuged at 500 � g for 5 min to\nsynchronize the infection and subsequently incubated at 37°C in an at-\nmosphere of 5% CO2 for 30 min. Thereafter, the cells were washed three\ntimes with RPMI 1640 medium and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium\ncontaining 100 �g ml�1 gentamicin for 1 h, followed by RPMI 1640 me-\ndium containing 25 �g ml�1 gentamicin for the rest of the experiment.\n\nAt 16 h after infection, the cells were fixed and processed for immu-\nnostaining of Salmonella LPS (rabbit anti-Salmonella O1,4,5; Difco, BD),\nthe HA epitope tag (Roche), and the dendritic cell-specific marker CD11c\n(Armenian hamster anti-CD11c; BD). The cells were analyzed by micros-\ncopy using a Zeiss LSM700 confocal laser scanning microscope.\n\nQuantification of T cell stimulation. The SL-H2-Kb-specific murine\nCD8� T cell hybridoma B3Z expresses the lacZ reporter gene under the\ncontrol of the NFAT enhancer (13). The cell line was kindly provided by\nNilabh Shastri at the University of California at Berkeley. Briefly, BM-DC\nfrom C57BL/6 mice at 105 per well in 96-well plates were infected with\nbacterial strains grown to stationary phase. Infection was performed for 1\n\nh at MOI of 25 and 100 for wild-type and MvP728 strains, respectively.\nThe plate was centrifuged for 5 min at 500 � g to synchronize the infec-\ntion. After the infection period, noninternalized bacteria were removed\nby two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). To kill remaining\nextracellular bacteria, infected cells were incubated for 1 h in medium\ncontaining 100 �g ml�1 of gentamicin. After a washing step, medium\ncontaining 25 �g ml�1 gentamicin was added. B3Z T cells were added to\nthe plates and cocultured at a DC:T cell ratio ranging from 1:8 to 1:0.125\nin a total volume of 200 �l per well for 24 h. Cells were recovered by\ncentrifugation at maximal speed and lysed by the addition of 100 �l sub-\nstrate solution (0.15 mM chlorophenyl red �-galactopyranoside, 0.5%\n[vol/vol] Nonidet P-40 in PBS). After incubation for 6 to 8 h at 37°C, the\nabsorbance was determined at 595 nm.\n\nStimulation of T cell proliferation was analyzed as described before\n(25). Briefly, BM-DCs from C57BL/6 mice were seeded at 105 per well in\na 96-well plate. The cells were infected with bacterial strains at an MOI of\n25. All experiments were performed in parallel for 1 h. The cells were\nwashed twice with PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium contain-\ning 100 �g ml�1 gentamicin for 1 h. After infection, plates were gamma-\nirradiated (3,600 rad) prior to coculture with 2 � 105 spleen cells from\nOT-I or OT-II mice (10) at a final ratio of 4:1. These mice express a\ntransgenic T cell receptor (V�2/V�5) specific for the OVA-derived pep-\ntides presented either in the MHC class I or MHC class II context. The\ntransgene status was confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting\n(FACS) with anti-mouse CD4 (clone RM4-5), anti-mouse CD8� (clone\n5H10), and anti-mouse V�2 (clone B20.1) from BD Biosciences. As a\ncontrol, spleen cells were stimulated with 1 �g ml�1 concanavalin A\n(Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) without the addition of DC. After 48 h of\ncoincubation, the proliferation was measured by 3H uptake for an addi-\ntional 24 h. All experiments were performed in triplicate and at least three\nbiological replicates were performed.\n\nVaccination experiments. The immune responses to vaccination with\nlive Salmonella carriers translocating fusion proteins of listeriolysin (Llo)\nto various effectors were analyzed as previously described (25). Briefly,\nBALB/c female mice 6 weeks of age (Jackson Laboratory) were maintained\nunder standard conditions at the Baylor College of Medicine animal fa-\ncility and were treated according to an IACUC-approved protocol. For\nimmunization, cohorts of seven mice were immunized by orogastric ap-\nplication of 1 � 109 CFU per mouse of Salmonella MvP728 or MvP728\nharboring plasmid p2810 (sseF::lisA), p3635 (sseJ::lisA), p3636 (sifA::lisA),\np3637 (sseL::lisA), or p3638 (steC::lisA). The inocula were applied in 200\n�l of 5% sodium bicarbonate using 20-gauge gastric gavage needles (Pop-\nper & Sons, Inc.). Booster immunizations were applied at days 14 and 28\nafter primary vaccination using the same conditions. The inoculum used\nwas always verified by serial dilution and plating on LB agar plates in the\npresence of the appropriate antibiotic.\n\nMHC pentamer staining and FACS analysis. Blood samples were col-\nlected 10, 21, and 35 days after immunization from vaccinated mice or\ncontrol groups. After erythrocyte lysis with ammonium chloride solution,\ncells were stained with a phycoerythrin (PE)-labeled H-2Kd/Llo91–99 (GY\nKDGNEYI)-specific Pro5 pentamer (ProImmune, Inc.), rat anti-mouse\nfluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated CD8 monoclonal antibody\n(MAb) KT15 (Proimmune, Inc.), allophycocyanin-conjugated hamster\nanti-mouse CD3e (BD Biosciences), and peridinin chlorophyll protein\n(PerCP)-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD45 (BD Biosciences). The fluoro-\nchrome and isotype-matching MAbs suggested by BD Biosciences were\nused as negative controls. The analysis was performed on an LSR-II flow\ncytometer (BD Biosciences) using BD FACDiva software, v. 6.0.\n\nStatistical analyses. Analyses for unpaired groups and the control\ngroup were performed by the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with\na Bonferroni t test using SigmaPlot 11.\n\nRESULTS\nGeneration and evaluation of expression cassettes.

For either model antigen, the fragments encode\nCD4- and CD8-restricted epitopes, and a large panel of tools is\navailable for the characterization of immune responses. The ex-\npression cassettes were placed on the low-copy-number plasmid\npWSK29, which has previously been shown to be compatible with\nSsrAB-regulated in vivo expression (8, 11). The modular design of\nthe various expression cassettes is presented in Fig. 1.\n\nNext, strains harboring the expression cassettes were tested for\nthe levels of recombinant fusion proteins. We first used in vitro\nculture conditions known to induce the expression of genes of the\nSsrAB regulon and the synthesis of SPI2 effector proteins. The\nsynthesis of SPI2 effector-OVA-HA (Fig. 2A and C) and SPI2\neffector-Llo-HA (Fig. 2B and D) fusion proteins was observed for\nall constructs analyzed here. In order to quantify the amounts of\nrecombinant protein produced by the various strains, Western\nblots were analyzed using the Odyssey detection system, and sig-\nnals for model antigens were normalized to the levels of the con-\nstitutively synthesized control protein DnaK. For both model an-\ntigens, SseJ and SteC fusions were expressed at significantly higher\nlevels than SseL or SifA fusions. SteC fusions provided the highest\nlevel of recombinant-protein synthesis.\n\nSince all fusion constructs were expressed by episomal genes,\nwe tested plasmid stability in the absence of antibiotic selection\nand under conditions that mimic the intracellular environment of\nSalmonella in host cells (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).\nThese experiments indicated that 80 to 90% of the bacterial cells\nmaintained the plasmids over 7 days of repeated subculture in the\nabsence of antibiotics. Similar numbers of plasmid-harboring\nbacteria were obtained by subculture in noninducing minimal\nmedium without antibiotics, while 60 to 70% plasmid-harboring\ncells were obtained after subculture in SPI2-inducing minimal\n\nmedium without antibiotics. Under these conditions, the greatest\nloss of plasmids was observed for fusion constructs with SseJ and\nSseF, while constructs based on SseL were maintained in more\nthan 80% of the cells. These data suggest that the maintenance of\nexpression cassettes is sufficiently stable for potential in vivo ap-\nplications.\n\nNext, we analyzed the translocation of the model antigens by\nintracellular Salmonella in mammalian cells. We investigated the\ntranslocation of OVA-HA (Fig. 3) and Llo-HA fusion proteins\nusing expression cassettes with the PsseA promoter. All expression\ncassettes mediated translocation of fusion proteins into HeLa cells\n(Fig. 3A) and BM-DC (Fig. 3B). However, the intensities of the\nHA tag immunofluorescence staining of infected BM-DC varied\nconsiderably, indicating different amounts of the translocated\nprotein (data not shown). In contrast, infected HeLa cells showed\nmore uniform signal intensities and were used for quantification.\nInfected HeLa cells harboring similar numbers of intracellular\nSalmonella were selected, and the signal intensities of the HA tag of\nthe examined constructs were compared. The SPI2 effectors were\nranked in the following order depending on the level of the fusion\nprotein expression: SteC � SseJ � SseF � SseL � SifA (Fig. 3C).\n\nQuantification of T cell responses to antigens presented by\nintracellular Salmonella. We next compared the antigen-\ndependent stimulation of T cells after uptake of recombinant Sal-\nmonella strains with expression of recombinant antigens under\nthe control of PsseA. BM-DC were infected with the attenuated S.\nenterica serovar Typhimurium carrier strain MvP728, which is\ndeficient in purD and htrA (21) and harbors plasmids for the ex-\npression of SPI2 effector::OVA::HA under the control of PsseA.\nSubsequently, infected BM-DC were incubated with B3Z T cells.\nB3Z is a T cell hybridoma that recognizes the OVA-derived SIIN\nFEKL epitope in the context of H2Kb and expresses the lacZ re-\nporter gene under the control of the NFAT enhancer. The\n�-galactosidase activity thus is a measure of the antigen-\ndependent stimulation (25). Very low stimulation was observed\nwith the vector controls without expression cassettes, while addi-\n\nFIG 1 Generation of expression cassettes for heterologous vaccine antigens.

Expression cassettes with fusions to sseF were described previously (11). In all cassettes, the expression\nis controlled by the in vivo-activated promoter PsseA of the SsrAB regulon. All plasmids were generated on the basis of the low-copy-number vector pWSK29, and\np3631, etc., are plasmid designations.\n\nHegazy et al.\n\n1196 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\n o\nn\n F\n\ne\nb\nru\n\na\nry 1\n\n5\n, 2\n\n0\n1\n2\n b\n\ny U\nN\n\nIV\nE\n\nR\nS\n\nIT\nA\n\nE\nT\n\n O\nS\n\nN\nA\n\nB\nR\n\nU\nE\n\nC\nK\n\nh\nttp\n\n://ia\ni.a\n\nsm\n.o\n\nrg\n/\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\n\nlo\na\n\nd\ne\n\nd\n fro\n\nm\n \n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\ntion of the SIINFEKL peptide was used as positive control, result-\ning in maximal stimulation. The use of the Salmonella purD htrA\nstrain with plasmids harboring various expression cassettes re-\nsulted in highly increased stimulation of the T cell hybridoma. The\nhighest stimulation was obtained with expression cassettes with\nSseJ and SteC fusion proteins (Fig. 4). These findings were com-\npatible with the quantification of signals for protein translocation,\nwhich also showed that levels of SteC and SseJ fusion proteins\nwere highest.\n\nAs a second approach, we used the OVA-specific T cells iso-\nlated from OT-I or OT-II transgenic mice (25). OT-I mice are\ntransgenic for CD8� T cells that recognize the OVA epitope SIIN\nFEKL (OVA257–276) in the context of MHC class I molecules, while\nOT-II mice are transgenic for CD4� cells that respond to the\nOVA323–339 peptide ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR in the context of\nthe MHC class II I-A2 molecule. BM-DC were infected with vari-\nous combinations of carrier strains and expression cassettes, and\nthe proliferation of OT-I- and OT-II-derived T cells was deter-\nmined as a measure of antigen-dependent stimulation (Fig. 5).\nCompared to the control stimulation of T cells by concanavalin A,\nhigh levels of stimulation of OT-I cells were obtained with the\nSalmonella purD htrA carrier strain with the various expression\ncassettes for SPI2 effector::OVA::HA. In contrast, stimulation of\n\nOT-II cells was rather low under the various conditions investi-\ngated in this assay. This indicates that peptides derived from trans-\nlocated fusion proteins are predominantly presented in a MHC\nclass I-restricted manner. The highest stimulation was observed\nwith strains harboring SteC and SseJ fusion proteins.\n\nFusion proteins with SseJ and SifA efficiently induce T cell\nresponses after vaccination in mice. To examine the effect of\nSPI2 effectors on the in vivo immunogenicity of the recombinant\nvaccines, we used the purD htrA double-deficient strain MvP728,\nwhich harbored expression cassettes for the SPI2 effector-Llo fu-\nsion proteins under the control of PsseA. Mice were immunized by\noral administration of the vector or vaccine strains followed by\nbooster immunizations on days 14 and 28. In order to quantify the\nimmune response to vaccination, blood samples were analyzed on\ndays 10, 21, and 35 after the initial immunization.

In con-\ntrast, immunization with strains translocating SseJ-Llo or SifA-\nLlo fusion proteins induced increased numbers of CTL compared\nwith SseF-Llo. The highest CTL frequency was detected in the\ngroup immunized with the SseJ fusion protein. These results in-\ndicate that effector proteins SteC and SseL are suboptimal for the\nuse in recombinant vaccines. In contrast, SseJ and SifA are supe-\nrior to the previously characterized effector protein SseF and can\nbe used for the translocation of heterologous antigens by\nSalmonella-based recombinant vaccines.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPrevious work from others and our labs has demonstrated the\nbroad potential applicability of bacterial T3SS for the transloca-\ntion of heterologous vaccine antigens by live attenuated bacterial\ncarrier strains (19). Among multiple factors that contribute to the\nvaccine efficacy, the choice of a T3SS translocation signal or a\n\nT3SS effector protein as a fusion partner for the target antigens is\nof particular importance. Here, we compared the ability of five\nSPI2 effectors (SseJ, SifA, SteC, SseL, and SseF) to translocate\nmodel antigens in APCs and to elicit antigen-specific immune\nresponse in vivo. We observed that the amount of translocated\nprotein, as well as the stimulation of T cell responses under in vitro\nconditions, correlated well with the translocation efficacy of the\nvarious effectors. However, the T cell responses triggered in a vac-\ncination experiment were only in partial agreement with the ef-\nfects observed in vitro. SseJ consistently demonstrated the stron-\ngest activities both in vitro and in vivo. While stimulation of T cell\nresponses by fusion proteins based on SseJ was efficient in all assay\nsystems applied here, SseL did not appear to be useful for the\ngeneration of the fusion proteins with heterologous antigens in\nthe same settings. The results from in vitro and in vivo experiments\nwere only in partial agreement for fusion proteins based on SteC\nor SifA. While fusion proteins with SteC were efficiently translo-\ncated and stimulated T cell responses in �-Gal- or OVA-\nresponsive T cells, the stimulation of Llo-responsive T cells in\nvaccinated mice was not detectable.\n\nFIG 3 Translocation of fusion proteins by intracellular Salmonella. Wild-type S. enterica serovar Typhimurium harboring plasmids with cassettes for the\nexpression of fusion proteins consisting of the SPI2 effector protein SseJ, SifA, SseL, or SteC and the model antigen Llo with a C-terminal HA epitope tag under\nthe control of PsseA were used to infect epithelial HeLa cells at an MOI of 10 or BM-DC at an MOI of 25.

Immature DC can internalize and pro-\ncess S. enterica for peptide presentation on MHC class II as well as\nMHC class I, initiating an immune response (22). Interestingly, al-\nthough S. enterica remains confined to vacuolar compartments, it can\nbe processed for MHC class I presentation of bacterial antigens to\nCD8� T cells (26). Because of the cytotoxicity of S. enterica to infected\ncells, DC can be either direct or indirect presenters of S. enterica an-\ntigens. Direct presentation of bacterial antigens to T cells follows\nphagocytic processing of S. enterica, which does not induce cytotox-\nicity. Indirect presentation of bacterial antigens to T cells is a conse-\nquence of uptake by professional APCs of antigenic material from\nneighboring cells that have undergone Salmonella-induced apoptotic\ndeath (22). Our results of the stimulation of OT-I and OT-II T cells\nindicate that translocation of all fusion constructs results in MHC\nclass I- as well as MHC class II-restricted presentation. However, it is\nstill unknown how SPI2 T3SS effectors differ in their subcellular lo-\ncalization and route of processing of heterologous antigens in DC. A\nrecent study indicated that a subgroup of SPI2 T3SS effector proteins\nhas DC-specific functions, such as interference with MHC class II\npresentation (7).\n\nThe expression levels of genes encoding SPI2 effector proteins\nare highly divergent, and this is likely to affect the amount of the\ntranslocated effector protein (24). By comparison of various pro-\nmoters of the SsrAB regulon for expression of heterologous anti-\ngen fusions to SPI2 T3SS effector protein SseF, we recently iden-\ntified PsifB as a promoter with superior stimulation of immune\nresponses to vaccination (25). In this study, we compared various\nSPI2 effector proteins with high levels of synthesis for the translo-\ncation of fusion proteins. Here, the expression of the vaccine an-\ntigen fusions was controlled by PsseA, a promoter that has been\nutilized in our previous approaches (11, 23). The comparison of\nthe effector proteins SifA, SseJ, SteC, and SseL to the previously\ndeployed effector SseF clearly revealed high levels of stimulation of\nimmune responses by SifA and SseJ. Ongoing studies in our lab are\nexamining combinations of selected SPI2 promoters and effectors\nfor optimal immunogenicity of the recombinant vaccines. In ad-\ndition to the selection of promoters for the controlled in vivo ex-\npression of heterologous antigens and the SPI2 T3SS effector pro-\ntein, other parameters may affect vaccination efficacy. Recent work\nshowed that adaptation of the codon usage of foreign antigens to the\ncodon usage of Salmonella as a carrier strain can strongly affect levels\nof protein synthesis and in turn the immune response to the antigen\n(23). Another important aspect is the selection of a suitable attenu-\nated carrier strain. In the previous analysis and in this study, S. en-\nterica serovar Typhimurium strain MvP728 harboring deletions of\npurD and htrA was used. Other attenuated mutant strains are yet to be\ntested for their compatibility with SPI2 T3SS-dependent transloca-\ntion of heterologous antigens.\n\nFrom results of this study we conclude that the choice of a\ntranslocated SPI2 effector is an important parameter for the\nconstruction of efficient recombinant vaccines. However, the\nin vitro efficacy of the various SPI2 effectors only partly corre-\nlated with the immunogenicity observed in vivo. This discor-\ndance may be explained by several factors. (i) Carrier strains\nwith high levels of expression of heterologous antigens (e.g.,\nwith SteC effector) could be more rapidly eliminated in vivo,\n\nresulting in reduced immune responses. (ii) The levels of syn-\nthesis of certain effectors are different under the in vivo and in\nvitro conditions applied here. (iii) The subcellular location of\nthe fusion protein under in vivo conditions is not favorable for\nefficient stimulation of immune response.\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis showed that the choice of SPI2 effector\nprotein as a vehicle for intracellular delivery of a target antigen is a\ncritical parameter for the optimal design of Salmonella-based recom-\nbinant vaccines. The in vivo vaccination efficacy of such SPI2 effectors\ndid not completely match their in vitro performance. These results\nreflect the complex interplay between expression level, attenuation of\nlive carrier strains, and properties of the recombinant antigen in vac-\ncination of host organisms. Further mechanistic studies are required\nfor the comprehensive evaluation of these critical parameters for the\nrational design of recombinant vaccines\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by grant HE1964 of the Deutsche Forschungs-\ngemeinschaft to M.H., a fellowship of the DAAD to W.A.H.H., and grants\nfrom the National Institutes of Health (P50 CA126752) and The Caroline\nWiess Law Foundation to L.M.
