Type VI Secretion System Encoded in Salmonella Pathogenicity\nIsland 19 Is Required for Salmonella enterica Serotype Gallinarum\nSurvival within Infected Macrophages\n\nCarlos J. Blondel, Juan C. Jiménez, Lorenzo E. Leiva, Sergio A. Álvarez, Bernardo I. Pinto, Francisca Contreras, David Pezoa,\nCarlos A. Santiviago, Inés Contreras\n\nDepartamento de Bioquímica y Biología Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Químicas y Farmacéuticas, Universidad de Chile, Santiago, Chile\n\nSalmonella enterica serotype Gallinarum is the causative agent of fowl typhoid, a disease characterized by high morbidity and\nmortality that causes major economic losses in poultry production. We have reported that S. Gallinarum harbors a type VI secre-\ntion system (T6SS) encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity island 19 (SPI-19) that is required for efficient colonization of chicks. In\nthe present study, we aimed to characterize the SPI-19 T6SS functionality and to investigate the mechanisms behind the pheno-\ntypes previously observed in vivo. Expression analyses revealed that SPI-19 T6SS core components are expressed and produced\nunder in vitro bacterial growth conditions. However, secretion of the structural/secreted components Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG to\nthe culture medium could not be determined, suggesting that additional signals are required for T6SS-dependent secretion of\nthese proteins. In vitro bacterial competition assays failed to demonstrate a role for SPI-19 T6SS in interbacterial killing. In con-\ntrast, cell culture experiments with murine and avian macrophages (RAW264.7 and HD11, respectively) revealed production of a\ngreen fluorescent protein-tagged version of VgrG soon after Salmonella uptake. Furthermore, infection of RAW264.7 and HD11\nmacrophages with deletion mutants of SPI-19 or strains with genes encoding specific T6SS core components (clpV and vgrG)\nrevealed that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum survival within macrophages at 20 h postuptake. SPI-19 T6SS function\nwas not linked to Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity or cell death of infected macrophages, as has been described for other T6SS.\nOur data indicate that SPI-19 T6SS corresponds to a novel tool used by Salmonella to survive within host cells.\n\nThe Salmonella genus includes over 2,500 known serotypes dis-tributed between two species, S. enterica and S. bongori (1).\nSalmonella infections can range from subclinical colonization to\nserious systemic disease, depending both on the serotype and the\ninfected host. While some serotypes can infect and cause systemic\ndisease in a wide range of animal hosts, others are restricted to a\nspecific host. S. enterica serotype Gallinarum has a host range re-\nstricted to birds and causes a severe systemic disease called fowl\ntyphoid. This disease is characterized by high morbidity and mor-\ntality, causing major economic losses in poultry production in\nseveral parts of the world (2, 3). S. Gallinarum has been eradicated\nfrom most developed countries, such as the United States, Austra-\nlia, and many Western European countries, as a result of im-\nproved surveillance and slaughter practices; however, it is still a\nmajor concern in developing countries (2).\n\nThe ability of Salmonella to invade and survive within host cells\ndepends on the delivery of specialized effector proteins into the\nhost cell cytosol by two different type III secretion systems (T3SS),\neach encoded in distinct genomic islands known as Salmonella\npathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2. The SPI-1 T3SS confers\nthe ability to invade nonphagocytic cells and to colonize and\nbreach the gastrointestinal tract of their hosts. On the other hand,\nSPI-2 T3SS allows Salmonella to survive within eukaryotic cells\nand spread to internal organs, such as the liver and spleen (4).\nBoth T3SS are present in every S. enterica serotype and correspond\nto the most critical virulence determinants in Salmonella. Never-\ntheless, S. enterica serotypes differ greatly in terms of pathogenic-\nity and host specificity, suggesting that other virulence factors are\ninvolved in the adaptation of different serotypes to specific hosts\nand/or environments.\n\nThe type VI secretion system (T6SS) corresponds to a newly\n\ndescribed mechanism for protein translocation that is widespread\namong Gram-negative bacteria (5) and has been linked to a wide\nvariety of cellular processes, including virulence in several bacte-\nrial pathogens (6). We have reported that the Salmonella genus\ncomprises five phylogenetically distinct T6SS, each encoded in\ndifferentially distributed SPIs, including SPI-6, SPI-19, SPI-20,\nSPI-21, and SPI-22 (7, 8). S. Gallinarum harbors one T6SS en-\ncoded in SPI-19 (SPI-19 T6SS), which is required to efficiently\ncolonize the avian host (9, 10). The requirement of a fully func-\ntional SPI-19 T6SS for systemic infection suggested a role for this\nsystem in the interaction of Salmonella with cells of the reticuloen-\ndothelial system (9).\n\nInteraction of S. Gallinarum with the avian immune system has\nbeen reported to be critical for the ability of this serotype to colo-\nnize and cause disease in chicks (11). This interaction occurs in\neach of the different stages of the progression of avian systemic\nsalmonellosis, from intestinal invasion and systemic infection to\nthe immune clearance/persistence of the pathogen (reviewed in\nreference 12). Nevertheless, despite the critical aspects of this Sal-\n\nReceived 12 November 2012 Returned for modification 16 December 2012\nAccepted 19 January 2013\n\nPublished ahead of print 28 January 2013\n\nEditor: A.

Gallinarum with macrophages, especially those of\navian origin. In this context, even though several SPIs have been\nshown to contribute to infection in vivo (3, 9, 13), only SPI-1 and\nSPI-2 T3SS have been evaluated in vitro (14, 15).\n\nIn the present work, we aimed to further characterize SPI-19\nT6SS and the molecular mechanisms behind the phenotypes pre-\nviously observed in vivo. To accomplish this, we analyzed the ex-\npression, production, and secretion profiles of selected T6SS com-\nponents under different in vitro growth conditions and analyzed\nthe role played by SPI-19 T6SS in the interaction of S. Gallinarum\nwith murine and avian macrophages. We determined that SPI-19\nT6SS components are expressed and produced, but not secreted,\nunder different growth conditions. On the other hand, we deter-\nmined intracellular production of the cell-puncturing protein\nVgrG once the bacteria are internalized by macrophages and that\nSPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum survival within murine\nand avian macrophages.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and growth conditions. The bacterial strains used in the\npresent study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were routinely grown in Luria-\nBertani (LB) medium (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter\nNaCl) at 37°C with aeration. When required, LB medium was supple-\n\nmented with ampicillin (Amp; 100 mg/liter), chloramphenicol (Cam; 20\nmg/liter), and kanamycin (Kan; 50 mg/liter). Media were solidified by the\naddition of agar (15 g/liter). For SPI-1-inducing conditions, bacteria were\ngrown in LB medium supplemented to reach final concentrations of 0.171\nM NaCl, 0.3 M NaCl, or 0.2 M sucrose, as described previously (16). LB\nmedium (0.085 M NaCl) was used as a control condition. For SPI-2-\ninducing conditions, bacteria were grown in a modified N-minimal me-\ndium [5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 1 mM KH2PO4,\n0.1 mM Tris-HCl, pH 5.5, 38 mM glycerol, 0.1% Casamino Acids] ad-\njusted to pH 5.5 and supplemented to reach a final concentration of 10\n�M MgCl2 (17). N-minimal medium, adjusted to pH 7.4 and supple-\nmented to achieve/reach a final concentration of 10 mM MgCl2, was used\nas a control.\n\nStandard DNA techniques. Total genomic DNA was obtained from\novernight bacterial cultures using the GenElute bacterial genomic\nDNA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) according to the manufac-\nturer’s instructions. Plasmid DNA was obtained from overnight cul-\ntures using either the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit or the QIAprep Spin\nplasmid Maxikit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) according to the manu-\nfacturer’s instructions. PCR products were purified using the\nQIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD) as recom-\nmended. The multicopy plasmid pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison,\nWI) was used for complementation studies. DNA samples were rou-\ntinely analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels (prepared in 1�\nTris-acetate-EDTA buffer) and visualized under UV light after\nethidium bromide staining.\n\nTABLE 1 Strains used in this study\n\nStrain Feature(s) Source or reference\n\nE. coli\nDH5� F� �80lacZ�M15 �(lacZYA-argF)U169 deoR recA1 endA1 hsdR17(rk\n\n� mk\n�)\n\nphoA supE44 thi-1 gyrA96 relA1 ��\nLaboratory collection\n\nS.

Mutant strains with deletions of\nSPI-19 (SG1024 to SG1054), clpV (SG1034), icmF (SG1031), hcp1\n(SG1029), hcp2 (SG1043), and vgrG (SG1044) were constructed using the\nRed-swap method (18). PCR primers 60 bases long were synthesized with\n40 nucleotides (nt) on the ends corresponding to the extreme of the de-\nsired deletion (Table 2) and 20 nt that anneal to the 5= or 3= end of a Cam\nresistance cassette flanked by the FRT sites (FLP recombinase target se-\nquence) present in plasmid pCLF2 (GenBank accession number\nHM047089), which was used as the template DNA. S. Gallinarum strain\n287/91 (10), carrying the temperature-sensitive plasmid pKD46, which\nexpresses the Lambda-Red recombinase system, was grown to an optical\ndensity at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.5 at 30°C in LB medium containing Amp\nand L-arabinose (10 mM). Bacteria were made electrocompetent by se-\nquential washes with ice-cold, sterile 10% glycerol and transformed with\napproximately 500 ng of the corresponding purified PCR product. Trans-\nformants were selected on LB Cam agar at 37°C. The presence of each\nmutation was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers flanking the\nsites of substitution. Also, each mutant was assayed for Amp sensitivity to\n\nconfirm the loss of pKD46. Finally, mutant alleles were transferred to the\nwild-type background by generalized transduction using P22 phage.\n\nTo obtain nonpolar deletions, the Cam resistance gene was removed\nby transforming each mutant with pCP20, which encodes the FLP recom-\nbinase. Transformants were plated on LB Amp agar at 30°C. Individual\ncolonies were replica plated on LB agar, LB Amp agar, and LB Cam agar at\n37°C. Transformants that had lost the resistance cassette and pCP20 were\nselected as those colonies that were unable to grow in the presence of Amp\nand Cam. The absence of the antibiotic resistance gene cassette was con-\nfirmed for each mutant by PCR analysis.\n\nTo obtain the S. Typhimurium 14028s �SPI-1 mutant strain, a P22\nphage lysate from �SPI-1::Kan S. Typhimurium SL1344 (NCTC 13347)\n(19) was used to transduce this mutation to the 14028s background.\n\nConstruction of lacZ operon fusions. To construct lacZ operon fu-\nsions, the method developed by Ellermeier and collaborators was used\n(20). This method consists of the specific integration of a suicide plasmid\n(pCE36) that has an FRT site directly upstream of promoterless lacZY into\na chromosomal FRT site from a previous Red-swap mutation.

These strains were then grown at\n30°C and transformed by electroporation with plasmid pCE36. Transfor-\nmants were recovered in LB, and dilutions were plated on LB Kan 5-bro-\nmo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-\t-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) agar at 37°C.\nGrowth at 37°C allows for the optimal production of FLP recombinase\nand blocks the replication of the temperature-sensitive plasmid pCP20,\nresulting in the stable integration of pCE36 and the loss of pCP20. Fusions\nwere checked by PCR with the appropriate set of primers (Table 2) to\nensure integration of pCE36 in the correct chromosomal location and to\nrule out the presence of multiple plasmid integrants.\n\nConstruction of 3�FLAG gene fusions. Epitope tagging of T6SS\ncomponents was performed by constructing gene fusions between the\nhcp1, hcp2, and vgrG open reading frames (ORFs) and the 3�FLAG\nepitope by a modification of the Red-swap method described by Uzzau\nand collaborators (21) using primers listed in Table 2. The PCR products\nwere amplified from template plasmid pSUB11 (Table 3), and the Red-\nswap protocol was similar to that described above. Each fusion was\nchecked by PCR and transduced into a clean wild-type background, and\nthen the resistance marker was excised from the chromosome as described\nabove.\n\nConstruction of a VgrG-GFP gene fusion. A gene fusion between the\ngreen fluorescent protein (GFP) ORF and the ORF of the VgrG T6SS\ncomponent (termed VgrG-GFP) was constructed by a modification of the\nRed-swap method described by Gerlach and collaborators (22). The PCR\nproduct was amplified using primers listed in Table 2 and plasmid p3174\nas the template (Table 3) and included the ORF encoding the GFP re-\nporter followed by a Kan resistance cassette flanked by FRT sites. Proper\nintegration of the reporter cassette was confirmed by PCR. Positive clones\nwere moved into a wild-type background by generalized transduction\nusing P22, and the resistance marker was excised from the chromosome as\ndescribed above.\n\nProtein sample preparations. For whole-cell lysates, bacteria were\ngrown overnight in an orbital shaker at 37°C and subcultured in the ap-\npropriate growth media. When the culture reached an OD600 of \n0.3 to\n0.4, the cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 2 min). The\nsupernatant was removed and the pellet was weighted in order to normal-\nize samples. Each mg of bacterial pellet was resuspended in 10 �l of 1�\nprotein loading buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol,\n0.01% bromophenol blue, 5% \t-mercaptoethanol). Finally, the samples\nwere boiled for 10 min and stored at �20°C.\n\nFor protein secretion analyses, bacterial cells were removed by centrif-\nugation (13,000 rpm for 2 min). The culture supernatant was filter steril-\n\nized and mixed with trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to a final concentration of\n10%. The samples were chilled on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 13,000\nrpm for 15 min. The protein pellet was washed twice with ice-cold ace-\ntone, air dried, and resuspended in 1� protein loading buffer. Finally, the\nsamples were boiled for 5 min and stored at �20°C.\n\nSDS-PAGE analyses and immunoblotting. Polyacrylamide gels\n(12%) were prepared and mounted using a Mini-Protean III (Bio-Rad,\nRichmond, CA) PAGE system. The samples were run at 100 V (constant)\nwith 1� protein running buffer (1.44% glycine, 0.3% Tris, 0.1% SDS).\nTransfer from the polyacrylamide gel was performed in a Mini Trans-Blot\nsystem (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). A polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)\nmembrane was activated by immersion in 100% methanol for 15 s. The\ntransfer was performed for 65 min at 230 mA in 1� transfer buffer (1.44%\nglycine, 0.3% Tris, 0.01% SDS, and 20% methanol). The membrane was\nblocked by incubation in a solution containing 5% nonfat milk in TBS (25\nmM Tris, pH 8, 125 mM NaCl) for 90 min at room temperature. Later, the\nmembrane was incubated at 4°C for 2 h with the M2 anti-FLAG primary\nantibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) diluted at 1:10,000 in TBS. For\nsigma 70 detection, an anti-RNA polymerase sigma 70 antibody\n(ab12088) was used (Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) at a 1:1,000\ndilution in TBS. After five washes with a TBS– 0.05% Tween solution, the\nmembrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with a 1:20,000\ndilution of the secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxi-\ndase. For immunodetection, the Supersignal West-Pico solution (Pierce,\nRockford, IL) was used, exposing the membrane on a CL-Xposure\n(Pierce, Rockford, IL) photographic film.\n\n�-Galactosidase assays. Bacteria were grown overnight in LB broth\nand then subcultured and grown in 50 ml of the appropriate medium at\n37°C in an orbital shaker. Every 30 min, a 1-ml sample was withdrawn to\nevaluate bacterial growth (OD600 and CFU/ml), and the \t-galactosidase\nactivity was measured as described previously (20). Enzyme activities (in\nMiller units), normalized for cell density (OD600), were calculated using\nthe following equation: [A420 � (1.75 � A550)] � 1,000/(reaction time �\nculture volume � OD600), where reaction time was measured in minutes\nand culture volume in ml. Each sample was analyzed in triplicate in at least\nthree independent experiments.\n\nBacterial killing assays. Bacterial strains used for the interbacterial\ncompetition studies included Enterobacter cloacae (ATCC 700323), Shi-\ngella sonnei (ATCC 25931), Escherichia coli (ATCC 35218), Escherichia coli\nK-12 (ATCC 25922), Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus saprofiticus\n(ATCC BAA750). Each of these strains was tested for competition against\nantibiotic-resistant derivatives of the wild-type and �SPI-19 mutant\nstrains. A Cam-resistant derivative of S. Gallinarum was generated by\ntransformation with plasmid pWRKC (Camr), a derivative of plasmid\n\nTABLE 3 Plasmids used in this study\n\nPlasmid Feature(s) Source or reference\n\npKD46 bla PBAD gam bet exo pSC101 ori(Ts), Amp\nr 18\n\npGEM-T Easy Cloning vector, Ampr Promega\npGEM-T::clpV pGEM-T Easy harboring clpV, Ampr This work\np3174 Plasmid encoding the gfpmut3 gene 22\npSUB11 3�FLAG gene fusions plasmid, oriR6K, Kanr 21\npCP20 bla cat cI857 �PR flp pSC101 ori(Ts), Cam\n\nr, Ampr 69\npCE36 aph FRT lacZY� this oriR6K, Kan\n\nr 20\npCLF2 Red-swap-redesigned vector, Camr 70\npCLF4 Red-swap-redesigned vector, Kanr 71\npWRKC Derivative of pir-dependent plasmid pNFB9, integrates at Gifsy-1 attachment site attG1, Camr This work\npmCherry Constitutive production of the mCherry fluorescent protein, Ampr C.

The chromosomal insertion of pWRKC, flanking the\nattG1 site, was confirmed by PCR amplification using primers LepA_F\nand LepA_R (Table 2). For competition assays, each strain was grown\novernight in LB media and then collected and washed three times in sterile\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 13,000 rpm for 2 min). The cell suspen-\nsions were normalized to an OD600 of 0.5 and mixed at a 1:1 ratio with\neither the S. Gallinarum pWRKC (Camr) or the �SPI-19::Kan (Kanr)\nstrain. Fifty �l of the mixture then was spotted onto a prewarmed brain\nheart infusion (BHI) agar plate and incubated for 1 week at 37°C. The\ninitial inoculum was serially diluted and plated to determine the initial\nCFU/ml. After 1 week, cells were recovered from the plates and resus-\npended in 1 ml of sterile PBS, and serial dilutions were plated out on BHI\nagar with or without kanamycin. The amount of prey CFU was deter-\nmined by subtracting the Kan-resistant CFU counts from the total CFU\ncounts.\n\nCell culture conditions. The murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7\nand the avian macrophage line HD11 were routinely maintained in Dul-\nbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) high glucose (high glucose is\ncomposed of 584 mg/liter L-glutamine, 4,500 mg/liter glucose, 110 mg/\nliter sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% inactivated bovine fetal\nserum (FBS) and antibiotic/antimycotic solution (10,000 nU/ml penicil-\nlin, 10,000 mg/liter streptomycin, 25 mg/liter amphotericin B) at 37°C in\na 5% CO2 atmosphere.\n\nIn vitro infection assays. Gentamicin protection assays were per-\nformed according to Schwan and collaborators (24). RAW264.7 and\nHD11 macrophages were seeded in 48-well cell culture plates at a density\nof \n2.5 � 105 cells per well. Bacterial strains were grown overnight at\n37°C in an orbital shaker, and on the day of the assay they were subcul-\ntured in LB at a 1:30 dilution and grown until they reached an OD600 of\n\n0.6. The bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation (13,000 rpm for\n2 min), washed three times with sterile PBS, and suspended in prewarmed\n10% FBS-DMEM to reach a final concentration of 2.5 � 107 CFU/ml. This\nsuspension was serially diluted, and bacteria were quantified by plating on\nLB agar plates. Macrophages were washed once with sterile PBS, and then\n100 �l of the bacterial suspension was added (multiplicity of infection\n[MOI] of 10). Plates were centrifuged at 250 � g for 5 min at room\ntemperature to synchronize infection, and invasion was allowed to pro-\nceed for 45 min (time point 0). After this time, the wells were washed 3\ntimes with warm, sterile PBS and the cells were further incubated for 1 h\nwith 10% FBS-DMEM supplemented with gentamicin (200 �g/ml) to kill\nextracellular bacteria. The gentamicin concentration then was lowered to\n10 �g/ml for the rest of the experiment. At 2 and 20 h postuptake, different\nwells were washed 3 times with warm, sterile PBS, and the macrophages\nwere lysed with 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (DOC) in PBS. Serial dilutions\nwere prepared and plated on LB agar plates to determine viable intracel-\nlular bacteria. For each assay, viable macrophages were determined by\ntrypan blue exclusion. The intracellular survival of mutant strains was\ncalculated as CFU per 105 viable macrophages.\n\nViability and cytotoxicity assays. Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity\nwas determined by the CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay\n(Promega, Madison, WI). For each assay, RAW264.7 and HD11 cells were\nseeded in 96-well plates at a density of \n30,000 cells per well. The next\nday, the cells were infected with the bacterial strains as described for the\ninfection assays. At 20 h postuptake, the supernatant of infected cells was\ncollected and transferred to a new 96-well plate. The cytotoxicity reagent\nthen was added following 30 min of incubation at room temperature\nprotected from light. After incubation, absorbance at 562 nm was mea-\nsured and the cytotoxicity levels were calculated as a percentage of lactate\ndehydrogenase (LDH) release normalized to the spontaneous release\nfrom noninfected cells.\n\nFor viability and sub-G1 population analyses, RAW264.7 and HD11\nmacrophages were seeded at a density of \n300,000 cells per well. Sub-G1\nanalysis allows the detection of hypoploid cells, which are cells with lower\nDNA content due to apoptotic cell death. Gentamicin protection assays\n\nwere performed as described above. At 20 h postuptake, cells from both\nthe supernatant and the monolayer were recovered (to obtain a complete\ninfected cell population), washed, and resuspended in 1 ml of warm 10%\nFBS-DMEM. For viability analysis, 5 �l of a 1 mg/ml stock of propidium\niodide (PI) was added to 500 �l of the cell suspension, and the samples\nwere analyzed by flow cytometry. For sub-G1 analysis, a volume of 500 �l\nof the cell suspension was used. Cells were collected by centrifugation and\nthen treated with 100% methanol for 1 h at �20°C. After incubation, cells\nwere collected and resuspended in 500 �l of PBS containing RNase at a\nconcentration of 50 �g/ml. After incubation for 1 h, 5 �l of a 1 mg/ml\nstock of PI was added. The levels of PI incorporation were quantified on a\nFACScan flow cytometer (Becton, Dickinson). Cell size was evaluated by\nforward-angle light scattering (FSC). PI-negative cells of normal size were\nconsidered alive. A total of 5,000 cells per sample were analyzed.\n\nEpifluorescence microscopy. For epifluorescence analysis of VgrG-\nGFP production upon internalization of S. Gallinarum into RAW264.7\nand HD11 macrophages, cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips in 6-well\nplates at a density of \n375,000 cells per well. After 20 h, the cells were\ninfected with the bacterial strains as described for the infection assays. At\neither 45 min or 2 h postuptake, the cells were washed 3 times with warm,\nsterile PBS and fixed with a 4% formaldehyde solution for 20 min at room\ntemperature. After incubation, the coverslips were washed with sterile\nPBS and mounted in a 4=,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-contain-\ning solution from VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, Burlington, CA). For\nCytochalasin D analysis, cells were incubated for 1 h with 10 �g/ml Cy-\ntochalasin D before infection and maintained with this concentration\nthroughout the experiment. The samples were stored at 4°C and visual-\nized under an epifluorescence microscope. Fluorescence microscopy\nanalysis was performed using a Spinning Disk Olympus IX 81 fluores-\ncence microscope, and fluorescence micrographs were captured using a\nZeiss Axiocam MRC5 and CellR software.\n\nVgrG translocation assays. The vgrG ORF (SG1044), without the cor-\nresponding stop codon, was amplified by PCR using as the template a\npreparation of S. Gallinarum 287/91 genomic DNA and cloned into plas-\nmid pFlagTEM-1 (25, 26). The production of the VgrG-BlaTEM recom-\nbinant protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis\nusing anti-3�FLAG monoclonal antibodies. To demonstrate T6SS-de-\npendent VgrG translocation, a modified gentamicin protection assay was\nperformed as described previously (8). RAW264.7 and HD11 macro-\nphages were seeded in 96-well optical plates (black walls and clear, flat\nbottoms) and infected with each of the bacterial strains expressing the\ncorresponding BlaTEM fusions.\n\nBacteria were grown to an OD600 of 0.3 and induced with 1 mM iso-\npropyl-\t-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) until they reached an OD600 of\n0.6. The cells were collected and washed three times with sterile PBS\n(13,000 rpm for 2 min) and resuspended in the appropriate volume of\nprewarmed 10% FBS-DMEM. Infections were performed for 45 min at an\nMOI of 50. Noninternalized bacteria were removed by three washes with\nsterile PBS, and cells were further incubated with 200 �l 10% FBS-DMEM\nsupplemented with 1 mM IPTG and 200 �g/ml gentamicin. After 1 h of\nincubation, the cell supernatant was replaced with 100 �l Hanks’ buffered\nsalt solution (HBSS; Gibco) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES and 3 mM\nprobenecid (pH 7.4; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) (designated HBSS-\nHP), and 20 �l freshly prepared CCF4-AM \t-lactamase substrate (Live-\nBLAzer FRET-B/G loading kit; Invitrogen) was added. After 90 min of\nincubation at room temperature in the dark, the cells were washed five\ntimes with HBSS-HP. Fluorescence emission at 450 and 520 nm was mea-\nsured from the bottom using a plate reader fluorometer (Synergy H1;\nBioTek) (410-nm excitation wavelength, 10-nm band pass). The translo-\ncation level was calculated as recommended in the LiveBLAzer FRET-B/G\nloading kit manual. Briefly, emission values were first corrected by sub-\ntraction of the average background signals recorded for empty wells, and\nthe mean 450-nm/520-nm emission ratio of a triplicate of wells was cal-\nculated for each sample. The translocation level is expressed as fold in-\ncrease of the mean 450-nm/520-nm emission ratio of each infected sam-\n\nSPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular Survival\n\nApril 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1211\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nple relative to the mean emission ratio of uninfected cells. Epifluorescence\nmicroscopy analysis was performed using a Spinning Disk Olympus IX 81\nfluorescence microscope. Fluorescence micrographs were captured using\na Zeiss Axiocam MRC5 and CellR software. Images were imported into\nthe ImageJ software (v.1.44).\n\nStatistical analysis. The statistical significance of differences in the\ndata was determined using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with\nDunnett’s posttest (GraphPad Prism v5.0).\n\nRESULTS\nSPI-19 T6SS components are expressed and produced under in\nvitro bacterial growth conditions. A recent report from our\ngroup provided genetic evidence of SPI-19 T6SS functionality (9).\nNevertheless, no study regarding expression, production, and se-\ncretion of its components has been performed to date. In order to\nfurther characterize SPI-19 T6SS in S. Gallinarum, operon fusions\nto the lacZ reporter were constructed for the conserved core com-\nponents hcp1, hcp2, vgrG, clpV, and icmF, and gene fusions to the\n3�FLAG epitope were constructed for hcp1, hcp2, and vgrG, as\nthey encode secreted components of T6SS (Fig. 1A and Table 1).\nDifferent in vitro growth conditions were tested to study the ex-\npression and production of these components, including (i) stan-\ndard bacterial culture conditions (growth in LB medium at 37°C\nwith agitation); (ii) SPI-1-inducing growth conditions modified\nto mimic the conditions found by S. Gallinarum in the intestinal\nlumen of the chicken (42°C, high osmolarity, anaerobiosis) (16);\nand (iii) SPI-2-inducing growth conditions intended to mimic\nthose found by the bacterium inside macrophages (pH 5.5 and 10\n�M MgCl2) (17). Even though these media cannot fully replicate\nthe conditions encountered by Salmonella in the host, they have\nproven useful for identifying underlying regulatory networks in\nSalmonella (16, 17, 27–29).\n\nExpression analyses revealed a growth phase-dependent regu-\nlation of each gene analyzed under standard bacterial culture con-\nditions, with the hcp1 gene showing the highest expression levels\nof all the genes tested (Fig. 2A). Gene expression analyses under\nSPI-1- and SPI-2-inducing conditions showed a significant in-\ncrease only for hcp1 under SPI-2-inducing conditions (data not\nshown).\n\nProduction of the structural/secreted proteins Hcp1, Hcp2,\nand VgrG revealed that these three proteins are produced in vitro\n(Fig. 2B). The Hcp1 protein was detected under all of the condi-\ntions tested, and relative quantification by gel densitometric anal-\nysis of its production revealed that increased levels of the protein\nwere present under SPI-2-inducing conditions (Fig. 2B). In con-\ntrast to expression analyses, the Hcp2 and VgrG proteins were\n\ndetected only at the exponential phase of bacterial growth and\nwere barely detected at stationary phase or under SPI-1- and SPI-\n2-inducing conditions (Fig. 2B).\n\nRegardless of the differences observed for the expression and\nproduction of T6SS core components, it was not possible to detect\nsecretion of either Hcp1, Hcp2, or VgrG to the culture media\nunder the different growth conditions tested (Fig. 2B). These find-\nings suggest that additional signals are required for full activation\nof SPI-19 T6SS in S. Gallinarum.\n\nSPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing under\ndifferent in vitro growth conditions. An increasing number of\nT6SSs have been linked to interbacterial killing against different\nGram-negative bacteria through the delivery of different toxins\nwhich target the peptidoglycan of susceptible bacterial species\n(30–34). A heuristic informatic approach was recently developed\nfor large-scale identification of T6SS antibacterial effectors (35).\nIn Salmonella, this approach identified several toxin/antitoxin\nmodules inside the SPI-6 T6SS gene cluster and one additional\nmodule in a genomic region not associated with T6SS loci (tae3\nand tai3 genes in Fig. 1B) (35). Interestingly, this module is pres-\nent in every Salmonella enterica genome we have analyzed (data\nnot shown), so it is tempting to speculate that even though the\nSPI-19 T6SS gene cluster does not seem to encode a toxin/anti-\ntoxin module, it could be involved in interbacterial killing\nthrough translocation of the toxin encoded in this novel cluster\n(Fig. 1B).\n\nTo test this, an in vitro competition assay was performed using\nthe wild type or a �SPI-19 derivative of S. Gallinarum against a\npanel of 6 Gram-negative bacteria, including bacteria previously\nshown to be susceptible to T6SS killing. A Gram-positive strain\nwas included in the assay as a control. As shown in Fig. 3, each prey\nstrain tested grew at similar levels after coculture with either the\nwild-type or the SPI-19 mutant strain. When the same experiment\nwas performed under different in vitro growth conditions (30, 37,\nand 42°C and SPI-1-inducing conditions), no differences were\nobserved (data not shown). These results indicate that S. Gallina-\nrum SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing under the\nconditions studied.\n\nVgrG is produced after S. Gallinarum internalization by mu-\nrine and avian macrophages. The contribution of the SPI-19\nT6SS to S. Gallinarum colonization of orally infected chickens\nsuggested a role for this system in the interaction of Salmonella\nwith eukaryotic cells, especially those of the reticuloendothelial\nsystem (7). Because expression of T6SS components in other bac-\nteria is induced within eukaryotic cells (reviewed in reference 36),\n\nFIG 1 Salmonella pathogenicity island 19 and the T6SS-related toxin/antitoxin gene cluster. (A) Schematic representation of the SPI-19 T6SS gene cluster in S.\nGallinarum. (B) The putative toxin/antitoxin module identified by Russell and colleagues (35). T6SS core components are shown in gray. Components studied\nin this work are shown in black.\n\nBlondel et al.\n\n1212 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nwe analyzed the production of the VgrG protein within macro-\nphages. To date, most studies regarding the ability of Salmonella to\ninfect and survive within macrophages have been performed in\nmurine macrophages. However, since S. Gallinarum corresponds\nto an avian-adapted serotype, we chose to use both murine\n(RAW264.7) and avian (HD11) macrophages and compare the\nresults obtained for each cell line.\n\nA chromosomal gene fusion was constructed between the vgrG\nORF and the ORF encoding the GFP reporter using the method\n\ndescribed by Gerlach and colleagues (22). The vgrG gene was cho-\nsen because (i) it is an essential T6SS component, (ii) production\nof VgrG was not detected under the conditions we tested, includ-\ning those used prior to infection (either LB medium, 37°C, and an\nOD600 of 0.6 or DMEM, 5% CO2, and 37°C) (Fig. 4A), and (iii) it\nhas been shown that VgrG C-terminal fusions can be constructed\nwithout affecting the functionality of the corresponding T6SS\n(37).\n\nTo analyze the production of the VgrG-GFP fusion protein\nafter Salmonella internalization by macrophages, gentamicin pro-\ntection assays were performed. RAW264.7 and HD11 cells were\nseeded onto sterile glass coverslips and infected with an S. Galli-\nnarum strain harboring the VgrG-GFP fusion in its chromosome.\nThis strain also carries the pmCherry plasmid, encoding the red\nfluorescent protein mCherry under the control of a constitutive\npromoter, to allow bacterial visualization. After 45 min of infec-\ntion, cells were washed and cell culture media added with a final\nconcentration of 100 �g/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacte-\nria. Two hours postuptake, the cells were washed, fixed, and\nmounted for their analysis by epifluorescence microscopy. As\nshown in Fig. 4B and C, intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP\nfusion was detected in bacteria expressing cytosolic mCherry in\nboth murine and avian macrophages at 2 h postuptake.\n\nTo determine whether production of VgrG was induced by the\ninitial cell contact between Salmonella and the macrophages or\noccurred after bacterial internalization, cells were pretreated with\nCytochalasin D to inhibit Salmonella uptake. As shown in Fig. 4B\nand C, pretreatment with Cytochalasin D prevented VgrG pro-\nduction in both murine and avian macrophages infected with S.\nGallinarum. Interestingly, infections performed with the HD11\nmacrophage cell line revealed that S. Gallinarum was detected in\ngranule/vacuolar structures after internalization. This was not\nseen in infected murine macrophages (Fig. 4C). Further studies\nwill be needed to fully characterize the intracellular fate of S. Gal-\nlinarum in HD11 macrophages compared to results from previ-\nous studies performed in murine macrophages. Altogether, our\nresults indicate that production of VgrG is induced once S. Galli-\nnarum is internalized by macrophages of either murine or avian\norigin.\n\nSPI-19 T6SS contributes to S. Gallinarum intracellular sur-\nvival within murine and avian macrophages. Intracellular pro-\nduction of VgrG in RAW264.7 and HD11 cells suggested that\nSPI-19 T6SS is involved in the interaction of Salmonella with mac-\nrophages. To test this, a set of defined S. Gallinarum mutants was\nconstructed and tested in intracellular survival assays in both mu-\nrine and avian macrophages. Gentamicin protection assays were\nperformed, infecting each macrophage cell line with either the\nwild-type, �SPI-19, or �clpV mutant strain. As controls, �ssaG\nand �aroA mutant strains were also included, as both genes en-\ncode proteins required for Salmonella survival within macro-\nphages. The ssaG gene encodes an essential SPI-2 T3SS structural\ncomponent (38), while aroA corresponds to an auxotrophic mu-\ntant for aromatic amino acids with impaired ability to survive and\ngrow within macrophages (39).\n\nAt 2 and 20 h postuptake, intracellular bacteria were recovered\nand bacterial loads were determined and expressed as CFU per 105\n\nmacrophages. As shown in Fig. 5, none of the T6SS mutants\nshowed a significant intracellular survival defect compared to the\nwild-type strain at 2 h postuptake. However, at 20 h postuptake,\neach T6SS mutant strain showed a statistically significant defect in\n\nFIG 2 Expression, production, and secretion analysis of selected SPI-19 T6SS\ncomponents under different in vitro conditions. (A) Activity of lacZ operon\nfusions to hcp1, clpV, icmF, hcp2, and vgrG during the bacterial growth curve.\nExpression was measured as \t-galactosidase activity (expressed as Miller\nunits).

Relative quantification (RQ) of the Hcp1 protein was deter-\nmined by densitometric analysis and is expressed as the ratio against the pro-\nduction levels of the nonspecific band detected with the 3�-FLAG antibody.\nDetection of the RNA polymerase by an �-sigma 70 antibody was used as a\ncontrol to analyze protein secretion in the cell culture supernatants. Under\nstandard bacterial growth conditions (LB), samples were acquired at both\nexponential (Ex; OD600 of 0.3) and stationary (St; OD600 of 1.8) phases of\ngrowth.\n\nSPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular Survival\n\nApril 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1213\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nintracellular survival compared to the wild-type strain (Fig. 5).\nBacterial loads per macrophage at 20 h postuptake were similar to\nthose observed for the ssaG and aroA mutant strains.\n\nTo directly link the phenotype observed for T6SS mutant\nstrains to T6SS functionality, the �clpV mutant was transformed\nwith a plasmid harboring a wild-type copy of the clpV gene and\ngentamicin protection assays were performed. As shown in Fig. 6,\nintroduction of the clpV gene in trans restored the ability of the S.\nGallinarum �clpV strain to survive within RAW264.7 and HD11\nmacrophages.\n\nTo determine if SPI-19 T6SS contributes to cytotoxicity and\nhost cell death, as described for other T6SS (40–42), macrophages\nwere infected with either the wild-type strain or the �SPI-19 mu-\ntant. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by release of lactate dehydroge-\nnase (LDH) to the culture media, and cell viability was assayed by\npropidium iodide (PI) incorporation and analysis of the sub-G1\npopulation by flow cytometry. The sub-G1 population is com-\nmonly used as an index of apoptotic cell death (43). As shown in\nFig. 7, no differences in cytotoxicity, viability, and cell death were\nobserved between the wild-type and mutant strains in either mu-\nrine or avian macrophages. Altogether, these results clearly indi-\ncate that SPI-19 and the T6SS encoded therein contribute to S.\nGallinarum intracellular survival in both murine and avian mac-\nrophages, and that this T6SS does not contribute to Salmonella-\ninduced cytotoxicity and host cell death of infected macrophages.\n\nFinally, to assess if the VgrG protein is translocated into the\ncytosol of infected macrophages, a FRET-based fluorescent assay\nwas performed using the CCF4/AM substrate. This method has\nbeen used recently to monitor VgrG translocation in Vibrio chol-\nerae (37). A reporter gene fusion was constructed by cloning the\nvgrG ORF into plasmid pFlagTEM-1, which allows the production\nof \t-lactamase fusion proteins under the control of an IPTG-\ninducible promoter (25). VgrG-BlaTEM translocation into the\nhost cytosol allows processing of the FRET fluorescent sub-\nstrate CCF4/AM. RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were in-\n\nfected with S. Gallinarum strains harboring plasmids encoding\neither VgrG-BlaTEM or SipA-BlaTEM fusion proteins. The SipA-\nBlaTEM fusion was used as a positive control, as it corresponds to\na known SPI-1 T3SS translocated effector protein (26). As a con-\ntrol, infection experiments were also performed using the S. Ty-\nphimurium 14028s strain. Translocation was assessed by both\nfluorometric plate reader quantification and epifluorescence mi-\ncroscopy. As expected, translocation of SipA was observed for S.\nTyphimurium in both macrophages by fluorometric quantifica-\ntion (see File S1 in the supplemental material). However, in the\ncase of S. Gallinarum, we could not detect translocation of SipA or\nVgrG fusion proteins into either macrophage cell line (see File S1).\nIn spite of this, epifluorescence microscopy analysis showed that a\nvery small number of cells per field presented substrate processing\nin macrophages infected with the S. Gallinarum strains harboring\npSipA/FT or pVgrG/FT (see File S1).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe recent discovery of at least 5 different T6SSs in Salmonella has\ngenerated many questions of whether these systems contribute to\nSalmonella host and environmental adaptation. We have previ-\nously shown that SPI-19 T6SS contributes to efficient colonization\nof chicks infected with S. Gallinarum, suggesting a role for this\nT6SS in the interaction of Salmonella with cells of the reticuloen-\ndothelial system (7). In this study, we characterized SPI-19 T6SS\nby analyzing the expression, production, and translocation of se-\nlected components/effectors and by defining its role in the inter-\naction of S. Gallinarum with murine and avian macrophages.\n\nExpression analysis of five SPI-19 T6SS core components re-\nvealed a growth phase-dependent regulation, with an increase in\ntheir expression when the bacteria reached the onset of stationary\nphase (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, analysis of the production of the\nstructural/secreted proteins Hcp1, Hcp2, and VgrG showed an\ninverse relationship regarding growth phase regulation, with in-\ncreased protein levels detected at exponential phase (Fig. 2B). This\n\nFIG 3 SPI-19 T6SS is not involved in interbacterial killing. Survival of prey strains listed below the x axis was determined by measuring the corresponding CFU\nafter 1 week of exposure to either the wild type or a �SPI-19 mutant of S. Gallinarum. Data represent CFU from three independent experiments. Bars represent\nmean values, and error bars denote standard deviations. No statistically significant differences between the mutant and the wild type were determined by one-way\nANOVA with Dunnett’s posttest.\n\nBlondel et al.\n\n1214 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\ndiscrepancy between gene expression and protein production sug-\ngests that these components are under posttranscriptional regula-\ntory mechanisms, as described for other T6SS (44, 45). Growth\nphase-dependent expression and production of T6SS compo-\nnents was not unexpected. Core components of the T6SSs of Yer-\nsinia pestis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been shown to be\nregulated by the bacterial phase of growth (46, 47), and T6SSs of\n\nAeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aerugi-\nnosa have been linked to quorum-sensing regulatory mechanisms\n(48–50).\n\nAnalysis of culture supernatants failed to demonstrate secre-\ntion of either Hcp1, Hcp2, or VgrG, even under the growth con-\nditions that favored their production (Fig. 2B). In this context, it is\npossible that secretion of the SPI-19 T6SS is regulated by a post-\n\nFIG 4 Intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP fusion protein.

In agreement with this notion, it has been\nreported that T6SS activation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires\na serine-threonine kinase and a phosphatase that regulate the\nphosphorylation status of a forkhead-associated (FHA) inner\nmembrane protein (51). Even though the SPI-19 T6SS locus does\nnot encode putative serine-threonine kinase and a phosphatase, it\n\ndoes encode a putative FHA domain-containing protein\n(SG1038) (7). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that activation\nof the SPI-19 T6SS depends on a similar posttranslational regula-\ntory mechanism.\n\nIn order to dissect the putative roles of the SPI-19 T6SS, we\ntested its contribution to interaction with bacterial cells and mac-\nrophages. Interbacterial killing assays failed to demonstrate anti-\n\nFIG 5 Contribution of SPI-19 T6SS to Salmonella intracellular survival. Gentamicin protection assays were performed using RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages\ninfected with the corresponding wild-type and mutant strains.

Nevertheless, it is important to mention that this\nassay is not comprehensive, as other unidentified Gram-negative\nbacteria can be the target of SPI-19 T6SS, and other inducing\nsignals might be important for activating SPI-19 T6SS-dependent\nkilling. Furthermore, the presence of a toxin/antitoxin module\n(Fig. 1B) suggests that the SPI-19 T6SS could indeed be involved\nin interbacterial killing.\n\nCell culture-based assays revealed that the VgrG protein was\nproduced after Salmonella internalization by cultured murine and\navian macrophages (Fig. 4). Preferential production of VgrG\nupon phagocytosis was not unexpected, because expression of\nT6SS components within macrophages has been described for\nother T6SS, including those encoded in the tss5 locus of Burkhold-\neria pseudomallei, the FPI island of Francisella tularensis, the\nT6SS1 locus of Burkholderia mallei, and the vas cluster of Vibrio\ncholerae, all of which are upregulated upon phagocytosis (re-\nviewed in reference 36).\n\nWhen intracellular production of the VgrG-GFP fusion pro-\ntein was determined, GFP fluorescence was observed in the cyto-\nplasm of infected macrophages, suggesting that the VgrG protein\ncould be translocated into the host cell cytosol. To test this, a\nVgrG-BlaTEM fusion was constructed, and CCF4/AM processing\nwas evaluated in murine and avian macrophages. Even though\nvisual inspection through epifluorescence microscopy revealed\ntranslocation in a small percentage of the total cell population,\nfluorometric plate reader quantification did not determine a sig-\nnificant increase in the fluorescent substrate processing. Taking\ninto account that S. Gallinarum is internalized significantly less\nefficiently by macrophages than S. Typhimurium, and that trans-\nlocation of the positive-control SipA was observed by epifluores-\ncence microscopy but not detected by fluorescence quantification\nin S. Gallinarum, it is plausible to think that VgrG is indeed trans-\n\nlocated under these conditions. Nevertheless, further experiments\nwill be needed to clarify this issue, including the construction of\ndifferent reporter fusions attaching to the VgrG protein.\n\nUnexpectedly, fluorescence microscopy analysis showed that\nthe VgrG-GFP protein was detected throughout the bacterial cell\nand not in punctate foci in the bacterial membrane, as seen for\nother T6SS structural components (52). One possible explanation\nis that the GFP reporter affects the normal function of the VgrG\nprotein, including its subcellular localization. To test this hypoth-\nesis, we performed gentamicin protection assays in murine and\navian macrophages infected with either the wild-type or VgrG-\nGFP strain. Results from these assays suggest that the fusion pro-\ntein is partially impaired in T6SS function (see File S2 in the sup-\nplemental material).\n\nThe SPI-19 T6SS expression data are reminiscent of what has\nbeen described for the Salmonella SPI-2 T3SS. The genes encoding\nstructural components of the SPI-2 T3SS are upregulated upon\nphagocytosis (53, 54), including the ssaG gene, which encodes a\ntranslocon component of the needle complex. Expression of the\nssaG gene responds to the DNA supercoiling status of the bacterial\ncell chromosome, as it adapts to the intracellular environment.\nThis activation depends on the direct binding of the Fis protein to\nthe ssaG promoter region (55). Several Fis-regulated genes show a\ngrowth phase-dependent gene expression (56, 57) due to en-\nhanced levels of the Fis protein at exponential phase. Therefore,\nthe increased levels of Hcp2 and VgrG proteins in the exponential\nphase of growth could be due to increased levels of Fis. In support\nof this notion, we have identified the presence of several Fis bind-\ning sites in the promoter regions of hcp2 and vgrG (see File S3 in\nthe supplemental material). Further work will be needed to clarify\nthis hypothesis and to identify the global regulators that seem to be\nregulating the expression, production, and function of SPI-19\n\nFIG 7 SPI-19 T6SS does not contribute to Salmonella-induced cell death of infected macrophages. RAW264.7 and HD11 macrophages were infected with either\nthe wild-type or �SPI-19 mutant strain, and gentamicin protection assays were performed. After 20 h postuptake, cytotoxicity was evaluated by LDH release, and\ncell death by was determined by propidium iodide incorporation and cell cycle analysis of infected macrophages. NI, noninfected. Bars represent mean values,\nand error bars denote standard deviations. No statistical significant differences between the mutant and the wild type were determined by one-way ANOVA with\nDunnett’s posttest.\n\nSPI-19 T6SS Is Required for Intracellular Survival\n\nApril 2013 Volume 81 Number 4 iai.asm.org 1217\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nT6SS in Salmonella under in vitro growth and cell culture condi-\ntions.\n\nIntracellular production of VgrG indicated a possible role of\nthe SPI-19 T6SS in the interaction of S. Gallinarum with macro-\nphages. Gentamicin protection assays revealed that SPI-9 T6SS\ncontributes to Salmonella intracellular survival in both murine\nand avian macrophages. Upon phagocytosis, Salmonella is en-\ngulfed in a compartment known as the Salmonella-containing\nvacuole (SCV), and through the orchestrated action of SPI-1 and\nSPI-2 T3SS-secreted effector proteins, the bacterium ensures its\nsurvival by avoiding phagosome maturation (58). SCV biogenesis\nis usually divided in early (�30 min), intermediate (30 min to 5\nh), and late stages (�5 h), with a defined set of T3SS effectors\ninvolved in each stage (59, 60). By altering phagosome biogenesis,\nSalmonella is able to reside in mature SCVs that localize in a peri-\nnuclear region associated with the Golgi network late after infec-\ntion (60, 61).\n\nIn S. Gallinarum, the SPI-2 T3SS has been shown to be impor-\ntant for the ability of the bacteria to survive within murine and\navian macrophages from 1 h postuptake (14, 15). In agreement\nwith this, we observed that the SPI-2 T3SS �ssaG mutant strain\nshowed a significant defect on intracellular survival at 2 h\npostuptake. In contrast, the �SPI-19 and �clpV mutants showed a\nsignificant defect only at 20 h postuptake. These observations sug-\ngest that either (i) the T3SS and T6SS contribute to Salmonella\nsurvival by modulating different stages of SCV biogenesis, or (ii)\nthe T6SS promotes replication of Salmonella once it has escaped\nfrom the phagolysosomal fate, as has been shown for other viru-\nlence-related loci, including the PhoP/Q regulon (62). Further\nexperiments regarding the kinetics of phagolysosomal fusion and\nreplication rates of T6SS mutant strains will be needed to clarify\nthese issues.\n\nDespite the role of SPI-19 in intracellular survival, there was no\nsignificant impact on host cell death and cytotoxicity of infected\nmacrophages in vitro, as seen for other T6SSs that are involved in\nthe interaction of the bacteria with cells of the immune system (6).\nNotwithstanding this, it is plausible to think that the SPI-19 T6SS\ncould influence other processes triggered after infection of mac-\nrophages, including the production and secretion of proinflam-\nmatory cytokines and chemokines. In this context, it has been\nshown that immune responses generated by infection with S. Gal-\nlinarum are critical for the virulence and pathogenicity of this\nserotype both in vitro and in vivo (11, 12, 63, 64). Therefore, con-\ntribution of the SPI-19 T6SS to in vivo colonization of infected\nchicks is mediated by these processes in addition to intracellular\nsurvival within macrophages. Future work will be needed to de-\ntermine these issues.\n\nIn agreement with our findings, other authors have pointed\nout a role for T6SSs in the interaction of Salmonella with host cells.\nLibby and colleagues (65) identified several genes linked to the\nSPI-6 T6SS of S. Typhi which are required for systemic infection in\na humanized mouse model. In addition, Wang and colleagues\n(66) recently reported that a mutant in an essential SPI-6 T6SS\ncore component enhanced the ability of S. Typhi to invade epithe-\nlial cells and reduced Salmonella-induced cytotoxicity toward\nthese cells. More recently, Liu and colleagues (67) have shown that\nlack of SPI-6 T6SS in S. Typhimurium leads to reduced Salmonella\nsurvival and proliferation within infected murine macrophages\nand a defect in mice colonization. Finally, Mulder and colleagues\n(68) reported that several SPI-6 T6SS core components and SPI-6\n\nT6SS-associated gene clusters contribute to S. Typhimurium in-\ntracellular survival within murine macrophages and systemic dis-\nsemination in mice.\n\nSince the evidence described above shows that both SPI-6 and\nSPI-19 T6SSs are involved in the ability of Salmonella to survive\nwithin macrophages, it is tempting to speculate that despite hav-\ning distinct phylogenetic origins, these two T6SSs are functionally\nredundant.\n\nIn the context of Salmonella evolution, the functional implica-\ntions of this potential redundancy are intriguing. Comparative\ngenomic analysis of T6SSs in Salmonella have suggested that a\ncommon ancestor of SPI-19-containing serotypes harbored both\nSPI-6 and SPI-19 T6SSs in their genomes. During evolution, some\nserotypes maintained both T6SSs (e.g., Dublin and Weltevreden),\nothers have lost SPI-6 T6SS while maintaining SPI-19 T6SS (e.g.,\nGallinarum and Agona), and still others lost both T6SS loci (e.g.,\nEnteritidis) (7). Therefore, it would be of interest to determine if\nthese systems are indeed redundant or if there are subtle differ-\nences in their function that could explain why some Salmonella\nserotypes retained one of these systems over the other, and if they\ndifferentially contribute to the adaptation of Salmonella serotypes\nto different hosts and environments.\n\nIn conclusion, in this work we have demonstrated that SPI-19\nT6SS contributes to Salmonella intracellular survival and that the\nVgrG protein is preferentially produced once the bacteria have\nbeen internalized by the cells. Altogether, our work expands the\nknown set of virulence factors employed by Salmonella to subvert\nthe immune system of its hosts.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are indebted to R.
