are\nunsatisfactory. Oxidative stress in the ischemic limbs may accelerate apoptosis of injected EPCs, leading to less\nneovascularization. Forkhead transcription factor 4 (FOXO4) was reported to play a pivotal role in apoptosis signaling of\nEPCs in response to oxidative stress. Accordingly, we assessed whether FOXO4-knockdown EPCs (FOXO4KD-EPCs) could\nsuppress the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and augment the neovascularization capacity in ischemic limbs. We\ntransfected small interfering RNA targeted against FOXO4 of human EPCs to generate FOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs and confirmed a\n\nsuccessful knockdown. FOXO4KD-EPCs gained resistance to apoptosis in response to hydrogen peroxide in vitro. Oxidative\nstress stained by dihydroethidium was stronger for the immunodeficient rat ischemic limb tissue than for the rat non-\nischemic one. Although the number of apoptotic EPCs injected into the rat ischemic limb was greater than that of apoptotic\nEPCs injected into the rat non-ischemic limb, FOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs injected into the rat ischemic limb brought less apoptosis and\n\nmore neovascularization than EPCs. Taken together, the use of FOXO4KD-EPCs with resistance to oxidative stress-induced\napoptosis may be a new strategy to augment the effects of therapeutic angiogenesis by intramuscular injection of EPCs.\n\nCitation: Nakayoshi T, Sasaki K-i, Kajimoto H, Koiwaya H, Ohtsuka M, et al.

Early pro-\n\nangiogenic cells (EPCs) [2], which were reported to contribute to\n\nadult neovascularization, may offer more options for cell therapy.\n\nEPCs can be ex vivo-expanded out of isolated bone marrow-derived\n\nmononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and peripheral blood-derived\n\nmononuclear cells (PB-MNCs) [3], and these cells have been used\n\nfor cell therapy in large-scale clinical trials [4]. We and others\n\nperformed therapeutic angiogenesis by intramuscular injection of\n\nBM-MNCs and PB-MNCs for patients with critical limb ischemia\n\nand reported the effects and safeties [5–8]. However, the effects\n\nhave been unsatisfactory. Although we and others reported that\n\nthe impaired migration capacity of atherosclerotic patient-derived\n\nBM-MNCs and EPCs in vitro was related to the impaired\n\nneovascularization capacity of the cells in vivo [9,10], there may\n\nbe other reasons for the unsatisfactory effects.\n\nIn ischemic limbs, exposure to acute or chronic hypoxia induces\n\noxidative stress to the skeletal muscle in animals and humans [11–\n\n13]. In addition, it has been reported that oxidative stress is a\n\nmediator of apoptosis [14,15]. Thus, ischemia-induced oxidative\n\nstress may be increased in the limbs of patients with critical limb\n\nischemia and the ischemia-induced oxidative stress may accelerate\n\napoptosis of EPCs injected to the ischemic limbs. The loss of viable\n\nEPCs may result in impaired neovascularization of the ischemic\n\nlimb. If we can augment the anti-apoptosis capacity of EPCs to\n\noxidative stress before the injection, the effects of therapeutic\n\nangiogenesis may be more desirable. Therefore, we tried in this\n\nstudy to find out how we could augment the anti-apoptosis\n\ncapacity of EPCs in response to oxidative stress. Brunet et al.\n\nreported that apoptosis of human epithelial cells was suppressed by\n\ninactivation of forkhead transcription factor (FOXO) [16].\n\nNemoto et al. reported that FOXO was activated by reactive\n\noxygen species (ROS) [17]. In EPCs, Urbich et al. reported that\n\nFOXO4, but not FOXO1 and FOXO3a, played a pivotal role in\n\na signaling of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis [18]. Accordingly,\n\nwe transfected small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted against\n\nFOXO4 of EPCs to generate FOXO4-knockdown EPCs (FOX-\n\nO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs) and examined whether FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs gained\n\nresistance to apoptosis in response to oxidative stress in vitro. In\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92626\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\naddition, we assessed whether intramuscular injection of FOX-\n\nO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs to the rat ischemic limbs could augment neovascu-\n\nlarization though the augmented anti-apoptosis capacity to\n\nischemia-induced oxidative stress.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEPC Culture\nWe first obtained written informed consent by documentation\n\nfor this study and then collected peripheral blood from healthy\n\nvolunteers and coronary artery disease patients with more than\n\ntwo of the following atherosclerotic risk factors: age .65 years,\n\ncurrent smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. This\n\nstudy conformed to the principles outlined in the Declaration of\n\nHelsinki and was approved by the Committees on the Ethics\n\nReview Board of Kurume University School of Medicine. We\n\ngenerated EPCs from peripheral blood-derived mononuclear cells\n\n(PB-MNCs), as we and others previously reported [9,19]. In brief,\n\nPB-MNCs were isolated by density gradient centrifugation with\n\nFicoll (Ficoll-Paque PLUS, GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB) and\n\nseeded onto a plate coated with fibronectin (Sigma) and cultured\n\nin endothelial basal medium with supplements (EBM-2 BulletKit,\n\nClonetics) and 20% fatal bovine serum (FBS) for 4 days at 37uC,\n5% CO2, in a humidified incubator.\n\nEPC Apoptosis Assay\nWe assessed apoptosis of EPCs in vitro and in vivo using the\n\nterminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) method. First, we\n\nassessed apoptosis of EPCs subjected to malnutrition stress,\n\nhypoxic stress, or oxidative stress in vitro. We incubated EPCs\n\nwith serum-free culture medium, with hypoxic chamber (O2 1.0%;\n\nCO2 5.0%, N2; 94%; APM-30DR, ASTEC), or with 1 mM\n\nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-added culture medium for 18 h at\n\n37uC. H2O2 was used experimentally as the chemical agent of\nexogenous oxidative stress [18]. The cells were detached from the\n\nculture plates, washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 1%\n\nparaformaldehyde. TUNEL-positive cells were stained with an\n\nFigure 1.

In addition, another apoptosis\n\ndetection kit (APO-DIRECTTM Kit, BD Biosciences) was used\n\nto analyze TUNEL-positive cells using flow cytometry (FACS-\n\nCanto II, Becton Dickinson). These staining procedures were\n\nperformed according to the respective manufacturers’ instructions.\n\nThe flow cytometric analysis was performed with software\n\nsupplied by the manufacturer (FACSDiva, Becton Dickinson).\n\nSecond, we assessed apoptosis of EPCs injected into the rat\n\nischemic limbs. We labeled EPCs with a fluorescent red reagent\n\nDil (CellTracker CM-Dil C7000, Invitrogen) according to the\n\nmanufacturer’s instructions and injected a total of 50 mL\nphosphate buffered saline (PBS) with or without EPCs (56105\n\ncells per rat) into five equally-spaced points on the ischemic and\n\nnon-ischemic adductor muscles 2 h after the surgery of hindlimb\n\nischemia. We harvested the tissues of the ischemic and non-\n\nischemic adductor muscles 24 h after the injection of EPCs and\n\nfixed 5-mm frozen sections of the tissues with 2% paraformalde-\nhyde for 10 min at room temperature. TUNEL-positive cells in\n\nthe tissues were stained with an apoptosis detection kit (In Situ Cell\n\nDeath Detection Kit, Fluorescein, Roche) according to the\n\nmanufacturer’s instructions. We counted the numbers of TU-\n\nNEL-positive and TUNEL-negative EPCs in 10 randomly selected\n\nhigh-power fields (6400) with a fluorescence microscope (BX50,\nOLYMPUS) and divided the number of TUNEL-positive EPCs\n\nby the total number of EPCs to calculate the apoptosis ratio for the\n\ninjected EPCs.\n\nWestern Blotting\nWe harvested EPCs and thigh tissues from the culture plate and\n\nrat ischemic limbs, respectively. Then, we lysed them with a buffer\n\n(0.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5.0 M NaCl, 10% Triton X-100, 10%\n\nglycerol, 0.2 M Na3VO4, 0.5 M NaF, 0.1 M NaPP). Twenty\n\nmicrograms of protein per sample was electrophoresed on a\n\npolyacrylamide gel (NuPAGE Novex 4–12% Bis-Tris Gel,\n\nInvitrogen), and the protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene\n\ndifluoride membrane (iBlot Gel Transfer Stacks, Invitrogen).

The study protocol was approved by the Institutional\n\nAnimal Care and use Committee of Kurume University School of\n\nMedicine. All procedures for rats were performed under anesthesia\n\nwith isoflurane (5% in 100% oxygen for induction, 1–2% in 100%\n\noxygen for maintenance) using an animal anesthesia apparatus\n\n(TK-5, Bio Machinery). Depth of anesthesia was monitored by the\n\ntoe pinch reflex test.\n\nROS Production Assay\nTo assess the oxidative stress of rat ischemic limbs, we analyzed\n\nthe generation of ROS in the limbs. At 14 days after the hindlimb\n\nischemia induction, the rats were sacrificed by cervical dislocation\n\nafter anesthesia with isoflurane, and the tissues of the ischemic and\n\nnon-ischemic adductor muscles were harvested. We made 5-mm\nfrozen sections of the tissues and incubated them with 2 mmol/L\n\ndihydroethidium (DHE) (Invitrogen), which is a probe to detect\n\nROS production, for 30 min at 37uC in the dark. The DHE\nstaining of the section was assessed in 5 randomly selected high-\n\npower fields (6200) under a fluorescence microscope (BX50,\nOLYMPUS). The DHE fluorescence intensity was quantified with\n\nimage analysis computer software (Image-Pro Plus 6.2J, Media\n\nCybernetics, Inc.).\n\nLimb Perfusion Measurement\nAt 14 days after the intramuscular injection of PBS with or\n\nwithout EPCs (56105 cells per rat) to the rat ischemic limb, we\ndetermined the blood flow of the rat ischemic and non-ischemic\n\nlimbs with a laser Doppler blood flow imager (moorLDI-Mark 2,\n\nMoor Instruments Ltd.). Before scanning of the blood flow, rats\n\nwere placed on a heating pad (FHP-300S, TGK) at 37uC to\nminimize variations in temperature. The mean of laser Doppler\n\nflux was analyzed on both limbs with software supplied by the\n\nmanufacturer. To avoid variables due to ambient light and\n\ntemperature, the calculated blood perfusion was expressed as the\n\nischemic/non-ischemic hindlimb blood flow ratio [9,19].\n\nCapillary Density Analysis\nFor histological assessment of neovascularization of the rat\n\nischemic limb intramuscularly injected PBS with or without EPCs,\n\nwe analyzed the capillary density in five-mm frozen sections of the\nischemic adductor muscles at 14 days after the injection. Capillary\n\nendothelial cells were stained with CD31 monoclonal antibody\n\nFOXO4, BimEL, and cleaved caspase-3 in EPCs.

In the western blot\n\nanalysis, results of the expression of FOXO3a or FOXO4 in EPCs\n\nand H2O2-treated-EPCs were analyzed with the paired Student’s\n\nt-test. Results of the expressions of FOXO4 in healthy volunteer-\n\nand atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs were analyzed with the\n\nStudent’s t-test. Results of DHE tissue staining were also analyzed\n\nwith the Student’s t-test. Other results were analyzed with one-way\n\nANOVA with Tukey’s post-hoc test. P values ,0.05 were\n\nconsidered statistically significant. All analyses were performed\n\nwith SPSS version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.).\n\nResults\n\nApoptosis of EPCs in vitro\nIn atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs, the percentage of\n\nTUNEL-positive EPCs (i.e. apoptotic EPCs) was significantly\n\ngreater for EPCs subjected to H2O2 (i.e. oxidative stress) than to\n\nserum-free medium (i.e. malnutrition stress) or to low oxygen (i.e.\n\nhypoxic stress). These results suggested high susceptibility of\n\natherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs for oxidative stress-induced\n\napoptosis (Fig. 1).\n\nFOXO Expressions in Apoptotic EPCs\nIn atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs, the expression of\n\nFOXO3a in H2O2-treated EPCs was comparable to that in\n\nnon-treated EPCs (Fig. 2A, B). However, the expression of\nFOXO4 in H2O2-treated EPCs was significantly greater than that\n\nin non-treated EPCs (Fig. 2A, B). These results suggested that\nFOXO4 was more essential for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis\n\nof atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs than FOXO3a.\n\nIntriguingly, the expression of FOXO4 in EPCs under normal\n\nconditions was significantly greater for atherosclerotic patient-\n\nderived EPCs than for healthy volunteer-derived EPCs (Fig. 2C,\nD). The baseline clinical characteristics of healthy volunteer- and\natherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs are shown in Table 1.\nMoreover, the expression of FOXO4 in EPCs subjected to H2O2\nwas augmented in atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs only\n\n(Fig. 2C, D). These results suggested again that FOXO4 was\nessential for oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of atherosclerotic\n\npatient-derived EPCs.\n\nTaken together, we adopted FOXO4 to generate FOXO-\n\nknockdown EPCs gained resistance to oxidative stress-induced\n\napoptosis and used atherosclerotic patient-derived cells for the\n\ngeneration.\n\nathymic nude rats (left panels) and fluorescence microscopic photos of\nCD31-positive endothelial capillaries in the ischemic limb (right panels)\n14 days after intramuscular injection of PBS, EPCs, NT-EPCs, or FOXO4KD-\nEPCs to the right ischemic limb.

FOXO4 expression in FOXO4 siRNA transfected\nEPCs was significantly lower by 39.367.2% than that in non-\n\ntransfected EPCs, indicating successful generation of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-\n\nEPCs (Fig. 3B).\n\nPhenotype of EPCs\nIn the flow cytometric analysis, the expressions of CD133,\n\nCD34, CD31, and KDR, which were reported as surface antigens\n\nof EPCs [3,9,19], were comparable among EPCs, NT-EPCs, and\n\nFOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs (Fig. 4). These results indicated that siRNA\ntransfection did not alter the phenotype of EPCs.\n\nAnti-apoptosis Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vitro\nAfter treatment of EPCs with H2O2, the number of TUNEL-\n\npositive EPCs was significantly smaller for FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs than\n\nfor EPCs and NT-EPCs (Fig. 5A–C). The expressions of BimEL\nand cleaved caspase-3, which were reported as pro-apoptotic\n\nproteins of EPCs [18,22], were significantly decreased as well as\n\nthe expression of FOXO4 in FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs treated with H2O2\n(Fig. 6A,B). These results suggested that anti-apoptosis capacity\nfor oxidative stress was augmented in FOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs.\n\nROS Production in Athymic Nude Rat Ischemic Limbs\nIn the rat ischemic and contralateral non-ischemic limb tissues\n\nstained with DHE, the fluorescence intensity of DHE was\n\nsignificantly greater for the ischemic tissues than for the non-\n\nischemic tissues, indicating that more ROS was produced in the\n\nischemic limb than in the non-ischemic limb (Fig. 7A, B). In\naddition, the DHE expression in the ischemic limb injected EPCs\n\nor FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs was comparable to that in the ischemic limb\n\ninjected PBS (Fig. 7C, D). These results suggested that\nintramuscularly injected EPCs or FOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs did not reduce\n\nROS in the ischemic limb tissues.\n\nAnti-apoptosis Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vivo\nAt 24 h after intramuscular injection of EPCs to the rat\n\nischemic and contralateral non-ischemic limbs, significantly more\n\nEPCs were positive for TUNEL in the ischemic limb than in the\n\nnon-ischemic limb (Fig. 8A, B), indicating more apoptosis of the\ninjected EPCs in the ischemic limb than in the non-ischemic limb.\n\nHowever, the number of apoptotic EPCs was significantly smaller\n\nfor FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs but not NT-EPCs in the ischemic limb\n\n(Fig. 8A, B), suggesting the augmented anti-apoptosis capacity of\nFOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs in the ischemic limb.\n\nNeovascularization Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs in vivo\nAt 14 days after intramuscular injection of PBS or EPCs to the\n\nrat ischemic limb, the blood flow ratio and the CD31-positive\n\ncapillary density of the ischemic limb were significantly greater for\n\nthe injection of EPCs than for the injection of PBS (Fig. 9A–C),\nwhich were further increased by the injection of FOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs,\n\nbut not NT-EPCs (Fig. 9A–C).\n\nIncorporation of EPCs in Endothelial Cells in vivo\nAt 60 h after intramuscular injection of human-derived EPCs in\n\nthe rat ischemic limb, human-specific proliferative cell nuclear\n\nantigens (PCNA)-positive cells, which were defined as injected\n\nEPCs in proliferative phase, were incorporated in rat CD31-\n\npositive endothelial cells (Fig. 10A). Moreover, the number of\nPCNA-positive cells incorporated in CD31-positive endothelial\n\ncells was significantly greater in the injection of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs\n\nthan in the injections of EPCs and NT-EPCs (Fig. 10B). This\nresult suggested that more FOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs survived in the\n\nischemic limb tissue and were incorporated in endothelial cells of\n\nthe tissue for augmenting neovascularization of the limb.\n\nSecretion Capacity of FOXO4KD-EPCs\nThe concentrations of VEGF, b-FGF, IGF-1, and SDF-1a\n\nsecreted from EPCs in the culture medium were comparable\n\namong EPCs, NT-EPCs, and FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs (Table 2),\nsuggesting that there were no effect of FOX4-knockdown on the\n\nsecretion capacity of EPCs.\n\nAngiogenic Cytokines in Athymic Nude Rat Ischemic\nLimbs\nWe examined EPC-secreted angiogenic cytokines such as\n\nVEGF, b-FGF, IGF-1, and SDF-1 in the rat ischemic limb using\n\nwestern blot analysis. At 60 h after the EPCs injection, the\n\nexpressions of human specific VEGF, b-FGF, SDF-1, and IGF-1\n\nwere greater in the injection of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs than in the\n\ninjections of EPCs and NT-EPCs (Fig. 10C). These results\nsuggested that more FOXO4\n\nKD\n-EPCs survived in the ischemic\n\nCD31-positive endothelial cells were stained red.

In this study, oxidative stress was higher\n\ncytotoxic factor for EPCs than malnutrition and hypoxic stress\n\nin vitro. This result may suggest that a great number of EPCs that\n\nare injected to the ischemic limb lose the viability due to ischemia-\n\ninduced oxidative stress in the limb (Fig. 11A, B). Oxidative\nstress, which is caused by an imbalance between the production\n\nand accumulation of ROS and the body’s ability to manage them\n\nwith various antioxidants, was reported to be increase in ischemic\n\nskeletal muscles of human and rodent limbs [11–13]. In this study,\n\nthe expression of DHE, which is a probe to detect ROS\n\nproduction, was greater in the ischemic limb of athymic nude\n\nrat than in the contralateral non-ischemic limb of the rat,\n\nindicating that oxidative stress was increased in the rat ischemic\n\nlimb. Moreover, at 24 h after the intramuscular injection of EPCs\n\nto the rat limb with or without ischemia, the number of apoptotic\n\nEPCs was greater in the ischemic limb than in the non-ischemic\n\nlimb. These results suggested that intramuscularly injected EPCs\n\nto the ischemic limb resulted in apoptosis partly due to oxidative\n\nstress of the limb and a great number of viable EPCs with\n\nneovascularization capacity were lost from the limb.\n\nFOXO4-knockdown Suppressed Oxidative Stress-induced\nApoptosis of EPCs in vitro\nIt has been reported that oxidative stress activated FOXO and\n\nthe activation promoted apoptosis [16,17]. In this study, the\n\nexpression of FOXO4, but not FOXO3a, was augmented in\n\nH2O2-treated EPCs, which may suggest that oxidative stress\n\ninduces FOXO4-mediated apoptosis of EPCs. In addition,\n\nFOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs prevented oxidative stress-induced apoptosis\n\nin vitro and the expressions of pro-apoptotic proteins BimEL and\n\ncleaved caspase-3 were decreased in FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs in response\n\nto oxidative stress. Thus, we succeeded ex vivo in generating\n\nFOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs with augmented anti-apoptosis capacity for\n\noxidative stress.\n\nFOXO4KD-EPCs Contributed to Augment\nNeovascularization in vivo\nIn order to assess whether the ex vivo anti-apoptosis capacity of\n\nFOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs could work in vivo, we intramuscularly injected\n\nEPCs, NT-EPCs, or FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs into the rat ischemic limb\n\nand assessed neovascularization of the limb. At 24 h after the cell\n\ninjection, the number of apoptotic FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs was signif-\n\nicantly smaller than that of apoptotic EPCs or NT-EPCs in the\n\nlimb. The the injection of EPCs or NT-EPCs increased the blood\n\nflow and the capillary density of the rat ischemic limb more than\n\nthe injection of PBS at 14 days, which were further increased by\n\nthe injection of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs. Moreover, injected EPCs in\n\nproliferative phase were incorporated in endothelial cells of the\n\nlimb tissue and the number of the EPCs was significantly greater in\n\nthe injection of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs than in the injections of EPCs\n\nand NT-EPCs. These results suggested that the ex vivo anti-\n\napoptosis capacity of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs could work in the rat\n\nischemic limb to decrease the loss of intramuscularly injected\n\nEPCs and to let the surviving many EPCs fully bring out the\n\nFigure 11.

Urbich\net al. reported that EPCs secreted angiogenic proteins such as\n\nVEGF, SDF-1, and IGF-1 and thereby enhanced migration of\n\nmature endothelial cells for neovascularization of the ischemic\n\ntissue [21]. In this study, FOXO4-knockdown did not affect the\n\nsecretion of such angiogenic proteins. Given the augmented anti-\n\napoptosis capacity of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs in the ischemic limb, the\n\namount of angiogenic proteins secreted from intramuscularly\n\ninjected EPCs was greater for FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPC-injected limb than\n\nfor non-treated EPC-injected limb. This may be one of the\n\nmechanisms of augmented neovascularization by the injection of\n\nFOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs. Indeed, the expression of VEGF, b-FGF, SDF-\n\n1, and IGF-1 secreted from EPCs in the rat ischemic limb tissue\n\nwere greater in the injection of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs than in the\n\ninjections of EPCs and NT-EPCs.\n\nUrao et al. have recently reported in endothelial specific\n\ncatalase transgenic mice with hindlimb ischemia that endothelial\n\ncell-derived H2O2, which is a kind of ROS, plays a critical role in\n\nneovascularization of the ischemic limb [23]. Although we assume\n\nin this study that ischemia-induced oxidative stress plays an\n\nundesirable role in EPC-mediated neovascularization of the\n\nischemic limb, there may be the possibility that intramuscularly\n\ninjected EPCs reduced endothelial cell-derived H2O2 in the\n\nischemic limb and thereby impaired endothelial cell-regulated\n\nneovascularization. However, this possibility was thought to be\n\nunlikely because the expression of DHE in EPC- or FOXO4\nKD\n\n-\n\nEPC-injected ischemic limb tissue was comparable to that in PBS-\n\ninjected ischemic limb tissue. Thus, FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs injection to\n\nthe ischemic limb did not affect neovascularization regulated by\n\nthe endothelial cell-derived ROS but contributed to augment\n\nEPC-mediated neovascularization by the decrease of oxidative\n\nstress-induced apoptosis of EPCs.\n\nStudy Limitations\nThere were several limitations in this study. First, we used\n\nEPCs, but not MNCs, in this study. Further, EPCs were generated\n\nfrom PB-MNCs, but not from BM-MNCs. FOXO4-knockdown in\n\nBM-MNCs should be examined in our future study. Second, we\n\ndid not directly examine the activation of FOXO4 (e.g. the\n\nexpression of phosphorylated FOXO4) in apoptotic EPCs but\n\nindirectly assessed the activation by expressions of BimEL and\n\ncleaved caspasse-3. Third, we assessed the in vivo neovasculariza-\n\ntion capacity of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs in the ischemic limbs of rats\n\nwithout atherosclerotic risk factors. It has been reported that\n\nhindlimb ischemia induction in rodents with atherosclerotic risk\n\nfactors further increased oxidative stress in the plasma and\n\nischemic limb tissue [24–26]. Accordingly, in the ischemic limbs of\n\nrodents with atherosclerotic risk factors we may not be able to\n\nobtain the same neovascularization by FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs as we did\n\nin this study. Forth, we did not perform this study using healthy\n\nvolunteer-derived FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs in vivo. Although the expres-\n\nsion of FOXO4 in EPCs subjected to H2O2 in vitro was augmented\n\nin atherosclerotic patient-derived EPCs only, future studies are\n\nrequired to examine if the in vivo neovascularization capacity of\n\nhealthy volunteer-derived EPCs was augmented by FOXO4-\n\nknockdown of the cells as observed in atherosclerotic patient-\n\nderived EPCs. However, most critical limb ischemia patients\n\nundergoing therapeutic angiogenesis have several atherosclerotic\n\nrisk factors and the patient-derived cells are actually used in the\n\ntherapy, suggesting an appropriate use of atherosclerotic patient-\n\nderived cells for this study. Fifth, we were not able to examine the\n\nanti-apoptosis capacity of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs in vivo in several time\n\npoints after intramuscular injection to the rat ischemic limb,\n\nbecause we were not able to find any TUNEL-positive EPCs in the\n\nlimb 72 h after the injection of Dil-labeled EPCs (data not shown),\n\nsuggesting that apoptotic EPCs in the limb might be phagocytized\n\nby cells such as macrophages within 72 h of the injection. Thus, it\n\nmay be difficult to study the anti-apoptosis capacity of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-\n\nEPCs after 24 h of the injection to ischemic tissues. Sixth, we have\n\nperformed this study using hydrogen peroxide, but not other\n\nstimulators. Future studies are required to examine if other\n\nstimulators and transcriptional regulators, which were induced by\n\nhypoxic condition in the rat ischemic limb, related to apoptosis of\n\nEPCs. We do not consider that hydrogen peroxide is the main\n\nsource to induce apoptosis of EPCs intramuscularly injected in the\n\nischemic limb.\n\nConclusion\n\nFOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs gained resistance to oxidative stress-induced\n\napoptosis in the ischemic limb, resulting in decrease of the loss of\n\nworkable EPCs for neovascularization of the limb. Intramuscular\n\ninjection of FOXO4\nKD\n\n-EPCs may be a promising therapeutic\n\nstrategy for patients with critical limb ischemia.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Kimiko Kimura, Miho Kogure, and Miyuki Nishigata in the\n\ncardiovascular research institute, Kurume University for their excellent\n\ntechnical support in the flow cytometry, western blotting, ELISA, and\n\ntissue staining.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: KS.
