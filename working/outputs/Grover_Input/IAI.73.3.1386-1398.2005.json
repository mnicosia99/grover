The gingipains, comprising a group of cysteine proteinases\nand associated hemagglutinin domains, are major virulence determinants of this organism. As vascular\nexpression of leukocyte adhesion molecules is a critical determinant of tissue response to microbial challenge,\nthe objective of this study was to determine the capacity of gingipains to modulate the expression and function\nof these receptors. Given the potential multifunctional role of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1\n(PECAM-1) in the vasculature, the effect of gingipains on PECAM-1 expression by endothelial cells was\nexamined. Activated gingipains preferentially down-regulated PECAM-1 expression on endothelial cells com-\npared with vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule 1, but the reduction\nin PECAM-1 expression was completely inhibited in the presence of the cysteine proteinase inhibitor TLCK\n(N�-p-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone). Endothelial monolayers treated with activated gingipains demon-\nstrated progressive intercellular gap formation that correlated with reduced intercellular junctional PECAM-1\nexpression as determined by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. This was accompanied by\nenhanced transfer of both albumin and neutrophils across the monolayer. The results suggest that degradation\nof PECAM-1 by gingipains contributes to increased vascular permeability and neutrophil flux at disease sites.\n\nPeriodontal diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases af-\nfecting the well-vascularized connective tissues of the peri-\nodontium (20). Microbial challenge at the gingival sulcus leads\nto an inflammatory response in the adjacent soft tissues that is\ncharacterized by a migration of leukocytes from postcapillary\nvenules into the extravascular tissue. It has been shown that the\nnumerical density of vascular profiles in the connective tissue\nincreases significantly subjacent to the altered epithelial lining\nof the periodontal pocket (11). Characteristic endothelial cell\nadhesion molecule expression related to leukocyte infiltration\nof human gingiva has been demonstrated (38, 44).\n\nPorphyromonas gingivalis has been implicated as a major\netiological agent in the onset and progression of chronic peri-\nodontitis (59). The trypsin-like cysteine proteinases or gingi-\npains (Arg-gingipain, encoded by the two genes rgpA and rgpB,\nand a Lys-specific gingipain encoded by a single gene, kgp)\nhave been closely linked with the virulence of this gram-neg-\native anaerobic bacteria (28, 31, 36). The outer membrane-\nassociated gingipains (RgpA and Kgp) extracted from P. gin-\ngivalis ATCC 33277 contain a catalytic domain and a\nhemagglutinin/adhesin domain (54, 70). Cysteine proteinase\nactivities may affect cytokine inactivation and degradation (69,\n70), acquisition of metabolically necessary iron and porphyrin\nfrom hemoglobin (14), enhancement of vascular permeability\n\nthrough plasma prekallikrein activation and bradykinin release\n(33), and degradation of epithelial cell-cell junctional com-\nplexes (37).\n\nLeukocyte emigration from the bloodstream into tissues at\nsites of inflammation is controlled by sequential intercellular\nadhesion events with endothelial cells that line the vascular\nwall. The initial rolling and tethering steps are mediated by\nmembers of the selectin family including endothelial leukocyte\nadhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1 or E-selectin) and L-selectin\n(4, 8, 60). Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and\nintercellular cell adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), located on\nthe surface of cytokine-activated endothelium, belong to the\nimmunoglobulin supergene family and are considered to be\ninvolved in the next step of leukocyte-endothelium interaction,\nwhere a tighter adhesion takes place (5, 51). Gemmell et al.\nfound that endothelial cells did not express ELAM-1 in chron-\nically inflamed periodontal tissue (27). Other studies have in-\ndicated that ELAM-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 can be detected\non endothelial cells adjacent to the junctional epithelium early\nin the course of experimentally induced gingivitis (44, 50, 65),\nsuggesting that they are involved in crucial processes which\ndirect leukocyte migration into the tissues and toward the\ngingival sulcus. Further, ICAM-1 on oral epithelial cells has\nrecently been shown to be susceptible to proteolysis by gingi-\npains (63). The importance of cell adhesion molecules is high-\nlighted by the rapid and severe periodontitis that characterizes\nleukocyte adhesion deficiency where polymorphonuclear leu-\nkocytes (PMNs) are unable to migrate through the endothe-\nlium of gingival blood vessels (22).\n\nLeukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is followed by leu-\n\n* Corresponding author.

Studies have shown a role for PECAM-1 in inter-\nendothelial adhesion (16) and leukocyte-endothelial cell inter-\nactions (6). Muller et al. (45, 46) were the first to show that\npretreating monocytes or neutrophils with antibodies specific\nfor PECAM-1 inhibited their emigration across an endothelial\ncell monolayer in a quantitative in vitro assay of transendothe-\nlial migration. Other studies have also demonstrated an abnor-\nmal transit of polymorphonuclear leukocytes across vascular\nbasement membranes in PECAM-1-deficient mice (19, 64).\n\nPECAM-1 has also been implicated in vascular responses in\nwound healing, angiogenesis (15, 25), and the development of\nthe early cardiovascular system (2). Investigation of cultured\nPECAM-1-deficient endothelial cells has provided confirma-\ntory evidence that PECAM-1 has an important function in the\nmaintenance of a vascular permeability barrier (24). In the\nlesions of gingivitis and periodontitis, the expression of\nPECAM-1 on mononuclear infiltrates increases significantly\nwith increasing size of infiltrate (27). Although these studies\nimplicate cell adhesion molecules in the pathogenesis of peri-\nodontal disease, the ability of gingipains from P. gingivalis to\ninteract with these molecules has not been previously exam-\nined.\n\nIn this study we report that the gingipains adhere to human\numbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rapidly de-\ngrade PECAM-1 at endothelial cell lateral junctions to induce\nthe formation of intercellular gaps. In contrast, tumor necrosis\nfactor � (TNF-�)-induced VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 expression\non HUVECs is minimally affected by gingipains. Evidence is\npresented to show that loss of PECAM-1 on HUVECs can\nfacilitate neutrophil transmigration in vitro. Hence, gingipains\nof P. gingivalis may contribute to the vascular disruption of\nperiodontal tissue and facilitate leukocyte extravasation into\nthe site.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nChemicals and reagents. Bovine serum albumin, Evans blue dye, formyl-Met-\nLeu-Phe (fMLP), L-cysteine, paraformaldehyde, protease inhibitor cocktails (for\nmammalian tissues), sodium azide (NaN3), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), N�-\np-tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone (TLCK), Trizma base, Tris-hydrochloride\n(Tris-HCl), trypsin, and Tween 20 were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mis-\nsouri). Fetal calf serum (FCS) and RPMI medium were obtained from ICN\nBiochemicals (Irvine, Calif.); 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-pro-\npanesulfonate (CHAPS) was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, Calif.).\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and Trypticase soy broth were purchased from\nOxoid (Basingstoke, United Kingdom). Calcein-AM and Alexa Fluor 488 were\npurchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.). All reagents for electro-\nphoresis and Western blotting were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, Calif.).\n\nRecombinant cytokines and antibodies. Human recombinant TNF-� was ob-\ntained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.). Mouse monoclonal antibodies\n(MAb) specific for human CD31 (PECAM-1), CD62E (ELAM-1), and CD106 or\nVCAM-1 (MAb 51-10C9) were purchased from Becton Dickinson Inc. (Heidel-\nberg, Germany). A blocking antibody to PECAM-1 (clone HEC7) was also\npurchased from Research Diagnostics Inc. (Flanders, N.J.). MAb IIB2 was raised\nin mice against gingipains as previously described (14). IIB2 recognizes the\nhemagglutinin/adhesin domains, HA1 and HA3, of RgpA and Kgp (39 kDa)\nfrom P. gingivalis.\n\nBacterial strain and proteinase purification. P. gingivalis (ATCC 33277) was\ngrown in enriched Trypticase soy broth under anaerobic conditions for 48 h.\nOrganisms at a density of 1.5 gm/cm3 were suspended in saline, stirred for 1 h at\n4°C, washed three times with pyrogen-free water, and lyophilized. Arg-gingipain\nand Lys-gingipain proteinase-adhesin complexes were purified according to the\nmethod previously described (70). Purified gingipains were dialyzed against five\nchanges of PBS with 1 mM CaCl2, pH 7.5.\n\nBinding of gingipains to endothelial cells. HUVECs were isolated by collage-\nnase treatment of the vessels as described elsewhere (35). Endothelial cells were\nseeded in 1% gelatin-coated 12-well plates (Corning Costar, Cambridge, Mass.)\nin M199 medium supplemented with 30 �g of endothelial cell growth factor per\nml and containing 20% FCS, 10 U of heparin per ml, 50 U of penicillin ml, and\n50 �g of streptomycin per ml. Cells used in these experiments were confluent and\nat passage levels four through six. Before the experiment, FCS was withheld, and\nthe cells were cultured in M199 medium. Confluent endothelial cell monolayers\nwere then treated with 5 mM cysteine-activated RgpA and Kgp at concentrations\nof 210 to 0.9 nM (1:3 serial dilution) for 1 h at 37°C. In serum experiments, cell\nmonolayers were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 to 40% FCS or 2\nmM TLCK (dialyzed against PBS and cultured in the absence of serum) for 1 h\nat 37°C. HUVECs were also tested in the presence or absence of the indicated\nconcentrations of cysteine added to the gingipains. After the incubations, cells\nwere harvested by gentle scraping and washed three times with 2 ml of PBS,\nstained with mouse IIB2 MAb, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conju-\ngated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; Dako, Sydney, Australia), and\nthe relative labeling of the cell population was quantified in a Becton Dickinson\nFACScan analyzer. Isotype-matched IgG1 (Dako) was used as a control.\n\nEvaluation of PECAM-1 expression on HUVECs. Confluent HUVECs were\nincubated with a 5 mM concentration of cysteine-activated RgpA or Kgp at\nconcentrations of 70, 23, or 7.8 nM at 37°C without serum and harvested by\nscraping at 15-min intervals for up to 1 h. Gingipain-treated HUVECs were\nsimilarly cultured in the presence or absence of 5, 10, and 20% FCS or 2 mM\nTLCK for 1 h. Endothelial cells were then washed twice with cold PBS–0.1%\nbovine serum albumin–0.01% NaN3 and stained with the corresponding primary\nmouse anti-human MAbs (1:50) against PECAM-1 or with matched isotype\ncontrol antibody. Cells were then labeled with a 1:100 concentration of fluores-\ncein isothiocyanate-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako) and quantitated by\nusing a Becton Dickinson FACScan analyzer. Incubations were for 50 min at 4°C\nfor each stage. Volume gates were set to include the entire HUVEC population.\nData were collected as histograms of relative fluorescence in a logarithmic scale\non the x axis, with cell number as a linear scale on the y axis. To assess the effect\nof fixation on PECAM-1 expression, HUVECs were fixed in 3% paraformalde-\nhyde in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and washed twice with PBS. Fixed\nor unfixed endothelial cells were then incubated with activated gingipains (70 nM\neach) for 1 h at 37°C without serum. After the incubation, HUVECs were\nwashed, stained for surface PECAM-1, and analyzed by flow cytometry.\n\nWestern blot analysis of PECAM-1 expression on HUVECs after gingipains\ntreatment. Confluent HUVECs grown on 1% gelatin-coated six-well plates\n(Corning Costar) were cultured with activated RgpA or Kgp (70 nM each) for\nvarious times at 37°C in the absence of serum. After incubation, reactions were\nstopped with 2 mM TLCK, and HUVECs were isolated by gently scraping.\nHUVECs were also treated with 2 mM TLCK-treated gingipains for 1 h without\nserum. Endothelial cells were then washed twice with 5 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH\n7.5) and mixed with 20% (vol/vol) protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma). Endothe-\nlial cells were then lysed directly in SDS reducing sample buffer by three cycles\nof heat (100°C for 3 min) and vigorous mixing. Aliquots were then resolved by\nSDS–10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39) and transferred to polyvinyli-\ndene difluoride membranes (66). The primary antibody, mouse anti-human\nPECAM-1 MAb, was diluted 1:500 in 5% nonfat dry milk–Tris-buffered-saline\nbefore use. Alkaline phosphatase rabbit anti-mouse (Dako), diluted 1:5,000, was\nused as the secondary antibody. Membranes were washed five times in Tris-\nbuffered saline–0.1% Tween 20 between each step. Color was developed in a\nsolution containing nitroblue tetrazolium chloride (1.65 mg) and 5-bromo-4-\nchloro-3-indolylphosphate p-toluidine salt (0.8 mg) in 10 ml of 100 mM Tris-HCl\n(pH 9.5).\n\nEndothelial cell permeability assay. The permeability of HUVEC monolayers\nto Evans Blue albumin (EBA; 0.67 mg Evans Blue dye/ml and 4% bovine serum\nalbumin in M199 medium), as a measure of gap junctional area, was determined\nas previously described (52). HUVEC monolayers were grown to confluence on\ntissue culture-treated transwells (3-�m pore size; 12-mm diameter) (Corning\nCostar) in 24-well microtiter plates. The upper transwell and lower culture plate\nwells were filled with M199 medium (50 and 500 �l, respectively). For treatment\nof the monolayers, the transwells were washed with M199 medium without serum\nand then treated for 30 min with 5 mM cysteine-activated or TLCK-inhibited\n\nVOL. 73, 2005 HYDROLYSIS OF PECAM-1 BY GINGIPAINS 1387\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\n\n\ngingipains (70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp) or with the cysteine buffer\ncontrol. After treatment, the transwells were again washed three times with\nmedium; 500 �l of medium from the bottom well was collected for analysis and\nreplaced at times 0, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min, and 50 �l of fresh EBA was replaced\nin the transwell at the same time intervals. All samples were diluted 1:1 in M199\nmedium, and mean optical density at 630 nm was evaluated by spectrophotom-\netry. EBA standards were used to create a calibration curve of optical density\nversus milligrams of albumin per milliliter. The diffusion of EBA from the\nluminal buffer in the transwell to the abluminal buffer in the lower well was\nexpressed as milligrams of albumin/minute/centimeter2 of monolayer.\n\nPMN transmigration assay. Human PMNs were isolated by Ficoll gradient\nseparation (Robbins Scientific, Sunnyvale, Calif.), followed by hypotonic red cell\nlysis. For the visualization of transmigrating cells, PMNs were fluorescently\nlabeled with the membrane-associated dye calcein-AM (10 �M) (47) (Molecular\nProbes) for 30 min at 37°C with occasional shaking. After two washes in complete\nRPMI medium, cells were adjusted to a density of 106 cells/ml and resuspended\nin culture medium at 37°C. HUVECs were plated onto 0.1% gelatin-coated\ntranswells (3-�m pore size; 12-mm diameter) (Corning Costar) in 24-well mi-\ncrotiter plates for 2 to 3 days. PMN transmigration was also evaluated with\nTNF-� (10 ng/ml)-induced HUVECs for 4 h. Before the experiment, medium\nM199 in upper and lower chambers was replaced with serum-free medium.\nConfluent HUVECs were then incubated with 5 mM cysteine-activated gingi-\npains (a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp) in the presence or absence of 2\nmM TLCK, 10 �g of anti-CD31 MAb (clone HEC7) or isotype-matched control\nper ml, or with control medium for 30 min, after which the transwells were again\nwashed gently three times with M199 medium. To create a chemotactic gradient\nfor neutrophils, fMLP (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.) (23) at a concentration of 1 �M\nwas added to the lower compartments of the transwell units. Calcein-AM labeled\nneutrophils were added to the upper chamber at a density of 106 cells/well. At\ndifferent time points (1 or 2 h), transmigrated PMNs were recovered from the\nlower compartment, and the fluorescence of the samples was measured by a\nPerkin Elmer LS-50B spectrofluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm\nand an emission wavelength of 535 nm.\n\nImmunofluorescence staining. HUVECs for immunofluorescence assays were\ngrown on 1% gelatin-coated eight-well chamber culture slides (Lab-Tek, San\nDiego, Calif.) until a confluent monolayer was achieved. Endothelial cells were\nthen cultured with activated RgpA (70 nM) for 15 and 30 min at 37°C in the\nabsence of serum. HUVECs were also treated with 2 mM TLCK-treated RgpA\nfor 30 min without serum. After exposure to experimental conditions, cells were\nwashed in PBS and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. After washing,\nthe slide was stained with primary antibody against anti-PECAM-1 for 45 min,\nunbound primary antibody was washed away, and cells were labeled with Alexa\nFluor 488 (Molecular Probes)-conjugated secondary antibody for another 45 min\nat room temperature. After washing, the slide was mounted and analyzed with a\nZeiss fluorescence microscope (Thornwood, N.Y.) connected to a Nikon digital\ncamera (Tokyo, Japan).\n\nStatistical analysis. All data were expressed as means � standard error of the\nmeans (SEM). Differences between groups were examined for statistical signif-\nicance by using a Student’s t test for unpaired data and a paired t test for paired\ndata. A P value of �0.05 indicated the presence of a statistically significant\ndifference.\n\nRESULTS\n\nEffect of serum, cysteine, and proteinase inhibitors on bind-\ning of gingipains to HUVECs. The ability of gingipains to bind\nto HUVECs was examined by flow cytometry after a 1-h incu-\nbation. Figure 1A shows that, under serum-free conditions, the\nbinding of activated RgpA or Kgp to HUVECs occurred in a\ndose-dependent manner. Both RgpA and Kgp exhibited simi-\nlar binding activity to HUVECs, with 50% binding at approx-\nimately 2.7 nM and maximal effect near 70 nM. As serum is a\nrich source of proteinase inhibitors (30, 67), the effect of serum\non gingipain binding to HUVECs was examined. The binding\nof a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp to HUVECs was\nonly slightly affected by incubation in the presence of serum up\nto 40% (Fig. 1B). Further, the addition of 2 mM TLCK, an\ninhibitor of RgpA and Kgp, did not reduce binding, demon-\nstrating that cysteine proteinase activity was not required (Fig.\n\n1B). Figures 1C and D demonstrate the fluorescence-activated\ncell sorter (FACS) profiles of 70 nM RgpA and 70 nM Kgp\nbound to HUVECs after 1 h of incubation in the presence of\n20% FCS. As cysteine is known as an effective reducing agent\nfor the activation of gingipains, we tested the effect of various\nlevels of cysteine on the binding activity of 70 nM gingipains to\nHUVECs. The amount of cysteine had little effect on binding\nas �80% of maximal gingipain binding to HUVECs was\nachieved without activation (Fig. 1E). The results suggest that\nthe adhesin domains of the gingipains are able to bind to\nHUVECs and that proteolytic activity of the gingipains is not\ncritical in this process.\n\nReduction of PECAM-1 on HUVECs by gingipains. PECAM-1\nmolecules are constitutively expressed on endothelial cells\n(49). We first investigated the ability of purified RgpA and Kgp\nto affect the expression of PECAM-1 by HUVECs under se-\nrum-free conditions. Both RgpA and Kgp efficiently reduced\nPECAM-1 expression on HUVECs in a time- and dose-depen-\ndent manner (Fig. 2A, B). Treatment of the HUVECs with a\n70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp for 15 min reduced\ndetection of PECAM-1 from 90% to approximately 25%\n(RgpA) and 40% (Kgp) of positive cells. Figures 2C and D\ndemonstrate the FACS profiles of PECAM-1 expression on\nHUVECs after the addition of the indicated levels of gingi-\npains for 1 h. To further identify PECAM-1 expression on\nHUVEC surfaces after gingipain treatment, a time course\nstudy was followed by Western blotting with the anti-PE-\nCAM-1 MAb (Fig. 2E). In untreated HUVECs, there was a\n130-kDa band corresponding to intact PECAM-1. After a 15-\nmin incubation with either RgpA or Kgp at 70 nM, the 130-\nkDa band representing the PECAM-1 was reduced. The 130-\nkDa PECAM-1 band disappeared after a 30- or 60-min\ntreatment with RgpA or Kgp, respectively. To verify that the\ngingipains are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of sur-\nface PECAM-1 on HUVECs, the proteinase inhibitor TLCK\nwas incubated with gingipains before being added to the\nHUVECs. Under these conditions, the intensity of the 130-\nkDa PECAM-1 band was unaffected after a 60-min treatment\nwith TLCK-treated RgpA or Kgp. The results correlated well\nwith the flow cytometric analysis and confirmed that the re-\nduction of PECAM-1 expression on HUVECs was due to\nproteolysis by gingipains.\n\nExtracellular enzymatic digestion of PECAM-1 by gingi-\npains on HUVECs. The reduction of surface PECAM mole-\ncules on HUVECs was due to the enzymatic activity of gingi-\npains since the cysteine proteinase inhibitor TLCK (at 2 mM)\nblocked the effect completely (Fig. 3A). Further, gingipains\neffectively diminished PECAM-1 expression by �30% in the\npresence of 10% FCS. The capacity of the gingipains to reduce\nPECAM-1 expression was fully suppressed in the presence of\n20% serum.\n\nTo determine whether the reduction in PECAM-1 expres-\nsion may reflect either shedding or internalization of these\nadhesion glycoproteins (32) rather than proteolytic cleavage by\ngingipains, HUVECs were fixed before gingipain treatment.\nAs shown in Fig. 3B, both RgpA and Kgp down-regulated\nPECAM-1 expression on both fixed and unfixed HUVECs (P\n� 0.001). Taken together, these data demonstrated adhesin-\nmediated binding of gingipains to endothelial cells and signif-\n\n1388 YUN ET AL. INFECT.

We directly\ncompared the effects of gingipains on VCAM-1 and ELAM-1\nexpression to the effects observed for PECAM-1. TNF-�-acti-\nvated HUVECs were incubated for 1 to 3 h in the presence or\nabsence of 70 nM gingipain under serum-free conditions (Fig.\n4A). The percentage of cells expressing VCAM-1 and ELAM-1\nwas slightly decreased by approximately 10 to 15% after 1 to\n2 h of treatment with RgpA or Kgp compared to the untreated\nHUVEC cultures. VCAM-1 expression on HUVECs was de-\ncreased by a further 5 to 10% after 3 h of treatment with\ngingipains.

How-\never, when 20% FCS was added to the gingipain-treated\nHUVEC cultures for 1 to 3 h, no reduction of the VCAM-1\nand ELAM-1 expression levels on HUVECs was observed,\nwhich is similar to serum effects on PECAM-1 proteolysis by\ngingipains (data not shown).\n\nThe reduction of PECAM-1 expression on PMNs by gingi-\npains. As PECAM-1 is also expressed on neutrophils (48), we\nexamined the effects of gingipain treatment on PMN PECAM-1\nexpression. Under serum-free conditions, treatment of neutro-\nphils with a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp significantly\n(P � 0.001) reduced PECAM-1 surface expression by approx-\nimately 90% after a 1-h incubation (Fig. 4B). Further, the\n\nreduction of PECAM-1 expression was completely blocked by\nthe RgpA and Kgp inhibitor TLCK.\n\nVascular permeability is increased following treatment with\ngingipains in vitro. To demonstrate the effect of gingipains on\nHUVEC contraction and intercellular gap formation, pho-\ntomicrographs were taken, and monolayer permeability to\nEBA was recorded (52). Photographs taken at 0, 15, and 60\nmin after exposure to a 70 nM concentration of RgpA or Kgp\nshowed a rapid and obvious contraction of endothelial cells\nand gradual intercellular gap formation (Fig. 5A). In contrast,\na 60-min exposure to TLCK-treated RgpA or Kgp resulted in\nneither endothelial cell contraction nor intercellular gap for-\nmation, as seen by comparing photographs with those taken of\nuntreated HUVECs (Fig. 5A). Gingipains also induced a\nprompt increase in the permeability of monolayers to EBA.\nBuffer treatment was used as a negative control. Figure 5B\nshows that the same conditions resulted in a two- to threefold\nincrease in EBA permeability within 10 min.

Similarly, in TNF-�-activated\nHUVEC monolayers, gingipain treatment allowed more\nPMNs to transmigrate (Fig. 6B).

These results\n\nindicated that P. gingivalis may invade deeper structures of the\nconnective tissue. Likewise, it has been reported that P. gingi-\nvalis can adhere to and invade endothelial cells (17). Also, it is\ninteresting that P. gingivalis has been detected in atheroscle-\nrotic plaques (13). The present study indicates the role of\ngingipains in the ability of P. gingivalis to localize to endothelial\ncells. The results suggest that gingipains are likely to adhere to\nendothelial cells in vivo, as serum concentrations up to 40%\nhave little affect on binding activity. We speculate that the\nability of gingipains to adhere to endothelial cells may contrib-\nute not only to localized inflammation but also, through enter-\ning the bloodstream, to the development of systemic reactions\nsuch as atherosclerosis (3).

PECAM-1 is a single chain 130-kDa mem-\nbrane glycoprotein containing six extracellular Ig-like domains\nof the C2 subclass, one transmembrane region, and a cytoplas-\nmic tail (48). A recent study with chimeric constructs of human\nPECAM-1 revealed that homophilic binding of PECAM-1 on\nadjacent cells and positively charged sequences (599RKAKA\nK604) in the juxtamembrane region of the transmembrane do-\nmain of PECAM-1 are important for its localization to cell-cell\nborders (62). In this context, the hemagglutinin domains have\nbeen reported to regulate intracellular dispersion of gingipains\ntaken up by epithelial cells (57), and the proteinases have\nspecificity for arginine and lysine residues (54), with the 599RK\nAKAK604 sequence a potential target.\n\nThe major proteinase inhibitors present in human serum are\nalpha-1-antitrypsin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and alpha-2-\nmacroglobulin (�2M). Two strains of P. gingivalis (W83 and\nH185) have been shown to degrade most serum proteins, in-\ncluding the plasma proteinase inhibitors alpha-1-antitrypsin\nand �2M, but not alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (10). In another\nstudy, �2M was shown to inhibit the catalytic activity of gingi-\npain R efficiently but not gingipain K (30). While the serum\nprotease inhibitors may limit PECAM-1 cleavage on\nHUVECs, the actual effect remains undetermined in the\n\npresent study. The observed effect of serum in limiting down-\nregulation of PECAM-1 on HUVECs could be attributed to\nserum albumin, a known preferred target of gingipain activity\n(29), acting as a competitive substrate, resulting in increased\nretention of PECAM-1. The present report indicates that\ngingipains at a concentration of 70 nM effectively reduce\nPECAM-1 expression on HUVECs in the presence of 10%\nserum, whereas limited hydrolysis of PECAM-1 was observed\nin the presence of 20% serum. The level of gingipains in\ncrevicular fluid at inflamed sites was estimated at 40 to 90 nM\n(21), comparable to the amount used in this study. Hence, it is\npossible that proteolytic cleavage of PECAM-1 by gingipains\noccurs in vivo.\n\nThe present study shows that gingipains are able to increase\nthe permeability of endothelial monolayers. The kinetics of\nendothelial permeability induced by gingipains correlated with\nthe kinetics of PECAM-1 degradation. It can therefore be\npresumed that treatment of endothelial monolayers with gin-\ngipains disrupts intercellular junctions, at least by degradation\nof the PECAM-1 involved in endothelial monolayer integrity.\nGap formation by gingipains appears to be different from\nTNF-�-promoted intercellular gap formation, where actin pe-\nripheral bundles are converted into stress fibers and where\n\nFIG. 7.

We conclude that reduced PECAM-1 expres-\nsion at the junctions after gingipains treatment may disrupt the\ntight assembly of endothelial cells, thus allowing leukocyte\ntransmigration in this system.\n\nEvidence was obtained that gingipains did not preferentially\ndegrade ELAM-1 and VCAM-1 expressed by endothelial cells\ncompared with PECAM-1. RgpA reduced half of the TNF-�-\ninduced ELAM-1 expression on endothelial cells after 3 h of\nincubation, reflecting the limited activity of RgpA in degrada-\ntion of ELAM-1. ELAM-1 binds neutrophils selectively but not\nthe majority of lymphocytes (5). It has been suggested that\ngingival blood vessels might be functionally specialized to con-\nstitutively express ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 and thus facilitate\nleukocyte traffic into the gingival crevice (44). The present\ninvestigation indicated that prolonged exposure to gingipains\nproduced by P. gingivalis might modify the rolling or tethering\nsteps of leukocytes mediated by ELAM-1 expression on endo-\nthelial cells.\n\nIt has been reported that two regions of VCAM-1, localized\nto domains 4 and 5, are sensitive to proteolytic cleavage by\nendopeptidase Glu-C of Staphylococcus aureus (53). However,\ngingipains exhibit minimal activity against TNF-�-induced\nVCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells in vitro. VCAM-1 is a\nselective adhesion molecule for mononuclear cells (9). The\nresistance of VCAM-1 on endothelial cells to gingipains sug-\ngests a functional involvement of this molecule during adhe-\nsion and transendothelial migration of lymphocytes in peri-\nodontitis. Our results indicate that PMN transmigration across\ncytokine-activated endothelial cells can be facilitated by gingi-\npains and may potentially contribute to leukocyte accumula-\ntion at periodontal sites.\n\nThe expression of PECAM-1 on PMNs could play an im-\nportant role in the modulation of inflammatory foci by influ-\nencing responses to chemotaxis, cell adhesion, or mediators of\ninflammation such as cytokines and complement (46). Also,\nthe transendothelial migration of leukocytes across the suben-\ndothelial basal lamina is mediated via the heterophilic inter-\naction of domain 6 of leukocyte PECAM-1 with unknown\ncomponent(s) of the basement membrane (41, 46). We ob-\nserved that gingipains can also down-regulate PECAM-1 ex-\npression on PMNs. The data suggest the potential ability of\ngingipains to reduce the heterophilic interaction of leukocyte\nPECAM-1 with endothelial cells at sites of inflammatory gin-\ngival tissue.\n\nGingipain-K has potent fibrinogenolytic activity that can\ncontribute to a bleeding tendency at periodontitis sites (34).\nOn the other hand, a recent study has demonstrated prolonged\nbleeding times in PECAM-1-deficient mice (42). These studies\nare consistent with a role for gingipains in the acquisition of\nthe iron or porphyrin necessary for bacterial growth and viru-\nlence (14), potentially mediated by modulating endothelial cell\nPECAM-1 expression and extending bleeding time.\n\nLeukocyte transmigration through the endothelium is a mul-\ntistep process. PECAM-1 is an important component at endo-\nthelial junctions. However, three additional adhesive proteins,\njunctional adhesion molecule (40, 43), CD99 (56) and vascular\nendothelial-cadherin (61), expressed at endothelial cell-cell\n\njunctions, have recently been demonstrated to be involved in\nleukocyte transmigration. To date, only the epithelial-cadherin\nand neuronal-cadherin of epithelial cells are known to be de-\ngraded by P. gingivalis proteases (12). Further investigation is\nunder way to resolve a possible interaction of gingipains and\nthese adhesion proteins.\n\nThe creation of intercellular gaps and the relative sparing of\nadhesion receptors important in anchoring mononuclear leu-\nkocytes is noteworthy in relation to the pathology of the lesion.\nP. gingivalis infection can cause local inflammation, which con-\ntributes to the ulceration of the gingiva and local vascular\nchanges. The observed expression of endothelial ELAM-1 and\nVCAM-1 under P. gingivalis proteinase challenge is consistent\nwith the initial stages of gingival inflammation characterized by\nthe continuous migration of leukocytes (44, 50, 65). Further,\nthe present investigation indicates that gingipains from P. gin-\ngivalis may contribute to the initiation of endothelial barrier\ndestruction by cleaving PECAM-1 at the endothelial cell-cell\njunction. P. gingivalis and the gingipains may interact with\nendothelium of the microvasculature from the perivascular\naspect, along a gradient from the plaque mass in the periodon-\ntal pocket to the adjacent connective tissues. Equally likely,\ngingipains may enter the vasculature through localized sites of\nmicroulceration of the pocket wall, interacting with endothe-\nlium from the lumenal aspect. Consequently, gingipains can\npromote microvascular permeability and could potentially con-\ntribute to gingival crevicular flooding and leukocyte accumu-\nlation at periodontal sites infected with P. gingivalis. Of rele-\nvance also is the observed correlation between the occurrence\nof P. gingivalis and neutrophil elastase levels in the gingival\ncrevicular fluid at periodontitis sites (71). While the recruit-\nment of leukocytes and participation of inflammatory media-\ntors such as proinflammatory cytokines may amplify the mag-\nnitude of tissue and vascular damage at periodontitis sites,\nthese inflammatory products can also enter the circulation to\nproduce systemic effects. Significantly, P. gingivalis proteinases\nmay overcome host immune responses by effectively down-\nregulating both afferent and efferent arms of the cell-mediated\nimmune response (69, 70). Further, gingipains are effective in\nstimulating polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes (68), an\nobservation compatible with the observed perivascular accu-\nmulation of degenerate B-cell derivatives as a characteristic\nfeature of the lesion of periodontitis (26, 58). Conversely, me-\ndiation of vascular permeability by gingipains could contribute\nto the capacity of P. gingivalis to enter the circulatory systems.\nThe capacity of gingipains to attach to endothelial cells as\ndemonstrated in the present study could potentiate the dam-\naging effects of these enzymes, thereby decreasing the integrity\nand strength of vessel walls, with implications for the risk of\natherosclerosis and related cardiovascular events.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the National Health and\nMedical Research Council of Australia.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
