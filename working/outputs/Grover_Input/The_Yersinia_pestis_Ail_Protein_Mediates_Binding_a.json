Krukonis1,2*\nDepartment of Biologic and Materials Sciences, University of Michigan School of Dentistry,1 and Department of Microbiology and\n\nImmunology, University of Michigan School of Medicine,2 Ann Arbor, Michigan\n\nReceived 23 July 2008/Returned for modification 22 August 2008/Accepted 25 November 2008\n\nAlthough adhesion to host cells is a critical step in the delivery of cytotoxic Yop proteins by Yersinia pestis,\nthe mechanism has not been defined. To identify adhesins critical for Yop delivery, we initiated two transposon\nmutagenesis screens using the mariner transposon. To avoid redundant cell binding activities, we initiated the\nscreen with a strain deleted for two known adhesins, pH 6 antigen and the autotransporter, YapC, as well as\nthe Caf1 capsule, which is known to obscure some adhesins. The mutants that emerged contained insertions\nwithin the ail (attachment and invasion locus) gene of Y. pestis. A reconstructed mutant with a single deletion\nin the ail locus (y1324) was severely defective for delivery of Yops to HEp-2 human epithelial cells and\nsignificantly defective for delivery of Yops to THP-1 human monocytes. Specifically, the Yop delivery defect was\napparent when cell rounding and translocation of an ELK-tagged YopE derivative into host cells were\nmonitored. Although the ail mutant showed only a modest decrease in cell binding capacity in vitro, the KIM5\n�ail mutant exhibited a >3,000-fold-increased 50% lethal dose in mice. Mice infected with the �ail mutant also\nhad 1,000-fold fewer bacteria in their spleens, livers, and lungs 3 days after infection than did those infected\nwith the parental strain, KIM5. Thus, the Ail protein is critical for both Y. pestis type III secretion in vitro and\ninfection in mice.\n\nYersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, employs a type\nIII secretion system (T3SS) to deliver cytotoxic Yop proteins\ninto host cells (16). Yops have various cell-altering activities,\nincluding Rho-GAP activity (YopE) (6, 64), tyrosine phos-\nphatase activity (YopH) (9), serine/threonine kinase activity\n(YpkA) (23), and protease activity (YopT) (56), and the ability\nto disrupt MAP kinase signaling pathways via acetylation of\nMAP kinases (YopJ) (44–46). A sixth Yop, YopM, leads to\ndisruption of the immune system via depletion of NK cells\n(26). The injection of Yops into host cells by the Ysc T3SS of\npathogenic Yersinia species is required for virulence (49). Mu-\ntants lacking the Yop-encoding virulence plasmid are avirulent\nby all routes of entry, as are mutants unable to assemble a\nfunctioning T3SS for Yop delivery (49). An essential step for\nsecretion of type III effector proteins is host cell binding. This\ndocking step is required for pathogens to deliver a cargo of\ncell-altering effector proteins. In the case of enteropathogenic\nYersinia species, at least two adhesins are capable of mediating\nT3SS delivery of Yops, invasin and YadA (53). Both of these\nproteins are inactive in Y. pestis, due to an insertion element or\nframeshift mutation, respectively (20, 48, 54, 57). One known\nY. pestis adhesin, pH 6 antigen, restores adhesion and T3SS\ndelivery of ExoS when heterologously expressed in a nonad-\nherent mutant of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60). pH 6 antigen\ncan also fulfill this T3SS docking function in Y. pestis (S. Felek\nand E. S. Krukonis, unpublished). However, pH 6 antigen is\nonly expressed under certain environmental conditions (�35°C\nand pH of �6.7) (5), a pH 6 antigen mutant has a modest\n\ndefect in virulence via the intravenous, subcutaneous, or intra-\nnasal routes of infection (14, 32), and the expression of pH 6\nantigen in a mouse model of fully virulent pneumonic plague is\ngreatly downregulated (31). Thus, identification of the ad-\nhesins required for Y. pestis Yop delivery is still a priority.\n\nRecently, the Y. pestis Ail protein was also shown to mediate\ncell binding, cell invasion, bacterial autoaggregation, and se-\nrum resistance (3, 28). This finding was somewhat surprising,\nsince Y. pestis Ail is nearly identical to Yersinia pseudotubercu-\nlosis Ail, which has been reported to confer serum resistance\nbut not play a role in adhesion or invasion of tissue culture cells\n(67). On the other hand, in Yersinia enterocolitica, Ail mediates\nattachment and invasion of host cells and confers serum resis-\ntance to the bacterium (8, 40, 50). Ail of Y. enterocolitica shows\nsome cell selectivity allowing interaction with HEp-2 and CHO\ncells, but not MDCK cells (40). Ail is an outer membrane\nprotein of the OmpX family, proposed to have eight mem-\nbrane-spanning domains and four extracellular loops (22, 63).\nThe role of these loops has been extensively studied in Y.\nenterocolitica Ail. Mutations in either loop 2 or 3 were found to\naffect serum resistance, adhesion/invasion, or both activities\n(39). Furthermore, a peptide derived from a sequence within\nloop 2 of Y. enterocolitica Ail was able to disrupt invasion of\nCHO cells (39).\n\nWhile many researchers have used nonphagocytic cells as\ntargets of Yop secretion to identify adhesin molecules (11, 53),\nYop delivery to phagocytic cells, such as macrophages and\nneutrophils, may be adhesin independent, since the bacteria\ncan be readily engulfed by these host cells (11). During Yop\ndelivery to phagocytic cells, the pore-forming translocon mol-\necules YopB and YopD of the T3SS apparatus may serve as a\ncholesterol-binding docking complex, by analogy to other ho-\nmologous T3SSs (25). To identify Y. pestis factors critical for\n\n* Corresponding author. Mailing address: 1011 N. University, Den-\ntal Building RM 3209, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-1078. Phone: (734) 615-\n6424.

In tissue culture models of infection, we\ndemonstrate that Y. pestis Ail mediates cell attachment and\nfacilitates Yop delivery to a human epithelial cell line (HEp-2)\nand a human monocyte cell line (THP-1). In mouse infections,\nAil is critical for virulence, as reflected by the �3,000-fold\nincrease in the 50% lethal dose (LD50) of the �ail mutant.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial strains and culture conditions. Y. pestis strains were cultivated in\nheart infusion broth (HIB) overnight or on heart infusion agar (HIA) for 48 h at\n28°C. Escherichia coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or LB\nagar at 28°C or 37°C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations:\nstreptomycin (Sm), 100 �g/ml; kanamycin (Km), 30 �g/ml; chloramphenicol\n(Cm), 10 �g/ml; and ampicillin (Amp), 100 �g/ml. Isopropyl-�-D-thiogalactopy-\nranoside (IPTG) was used at a 100 �M concentration. Strain KIM5-3001 (Table\n1), an Sm-resistant version of KIM5, is hereafter referred to as KIM5 in the text,\nfor simplicity.\n\nTransposon mutagenesis and identification of ail. We previously observed that\nthe deletion of two known adhesins, pH 6 antigen and YapC, does not abolish\nthe ability of Y. pestis to bind to eukaryotic cells when it is grown at 28°C (21). To\nfind other potential adhesins in Y. pestis, we performed a random transposon\nmutagenesis by using a Y. pestis KIM5 �psaA �yapC �caf1 mutant strain. We\nused a caf1 mutant to exclude the masking effect of capsule during cell binding\nenrichment steps (33). The strain was conjugated with E. coli SM10(�pir)/pFD1\nharboring the mariner transposon (55) and then selected for Sm resistance (Y.\npestis) and Km resistance (mariner transposon).\n\nMutant pools were then used to serially infect HEp-2 cells in 24-well tissue\nculture plates six times per day for 3 days (18 rounds of enrichment). For each\nday of infection, the bacteria were put in the first well at a multiplicity of infection\n(MOI) of 100 and centrifuged for 5 min at 200 � g to facilitate bacterial contact\nwith the HEp-2 cells; infections were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. The\nunbound bacteria from the previous binding step were transferred to the next\nwell, centrifuged, and incubated, as described above. After six rounds of enrich-\nment, unbound bacteria were collected, cultured overnight in HIB at 28°C, and\nused for more enrichment the next day. We also performed an erythrocyte\nbinding enrichment three times per day for 3 days. Sheep erythrocytes were\nincubated with mutant pools, incubated for 2 h at 37°C, and centrifuged at 800\nrpm in a microcentrifuge for 3 min, and supernatants were mixed with new\n\nerythrocytes. After the last enrichment, unbound bacteria were collected and\ncultured overnight in HIB at 28°C and used for more enrichment the next day.\n\nTo identify the gene disrupted by mariner transposition, the insertion region\nwas amplified with primers Mariner-1 (5\t-GGCCACGCGTGCACTAGTACNN\nNNNNNNNNTACNG-3\t) and SFMar2 (5\t-TACGGTATCGATAAGC), and\nPCR products were purified (Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) and subjected to a\nsecond nested PCR by using primers SFMar3 (5\t-CACGCGTGCACTAGTAC-\n3\t) and SFMar4 (5\t-AATCATTTGAAGGTTGGTAC-3\t). Final PCR products\nwere purified and sequenced by the University of Michigan Sequencing Core by\nusing sequencing primer SFMarseq (5\t-ACGCCATCTATGTGTCAGAC-3\t).\n\nDeletion of ail. Gene deletion in Y. pestis KIM5 was performed as previously\ndescribed (18, 21, 68). Briefly, the pKD4 Km resistance cassette was amplified by\nPCR with primers aildf (5\t-ATTTTTCATGTGTCAGATATTTGTTAATATTTG\nGCTGGCCACTTTAGTCTTGTGTAGGCTGGAGCTGCTTC-3\t) and aildr (5\t-\nTCAGCAATTTGAAACCACCATTATGGTGGGTTTTCATGGTTAGGAGG\nACGCATATGAATATCCTCCTTAGT-3\t). PCR products were purified and di-\ngested with DpnI and then transformed into Y. pestis KIM5, which had been previ-\nously transformed with pKD46 and induced with arabinose. Km-resistant colonies\nwere selected, and the deletion of ail was confirmed by PCR with primers ailf1\n(5\t-TCAATGGGGCTATTGATTTCG-3\t) and ailr1 (5\t-GGTGACTTGCTCGAA\nATAATG-3\t). Replacement of ail with this cassette results in a complete deletion of\nail (all 585 bp). The strain was then transformed with pCP20 to resolve out the Km\nresistance cassette. This resolution results in an 82- to 85-nucleotide FLP recombi-\nnation target site scar in the place of ail (18). Plasmids were cured from the strains\nby growing in HIB at 28°C and screening for Amp sensitivity. The �ail mutant grew\nidentically to the starting strain, KIM5, in HIB at 28°C. It grew slightly faster than\nKIM5 at 37°C in HIB and minimal essential medium (Fig. 1).\n\nCloning of ail. The gene encoding Ail was amplified from Y. pestis KIM5 with\nPCR by using primers ailcf1 (5\t-GCGCGGATCCTTGGCTGGCCACTTTAG\nTCT-3\t) and ailcr1 (5\t-GCGCCTGCAGGGTTAGGAGGACGTTAGAAC-3\t).\nAmplification primers for cloning were designed to include the ribosomal bind-\ning site of ail. PCR products were purified and digested with BamHI and PstI, gel\npurified, and ligated into pMMB207 (43). The sequences of clones containing the\ninsert were confirmed. To construct pIV2-ail, pMMB207-ail was digested with\nBamHI and PstI, and the band harboring ail was gel purified and then ligated\ninto the BamHI- and PstI-digested pIV2 plasmid. The KIM5 �ail mutant strain\nwas transformed with pMMB207-ail and pIV2-ail or empty vectors for comple-\nmentation studies.\n\nSDS-PAGE. Deletion and complementation of ail were confirmed by sodium\ndodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Briefly, Y. pes-\ntis KIM5 and derivative strains were grown overnight in HIB containing Sm at\n28°C or 37°C. For pMMB207-containing strains, 100 �M IPTG and Cm were\n\nTABLE 1.

Y. pestis KIM5 and derivative strains were\ngrown overnight in HIB at 28°C or 37°C. For pMMB207-containing strains, 100 �M IPTG was added to induce ail expression. pIV2 is a\nplasmid derived from Yersinia enterocolitica that can be stably maintained during in vivo experiments for ail complementation (59). The\nidentity of the 17.5-kDa band absent in the KIM5 �ail mutant was confirmed to be Ail protein by mass spectrometry at the University of\nMichigan Proteomics Consortium.\n\nVOL. 77, 2009 Ail PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR Yop DELIVERY 827\n\n\n\nadded to HIB while only Km was added to the pIV2-containing strains (no\nIPTG). Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to\nnormalize for optical densities at 620 nm (OD620s), boiled for 5 min, and then\nsubjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie blue staining.\n\nAdhesion and invasion assays. HEp-2 and THP-1 cells were cultured in 24-\nwell tissue culture plates until reaching 100% and 60% confluence, respectively.\nTHP-1 cells were activated with 10 pg/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for\n3 days to stimulate attachment to 24-well plates. Y. pestis KIM5 or E. coli\nderivatives were cultured overnight at 28°C (100 �M IPTG and Cm was added\nfor the strains containing pMMB207). Tissue culture cells were washed twice\nwith 1 ml of serum-free minimal essential medium (for HEp-2 cells) or RPMI\n1640 (for THP-1 cells) and infected with the bacterial strains at an MOI of 100\n(Y. pestis) or 500 (E. coli) bacteria per cell. For THP-1 cells, the cells were\npretreated with 5 �g/ml cytochalasin D for 45 min prior to infection to inhibit\nphagocytosis. This blocked phagocytosis and decreased cellular uptake by 100-\nfold (49% decreased to 0.47%) as assessed by a gentamicin protection assay. For\nthe adhesion assay, plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in 5% CO2. Cells were\nthen washed, and cell-associated bacteria were liberated by the addition of sterile\nH2O containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. Serial dilutions of samples were\nplated onto HIA or LB agar for CFU analysis. In parallel wells, the entire\npopulation of bacteria was harvested and enumerated by dilution and CFU\nanalysis to determine the total number of bacteria per well. Percent adhesion was\ncalculated by dividing bound CFU by total bacteria in the well at the end of 2\nhours of incubation and then multiplying by 100. Presented data are from three\nexperiments performed in duplicate. Statistical analysis was performed using the\nStudent t test (n � 6).\n\nInvasion assays were performed similarly except that at the end of 2 hours of\nbacterial binding, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\nto remove unbound bacteria and minimal essential medium containing 7.5 �g/ml\ngentamicin was added for 1 hour at 37°C in 5% CO2 to kill extracellular bacteria.\nCells were then washed twice with PBS and lysed and plated as described for the\nadhesion assay.\n\nCytotoxicity assay. HEp-2 cells were cultivated until they reached about 50%\nconfluence in 24-well tissue culture plates. Y. pestis KIM5 and derivative strains\nwere cultured in HIB overnight at 28°C. Cultures were diluted to an OD620 of\n0.15 in HIB and incubated for 3 to 4 more hours at 28°C. Plates were washed two\ntimes with 2 ml of serum-free tissue culture medium, and bacteria were added to\neach well at an MOI of 10. IPTG (100 �M) was added to tissue culture medium\nto induce ail expression. Plates were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Rounding was\nobserved, and pictures were taken under a phase-contrast microscope at 0, 2, 4,\nand 8 h.\n\nYop delivery assay. KIM5 derivatives carrying a YopE-Elk-encoding plasmid\n(pYopE129-Elk) (19) were cultivated overnight in HIB at 28°C, diluted to an\nOD620 of 0.15 in HIB, and incubated for 3 to 4 more hours at 28°C. HEp-2 or\nTHP-1 cells were cultured in six-well tissue culture plates until they reached\n100% or 60% confluence, respectively. Each well was washed two times with\nserum-free tissue culture medium, and bacteria were added at an MOI of 10 in\nthe presence of 100 �M IPTG (to induce yopE-ELK and ail expression). The\nbacteria were allowed to interact and translocate Yops for 2 to 8 h. Cells were\nthen directly lysed in 100 �l of 1.5� Laemmli sample buffer containing protease\ninhibitor cocktail (Sigma P-8340) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma\nP-2850), combined with bacteria from the tissue culture medium supernatant,\nand boiled for 5 min. Extracts (7.5 �l) were run for Western blot analysis and\nprobed with anti-ELK or anti-phospho-ELK antibodies (Cell Signaling Technol-\nogy, Danvers, MA). Cells deleted for yopB served as a negative control for Yop\ndelivery, since YopB is part of the T3SS translocation pore and is required for\nYop delivery.\n\nMouse experiments. To find the median lethal dose (LD50), 6- to 8-week-old\nfemale Swiss Webster mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) were\ninoculated intravenously (i.v.) via tail vein injection with 5- to 10-fold-increased\nconcentrations of each strain. Each bacterial strain group consisted of three\ndifferent doses and 10 mice in each dose. Mice were observed daily for 16 days\nfor survival. For the pCD1-negative KIM5 avirulent mutant, only five mice were\ninfected with a single dose of 106 bacteria. Experiments were performed in\naccordance with the University of Michigan UCUCA guidelines. Bacteria for\nmouse inoculation were grown overnight at 28°C in HIB medium.\n\nFor tissue analysis experiments, 10 mice were inoculated with about 100\nbacteria i.v. (10 LD50s) and euthanized with CO2 at day 1, 2, 3, or 7. Spleen, liver,\nand lung tissues were removed and weighed, and samples were divided into two\nparts. One part was homogenized, and serial dilutions were plated for CFU. The\nother part was fixed in formalin for histology. Data presented are from two\nexperiments (20 mice per strain per time point). Histological sections and stain-\n\ning were done at the University of Michigan Dental School Core Histology\nLaboratory.\n\nStatistical analysis. Adhesion data, invasion data, and spleen weights of the\nmice were analyzed with Student’s t test. Tissue colonization levels were analyzed\nusing a two-tailed two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) test.\n\nRESULTS\n\nTransposon mutagenesis and enrichment identify Ail as a\ndominant adhesin of Y. pestis. To identify novel bacterial pro-\nteins that equip Y. pestis to bind host cells, we initiated our\nenrichment strategy with a KIM5 strain lacking two previously\ndescribed adhesins of Y. pestis—pH 6 antigen (�psaA) (67) and\nthe putative autotransporter YapC (�yapC) (21). This strain\nmaintains wild-type levels of adhesion. Thus, this mutant\nscreen was designed to identify redundant adhesins of Y. pestis.\nSince Y. pestis can become nonadherent due to mutations re-\nsulting in constitutive expression of the Caf1 capsule (Krukonis\nand Felek, unpublished observations), the caf1 locus was also\ndeleted from our KIM5 �psaA �yapC starting strain. Three\npools of �1,000,000 Y. pestis mutants (�3,000,000 total mu-\ntants) with random mariner transposon insertions were gener-\nated (55). The pools were subjected to two independent en-\nrichment strategies. In the first, bacterial cells were allowed to\nbind HEp-2 cells for 1 h, and then nonadherent bacteria were\nremoved and used to infect a fresh well of HEp-2 cells for 1 h.\nThis panning procedure was repeated for six rounds/day for 3\ndays (18 rounds of enrichment).\n\nThe other enrichment strategy took advantage of the fact\nthat Y. pestis can agglutinate sheep red blood cells when grown\nat 28°C; at 37°C, this activity is blocked by expression of the\nCaf1 capsule (Krukonis and Felek, unpublished observations).\nBacterial cells were incubated with sheep erythrocytes for 2 h\nat 37°C in PBS (our strain for mutagenesis was a �caf1 mu-\ntant), and then the erythrocytes were pelleted gently in a mi-\ncrocentrifuge. Nonadherent Y. pestis bacteria were then mixed\nwith fresh red blood cells, and the enrichment procedure was\nrepeated three times/day for 3 days (nine rounds of enrich-\nment).\n\nAfter either enrichment, we noticed that a vast majority of\nKIM5 mutant derivatives had an altered colony morphology\n(larger, more opaque, rough colony edges) (Fig. 1A). Genomic\nsequencing of three of these mutants identified the locus of the\nmariner insertion as the ail gene of Y. pestis (20). Ail has been\ndefined previously in pathogenic Yersinia species as mediating\ncell attachment and invasion as well as serum resistance (3, 28,\n40, 67). Homologues of Ail in other genera have also been\nreferred to as an opacity factor, since deletion of the locus\nresults in an altered colony morphology phenotype (7). One\nother sequenced mutant that emerged from this screen (with a\nnormal colony morphology) had an insertion in the gene en-\ncoding the regulatory protein DeoR. We have not character-\nized this mutant further.\n\nTo assess the specific importance of ail in our parental\nstrain, we next constructed a targeted single-deletion ail mu-\ntant of Y. pestis KIM5. SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue stain-\ning confirmed that the Ail protein was lacking in the recon-\nstructed �ail mutant and that it could be complemented by ail\nexpressed from the broad-host-range plasmid pMMB207 (Fig.\n1E) (43). Targeted ail mutants also had an altered colony\nmorphology. Despite the altered colony morphology, KIM5\n\n828 FELEK AND KRUKONIS INFECT.

THP-1\ncell adhesion assays were performed in the presence of 5 �g/ml\ncytochalasin D to inhibit phagocytosis. A freshly reconstructed\n�caf1 �psaA �yapC �ail mutant also showed a (35%) defect in\nadhesion relative to the �caf1 �psaA �yapC starting strain for\nmutagenesis (data not shown). We interpret this to mean that\nwhile Ail may be a dominant adhesin in our KIM5 �psaA\n�yapC �caf1 mutant (allowing it to be enriched to the exclu-\nsion of other adhesin mutants), additional redundant adhesins\nmust also be present. Expression of Ail in the heterologous\nhost, E. coli AAEC185 (fim negative), also facilitated binding\nto both HEp-2 and THP-1 cells (Fig. 2C and D, respectively).\n\nSome of the HEp-2 cell-associated bacteria were likely in-\nternalized in this assay, since Y. pestis is known to invade tissue\nculture cells (17, 28). However, based on our analysis of KIM5\ninvasion of HEp-2 cells, about 60% of adhered bacteria remain\nextracellular (compare Fig. 2A and Fig. 2E). Deletion of ail\nresults in only a modest decrease in invasion frequency (P �\n\n0.1) (Fig. 2E). Giemsa staining of infected cells also indicated\nthat many of the bacteria remain at the cell periphery, and\nsome even appear to be associated with the extracellular matrix\n(Fig. 3).\n\nAil is important for Yop delivery to host cells. One of the\ncritical steps in Y. pestis pathogenesis is the delivery of Yop\nproteins. In the absence of Yops, all pathogenic Yersinia spe-\ncies are completely avirulent (49). We next assessed the role of\nAil in Yop delivery to both phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells\nby using human monocytes (THP-1 cells) and human epithelial\ncells (HEp-2 cells). Yop delivery was measured by assessing\ndelivery and phosphorylation of ELK-tagged YopE from the\nKIM5 �ail mutant, compared to the parental strain, KIM5.\nELK is an epitope tag from the eukaryotic transcription factor\nElk-1 that is normally phosphorylated by MAP kinase (37) or\nstress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/Jun N-terminal protein\nkinase (JNK) (15).\n\nUpon infection of HEp-2 cells with KIM5, phosphorylated\nELK-YopE could be detected within 2 hours. However, for the\nKIM5 �ail mutant, no Yop delivery was detected even by 8\nhours (Fig. 4A). In THP-1 human monocytes, phospho-ELK-\nYopE was detected upon KIM5 infection by 2 hours, but not\n\nFIG. 2. Adhesion and invasion of Y. pestis derivatives or E. coli expressing ail to HEp-2 or THP-1 cells.

Percent adhesion was calculated by\ndividing cell-associated CFU by the number of all bacteria in the well (bound plus unbound) and multiplying by 100.

YopE-ELK\ndelivery to THP-1 cells by the �ail mutant at 4 hours was less\nefficient than that by KIM5 (Fig. 4B). Complementation of the\n�ail mutant with Ail expressed from an inducible plasmid\ndemonstrated that expression of Ail alone could restore Yop\ndelivery to the �ail mutant (Fig. 4A and B). Expression of the\nentire pool of YopE-ELK (phosphorylated and unphosphory-\n\nlated) within bacterial cells and tissue culture cells was de-\ntected using an anti-ELK antibody (Fig. 4). Deletion of yopB (a\ncomponent of the Yop translocation pore) completely pre-\nvented the ability of YopE-ELK to be translocated and phos-\nphorylated within host cells (Fig. 4). Thus, the yopB mutant\nserves as a negative control for YopE-ELK delivery. These\ndata indicate that Ail is an important adhesin for mediating\nYop delivery in Y. pestis. These studies also demonstrate that\nAil plays a role in Yop delivery to phagocytic cells, the primary\ntarget of Yops early in infection.\n\nThe delay in Yop delivery to HEp-2 cells was also confirmed\nby monitoring Yop-mediated cytotoxicity as indicated by cell\nrounding (Fig. 5). Counting of 500 cells per infecting strain\nindicated that at hour 2, 90% of KIM5-infected cells had\nrounded, yet only 5 to 10% of the �ail mutant-infected cells\nwere rounded (Fig. 5B). By hour 4, some rounding was de-\ntected in HEp-2 cells infected with the �ail mutant (25 to\n45%), and by hour 8, about 85% of cells infected with the �ail\nmutant had undergone cell rounding (100% of KIM5-infected\ncells were rounded at hour 8) (Fig. 5B). This indicates that the\n�ail mutant is not completely attenuated for Yop delivery.\nRounding of THP-1 cells was not evaluated, since they are\nquite round normally. Further rounding due to Yop delivery\nwas difficult to assess.\n\nLack of Yop-mediated cytotoxicity was also seen in Giemsa-\nstained HEp-2 cells 2 hours after infection by the KIM5 �ail\nmutant, as indicated by the failure of the mutant to cause\ncytoplasmic shrinkage (Fig. 3).\n\nAil plays a major role in Y. pestis virulence. Since the KIM5\n�ail mutant was strongly defective for Yop delivery in vitro, we\npredicted that it might be strongly attenuated for mouse viru-\nlence. We next assessed the role of Ail in a mouse infection\nmodel. Since KIM5 derivatives are pigmentation negative\n(pgm\n) and cannot acquire iron readily in peripheral tissues\ndue to lack of yersiniabactin (4, 13) encoded within the 102-kb\npgm high-pathogenicity island (12), we used the i.v. route of\ninfection. Three groups of 10 Swiss Webster mice were in-\nfected with 5- or 10-fold increasing doses of bacteria, and the\n\nFIG. 3. Giemsa staining of KIM5, the KIM5 �ail mutant, and the complemented mutant binding to HEp-2 cells. The shrunken cytoplasm in\nKIM5-infected cells is indicative of Yop-mediated cytotoxicity. KIM5 lacking the Yop-encoding virulence plasmid, pCD1, does not mediate\ncytotoxicity.\n\nFIG. 4. The �ail mutant is delayed for delivery of ELK-tagged\nYopE to the cytoplasm of host cells. HEp-2 (A) or THP-1 (B) cells\nwere infected with KIM5 derivatives carrying a YopE-Elk-encoding\nplasmid (pYopE129-Elk) (19) at an MOI of 10 in the presence of 100\n�M IPTG (to induce YopE-ELK and Ail expression). The bacteria\nwere allowed to interact and translocate Yops for 2 to 8 h. Western\nblots were probed with anti-ELK (ELK) or anti-phospho-ELK (P-Elk)\nantibodies. Cells lacking yopB served as a negative control for Yop\ndelivery, since they lack a critical component of the T3SS translocation\npore required for Yop delivery.\n\n830 FELEK AND KRUKONIS INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nLD50 was determined and compared with either that of the\nKIM5 parental strain or that of a Yop-negative plasmid-cured\nderivative of KIM5 (pCD1\n). Whereas the LD50 of our wild-\ntype KIM5 strain was calculated to be 10 or 7 bacteria in two\nexperiments (Table 2) (52), the KIM5 �ail mutant had an\nLD50 of 167,000 or 23,800 organisms in two experiments, a\n16,000- or 3,400-fold increase in the LD50, respectively. This\nstrong attenuation of the KIM5 �ail mutant is consistent with\na poor ability to deliver Yop proteins during animal infection.\nThe lack of virulence of the �ail mutant could also be partially\ncomplemented in vivo by expressing ail from the Y. enteroco-\nlitica-derived plasmid pIV2 (Table 2), which is stably main-\ntained in Yersinia strains for many generations without antibi-\n\notic selection (59), indicating that the virulence defect in this\nstrain is due to the lack of Ail protein. We suspect that the\nincomplete complementation of the �ail mutant is due to poor\nexpression of ail from pIV2-ail at 28°C (Fig. 1E).\n\nKIM5 colonizes host tissue to much higher levels than does\nthe KIM5 �ail mutant. Due to the decrease in virulence of the\nKIM5 �ail mutant, we analyzed the number of bacteria in\nvarious mouse organs to assess colonization and/or clearance\nof the infection. Mice were infected with 100 organisms of\neither KIM5 or the �ail mutant (�10 LD50s for the KIM5\nparental strain). After 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, mice were eutha-\nnized, and bacteria were harvested from their spleens, livers,\nand lungs. Ten mice were used per strain at each time point,\nand the experiment was repeated once to give 20 mice per time\npoint. At day 1, infection with the �ail mutant showed similar\nnumbers of bacteria in the spleen (a blood-filtering organ)\n(Fig. 6). By day 2, infection with the �ail mutant showed\n100-fold fewer bacteria/gram tissue in the spleen, liver, and\nlungs (P value of �0.00005 for all three tissues) (Fig. 6). Fi-\nnally, by day 3, the CFU of �ail mutant was decreased by\n�1,000-fold in spleen, liver, and lung compared to that of the\nparental strain, KIM5 (Fig. 6). In fact, by day 3, some mice\ninfected with the �ail mutant had now cleared the infection\nfrom the spleen (Fig. 6). Mice infected with KIM5 typically\nbegin to die on days 3 to 5, and all succumb to infection when\ninfected with 10 LD50s. However, we could follow survivors of\ninfection with the KIM5 �ail mutant in this experiment. Al-\nmost all such mice (all but one of the survivors) cleared the\ninfection from all three tissues by day 7 (Fig. 6). These data\nindicate that although early in infection (day 1), the KIM5 �ail\nmutant is present in the spleen at levels similar to those of the\nparental strain, KIM5, over the course of a weeklong infection,\nthe �ail mutant is gradually cleared from the host, while KIM5\nis able to replicate to high numbers and kill the host.\n\nHistology from day 3 of the infection revealed more immune\ninfiltration and tissue damage/degradative debris during infec-\ntion with the �ail mutant than during infection with KIM5,\nindicating that the �ail mutant induced a more robust immune\nresponse (Fig. 7). This is predicted if the delivery of immune-\nsuppressing Yops is defective. Host tissues lacking pathology in\nthe presence of the KIM5 �ail mutant had cleared the infec-\ntion, based on low CFU numbers from the same tissue sample\n(Fig. 7, panels D, F, J, and L), or the infection had not yet\nestablished high bacterial numbers in that tissue (Fig. 7, panel\nG). While many �ail mutant infections had been cleared (Fig.\n7, panels D and F [spleen] and J and L [liver]), those that had\nnot yet been cleared promoted robust immune infiltration that\n\nFIG. 5.

Again, this indicates a more dramatic\nimmune response against infection by the �ail mutant, result-\ning in immune cell infiltration in the spleen.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nBy coupling random mutagenesis with a phenotypic enrich-\nment strategy, we determined that the Ail adhesin is critical for\nY. pestis to deliver Yop proteins to host cells. The defect in Yop\ndelivery to the phagocytic cell line, THP-1, is dramatic, yet less\nprolonged than the defect in Yop delivery to nonphagocytic\nHEp-2 cells (Fig. 4).\n\nWhile the YopE-ELK phosphorylation assay indicates very\nlittle Yop delivery to HEp-2 cells by the KIM5 �ail mutant\neven after 8 hours of infection (Fig. 4), the Yop-mediated\ncell-rounding assay shows that some Yop delivery is occurring\nas early as 4 hours after infection with the �ail mutant and that\nquite a bit of Yop delivery is occurring by 8 hours postinfection\n(Fig. 5). Several explanations may address this discrepancy.\nThe YopE129-ELK fusion protein may be translocated less\nefficiently than wild-type Yops. The fact that several Yops can\nmediate cell rounding by disrupting the actin cytoskeleton (16)\nmay allow more rapid cell rounding than detection of a single\ntranslocated molecule. The phosphorylated YopE-ELK mole-\ncule may also be harder to detect than the activity of multiple\nYops. In the former case, one must have sufficient transloca-\ntion and phosphorylation to detect the protein by Western\nblotting. In the latter case, one detects the enzymatic activity of\nthe Yops. Thus, for cytotoxicity, less Yop delivery may be\nrequired to give a positive signal. Whatever the reason for the\ndifference in detection, it is clear that the KIM5 �ail mutant is\ndelayed for Yop delivery and is severely attenuated for viru-\nlence (Table 2). It remains possible that the measurement of\nYopE-ELK phosphorylation is not a direct indicator of Yop\ndelivery and that the �ail mutation may affect phosphorylation\nof YopE-ELK after translocation rather than translocation\nitself. Given the role of Ail as a cellular adhesin and the fact\nthat MAP kinase pathways (the kinase that phosphorylates\nElk-1) are known to be operating in cells affected by Yops (45),\nwe prefer the explanation that Ail mediates efficient docking to\nthe host cell membrane and Yop delivery.\n\nAil of pathogenic Yersinia sp. strains has been shown to\nmediate adhesion, invasion, autoaggregation, and serum resis-\ntance (3, 8, 28, 40, 50, 67).

IMMUN.\n\n\n\nsensitive to mouse serum (3, 65), it remains to be determined\nwhich of the other activities of Ail are critical for pathogenesis\nin mice. Our data indicate that one critical activity of Ail is to\nfacilitate efficient Yop delivery to targeted host cells during\ninfection. We propose that loss of Ail results in a defect in Yop\ndelivery and in dramatically reduced virulence in vivo.\n\nWe note that the �ail mutant is not as defective for virulence\n(103- to 104-fold increase in LD50) as a Y. pestis strain lacking\nthe pCD1 Yop-containing virulence plasmid (�107-fold in-\ncrease in LD50) (Felek and Krukonis, unpublished). We are\ncurrently investigating whether other Y. pestis surface mole-\ncules may play a role specifically in delivering Yops to phago-\ncytic cells. Such a surface component may provide a residual\nlevel of Yop delivery in the absence of Ail.\n\nIn a recent study, Bartra et al. characterized an indepen-\ndently generated KIM5 �ail mutant. In their studies, using\nretro-orbital inoculation, they found no defect in virulence in\nSwiss Webster mice for the �ail mutant (3). We recently ob-\ntained this strain and tested it in our tail-vein injection Swiss\nWebster mouse model and found it to be attenuated (�3,000-\nfold increase in LD50) similarly to our KIM5 �ail mutant (data\nnot shown). It is unclear whether the alternative route of retro-\norbital inoculation did not reveal the attenuating effect of the\n�ail mutation or whether the differences in our results are due\n\nFIG. 7. Histopathology upon Y. pestis infection in the spleen and liver. Swiss Webster mice were inoculated with �100 bacteria i.v. and\neuthanized at day 3.

Sections from three infected mice in each\ngroup were prepared (three panels per bacterial strain [e.g., KIM5 spleen infection in panels A to C]). Images were taken at a magnification of\n�400.

Increased\nspleen weight is an indication of increased immune infiltration in mice\ninfected with the KIM5 �ail mutant. Decreased spleen weight is an\nindication of cell death within the spleen in a KIM5 infection. Statis-\ntical comparisons are between spleen weights on day 1 versus those on\nday 3 for KIM5 or for the KIM5 �ail mutant. *, P � 5 � 10\n\n\n5 by the\nStudent t test.\n\nVOL. 77, 2009 Ail PROTEIN REQUIRED FOR Yop DELIVERY 833\n\n\n\nto the way the bacteria were grown prior to inoculation. Under\nconditions of overnight growth at 28°C in HIB prior to tail-vein\ninoculation, both our KIM5 �ail strain and the KIM5 �ail\nstrain of Bartra et al. were strongly attenuated. If Barta et al.\ngrew their strains in a way to induce other adhesins that are\nredundant to Ail, they may not have observed the virulence\ndefects of the ail mutant. We do find that although the calcu-\nlated LD50 of the KIM5 �ail mutant is �3,000-fold higher than\nthat of KIM5, at low-dose inoculations of 100 organisms, the\n�ail mutant can sometimes kill a few mice, even when the LD50\nis calculated to be 28,000 organisms. We take this to mean that\nduring infection, other adhesins can be induced in vivo. If\nthose adhesins are induced early enough, we hypothesize\nthat the attenuating defect of the �ail mutation is compen-\nsated for by the newly expressed adhesin.\n\nStudies on the Y. pseudotuberculosis Ail protein suggested\nthat it had no adhesive or invasive activity (67). Given that\nthere are only two amino acid substitutions between Y. pseudo-\ntuberculosis and Y. pestis Ail proteins, we did not anticipate\nidentifying Ail as a Y. pestis adhesin. In addition, it had been\nreported previously that Y. pestis ail in some strains is inacti-\nvated by an insertion element (61). Thus, we were surprised to\nidentify Ail as the predominant adhesin in our transposon\nscreen. Y. pestis Ail has also recently been shown to act as an\nadhesin by another group (28). We are currently investigating\nthe nature of the different activities of Y. pseudotuberculosis Ail\nand Y. pestis Ail. The two amino acid differences in Ail from Y.\npestis and Ail from Y. pseudotuberculosis are predicted to reside\nwithin surface-exposed loops 1 and 3 (3).\n\nAnother adhesin of Y. pestis is plasminogen activator Pla. Pla\nhas been shown to mediate adhesion to the extracellular matrix\n(30, 34) and to cells (27) and also to mediate cellular invasion\n(17, 29). Much of the adhesion of KIM5 to HEp-2 cells is to the\ncell periphery or even the extracellular matrix surrounding the\ncells, especially in a KIM5 �ail mutant (Fig. 3). This suggests\nthat Pla may also function as an adhesin in KIM5. We find that\na KIM5 �ail �pla mutant shows a drastic (85%) reduction in\nbinding to HEp-2 cells and a similar decrease in cellular inva-\nsion (95% reduction) (S. Felek, unpublished results). We hy-\npothesize that Pla was not identified in our transposon screen\nbecause it is encoded on the pPCP1 plasmid. Thus, there are\nmultiple copies per cell. Our identification of Ail as an adhesin\nof Y. pestis is in agreement with the recent findings of Kolodz-\niejek et al. (28), although the adhesion defects in our KIM5\n�ail mutant are less dramatic than the defect they observed\nwith their KIM6� �ail mutant. Kolodziejek et al. also found a\ndramatic decrease in invasion with their KIM6� �ail mutant.\nWe feel that they may have observed such strong adhesion and\ninvasion phenotypes because their KIM6� strain lacks Pla. In\nfact, their strain list indicates that their KIM6� strain lacks the\npPCP1 plasmid.\n\nGiven the loss of virulence of the �ail mutant (Table 2), Ail\nmay contribute to multiple steps of pathogenesis—as an adhe-\nsin during colonization, to deliver Yops to macrophages and\nneutrophils (the first line of defense against Y. pestis) and to\nexacerbate Yop-mediated tissue damage and necrosis of\nnonphagocytic cells (as represented by cytotoxicity on HEp-2\ncells) (Fig. 3 and 5).\n\nHistological and colonization studies indicate that infection\nby the KIM5 �ail mutant leads to greater immune cell infil-\n\ntration and eventual clearance of the infection (Fig. 6 and 7).\nPrevious studies with specific yop mutant strains of KIM5 also\ndemonstrated clearance of the yop mutants following initial\ncolonization, as well as distinct histopathology (58). In the\nspleen, a robust immune response against the ail mutant is also\nindicated by splenomegaly (increased spleen weight) (Fig. 8).\nIt has been shown in a number of studies in vitro that YopJ\nplays a role in suppressing the immune response of host cells to\nYersinia infections and can direct infected macrophages to\nundergo apoptosis (41, 45, 47). Not only do we see increased\nspleen weight in mice infected by a KIM5 �ail mutant, but also,\nspleens from the KIM5 (ail�) strain-infected mice undergo a\ndecrease in spleen weight, perhaps due to apoptosis of spleno-\ncytes (Fig. 8). Thus, we feel that the inability of the �ail mutant\nto efficiently deliver Yops may lead to a more robust immune\nresponse to the infection. This is in contrast to some recent\nfindings in the related pathogen Y. pseudotuberculosis. In a\nrecent study, it was shown that yopE and yopH mutants of Y.\npseudotuberculosis induce a less dramatic immune response\nthan wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis during an intragastric in-\nfection (36). In fact, the yop mutants were more readily cleared\nwhen coinoculated with the wild-type strain, due to increased\nimmune stimulation by the wild-type strain (36). This clearing\neffect on yop mutants could even be mediated by inoculating\nthe host with wild-type Y. pseudotuberculosis strains intraperi-\ntoneally (i.p.) while challenging the mice with the yop mutants\nintragastrically (36). While these results suggest that wild-type\nY. pseudotuberculosis strains can induce inflammation when\ninjected i.p., we would point out that we use a different species\nof Yersinia, Y. pestis, and a different route of inoculation (i.v.).\nFurthermore the lack of inflammation by yop mutants seen in\nthe study by Logsdon and Mecsas occurs at the site of the\nintestine (36). If the yopE and yopH mutants were delivered to\ndeeper tissues, they would likely be rapidly cleared, as has been\ndemonstrated previously for other yop mutants (58). i.p. inoc-\nulation of mice with a yopE or yopH mutant might also have\nstimulated inflammation which would lead to the clearing of\nyopE and yopH mutants colonizing the intestine. Previous stud-\nies have revealed a delayed progression of yopE or yopH mu-\ntant infections to deeper tissues following intragastric inocula-\ntion (35). Thus, we feel that our study and the study by\nLogsdon and Mecsas have some distinctions that result in\ndifferential effects on inflammation and clearance of yop mu-\ntants (or in our case, an ail mutant unable to deliver Yops). It\nshould also be noted that a recent study on the progression of\nY. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis infections after intradermal\ninjection indicated that by day 2, there were distinct differences\nin the way these two pathogens interact with the innate im-\nmune system, with Y. pseudotuberculosis stimulating a much\nmore organized polymorphonuclear leukocyte response (24).\nDifferences in the way specific Yersinia species are dealt with by\nthe immune system may reflect distinctions in lipopolysaccha-\nride-mediated immune stimulation (42, 51).\n\nWhen Y. pestis is grown at 28°C, Ail is the predominant\nadhesin for Yop delivery (Fig. 3 to 5). In Y. pseudotuberculosis,\nit has been demonstrated that the nature of the adhesin and\nthe specific signaling cascade that it triggers in host cells are\ncritical in determining the efficiency of Yop delivery (38). It has\nbeen proposed that integrin-mediated signaling in host cells\nfollowing Y. pseudotuberculosis invasin-integrin interaction re-\n\n834 FELEK AND KRUKONIS INFECT.

We hypothesize that since Y. pestis\nlacks invasin, Ail may mediate a receptor interaction that ini-\ntiates a similar series of events leading to pore formation and\nYop delivery. Further characterization of the role of Ail in Y.\npestis Yop delivery may lead to the identification of steps in\nplague pathogenesis that are vulnerable to pharmaceutical in-\ntervention.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by grants to E.S.K. from the University of\nMichigan Biomedical Research Council (BMRC), the University of\nMichigan Rackham Graduate School, and the University of Michigan\nOffice of the Vice President for Research.\n\nSusan Murray at the University of Michigan School of Public\nHealth, Department of Biostatistics, assisted with statistical analysis of\ntissue colonization. Many thanks to Edward Krukonis for reading\nhistology sections for pathology. Finally, we thank Michele Swanson\nand Victor DiRita for critical reading of the manuscript.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
