These proteins, together with cyclophilin B\n(encoded by PPIB), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the a1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis/trans\nisomerase (PPIase) activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is\nnot required for the structural stability of collagen; however, the absence of this post-translational modification may disrupt\nprotein-protein interactions integral for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen over-modification. P3H1 and CRTAP\nstabilize each other and absence of one results in degradation of the other. Hence, hypomorphic or loss of function\nmutations of either gene cause loss of the whole complex and its associated functions. The relative contribution of losing\nthis complex’s 3-hydroxylation versus PPIase and collagen chaperone activities to the phenotype of recessive OI is\nunknown. To distinguish between these functions, we generated knock-in mice carrying a single amino acid substitution in\nthe catalytic site of P3h1 (Lepre1H662A). This substitution abolished P3h1 activity but retained ability to form a complex with\nCrtap and thus the collagen chaperone function. Knock-in mice showed absence of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the\na1(I) and a1(II) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They were normal in\nappearance, had no growth defects and normal cartilage growth plate histology but showed decreased trabecular bone\nmass. This new mouse model recapitulates elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth\nphenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Our observations suggest differential tissue\nconsequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-\nhydroxylation complex.\n\nCitation: Homan EP, Lietman C, Grafe I, Lennington J, Morello R, et al.

A\n\nmutation in cartilage associated protein (CRTAP) (*605497) was\n\nfirst identified by Morello et. al. in a class of patients with recessive\n\nOI [2]. CRTAP functions in a complex with prolyl 3-hydroxylase\n\n1 (P3H1) (*610339) and cyclophilin B (CYPB) (*123841) to 3-\n\nhydroxylate a unique proline, Pro986, of the a1(I) chain and also\nto chaperone collagen trimer assembly [3–5]. Additionally, other\n\nclade A fibrillar collagens, such as collagen type II, are similarly\n\nhydroxylated. Subsequently, mutations in both leucine and proline\n\nenriched proteoglycan (LEPRE1), encoding P3H1, and peptidyl-\n\nprolyl isomerase b (PPIB), encoding CYPB, were identified in\n\nother patients with recessive forms of OI [6–13]. Mutations in\n\nadditional genes have since been identified in recessive OI,\n\nrevealing novel mechanisms of disease through alterations in post-\n\ntranslational collagen modification, trafficking and signaling.\n\nKnockout mice have been created for each of the three genes\n\nthat encode the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex and these mice\n\nrecapitulate the phenotype observed in recessive OI patients.\n\nCrtap\n2/2\n\nand Lepre1\n2/2\n\nmice display osteochondrodysplasia,\n\nsevere low bone mass, kyphosis, rhizomelia and collagen fibrils\n\nwith irregular diameter [2,14]. Although the Ppib\n2/2\n\nmice do not\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121\n\n\n\nhave rhizomelia, they also have a low bone mass phenotype with\n\nkyphosis and wider collagen fibrils [15]. Together, these findings\n\nhighlighted the importance of this complex in collagen modifica-\n\ntion and maintenance of bone mass.\n\nSince null mutations in either LEPRE1 or CRTAP can result in\n\nrecessive forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) with almost\n\nidentical features, P3H1 and CRTAP were hypothesized to\n\nstabilize each other [16]. Indeed, western blot and immunofluo-\n\nrescence studies demonstrated absence of both CRTAP and P3H1\n\nin fibroblasts isolated from patients carrying either LEPRE1 or\n\nCRTAP mutations alone [16,17]. These data supported the notion\n\nthat CRTAP and P3H1 proteins stabilize each other in the\n\nendoplasmic reticulum.\n\nThe present study aimed to determine the relative contribution\n\nof the hydroxylation activity of the P3H1 complex to the\n\npathogenesis of recessive OI. This important question was\n\naddressed in vitro and in vivo by introducing a point mutation in\n\nthe catalytic domain of P3H1 that inactivated hydroxylase activity\n\nwhile preserving the protein secondary structure and the CRTAP/\n\nP3H1/CypB complex integrity.\n\nResults\n\nDetermining amino acids important for the hydroxylase\nfunction of P3H1\n\nTo accomplish our goal of inactivating the hydroxylase function\n\nof P3H1, we employed an evolutionary trace algorithm to identify\n\nconserved residues that are essential for its enzymatic function.\n\nThe four top ranking residues identified were the catalytic triad\n\nresidues (HIS590, HIS662, and ASP592) and the 2-oxoglutarate\n\nbinding residue (ARG672) (Figure 1A). The importance of these\nresidues for hydroxylase activity was confirmed by earlier\n\nliterature [18,19]. Conversion of the catalytic triad histidines or\n\naspartic acid to either alanine or glutamate abolished the\n\nenzymatic activity of Prolyl 4-hydroxylase activity in A. thaliana\n\n[20]. Similarly, conversion of the 2-oxoglutarate binding arginine\n\nto alanine also abolished the hydroxylase activity, suggesting that\n\nsubstituting the corresponding sites in P3H1 with an alanine could\n\npotentially inactivate its hydroxylase function [20]. Since alanine is\n\na non-bulky, uncharged amino acid that can mimic the secondary\n\nstructure of many other amino acids, we opted for this substitution\n\nrather than a glutamate substitution to preserve the structural\n\nintegrity of P3H1.\n\nRescue of CRTAP stability by mutant P3H1 in cell culture\nSince the stability of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex is\n\ndependent on the interaction of P3H1 and CRTAP, it was\n\nimportant to verify that the mutation introduced into LEPRE1 did\n\nnot disrupt its ability to form a stable complex with CRTAP and\n\nCYPB. To do this we first used an in vitro approach. We used\n\nimmortalized patient fibroblasts carrying a loss of function\n\nmutation in LEPRE1 and tested whether the expression of 4\n\ndifferent LEPRE1 constructs containing alanine substitutions at\n\nH590, D592, H662, or R672 were able to restore the stability of\n\nCRTAP by immunofluorescence and immunoblot assays. We\n\nfound that the mutant expression construct converting H662 to\n\nalanine (P3H1\nH662A\n\n) was the most effective at rescuing CRTAP\n\ncompared with the others or the un-transduced LEPRE1 loss of\n\nfunction cells (figure 1B, C). These findings are consistent with\nP3H1\n\nH662A\nbeing able to interact with CRTAP and to restore it to\n\nthe ER. Although P3H1\nH662A\n\nwas not assayed for enzymatic\n\nactivity, mutating the corresponding residue to an alanine in Prolyl\n\n4-hydroxylase in A. thaliana resulted in complete inactivation of the\n\nhydroxylase activity, suggesting the P3H1\nH662A\n\nmutant is likely to\n\nbe inactive [20].\n\nDemonstration that Lepre1H662A/H662A knock-in mice lack\nPro986 collagen hydroxylation\n\nWe generated knock-in mice carrying the H662A mutation at\n\nthe Lepre1 locus (Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\n) (figure S1). Importantly, we\nverified that CRTAP is also restored in vivo in the Lepre1\n\nH662A/\n\nH662A\nmice compared with wild-type littermates by confirming its\n\npresence by western blot using protein isolated from P1 calvaria\n\n(figure 2A). Since the Pro986 residue of a1(I), a1(II) and a2(V)\nprocollagen chains is normally fully hydroxylated and complete\n\nloss of the P3H1 complex abolishes hydroxylation at these sites\n\n[2,14,15,17], we analyzed the hydroxylation status of these\n\nresidues in the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice to assess the in vivo\n\nenzymatic activity of P3H1\nH662A\n\n. Tandem mass spectrometry\n\nshowed loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation (3-Hyp) at Pro986 in the\n\na1(I) chain and a residual 21% 3-Hyp in the a2(V) chain from\nbone (figure 2B, 3). Pro978 of the bone a2(V) chain remained\nminimally 4-hydroxylated, similar to the level observed in wild-\n\ntype littermate bone (figure 3). This is in contrast to Crtap\n2/2\n\nmice in which 3-Hyp at Pro986 was missing but in effect replaced\n\nby 4-Hyp at Pro978 apparently as a consequence of over-\n\nmodification in comparison to wild-type mice [17]. In cartilage,\n\ntandem mass spectrometry showed specifically a residual 9% 3-\n\nHyp at Pro986 in the a1(II) chain of the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice\n\n(figure 2C), which is comparable to the 6% 3-Hyp observed in\nCrtap\n\n2/2\nmice (not shown). These findings are summarized in\n\nTable 1 together with the hydroxylation status of other partially\noccupied 3-Hyp sites in bone and cartilage collagens. The loss of 3-\n\nHyp appears to be specific to Pro986 of types I, II and V collagens\n\nsimilar to findings in mouse models with complete loss of the P3H1\n\ncomplex [2,14,15,17].\n\nEffects on lysine hydroxylation and cross-linking\nCollagen cross-linking in bone was studied by determining the\n\nratio of hydroxylysyl pyridinoline to lysyl pyridinoline (HP/LP).\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nThe prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex serves to hydroxylate a\nsingle residue in type I collagen and also serves as a\ncollagen chaperone. The complex is comprised of prolyl 3-\nhydroxylase 1, cartilage associated protein, and cyclophilin\nB. Mutations have been identified in the genes encoding\nthe complex members in patients with recessive Osteo-\ngenesis Imperfecta. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-\nhydroxylation of collagen does not alter the stability of\ncollagen but may rather mediate protein-protein interac-\ntions. Additionally, the collagen chaperoning function of\nthe complex is an important rate limiting step in the\nmodification of type I collagen. Irrespective of whether\npatients with mutations in the genes encoding the\nmembers of the prolyl 3-hydroxylase complex have\nhypomorphic or complete loss of function alleles, either\ncircumstance leads to the loss of both functions of the\nprolyl 3-hydroxylase complex. Thus, it is unknown how\ncollagen chaperoning and/or hydroxylation affect bone\nand cartilage homeostasis. In this study, we generated a\nmouse model lacking the prolyl 3-hydroxylation activity of\nthe complex while maintaining the chaperoning function.\nWe found that the hydroxylase mutant mice have normal\ncartilage and normal cortical bone but decreased trabec-\nular bone, suggesting that there is a differential require-\nment for hydroxylation in different tissues.\n\nEffects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

Analysis of prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 on the a(1) chain of type I collagen in bone using mass\nspectrometry demonstrates complete loss of 3-hydroxylation in the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice when compared to Lepre1+/+ littermates (B). Similarly,\nanalysis of the Pro986 site on the a1 chain of type II collagen in cartilage demonstrates a reduction to 9% 3-hydroxylation in the Lepre1H662A/H662A\n\nmice and is similar to what was reported in Crtap\n2/2\n\nmice (C).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g002\n\nEffects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121\n\n\n\neither with bacterial collagenase or trypsin showed no significant\n\ndifferences between Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nand wild-type bone colla-\n\ngen.

So the difference\n\nin HP/LP ratio may be due to altered hydroxylation at the\n\nhomologous sites in the a2(I) chain but we did not acquire\ninformative peptides from the latter. Informative peptides from\n\nnon cross-linking lysine sites also showed no significant differences\n\nbetween wild-type and Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nbone.

Thus, no evidence of generalized over-modification was\n\nfound from these site-specific mass spectral results.\n\nThe content of HP+LP in the bone collagen was not\nsignificantly altered (Table 2).

Radiographs at 3 months and 6 months of age showed\n\nnormal skeletal patterning and no evidence of skeletal deformity\n\nsuch as kyphoscoliosis (figure 4A, not shown). Previous studies\nof the Crtap\n\n2/2\nand Lepre1\n\n2/2\nmice showed a disorganization of\n\nthe growth plate causing smaller body size with shortening of the\n\nproximal long bone segments (rhizomelia) [2,14]. To assess\n\ngrowth, the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice and their wild-type littermates\n\nwere weighed weekly until 3 months of age. At all time points, the\n\nweight of Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice was not statistically different from\n\nthat of wild-type littermates (figure 4B). Similarly, there were no\nsignificant differences between the lengths of the femur, tibia, nor\n\nthe femur/tibia ratio, thus excluding any rhizomelic defect in the\n\nLepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice [2,14] (figure 4C).\n\nSince the Lepre1\n2/2\n\nmice have a dysplasia of the growth plate\n\nthat also affects the hypertrophic chondrocytes, we performed\n\nhistology and specific staining of the hypertrophic zone with an\n\nantibody directed towards type X collagen in Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice at P1 [14]. No defects were observed in the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice compared to their wild-type littermates (figure 5A, B;\nfigure S2A, B). Additionally, we observed no difference in the\nwidth of the hypertrophic zone between the two genotypes (N = 8,\n\np-value = NS) (figure 5C; figure S2C). Collectively, the normal\ngrowth curve, normal femur to tibia ratio and normal hypertro-\n\nphic zone suggest that the cartilage in the long bones of\n\nLepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice is indeed normal despite of loss of\n\nPro986 hydroxylation in type II collagen.\n\nBy assessing the femurs and spines at 3 months of age (n = 10,\n\neach genotype) by micro-computed tomography, we found that\n\nthe Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice had cortical bone mineral density and\n\ncortical thickness values comparable to wild-type littermates\n\n(figure 6). In addition, while the biomechanical analysis of\nfemurs by 3-point bending test (n = 7, each genotype) demonstrat-\n\ned no differences in the extrinsic biomechanical properties\n\n(ultimate load, stiffness, energy to failure and post-yield displace-\n\nment), the geometric value, cross-sectional moment of inertia, was\n\nincreased and the elastic modulus, an intrinsic material property,\n\nwas decreased in the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice compared to\n\nwild-type littermates (figure 6). Moreover, the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice have less trabecular bone when compared to wild-type\n\nlittermates, which is quantified by decreased bone volume over\n\ntissue volume (BV/TV), decreased trabecular number (Tb.N),\n\ndecreased trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and increased trabecular\n\nseparation (Tb.Sp) (figure 6). These findings are partly in contrast\nto what was described for Lepre1\n\n2/2\nmice, which are characterized\n\nby a decrease in both trabecular and cortical bone mineral density\n\n[14], and cortical stiffness and force to failure of femurs [14].\n\nTo further study the trabecular bone phenotype in the\n\nLepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice, bone histomorphometric analysis was\n\nconducted on 3-month spines (n = 9). A statistically significant\n\ndecrease in bone volume over tissue volume and trabecular\n\nthickness confirmed the low bone mass phenotype (figure 7) [2].\nHowever, no differences in the osteoblast number (N.Ob/BS),\n\nosteoclast surface over bone surface (Oc.S/BS), osteoid parameters\n\n(osteoid volume over bone volume and osteoid surface over bone\n\nsurface) or bone formation rate were observed between the two\n\ngenotypes (figure 7).\n\nCollagen fibril ultrastructure, secretion rate, and steady-\nstate levels\n\nThe morphology of collagen fibrils was then analyzed at the\n\nultrastructural level in skin biopsies from Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice.\n\nThe electron micrographs showed collagen fibrils that were more\n\nhomogeneous in diameter compared to wild-type controls\n\n(figure 8). This suggested that collagen trimers may not be\nefficiently assembled into higher order collagen fibrils as reflected\n\nby an increase in the proportion of smaller diameter collagen\n\nfibrils in the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nskin (N = 3, 150 collagen diameters\n\nmeasured per animal, p,0.05) (figure 8).\n\nWe then analyzed the collagen secretion rate, as measured by\n\npulse-chase assays in dermal fibroblasts. The rate and amount of\n\nprocollagen secreted from the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nfibroblasts were\n\napparently similar to those secreted by wild-type fibroblasts\n\n(repeated 3 times) (figure 9A, B). These findings contrast with\nthe delayed procollagen secretion observed in the Lepre1\n\n2/2\nmice\n\nand are apparently different from the increase in the collagen\n\nsecretion rate observed in the Crtap\n2/2\n\nfibroblasts (figure 9A, B)\n[2,14]. We also assessed whether there was collagen overmodifica-\n\ntion by steady-state analysis. The electrophoretic migration of type\n\nI collagen chains synthesized by wild-type and Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nfibroblasts was similar and suggested normal post-translational\n\nmodification (repeated 3 times) (figure 9C). These findings differ\nfrom the overmodification observed in collagen isolated from\n\nCrtap\n2/2\n\nfibroblasts [2]. These findings support a conclusion that\n\nthe catalytically inactive P3H1\nH662A\n\nmutant protein can restore\n\nthe chaperone activity and collagen assembly function of the P3H1\n\ncomplex in the ER.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe generated and characterized a novel mouse model\n\n(Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\n) that harbors a knock-in mutation in the\n\ncatalytic domain of P3H1. This mutation inactivated the 3-\n\nhydroxylase activity of P3H1 and caused loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986\n\nin the collagen a1(I) chain of bone and a reduction to 9% 3-Hyp at\nPro986 in the a1(II) chain of cartilage. Our findings are similar to\nwhat has been reported in the null mouse mutants for the\n\ncomponents of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex [2,14,15].\n\nAdditionally, our data confirm the findings by Pokidysheva et. al.\n\nthat the Pro986 site in the a1(I) chain of bone is exclusively\nhydroxylated by P3H1 [21]. The hydroxylation status of the A3\n\n(Pro707) site of the a2(I) chain is similar between the wild-type and\n\nTable 2.

The\n\nexpression of Leprel1 (encoding P3H2) was found to be dramat-\n\nically reduced in the bone of Lepre1\n2/2\n\nmice, possibly explaining\n\nthe reduction in hydroxylation observed at the A3 site [21].\n\nPokidysheva et. al. also noted a slight increase in the expression\n\nlevel of Leprel2 (encoding P3H3), which could account for the\n\nresidual hydroxylation observed in the Lepre1\n2/2\n\nmice [21].\n\nAdditionally, since the hydroxylation status of the A3 site isolated\n\nfrom bone of Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice is similar to their wild-type\n\nlittermates, it supports the notion that another P3H is responsible\n\nfor hydroxylation at this site.

With high\n\nexpression of Leprel1 (encoding P3H2) in pre-hypertrophic\n\nchondrocytes and Leprel2 (encoding P3H3) in the resting/\n\nproliferating chondrocytes (not shown), it is possible that the 9%\n\nresidual hydroxylation of Pro986 in a1(II) in cartilage could be a\nresult of hydroxylation by P3H3 (or P3H2) analogous to the\n\nsituation in bone with a2(V). Alternatively, it is possible that the\nhistidine to alanine substitution at residue 662 may not completely\n\ninactivate the prolyl 3-hydroxylase function of P3H1 although we\n\nthink this is less likely given published biochemical analysis of this\n\nresidue and the lack of hydroxylation in bone [20].\n\nThe Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice have reduced trabecular bone, but\n\nnormal cortical bone and normal extrinsic cortical biomechanics.\n\nFigure 5. Lepre1H662A/H662A mice have a normal femoral hypertrophic zone. Since the Lepre12/2 animals showed disorganization of the\nhypertrophic zone, we assessed the hypertrophic zone (P1) of Lepre1H662A/H662A mice by H&E staining (A) and by specifically marking the hypertrophic\nzone using an antibody directed against type6collagen (B). The hypertrophic zone of the femur of the Lepre1H662A/H662A mice are indistinguishable\nfrom their wild-type littermates (B) and this is confirmed by quantifying the width of the hypertrophic zone in which there is no difference in the\nwidth between genotypes (C) (N = 10, both genotypes).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004121.g005\n\nFigure 6.

Due to physiological higher\n\nremodeling rates in trabecular bone, a mild effect is more likely to\n\nmanifest earlier in trabecular bone than in cortical bone, and this\n\ncould account for the differential phenotype observed in our mice.\n\nThe mild effect could also account for our histomorphometry data\n\nwhere we observe no difference in osteoid and bone formation\n\nparameters and is in contrast to the lower osteoid parameters and\n\nbone formation rate observed in the Crtap\n2/2\n\nmice [2]. Thus, due\n\nto a mild effect, we cannot detect a difference in the osteoid and\n\nthe dynamic indices of bone formation.\n\nAdditionally, cartilage is normal in the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice\n\nsuggesting that 3-Hyp modification in type II collagen is not\n\nrequired at least in the resting/proliferative zone.

The pronounced growth\n\ndefects and disorganized growth plates in the mice lacking a\n\nfunctional P3H1 complex may reflect a particular sensitivity of\n\ngrowth plate chondrocytes to ER stress caused by handling\n\nmisfolded un-partnered subunits of the complex.\n\nThe effect of 3-hydroxyproline on collagen stability is not clear.\n\nStudies originally suggested the absence of a triple-helix structure\n\nfor synthetic peptides containing 3-hydroxyproline at all Xaa\n\npositions [22,23]. Recent studies indicate the presence of one or\n\ntwo 3-hydroxyprolines in the Xaa position does produce a triple\n\nhelix with a consequent slight increase in stability [3,24,25]. These\n\ndata suggest that although the absence of 3-hydroxyproline may\n\nnot affect the stability of the triple-helix it may alter protein-\n\nprotein interactions [24]. Since matrix-cell signaling is important\n\nin the development and maintenance of connective tissues, it is\n\nplausible that collagen post-translational modifications like prolyl\n\n3-hydroxylation could specify protein-protein interactions between\n\ncollagen and other ECM components. Furthermore, these\n\ninteractions may be context-dependent differing in trabecular\n\nFigure 7. Histomorphometry of Lepre1H662A/H662A mice.

Candidates include ligand\n\ninteraction sites mapped to the fibril in proximity to Pro986 and\n\ninclude fibronectin and a1b1/a2b1/a1b11 integrins [26].\nMutations that result in loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation\n\ncomplex can result in collagen overmodification [27]. This could\n\nalso independently affect collagen fibril interaction sites, e.g., with\n\nsmall leucine rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) such as decorin. Such\n\ndisruption or other signaling effects could explain the disorgani-\n\nzation of the hypertrophic zone observed in the Lepre1\n2/2\n\nmice\n\nbut not observed in the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice. Future work\n\ninvestigating the signaling defects present in bone and cartilage\n\nwill be necessary to understand the chondrodysplasia present in\n\npatients carrying mutations in LEPRE1 or CRTAP.\n\nCompared with other tissues, the extracellular matrix of bone is\n\nunique in the sense that it is able to mineralize [28]. As the\n\ndominant component of bone, it is likely that type I collagen plays\n\nan important role in the manner of mineralization of the\n\nextracellular matrix. It has been argued that the collagen of bone\n\nhas evolved special features that equip it to constrain the growth\n\ninternally of nanocrystal plates of hydroxyapatite [27]. Extra-\n\nfibrillar non-collagenous proteins limit the amount of extrafibrillar\n\ncrystal growth [27].\n\nEvolutionarily, prolyl 4-hydroxylation increases the thermal\n\nstability of the triple helix through hydrogen bonding [29].\n\nAlthough loss of prolyl 3-hydroxylation is a feature of recessively\n\ninherited OI, the evolutionary function of 3-hydroxyproline is still\n\npoorly characterized. One clue to the potential role of 3-\n\nhydroxyproline in collagen is through the identification of partially\n\noccupied 3-Hyp sites in type I and II collagen; these are D-\n\nperiodically spaced and suggest the modification is involved in\n\nsome aspect of collagen fibril assembly [30]. Peptide studies\n\nsuggest that the 3-Hyp residues have selective affinity for one\n\nanother [30]. Additionally, the 3-hydroxyl groups are outward\n\npointing from the triple-helix, which provides evidence that short-\n\nrange hydrogen bonding between collagen triple helices is likely to\n\noccur [30]. Although 3-Hyp appears early in collagen evolution,\n\nthe 3-Hyp at Pro986 of the alpha I chain of type I collagen\n\nappeared much later [27,31]. In fact, the presence of 3-Hyp at this\n\nresidue coincides with the appearance of CRTAP and occurs just\n\nbefore the appearance of vertebrates and bone [32]. Taken\n\ntogether, with the potential role of 3-Hyp and the appearance of 3-\n\nHyp at Pro986 just prior to the appearance of vertebrates and\n\nbone, we speculate that this unique modification could have\n\nfunctioned to equip collagen molecules for a polymeric architec-\n\nture that allows organized hydroxyapatite nanocrystal growth\n\nwithin fibrils potentially explaining the lack of phenotype in\n\ncartilage vs. bone in our Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice.\n\nIn addition to the loss of 3-Hyp at Pro986, we observed an\n\nincrease in the HP/LP ratio in the bone of the Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice compared to their wild-type littermates. In both dominant\n\nand recessive OI, there is an increase in the HP/LP ratio,\n\nsupporting alterations in collagen crosslinking [33]. The increase\n\nin HP/LP ratio suggests a disturbance of the fibrillar architecture\n\nin bone and could result in the disorientation of nanocrystal plates\n\nof hydroxyapatite, but does not signify overmodification of the\n\ncollagen. Since we observe no difference in collagen migration\n\nfrom the steady-state collagen analysis, we conclude that there is\n\nno gross overmodification in the collagen isolated from the\n\nLepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice. Additionally, we observe no difference in\n\ncollagen secretion, providing indirect evidence that the P3H1\n\ncomplex is able to form and bind to collagen, in contrast to the\n\nLepre1\n2/2\n\nmice which have a delay in collagen secretion due to\n\nfailure of complex formation [14].\n\nFuture work investigating the contribution of signaling vs.\n\ncollagen cross-linking defects present in bone and cartilage will be\n\nnecessary to understand the generalized connective tissue pheno-\n\ntype present in patients carrying mutations in LEPRE1 or CRTAP.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics statement\nAll research involving animals was conducted according to the\n\nrelevant national and international guidelines.

Subsequently, cells were scraped in\n1 ml 16 PBS and transferred to a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Cells\nwere spun down at 14000 RPM for 5 minutes at room\n\ntemperature. Samples were resuspended with 50 ml of 5%B-ME\nand Lamellae loading buffer (Biorad) prior to the separation of\n\nproteins on a polyacrylamide gel.\n\nImmunodetection by immunoblot\n10 mg of protein was loaded into each well, run and transferred\n\nto a PVDF membrane using a standard wet transfer process. After\n\nblocking using 5% milk or 5% BSA, proteins were detected using\n\nthe following antibodies directed against P3H1, CRTAP, and c-\nTubulin (sigma) diluted in appropriate buffer. The blot was\n\nwashed 3 times, 10 minutes each with 16 TBS with 0.05%\nTween20 and then incubated with the corresponding secondary\n\nantibody and washed again. Proteins were visualized using the\n\nLuminato Crescendo HRP substrate (Millipore) by incubating blot\n\nwith the substrate for 2 minutes before exposing the blot to film\n\nand feeding it through the developer.\n\nImmunofluorescence\nFibroblasts were split into glass LAB-TEK 4-well chamber slides\n\n(Nunc), and 24 hours later were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,\n\ntreated with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in 10% donkey serum\n\nand 1% BSA, and then sequentially incubated with 1:250 dilution\n\nof CRTAP antisera or P3H1, 1:500 donkey anti-rabbit secondary\n\nantibody conjugated to Alexa Flour 594 (Invitrogen), and mounted\n\nwith Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). The\n\nslides were visualized using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope.\n\nRecombineering\nRecombineering was utilized to generate the P3H1 knock-in\n\nmouse model using the method described by Pentao Liu [40].\n\nBriefly, retrieval vector and targeting constructs were designed and\n\ncloned together in order to retrieve the section of Lepre1 for gene\n\ntargeting and for introducing the alanine substitution into the gene\n\nlocus. The linearized DNA construct was electroporated into AB2.2\n\nembryonic stem (ES) cells and screened for positive recombination\n\nevents by both Southern blot and sequencing. Germ-line transmis-\n\nsion of the mutant allele into C57BL6 was obtained.\n\nAnimal tissue collection and processing\nLepre1\n\nH662A/H662A\nmice and wild-type littermates were sacrificed\n\nat 3 months of age.

Immunofluorescence on mouse tissues\n\nwas done as previously described [41]. Briefly, the paraffin sections\n\nwere xylene treated, rehydrated, and heated for 20 minutes in a\n\nsteamer for antigen retrieval. Subsequently they were incubated in\n\nblocking solution (3% normal Donkey serum, 0.1% BSA, 0.1%\n\nTriton X-100 in PBS), 1:100 dilution of COLX antisera, 1:600\n\ndonkey ant-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa flour\n\n594 (Invitrogen), and finally mounted with Prolong Gold anti-fade\n\nreagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). At the end of each described\n\nprocedure, images were captured using a Zeiss Axioplan 2\n\nmicroscope. Radiographs were obtained by Kubtec XPERT80\n\n(Kubtec X-ray, Milford, CT). Routine histologic analysis of\n\nparaffin-embedded long bone and growth plates was done as per\n\nstandard protocols. Histomorphometric analysis of static and\n\ndynamic parameters (using 25 mg/kg calcein injection) of bone\n\nresorption, formation, and volume was carried out according to\n\nstandard procedure in 12 week-old (N = 6 each sex and genotype)\n\n[42] and analyzed using the Bioquant OsteoMetrics software\n\nsystem (BIOQUANT Image Analysis Corporation, Nashville,\n\nTN).\n\nMicro-CT analysis\nSpine and femur samples were placed into a 16 mm tube filled\n\nwith 70% ethanol and scanned at 16 micron resolution using a\n\nScanCo uct40 scanner (N = 10 each sex and genotype). Trabecular\n\nand cortical analysis was performed using the ScanCo software.\n\nThe trabecular region of the L4 vertebrae was manually selected\n\n(contoured) every 5 slices, and then the remaining slices were\n\nmorphed to enclose the region of interest, for a total of 100 slices.\n\nThe region was thresholded at 210 with a gauss setting of 0.\n\nCortical analysis was performed on 50 slices of the femoral\n\nmidshaft, using the same thresholding.\n\nThree-point bending analysis\nFemurs were collected (N = 7, both genotypes) during tissue\n\nharvest, wrapped in gauze soaked in 16PBS and stored at 220uC\nuntil ready for analysis.

The posterior surface of the femur\n\nwas placed on the lower supports and centered between the two\n\nsupports. The displacement rate used for the analysis was\n\n0.3425 mm/sec.\n\nStress was calculated using the following formula:\n\nStress~\n(0:5h)FL\n\n4I\n\nwhere F is the load applied on the femur in N, L is the span length\n\nin mm, h is the specimen diameter in mm, and I is the cross-\n\nsectional moment of inertia in mm\n4\n. L was set at 7 mm for the\n\nthree point bending jig. Both h and I were obtained by analyzing a\n\nmidshaft micro-CT image using the slice geometry program in\n\nBoneJ, a plugin for bone image analysis in ImageJ. The program\n\nidentified the bone in the grayscale micro-CT image by pixel\n\nbrightness and then calculated its cross-sectional parameters once\n\nan accurate scale was assigned.\n\nStrain was calculated using the following formula:\n\nStrain~\n6Dh\n\nL2\n\nwhere D is the actuator displacement in mm, h is the diameter in\n\nmm and L is the span length in mm.\n\nTo determine the Yield Point, a region was identified after the\n\npreload and before the maximum load on the Load-Displacement\n\ncurve. This region was separated into 2 segments from which the\n\nfitted line of the segment with greatest slope was taken. Next, a\n\n0.00876 mm offset was implemented on the line. The point of\n\nintersection between the offset line and the Load-Displacement\n\ncurve was the Offset Yield Point. This yield point corresponded to\n\na 0.2% offset strain, which is commonly chosen in the literature.\n\nThe elastic region was identified as the region from the completion\n\nof the preload to the Yield Point. Post-Yield region was identified\n\nas the region from the Yield Point until the Failure Point, where\n\nthe load dropped to zero. Elastic Displacement was the\n\ndisplacement during which specimen remained in elastic region.\n\nPost-Yield Displacement was the displacement during which\n\nspecimen remained in the Post-Yield region. Total Displacement\n\nwas calculated as the sum of Elastic Displacement and Post-Yield\n\nDisplacement. Using a trapezoidal numerical integration method,\n\nElastic Energy was calculated as the area under the elastic region\n\nof the Load-Displacement curve. Similarly, Post-Yield Energy was\n\ncalculated as the area under the post-yield region of the Load-\n\nDisplacement curve. Energy to Failure was the sum of Elastic\n\nEnergy and Post-Yield Energy. Maximum Load was determined\n\nby finding the highest load value recorded by BLUEHILL, before\n\nthe specimen failed. To calculate Stiffness, Least Square fit method\n\nwas applied to the steepest segment of the elastic region of the\n\nLoad-Displacement curve. Stiffness was the slope of least square fit\n\nline.\n\nUltimate Strength was determined by finding the highest Stress\n\nvalue before the specimen failed. Using a trapezoidal numerical\n\nintegration method, Elastic Toughness was calculated as the area\n\nunder the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve. Similarly, Post-\n\nYield Toughness was calculated as the area under the post-yield\n\nregion of the Stress-Strain curve. Toughness to Failure was the\n\nsum of Elastic Toughness and Post-Yield Toughness. To calculate\n\nElastic Modulus, Least Square fit method was applied to the\n\nsteepest segment of the elastic region of the Stress-Strain curve.\n\nElastic Modulus was the slope of least square fit line.\n\nElectron microscopy\nFreshly dissected tissues were fixed in 1.5% glutaraldehyde/\n\n1.5% paraformaldehyde with 0.05% tannic acid in 0.1 M\n\nCacodylate buffer, pH 7.4 for 60 minutes on ice, rinsed in 0.1\n\nM cacocylate overnight, then postfixed for 60 minutes in\n\ncacodylate buffered 1% OsO4, rinsed, then dehydrated in a\n\ngraded ethanol series from 30–100%. The samples were washed in\n\npropylene oxide and embedded in Spurrs epoxy. Ultrathin\n\nsections were stained in Uranyl Acetate followed by Reynolds\n\nlead citrate and examined using a FEI Tecnai G2 TEM.\n\nTransmission electron microscopy was performed on skin of wild-\n\ntype and Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice (N = 3). The fibril diameter of ten\n\nfibrils in each of fifteen different areas per mouse was measured\n\n(N = 150 total measurements).\n\nCollagen cross-link and mass spectral analyses\nPyridinoline cross-links (HP and LP) were quantified by HPLC\n\nafter hydrolyzing demineralized bone in 6N HCl as described\n\n[44].\n\nTypes I and V collagens were prepared from minced bone\n\ndecalcified at 4uC in 0.1M HCl overnight. Type I a-chains were\nextracted by heat denaturation (90uC) in SDS-PAGE sample\nbuffer. Type V collagen was solubilized by pepsin in 3% acetic\n\nacid and selectively precipitated by 1.8 m NaCl [45]. Type II\n\ncollagen was solubilized by CNBr digestion of rib cartilage in 70%\n\nformic acid [46]. Collagen a-chains and CNBr-peptides were\nresolved respectively on 6% and 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels [47].\n\nDemineralized bone matrix was digested with bacterial colla-\n\ngenase as described [48]. Collagenase-generated peptides were\n\nseparated by reversed-phase HPLC (C8, Brownlee Aquapore RP-\n\n300, 4.6 mm625 cm) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile:n-\npropanol (3:1 v/v) in aqueous 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid [49].\n\nIndividual fractions were analyzed by LC-MS.\n\nCollagen a-chains or CB peptide bands were cut from SDS-\nPAGE gels and digested with trypsin in-gel [50]. Peptides were\n\nanalyzed by electrospray LC/MS using an LCQ Deca XP ion-trap\n\nmass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan) equipped with in-line liquid\n\nchromatography using a C8 capillary column (300 um6150 mm;\nGrace Vydac 208MS5.315) eluted at 4.5 ul min. The LC mobile\n\nphase consisted of buffer A (0.1% formic acid in MilliQ water) and\n\nbuffer B (0.1% formic acid in 3:1 acetonitrile:n-propanol v/v). An\n\nelectrospray ionization source (ESI) introduced the LC sample\n\nstream into the mass spectrometer with a spray voltage of 3 kV.\n\nSequest search software (ThermoFinnigan) was used for peptide\n\nidentification using the NCBI protein database. Large collagenous\n\npeptides not found by Sequest had to be identified manually by\n\ncalculating the possible ms/ms ions and matching these to the actual\n\nms/ms. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine calculations were done\n\nmanually by scrolling or averaging the full scan over several minutes\n\nso that all of the post-translational variations of a given peptide\n\nappeared together in the full scan.\n\nFibroblast isolation from mice\nMice were euthanized using isoflurane, the fur was scraped off\n\nthe back of the mouse and a small section of skin was harvested.\n\nThe skin was washed with 16PBS and placed dermis down onto a\nwell of a 6-well plate. 2 ml of DMEM complete was added to the\n\nwell and the skin was cut into small pieces using a scalpel to allow\n\nfibroblasts to migrate from the skin.\n\nCollagen secretion from fibroblasts\nWe analyzed procollagen secretion by pulse-chase assay as\n\npreviously described [51,52]. Briefly, we plated 2.56105 cells onto\n\nEffects of P3H1 on Bone and Cartilage\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 14 January 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 1 | e1004121\n\n\n\na 35 mm dish and let them grow overnight. The next evening, the\n\nmedium was changed to DMEM complete with 50 mM ascorbate\nto induce collagen synthesis. After washing the cells 3 times with\n\n16PBS to remove FBS from the cells, the medium was replaced\nwith serum free DMEM containing 50 mM ascorbate and 140 mCi\nof L-[2,3,4,5-\n\n3\nH] proline. Cells were labeled for 1 hour and then\n\nchased with fresh medium containing unlabeled proline. Both the\n\ncell layer and medium were harvested in 16 PBS containing 16\ninhibitor at 20-minute intervals and the procollagen was precip-\n\nitated with collagen carrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Samples\n\nwere electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containing urea\n\nunder reducing conditions, dried, and imaged by exposing film to\n\ngel for 24 hours at 280uC and processed using a developer.\nProcollagen secretion over time was measured by comparing the\n\namount of labeled procollagen present in the cell layer and\n\nmedium at each time point. The pulse-chase assay was repeated\n\nthree times to confirm the results.\n\nCollagen steady-state analysis\nWe analyzed collagen modification by collagen steady-state\n\nanalysis as previously described [51,52]. Briefly, we plated\n\n2.56105 cells onto a 35 mm dish and let them grow overnight.\nThe medium was changed to DMEM complete with 50 mM\nascorbate to induce collagen synthesis. After 4 hours, the cells\n\nwere washed 3 times with 16PBS and the medium was replaced\nwith serum free DMEM containing 50 mM ascorbate and 140 mCi\nof L-[2,3,4,5-\n\n3\nH] proline. Cells were labeled overnight. Both the\n\ncell layer and medium were harvested in 16 PBS containing 16\ninhibitor and the procollagen was precipitated with collagen\n\ncarrier (Sigma) and absolute ethanol. Collagens were obtained by\n\novernight pepsin digestion (50 ug/ml) of procollagen samples.\n\nSamples were electrophoresed on a 5% acrylamide gel containing\n\nurea under reducing conditions for collagen samples, dried, and\n\nimaged by exposing film to gel for 24 hours at 280uC and\nprocessed using a developer. This assay was repeated three times\n\nto confirm the results.\n\nStatistical analyses\nData are expressed as mean values 6 standard deviation (SD).\n\nStatistical significance was computed using the Student’s t test. A P\n\nvalue ,0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Generation of Lepre1\nH662A\n\nmutant allele. A recombi-\n\nneering strategy was utilized to incorporate the H662A mutation\n\ninto the Lepre1 gene locus. Positive recombination events were\n\nanalyzed by Southern blot using XmnI to differentiate the\n\ngenomic locus allele from the targeted (Lepre1\nH662A\n\n) allele.\n\n(TIFF)\n\nFigure S2 Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice have a normal tibial hyper-\n\ntrophic zone. Since the Lepre1\n2/2\n\nanimals showed disorganization\n\nof the hypertrophic zone, we assessed the hypertrophic zone (P1)\n\nof Lepre1\nH662A/H662A\n\nmice by H&E staining (A) and by specifically\n\nmarking the hypertrophic zone using an antibody directed against\n\ntype6collagen (B). The hypertrophic zone of the tibia of the\nLepre1\n\nH662A/H662A\nmice are indistinguishable from their wild-type\n\nlittermates (B) and this is confirmed by quantifying the width of the\n\nhypertrophic zone in which there is no difference in the width\n\nbetween genotypes (C) (N = 10, both genotypes).\n\n(TIFF)\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank Catherine Ambrose and the Biomechanics lab at\n\nthe University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX for their help\n\nperforming the 3-point bending analysis.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: EPH JL RM DN DE BHLL.\n\nPerformed the experiments: EPH CL IG MMJ EMM BD TKB YC RL JH\n\nMAW.
