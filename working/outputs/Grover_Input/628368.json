In humans and other mammals,\ndeterminations of the expression and activity of alkaline phosphatase have frequently been used for cell determination in\ndevelopmental studies and/or within clinical trials. Alkaline phosphatase also seems to be one of the key markers in the\nidentification of pluripotent embryonic stem as well as related cells. However, alkaline phosphatases exist in some isoenzymes\nand isoforms, which have tissue specific expressions and functions. Here, the role of alkaline phosphatase as a stem cell marker is\ndiscussed in detail. First, we briefly summarize contemporary knowledge of mammalian alkaline phosphatases in general. Second,\nwe focus on the known facts of its role in and potential significance for the identification of stem cells.\n\n1. Alkaline Phosphatase\n\nAlkaline phosphatase (AP, EC 3.1.3.1 orthophosphoric-\nmonoesterase, alkaline optimum) is a membrane bound\nenzyme which occurs in almost all living organisms. Mam-\nmalian APs have low sequence identity with E. coli, but\nresidues involved in the active site of the enzyme and the\nligands coordinating the two zinc atoms and the magnesium\nion are conserved; thus, the catalytic mechanism is consid-\nered to be similar in prokaryotic and eukaryotic APs [1, 2].\nIndividual mammalian alkaline phosphatases differ in their\nheat stabilities and uncompetitive inhibition properties. This\nis the result of their nonhomologous disulphide bonds, their\nstructural significance, and nonconserved residues [3, 4].\nIn humans, and probably also in other mammals, four\nisoenzymes have developed during evolution and are coded\nby up to four genes. These four isoenzymes can be found\nin various tissues, where they have different physiological\nfunctions. We know three isoenzymes of AP which are\nspecific for certain tissues in humans; these are tissue-\nspecific alkaline phosphatases (TSAP). They are intestinal\nalkaline phosphatase (IAP; Kasahara isoenzyme), placental\n\nalkaline phosphatase (PLAP; Regan isoenzyme), and germ\ncell alkaline phosphatase (GCAP; Nagao isoenzyme), which\nare expressed by embryonic cells but also carcinoma cells.\nThe fourth isoenzyme is ubiquitous, and we call it tissue\nnonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). TNAP occurs in\nthree isoforms which are bone, liver, and kidney TNAP [5].\n\nIn mice, there are also four APs; three of them are\ntissue specific and the fourth is tissue nonspecific. Intestinal,\nintestinal-like (IAP-like), and embryonicAP (EAP) are TSAP.\nThe IAP-like AP was identified in mice, which have a knock-\nout gene for IAP and still measurable residual activity in the\ngut.Murine EAP is similar to humanGCAP [6].Many impor-\ntant facts about the structure, physical and chemical proper-\nties, gene localisation, regulation, function, and tissue expres-\nsion ofAPs can be obtained fromMillán (2006) andMcComb\net al. (2011) [7, 8]. In the field of stem cell biology, TNAP\nare the main focus of interest, but EAP or GCAP, which are\nexpressed in pluripotent inner call mass and primordial cells,\nrespectively, cannot be ignored (see below). In general, TNAP\nand EAP/GCAP are frequently associated with germ layers,\nprogenitors, and naive nondifferentiating cells.\n\nHindawi Publishing Corporation\nStem Cells International\nVolume 2015, Article ID 628368, 11 pages\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/628368\n\n\n\n2 Stem Cells International\n\nIn contrast, TSAPs are expressed with the increasing\ndifferentiation and maturation of particular cell lineages and\ntissues, because of their connection to the functions of such\ncells, for example, enterocytes (IAP) [9–11].\n\n2. Expression of AP during Development\n\nSimilar to other lineages and developmental-specific genes\nrecognized as determinants of stem cells, the expression\npattern of AP during ontogenesis in some parts of tissues\nalso corresponds with particular stem cell precursors and\ntheir niches. Thus, here, we briefly summarize the expression\nand presumable function of particular AP associated with\ncell differentiation potential (such as pluripotency, e.g.,) and\nstemness during development in general.\n\nThe expression of alkaline phosphatase can already be\ndetected in 2-cell stage preimplantation embryos in mice\nand it is equally expressed in each embryonic cell to the\nstage of early blastocyst. At first, it is expressed by both the\ntrophectoderm and inner cell mass (ICM). In the stage of\nlate blastocyst, it seems that AP is strictly expressed in ICM.\nLepire and Ziomek [12] described the isoenzyme of AP\nin the preimplantation stage of embryo-embryonic alkaline\nphosphatase (EAP). Until this discovery only two isoenzymes\nofAPhad been defined inmice: EAP andTNAP. TNAP is also\nexpressed in the preimplantation embryo, but 10 times less\nthan EAP. Approximately 7 days post coitum (dpc) the expres-\nsion of Akp5 (EAP) decreases rapidly and Akp2 (TNAP)\nbecomes themajor gene of AP, which is expressed between 7–\n14 dpc in primordial germ (PG) cells [6]. The PG cells exhibit\nhigh activity of TNAP during migration to the developing\ngonad.The activity of TNAP decreases 14-15 dpc in these cells\n[13]. In humans, it is known that the expression of alkaline\nphosphatases is detectable prior to 4 weeks of gestation [14,\n15].\n\nIn contrast to mice PG cells (which express TNAP),\nGCAP activity is observed in human migrating PG cells\n[15–17]. In the adult, it is primarily synthesized in the\ntestes, cervix, and thymus. Trace amounts are synthesized\nin placenta and lung tissues [18]. It is not known whether\nAP is expressed in the preimplantation stage of human\nembryos. Also, little is known about the expression of other\nisoenzymes in human embryonic development because of\nethical limitations. On the 8th day post coitum (in mice),\nTNAP is also expressed in the neuroectoderm [19]. Later\n(9.5 dpc), TNAP activity is observed in the area of the brain\nand spinal cord. Between 10.5 and 14.5 dpc, TNAP activity is\nobserved in the mesencephalon and the rhombencephalon,\nalong the entire spinal cord and cranial nerves, and at the end\nof this stage TNAP positive fibres are in the pons. Fourteen-\nand-a-half days post coitum, TNAP expression is decreased in\nthe neuroepithelium. In the adult, TNAP positive clusters are\nobserved in the subependymal layer, where the neural pro-\ngenitors are localized. It is suggested that TNAP is involved\nin the development of the nervous system partly as an\nectonucleotidase in neurogenic zones [20, 21] or specifically\nby interacting with collagen during neuronal migration [22,\n23]. However, TNAP activity is detectable in the choroid\nplexus up to adult age [23].\n\nHowever, amongst all vertebrates (including humans),\nTNAP activity is dominant in the developing skeleton,\nbecause TNAP is involved in the mineralization of tissues.\nThe activity within the developing skeleton is associated with\nthe expression of TNAP in chondrocytes and osteoblasts. In\nmice this arises between 13 and 14 dpc [19].\n\nThe expression of another AP, TSAP, is also mostly\nassociated with cell differentiation and such AP activity is\ngenerally recognized as amarker of cell differentiation [9, 24–\n26].\n\n3. Role and Function of AP\n\nIf we ask why some stem cells express AP, we must know how\nAPs are utilized by particular cells. In general, AP catalyzes\nthe hydrolysis of phosphate esters. AP exhibits three types of\nactivity [27–31]:\n\n(1) hydrolytic activity R–P + H–OH→R–OH + H–P,\n\n(2) phosphotransferase activity R–P + R\U000f8020–OH→R–OH\n+ R\U000f8020P,\n\n(3) pyrophosphatase activity R–P–P–R\U000f8020+ H–OH→R–P\n+ R\U000f8020–P.\n\nHydrolytic activity is considered a general reaction which is\ncatalysed by AP.\n\nThe role of individual APs is also apparent from the phe-\nnotype of organisms with nonfunctional AP. EAP depletion\nis not associated with any detectable abnormalities. Also, the\ndepletion of TNAP has no effect on the differentiation or\nmigration of PGC, so we may suggest a similar state also for\nGCAP in human PGC; however, experimental data are unob-\ntainable due to ethical limitations. PLAP,which is only known\nin primates, enables the transport of maternal IgG through\nthe placenta and, by an unknown mechanism, improves the\ngrowth and development of embryos and cells in general.\nHigh levels of GCAP and PLAP are also markers of tumor\ndiseases, typically, such neoplasia as germ cell tumours [32,\n33], squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [34], and carcinoma\nof the gastrointestinal tract and uterus [35, 36].\n\nThe key roles of TNAP are in the mineralization of\nhard tissue (it provides free phosphate for the creation of\nhydroxyapatite crystals and hydrolyses pyrophosphate, an\ninhibitor of bonematrix formation) and in themetabolism of\nvitamin B6, and thus in the metabolism of neurotransmitter\n𝛾-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Therefore, the depletion or\nrecessive mutation of TNAP leads to defects in both the\nmineralization of hard tissue and the development of the\nnervous system.\n\nIAP plays a role in the transport of fatty acids and triglyc-\nerides from the intestinal tract to the circulation [37–40].\nIAP also regulates duodenal surface pH [41] and detoxifies\nbacterial endotoxins in the colon by means of dephosphory-\nlation [42, 43].\n\n\n\nStem Cells International 3\n\n4. Regulation of the Expression and\nActivity of AP\n\nAP activity clearly correlates with its expression, and its\nfine regulation is mediated by the actual microenvironment\nrather than by some individual signaling pathways. Thus,\nAP expression and activity are regulated mainly through the\ndevelopmental status of cells or tissues. Therefore, as men-\ntioned above, AP expression is a generally suitable marker\nof differentiation processes both in vivo and in vitro for\nparticular cell types. Although some data on the role of p38\nkinase (mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) p38) in the\nregulation of TNAP expression exist, the precise mechanism\nremains unknown [44–47]. Similarly, we observed both a\ndecreased level of AP and decreasedAP activity in p38−/−ES\ncells [48, 49] in comparison with their wt counterparts, while\nthe expressions of pluripotent markers such as Oct-4, Nanog,\nand Zfp42 remained unchanged (our unpublished data).\n\n5. Alkaline Phosphatase and Stem Cells\n\n5.1. Pluripotent Stem Cells. A high level of AP and high\nAP activity are traditional markers of pluripotent embryonic\nstem (ES) cells, both mouse and human. This is based on the\nfact that ICM is highly positive for AP activity, in contrast to\ntrophoblast cells at the blastocyst stage. As ICM is committed\nto lineage differentiation, AP expression is downregulated\nand it appears in discrete specialized cell populations such\nas PG cells and later also in other tissues, for example, in\nosteoblasts (see above). High AP activity is associated with\nthe majority of pluripotent stem cells. Embryonal cancer\n(EC also called teratocarcinoma stem cells), embryonic germ\n(EG), the already mentioned embryonic stem (ES), and\ninduced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells express high activity\nof AP. Interestingly, the absence of AP activity has been\nreported in pluripotent epiblast stem (EpiS) cells, which are\nderived from epiblasts of later developmental stages of the\nembryo than those from which ES cells are derived. The\npluripotency of EpiS cells is partially restricted in comparison\nwith other pluripotent stem cells, which correspond to their\nmore differentiated phenotype, compared to ES cells [50, 51].\n\nMouse ES cells are derived from pluripotent cells of ICM\nof early blastocyst 3.5–4 dpc. At this time, theAkp5 gene (cod-\ning EAP) is dominantly expressed in the embryo. However,\nmouse ES cells express the Akp2 gene (coding TNAP), which\nis used for determination of their undifferentiated state [52].\nMouse PG, EG, and EC cells derived from teratocarcinoma\nalso show high activity of TNAP [13, 53, 54]. The dominant\nexpression of TNAP but not EAP in mouse ES cells supports\nthe hypothesis concerning a shared predecessor of ES and\nPG/EG cells [55]. On the other hand, the shift in expression\nof AP isoenzymes may also correspond to the fact that the\nexpression of AP is important for cells, but that, as cell\nenvironments are modified during developmental processes,\nparticular AP may work more effectively in new conditions.\nThis, we may suggest, is based on the sensitivity of particular\nAP to various amino acids and small peptides, which were\ndetermined as inhibitors of AP activity; these are presented\n\nin Table 1 [5, 56–62]. However, further experiments will be\nrequired to verify such a hypothesis.\n\nIn human embryos, GCAP activity is found in PG cells, in\ncontrast to human ES cells, where TNAP is detected [63, 64].\nHowever, it is uncertain whether GCAP is also expressed,\nwhich might be expected. Human EC cells express both\nisoenzymes, TNAP and GCAP [65]. In human EG cells, the\nGCAP isoenzyme is expected, because GCAP is expressed in\nmigrating human primordial germ cells and gonocytes [18,\n63]. However, precise studies of this phenomenon in humans\nare lacking.\n\nIn addition, some experimental results point to greater\nsimilarity betweenmouse ES/PG/EG/ECandhumanPG/EG/\nEC cells, but not human ES cells, which raises another\nquestion about the significance and role of AP in these cells\n[66].\n\nHowever, this inconsistency in the phenotype of these\ncells was partially resolved by Brons et al. [51] and Tesar\net al. [50]. Both these groups described so-called epiblast\nstem (EpiS) cells, which correspond to pluripotent cells of\nepiblast. Mouse EpiS cells are more differentiated thanmouse\nES cells. Mouse and human ES cells should be equivalent in\ntheir properties. However, human ES cells correspond more\nclosely to mouse EpiS cells. Interestingly, EpiS cells do not\nexhibit detectable AP activity [50]. Thus, we can suggest that\nthe precise determination of AP isoform expression patterns\nin human ES in comparison to the abovementioned cell\npopulations may further improve our picture of its identity,\nregulation of self-renewal, and phenotype.\n\nThe specific importance of AP for pluripotent cells as well\nfor pluripotent stem cells remains questionable. Andäng et al.\nsuggest the importance of GABA synthesis in ES cells for the\nregulation of their proliferation and self-renewal [67] and that\nAP participates in GABA synthesis (see above). We may also\nsuggest the increased need for substrate dephosphorylation\nassociated with the quickly proliferating metabolism of ES\ncells. In ICM and other types of pluripotent cells, we can also\nhypothesise a similar role for AP as in ES cells.\n\nInterestingly, as mentioned above and expected in EpiS\ncells, all known mouse and human pluripotent stem cells\nexpress TNAP preferentially. The expression of TNAP is also\nquickly upregulated during the process of reprogramming\nsomatic cells into iPS cells. In the original protocol, the\niPS phenotype is induced through the exogenous expression\nof four genes: Oct-4 (Pouf5), Sox-2, and Klf4, which are\nresponsible for the maintenance of pluripotency, and c-\nmyc, responsible for the induction and/or increasing rate of\nproliferation [68]. TNAP expression increases directly after\nthe transfection of somatic cells by these four genes. This\ncorresponds with the conception of the direct regulation of\nTNAP expression by Oct-4 and Sox-2 [69]; see Table 2.Thus,\nTNAP expression appears long before real cell reprograming\nand the reexpression of endogenous genes for Oct-4 or Sox-2\n[70]. Further, our in silico analysis identified several binding\nsites for both Oct-4 and Sox-2 and further factors associated\nwith pluripotency such as Nanog, Tcf3, Sa4b, and FoxD3 in\npromoters of TNAP (Table 2). For all the above-mentioned\nfacts, AP activity is a widely accepted marker of pluripotent\nstem cells and it has been shown that the maintenance\n\n\n\n4 Stem Cells International\n\nTa\nbl\ne\n1:\nA\nlk\nal\nin\ne\nph\n\nos\nph\n\nat\nas\nes\n\nex\npr\nes\nse\nd\nin\n\nhu\nm\nan\nsa\n\nnd\nm\nic\ne\nw\nith\n\nth\nei\nrb\n\nas\nic\nat\ntr\nib\nut\nes\n.\n\nIs\noe\nnz\nym\n\ne\nA\nP\n\nG\nen\ne\n\nM\nol\nec\nul\nar\n\nw\nei\ngh\nt\n\nTi\nss\nue\n\nlo\nca\nliz\nat\nio\nn\n\nTe\nm\npe\nra\ntu\nre\n\nof\nin\nac\ntiv\n\nat\nio\nn\n\nSp\nec\nifi\nc\nin\nhi\nbi\nto\nrs\n\nPL\nA\nP\n\nA\nLP\n\nP\n90\n–1\n20\n\nkD\na\n\nSy\nnc\n\nyt\nio\ntr\nop\n\nho\nbl\nas\nt\n\nSt\nab\nle\nat\n70\n∘\nC\n\nne\nur\nam\n\nin\nid\nas\ne\n[5\n],\nL-\nph\n\nen\nyl\nal\nan\nin\ne\n[5\n8]\n,\n\nL-\nle\nuc\nin\ne\n[6\n0]\n,L\n-l\neu\ncy\nl-\ngl\nyc\nyl\n-g\nly\nci\nne\n\n[5\n6]\n,L\n-p\nhe\nny\nla\nla\nny\nl-\ngl\nyc\nyl\n-g\nly\nci\nne\n\n[5\n6]\n\nG\nC\nA\nP\n\nA\nLP\n\nPL\n2\n\nPG\nC\n,t\nes\nte\ns,\nce\nrv\nix\n,t\nhy\n\nm\nus\n\nEA\nP\n(m\n\nou\nse\n)\n\nA\nkp\n5\n(A\nlp\npl\n2)\n\nPr\nei\nm\npl\nan\n\nta\nti\non\n\nst\nag\ne\nof\n\nem\nbr\nyo\n\nIA\nP\n\nIA\nP-\nlik\n\ne\n(m\n\nou\nse\n)\n\nA\nLP\n\nI(\nhu\n\nm\nan\n)A\n\nkp\n3\n\n(m\nou\n\nse\n)\n\nA\nkp\n6\n(A\nlp\ni)\n\n70\n–9\n\n0\nkD\n\na\nSm\n\nal\nli\nnt\nes\nti\nne\n\n(d\nuo\n\nde\nnu\n\nm\n)\n\nSt\nab\nle\nat\n56\n∘\nC\n\nL-\nPh\n\nen\nyl\nal\nan\nin\ne\n[5\n8]\n,L\n-t\nry\npt\nop\n\nha\nn\n[5\n9]\n\nB\non\n\ne\nis\nof\nor\nm\n\nT\nN\nA\nP\n\nA\nLP\n\nL\n(h\num\n\nan\n)\n\nA\nlp\nl(\nm\nou\n\nse\n)\n\n12\n0–\n\n15\n0\nkD\n\na\n\nB\non\n\ne\n(p\nre\nos\nte\nob\n\nla\nst\nic\nce\nlls\n,\n\nba\nso\nla\nte\nra\nls\nite\n\nof\nos\nte\nob\n\nla\nst\ns)\n,\n\nch\non\n\ndr\noc\nyt\nes\n,o\ndo\n\nnt\nob\n\nla\nst\ns\n\nPG\nC\n(m\n\nou\nse\n),\nbr\nai\nn\n\n(s\nub\n\nep\nen\ndy\nm\nal\nla\nye\nr)\n,\n\nem\nbr\nyo\n,t\nes\nte\ns(\nm\nou\n\nse\n)\n\nN\non\n\nst\nab\nle\nat\n55\n∘\nC\n\nL-\nH\nom\n\noa\nrg\nin\nin\ne\n[6\n1]\n,n\n\neu\nra\nm\nin\nid\nas\ne\n[5\n],\n\nL-\nle\nva\nm\nis\nol\ne\n[5\n7]\n,i\nm\nid\naz\nol\ne\n[6\n2]\n\nLi\nve\nri\nso\nfo\nrm\n\nT\nN\nA\nP\n\nLi\nve\nr(\nbi\nlle\n\nep\nith\n\nel\niu\nm\n)\n\nA\nt5\n5∘\nC\nm\nor\ne\nst\nab\nle\n\nth\nan\n\nbo\nne\n\nis\nof\nor\nm\n\nK\nid\nne\ny\nis\nof\nor\nm\n\nT\nN\nA\nP\n\nK\nid\nne\n\ny\n(e\npi\nth\nel\nia\nlc\nel\nls\nof\n\npr\nox\nim\n\nal\ntu\nbu\n\nle\ns)\n\nN\non\n\nst\nab\nle\nat\n45\n∘\nC\n\nPL\nA\nP:\n\npl\nac\nen\nta\nlA\n\nP;\nG\nC\nA\nP:\n\nge\nrm\n\nce\nll\nA\nP;\n\nEA\nP:\n\nem\nbr\nyo\nni\nc\nA\nP;\n\nIA\nP:\n\nin\nte\nst\nin\nal\nA\nP;\n\nT\nN\nA\nP:\n\ntis\nsu\ne\nno\n\nns\npe\nci\nfic\n\nA\nP.\n\n\n\nStem Cells International 5\n\nTable 2: Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) analysis of promoters of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase isoforms.\n\nSpecies Gene symbol(name)\n\nMatrix family/matrix\nV$HOXF V$STEM V$SORY V$FKHD V$RXRF\n\nV$NANOG.01 V$OCT3 4.02 (Oct-4) V$OSNT.01 V$SOX2.01 V$HFH2.01 (FoxD3) V$RAR RXR.01\n\nHuman\nALPP (PLAP) 1 — — — — 2\nALPPL2\n(GCAP)\n\n— 1 1 1 — 1\n\nALPL (TNAP) 1 3 4 — — 3\n\nMouse\nAlppl2 (EAP) 1 — — — — —\nAlpl\n(Akp2/TNAP)\n\n1 6∗ 2 1 1 7\n\nNANOG, Oct3-4, SOX-2, FoxD3, and RAR/RXR binding motifs were predicted by the Genomatix software tool MatInspector (1) (digits denote numbers\nof matches) and further analysed using the rVista algorithm (based on Transfac Professional Library v10.2) (2) for evolutionary conserved motifs between\nmouse and human (grey fields).The asterisk “∗” symbol indicates previously observed Oct-4 binding in Alpl (Akp2) regulatory sequences using the Chip-PET\nmethodology (3, 4). Matrix V$OSNT.01 represents composed binding sites for Oct-4, Sox-2, Nanog, Tcf3 (Tcf7l1), and Sall4b in pluripotent cells.\n\nof AP activity in AP-positive colony formation positively\ncorrelates with the clonogenic and self-renewal potential of\nundifferentiated human ES cells in cultures [64]. In addition,\nAP activity is downregulated reciprocally with differentiation\nprocesses involving pluripotent stem cells [71]. On the other\nhand, depletion of the TNAP gene Akp2 has no effect on the\nformation of either ICM or PG cells or their expansions in\nmouse [52]. Surprisingly, at the same time, both ICM and\nPG cells may be considered at least precursors of pluripotent\nstem cells, as are ES or EG cells. Unfortunately, little is known\nabout the inability to isolate ES cells fromTNAP−/− embryos.\nMore importantly, a consequence of TNAP depletion is a\nnegative effect on bone development and vitamin B turnover\n(see above).\n\nInterestingly, although EAP is the dominant form of AP\nin pluripotent ICM, we recognized only one Nanog binding\nsite within the mouse EAP gene, and no binding sites were\nobserved for the other pluripotent genesmentioned above. In\nhuman GCAP, one binding site for the mentioned pluripo-\ntent genes, apart from FoxD3, was recognized (Table 2).\nThe mechanism concerning the shift from EAP/GCAP\nexpression in pluripotent ICM to TNAP expression in the\nother pluripotent cells and PG cells is still not understood.\n\nHowever, it seems clear that TNAP expression is not\nclosely associated with pluripotent stem cells or with pluripo-\ntency alone, because ICM cells express another AP domi-\nnantly and they have no pure self-renewal potential (and such\nICM cells cannot be recognized as stem cells) [19]. Further-\nmore, PG cells are other cells which strongly express TNAP\nand other so-called pluripotent markers (Oct-4, Nanog), but\nthey are not pluripotent.\n\nParadoxically, the regulation of TNAP expression in\npluripotent stem cells is also influenced by the effect\nof retinoic acid (RA). RA has a prodifferentiation and\npleiotropic effect on many cells both in vivo and in vitro\n[72, 73]. The RA effect is fast and strong. Cells undergo the\ndifferentiation process after the addition of RA to a culture\nindependently of other conditions. The final phenotype\ndepends on the RA concentration, type of culture (adherent,\nsuspension), and presence of particular signaling molecules\n\n[72, 74–77]. It is interesting that TNAP activity increases with\nthis differentiation, although both stemness and pluripotent\nmarkers decrease. This has been proven in both EC and\nES cells ([78, 79] and Figure 2). The upregulation of TNAP\nexpression is clearly mediated by RA receptors binding\nmotifs in the TNAP gene (Table 2). The role and significance\nof this RA-induced TNAP expression in EC and ES cell\ndifferentiation are unknown. However, this observation goes\nagainst the hypothesis concerning the role of TNAP in fast\nproliferating cells. RA induces a decrease in the proliferation\nand accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle in\nboth ES and EC cells [80–82].\n\nFurther, the in vitro study of the differentiation of ES cells\nto PG cells yields a remarkable observation. RA is required for\nthe induction of PG cell formation during the EBs-mediated\ndifferentiation of ES cells [83]. In this system, 5-day-old\nEBs, in which TNAP, Oct-4, and Nanog expression have\nbeen downregulated, are treated by RA. After this treatment,\nPG cells can be determined within EBs. However, PG cells\nalso express high levels of Oct-4, Nanog, and TNAP [84].\nIncreased TNAP may simply be explained by the presence\nof RA receptor (RAR/RXR) binding sites in the TNAP gene,\nas mentioned above. However, the expression of Oct-4 is\ndirectly inhibited by RA [85]. The expression of Nanog, the\nsecond most important pluripotent gene, can be positively\nregulated by RA, as has been shown in some recent studies\n[77, 86]. In this case, Nanog expression is probably induced\nthrough the induction of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)\nexpression by RA or other retinoids [86]. IGF is a strong\ninductor of the PI3-K pathway, whose activity leads to the\nincreasing expression of Nanog in ES cells [87, 88]. Thus,\nRA mediates the auto- and paracrine stimulation of PI3-\nK pathways by IGF. Importantly, Nanog itself regulates the\nexpression of Oct-4 [89]. Thus, we suppose that, in the\nmentioned model of the RA-induced formation of PG cells,\nOct-4 expression is upregulated and maintained by Nanog.\nThe feedback in the regulation network Oct-4/Nanog and\nthe positive role of IGF in the maintenance of ES cells are\nwell known [87, 89, 90]. However, the factors that enable the\nabove supposed RA-induced creation of Oct-4 positive cells\n\n\n\n6 Stem Cells International\n\nAP activity\n\n0.0\nES bmMSC aMSC NSC\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nac\n\ntiv\nity\n\n o\nf A\n\nP\n\n∗\n\n∗\n\n(a)\n\nTNAP\n\n0.00\n\n0.05\n\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\nTr\nan\n\nsc\nri\n\npt\n le\n\nve\nl r\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nto\n G\n\nA\nPD\n\nH\n\n∗∗ ∗∗\n\n∗\n\nES bmMSC aMSC NSC\n\n(b)\n\nOct-4\n\n0.0000\n\n0.0005\n\n0.0010\n0.10\n\n0.15\n\n0.20\n\nTr\nan\n\nsc\nri\n\npt\n le\n\nve\nl r\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nto\n G\n\nA\nPD\n\nH ∗∗\n\nES bmMSC aMSC NSC\n\n(c)\n\nNanog\n\n0.00\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.10\n\nTr\nan\n\nsc\nri\n\npt\n le\n\nve\nl r\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nto\n G\n\nA\nPD\n\nH\n∗∗\n\nES bmMSC aMSC NSC\n\n(d)\n\nOstC\n\n0.000\n\n0.002\n\n0.004\n\n0.006\n\n0.008\n\n0.010\n\nTr\nan\n\nsc\nri\n\npt\n le\n\nve\nl r\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nto\n G\n\nA\nPD\n\nH\n\n∗\n\n∗\n\nES bmMSC aMSC NSC\n\n(e)\n\nOstP\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nTr\nan\n\nsc\nri\n\npt\n le\n\nve\nl r\n\nel\nat\n\niv\ne \n\nto\n G\n\nA\nPD\n\nH\n\n∗\n\n∗\n\nES bmMSC aMSC NSC\n\n(f)\n\nFigure 1: Relative alkaline phosphatase activity (a) and mRNA expression of TNAP ((b) qRT-PCR) in various stem/progenitor cells.\nBone marrow-derived MSC (bmMSC) has both high AP activity and TNAP expression, followed by ES cells.

We can hypothesize\na small degree of balance between the expression of RA-\ntargeted genes and modulation of the Oct-4/Nanog network.\nThe reciprocal ordering of Oct-4 and Nanog expression\nduring the establishment of their network may also play an\nimportant role here. Recently, the preferential role of Nanog\nin PG cell formation rather than in pluripotency itself has also\nbeen demonstrated [91].\n\n5.2. Other Stem Cells. The high expression/activity of AP in\nES cells leads to the presumption that it is a universal marker\nof SC. Recent research has not confirmed the accuracy of\nsuch an assumption. Except for spermatogonia stem cells,\na high level of AP has not been definitively demonstrated\nas a general SC marker in other recognized tissue-specific\nstem (embryonal or adult) cells or stem cell rich populations.\nNevertheless, Langer et al. [20] determined some TNAP\npositive cells in embryonal and adult central nervous systems.\nThese neural TNAP positive cells were observed within cell\n\npopulations of the subventricular zone,which is rich in neural\nstem cells and various neural progenitors. Some of these\nprogenitors were TNAP positive. Here, TNAPwas not associ-\nated with particular progenitors, but with subpopulations of\nseveral identified progenitors. It seems that TNAP expression\nin the subventricular zone (SVZ) is not associated with a\nspecific cell phenotype, but with cell behaviour, for example,\nproliferation or migration [20]. This hypothesis is supported\nby the mitogenic effect of adenosine generated by TNAP\nthrough the hydrolyzation of nucleoside triphosphates and\ndiphosphates [20, 92]. Further examples of AP activity in\nsomatic stem cells can be found in reports of various sets\nof mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) [93–95]. Sobiesiak et al.\n[96] identified TNAP as a stemness marker ofMSC, signed as\nMACS1. Recently, however, Kim et al. [97] presented proost-\neogenic properties of MSC with higher TNAP activity. MSC\nderived from adipose tissue exhibit significantly lower levels\nof TNAP transcript and activity (Figure 1). This is in contrast\nto the situation in pluripotent stem cells, in which it may be\nsuggested that improved stemness correlates with high TNAP\n\n\n\n8 Stem Cells International\n\nactivity, excluding RA effects (see above). The notion that\nTNAP in mesenchymal cells is a mark of progenitors rather\nthan MSC themselves is also supported by further studies\ndocumenting high TNAP in differentiated osteoblasts and\nodontoblasts [97, 98] (Figure 1). In addition, side population\n(SP) cells derived from human dental pulp tissue, which are\nrich in stem cells, exhibit lower levels of TNAP mRNA than\nthemajor population [98]. However, further detailed study in\nthis field and on tissue-derived SP cells would be useful. Data\ncomparing the expressions and activities of TNAP in various\nstem cell-enriched populations are presented in Figure 1.\n\n6. Conclusion\n\nTNAP expression is a suitable marker of pluripotent stem\ncells, but with some limitations. A high level of AP correlates\nvery well with pluripotency and undifferentiated pluripotent\nstem cell phenotypes. A low level of AP activity denotes the\nrestriction of pluripotency, which was also observed in EpiS\ncells [50, 51] and with differentiation. Some other limitations\nare mentioned above. In all other cases, that is, in adult SC,\nand so forth, a high level of AP is associated with the process\nof differentiation rather than with stemness. Thus, particular\ncell types are able to regulate the expression of TNAP, and\nprobably also other APs, through various combinations of\ntranscriptional regulatory networks. Accordingly, AP such as\nTNAP, for example, may be expressed under the control of\nOct-4 in pluripotent cells and also in Oct-4 negative cells,\nsuch as mesenchymal cells and their progeny. Unfortunately,\nthe importance of AP activity for pluripotent cells and/or\nstem cells (principally for pluripotent stem cells) is still\ngenerally unclear. Similarly, we do not understand the role of\nthe shift in expression of EAP/GCAP to TNAP between ICM\nand ES cells. Does it play a role in the pluripotency of stem\ncells or does it only represent a marker of the common ances-\ntor/precursor of ES and PG cells? Curiously enough, no PG\nor ICM cells are considered genuine pluripotent stem cells.\nPG cells are not pluripotent and both ICM and PG cells have\nlimited self-renewal potential [55]. To answer the question of\nwhether AP/TNAP level and activity are common markers\nof pluripotent stem cells, further work is required.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interests\nregarding the publication of this paper.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry\nof Education, Youth and Sport of the Czech Repub-\nlic (MSM0021622430, HistoPARK CZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0185),\nand the European Regional Development Fund (KI-MU;\nCZ.1.07/2.3.00/20.0180).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] E.
