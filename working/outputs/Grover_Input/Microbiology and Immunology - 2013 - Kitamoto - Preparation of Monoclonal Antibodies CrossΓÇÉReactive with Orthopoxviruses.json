The last naturally occurring case\nin the world was in Somalia in 1977.  Variola virus\n(smallpox virus) caused smallpox infection.  Except for\nlaboratory stockpiles, the variola virus has been elimi-\nnated.  However, there is heightened concern that the\nvariola virus might be used as an agent of bioterrorism\nor biowarfare.  Therefore, the government of each\ncountry is taking precautions for dealing with a small-\npox outbreak.  Smallpox is a serious, contagious, and\nsometimes fatal disease.  Although the only prevention\nis vaccination, routine vaccination among the general\npublic was stopped.  There is no specific treatment for\nthe smallpox disease.\n\nConfirmation of a smallpox outbreak requires diag-\nnosis.  Laboratory diagnostic testing for the variola\nvirus has been conducted by serological assays, negative\nstain electron microscopy (EM) identification, or isola-\ntion of the variola virus from a clinical specimen.\nRecently, diagnosis has been performed by polymerase\nchain reaction (PCR) (2, 4, 16, 22), restriction fragment\nlength polymorphism (19), microarrays (17) and the\nsequencing (23) of viral DNA.  Genetic diagnosis has a\nhigh sensitivity and specificity, but might be costly,\ncomplicated and time-consuming.  In contrast, the sero-\nlogical assay may be more rapid and simple than the\n\nPreparation of Monoclonal Antibodies \nCross-Reactive with Orthopoxviruses and Their\nApplication for Direct Immunofluorescence Test\n\nNoritoshi Kitamoto*, 1, Takayuki Kobayashi1, Yoji Kato1, Nobutaka Wakamiya2, Kazuyoshi\nIkuta3, Tomoyuki Tanaka4, Shigeharu Ueda3, Hiroyuki Miyamoto5, and Shiro Kato3\n\n1School of Human Science and Environment, University of Hyogo, Himeji, Hyogo 670–0092, Japan, 2Asahikawa Medical Col-\nlege, Asahikawa, Hokkaido 078–8510, Japan, 3Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka\n565–0871, Japan, 4Sakai City Institute of Public Health, Sakai, Osaka 590–0953, Japan, and 5Osaka Prefecture Saiseikai-Sen-\nnan Medical Welfare Center, Sennan, Osaka 590–0535, Japan\n\nReceived June 29, 2004; in revised form, December 7, 2004.

To establish the possible diagnosis for\nsmallpox infection, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against VV and CPV were produced. The cross-reac-\ntivity of seven MAbs with cells infected with various strains of the orthopoxviruses (CPV, VV and EV) was\nconfirmed by an immunofluorescence (IF) test and other immunological analyses. Four and three MAbs\nreacted with the common antigen of all poxviruses (probably NP antigen) and the antigen involved in neu-\ntralization, respectively. We developed the IF test using these MAbs. The direct IF test required only 45\nmin to perform. Smallpox infection is now eradicated, but it is important to prepare for the diagnosis of\nsmallpox in an emergency. The direct IF assay using MAbs cross-reactive with orthopoxviruses is rapid,\nsimple, specific, applicable for multiple samples, and will make it possible to screen for and detect\northopoxviruses that include variola virus with tissue impression smears from skin lesions in most labora-\ntories or institutes.\n\nKey words: Monoclonal antibody, Smallpox, Rapid diagnosis, Cross-reactivity\n\n219\n\nMicrobiol.

Several major\nantigens have been shown to be induced in cells infected\nwith CPV and VV, i.e., the nucleoprotein (NP) antigen\n(24, 29), neutralization (NT)-associated antigen (21)\nand A-type inclusions (ATI) (7–9).  We have identified\nthe polypeptides of the major antigens by immunopre-\ncipitation (IP) with polyclonal antibodies (5, 6) and\nidentified those antigens by IP and immunoblotting\n(western blotting, WB) with a monoclonal antibody\n(MAb) (11–13).  The NP is a so-called common antigen\nthat shows cross-reactivity with cells infected with\neither an Orthopoxvirus such as CPV, EV and VV, or a\nLeporipoxvirus such as the Shope fibroma virus (SFV).\nThe NT antigen shows cross-reactivity with cells infect-\ned with the Orthopoxvirus such as CPV, EV and VV.\nOn the other hand, the ATI are seen in cells infected\nonly with an Orthopoxvirus such as CPV or EV.\n\nIn this study, we newly produced MAbs cross-reacted\nwith the orthopoxviruses, and examined the develop-\nment of simple, rapid, and reliable diagnostic screening\nfor the multiple tissue impression smears infected with\northopoxviruses that include the smallpox virus.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nViruses and cells.  RK13 cells derived from rabbit\nkidney cells, HeLa cells derived from a human carcino-\nma and L cells derived from mouse fibroblasts were\ngrown in minimum essential medium supplemented\nwith 5% calf serum (MEM-CS).  The strains of CPV\nwere the LB red, Amsterdam, 53, 58 and 60 strains, the\nEV strains were Ishibashi and Hampstead, the VV\nstrains were Ikeda, Lister, IHD-W and IHD-J, and the\nSFV strain was OA (5, 6, 11–13).  The RK13 or HeLa\ncells were infected with CPV, VV or SFV, and the\nHeLa or L cells were infected with EV.  Tissue samples\ninfected with Molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV)\nwere kindly provided by Dr.  Kenji Hiroi (Hiroi Derma-\ntologic Hospital, Osaka, Japan).\n\nProduction of hybridoma.  The methods for the pro-\nduction and culture of the hybridomas and the screening\nprocedures for the antibodies have been previously\ndescribed (11).  Hybridomas were obtained from the\ncultures of PAI myeloma cells fused with spleen cells\nfrom BALB/c mice immunized with cells infected with\nthe LB red strain of CPV, or Ikeda strain or Lister strain\nof VV.  The obtained ascites fluids as previously\ndescribed (12) were used as MAbs.  The subclasses of\nthese antibodies were determined by immunodiffusion\n\nwith a hybridoma cell lysate and class-specific\nimmunoglobulin antisera as described by Volk et al.\n(27).\n\nImmunofluorescence (IF) test. The direct and indirect\n(IF) test was carried out with cells infected with each\nvirus at 2 to10 PFU (plaque-forming unit)/ml cultured\nfor 24 hr after infection and fixed with cold acetone.\nFor the membrane IF (MIF) test, cells infected and cul-\ntured were used without fixation.  The FITC (fluorescein\nisothiocyanate isomer I, Becton Dicknson & Co.,\nU.S.A.)-conjugation with antibody can be performed\nusing the methods of Kawamura et al.  (10). Briefly, the\nantibody (ascites) was concentrated with a saturated\nsolution of ammonium sulfate and dialyzed with 0.85%\nNaCl buffer (pH 7.0).  The FITC was dissolved with\n500 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5), added to\nproduce a ratio of 10–40 µg/mg of antibody solution,\nand immediately mixed.  The mixture was incubated\nand rotated at room temperature for 2 hr.  The unreacted\nFITC or MAb was removed by gel filtration of\nSephadex G-25 (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Sweden)\ncolumn chromatography, and then DEAE (diethyl-\naminoethyl)-cellulose ion exchange chromatography\n(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto).  The F/P (1:2) ratio was\ndetermined by measuring the absorbance at 280 and\n495 nm.  This FITC-labeled MAb was used for direct IF\ntest.\n\nSerological analyses.  For the NT test, about 200\nPFU/ml of virus was incubated for 60 min at 37 C with\nfourfold serial dilutions of MAbs in MEM-CS.  The\nvirus-antibody sample was adsorbed to RK13 or HeLa\ncells for 60 min at 37 C. After 48 to 64 hr of incubation\nat 37 C, plaques were visualized by staining with\n0.13% crystal violet in 2% ethanol.  The titer of the\nantibodies was determined as the reciprocal of the high-\nest fourfold dilution neutralizing 50% of the PFU.  The\nIP assay has been described in detail elsewhere (11).\nThe WB techniques with MAbs by the method of Tow-\nbin et al. (26) with slight modifications have been\ndescribed in detail elsewhere (11).\n\nResults\n\nEstablishment and Characterization of MAbs\nSeven MAbs were obtained from mice immunized\n\nwith the CPV (LB red strain)- or the VV (Ikeda or Lis-\nter strain)-infected cells.  The specificities and the cross-\nreactivities of these antibodies with cells infected with\nvarious strains of CPV, VV, EV and SFV were exam-\nined by IF, IP, WB and several biological and serologi-\ncal analyses.  The antibodies reacting with the known\nmajor antigens, i.e., the common antigen of all\npoxviruses, probably involved the NP and NT antigen.\n\n220 N. KITAMOTO ET AL\n\n\n\nSeven MAbs were characterized and classified into\nthree groups according to their IF, IP and WB analyses.\nResults of the reactivities of the seven MAbs directed\nagainst common antigens are summarized in Table 1\nand are described below in detail.\n\nThree MAbs (C1321, C8911 and V1141) in the\ngroup A reacted with the CPV strains (LB red, Amster-\ndam, 53, 58 and 60), EV strains (Ishibashi and Hamp-\nstead) and VV strains (Ikeda, Lister, IHD-W and IHD-\nJ).  MAbs C1321 and C8911 clones were derived from\nmice immunized with the LB red strain of CPV, and the\nMAb V1141 clone was obtained from mice immunized\nwith the Ikeda strain of VV.  MAbs C1321 and C8911\nwere isotype IgG1, and MAb V1141 was isotype IgG3.\nAll of these MAbs reacted with the strains of CPV, EV\nand VV by the IF test (Table 1), and with granular pat-\nterns at the cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1a).  These\nMAbs reacted with the strains of CPV, EV and VV by\nIP and WB (Table 1), and with a polypeptide band of\nmolecular weight 65,000 (65 K) in the infected cells\n(Fig. 2).  These MAbs also reacted with the SFV of the\ngenus Leporipoxviridae (OA strain) in the IF test.\nThese antibodies gave negative reactions in the NT and\nMIF tests, and with MCV-, measles virus (Edmonston\nstrain)-, herpes simplex virus (type 1)- and mock-infect-\ned cells.\n\nOn the other hand, the C4413 clone (group B) reacted\nwith a 40 K polypeptide on IP and with two polypep-\n\ntides of 65 K and 40 K on WB (Fig. 2), and gave a pin\nspot-like cytoplasmic fluorescent staining pattern (Fig.\n1b).  The cross-reactivity of C4413 with each virus and\nwith the 65 K polypeptide was the same as those of\ngroup A. However, the IF staining and polypeptide pat-\nterns of MAb C4413 appeared to be different from\nthese of the clones in group A.\n\nThe C3716, V1771 and VL101 MAbs had neutraliz-\ning activity and each NT titer was 1,024 to 4,096 (Table\n1).  The C3716 clone was established from mice immu-\nnized with the LB red strain of CPV, and the V1141\nand V1771 clones were established from mice immu-\nnized with the Ikeda strain and Lister strain of VV,\nrespectively.  These MAbs reacted with 28 K polypep-\ntides on IP and on WB (Fig. 2).  These antibodies gave\npositive reactions with cells infected with CPV, EV or\nVV, but not with SFV in the IF and WB.  The reaction\nwas positive in the MIF test.  These antibodies gave\nnegative reactions with MCV-, measles virus-, herpes\nsimplex virus (type 1)- and mock-infected cells.  The IF\nstaining by these antibodies was surface and cytoplas-\nmic diffuse (Fig. 1c).\n\nPossibility of Rapid Diagnosis Using MAbs\nThe direct IF test using the FITC-labeled MAbs\n\nshortens the time needed for the procedures.  Two types\nof MAbs, V1141 (anti-NP) and VL101 (anti-NT) were\nchosen for development of the serological detection\n\n221ORTHOPOXVIRUS DIAGNOSIS USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES\n\nTable 1.

The smear of infected\ncells was fixed with cold acetone for 5 min.  The FITC-\nlabeled MAb was dropped on the smear and incubated\nfor 30 min at 37 C. The smear was then washed with\nPBS (phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.0) and mounted\nwith glycerin for fluorescence microscopic examina-\ntion.  This procedure takes only 45 min.  The FITC-\nlabeled V1141 showed granular patterns at the cyto-\nplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1e), and cross-reacted\nwith cells infected with CPV, VV, EV and SFV.  The\nlabeled VL101 showed a surface diffuse pattern at the\ncytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 1f), and cross-reacted\nwith cells infected with CPV, VV and EV.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThree MAbs (C1321, C8911 and V1141) in group A\n\nrecognized a common antigen in all the poxviruses\n(probably NP antigen, although this has not been\nabsolutely established), since they both reacted with the\n65 K polypeptide (6, 11) and cross-reacted with all the\npoxvirus-infected cells (29).  We also found that the 65\nK polypeptide was detected by the WB of CPV virions\npurified from infected cells (data not shown).  Wilton et\nal. (28) reported several MAbs against VV which recog-\nnized the core complex components and reacted with\ncytoplasmic inclusions (called B-type inclusions) widely\nranging in size.  The possibility is that the NP proteins\nare highly immunogenic antigens.  The NP antigen is\nassociated with the B-type inclusions, and not with ATI\n(9).  On the other hand, the C4413 clone (group B)\nreacted with a 40 K polypeptide on IP and with two\npolypeptides of 65 K and 40 K on WB.  This was\nexamined by peptide mapping experiments involving\n\n222 N. KITAMOTO ET AL\n\nFig. 1. Characteristic appearance of indirect (a–d) and direct (e, f) immunofluorescence (IF) test after staining of CPV\n(cowpox virus)-infected RK13 cells with each monoclonal antibody (MAb). The cells infected with CPV (LB red\nstrain) were smeared and fixed with cold acetone for 5 min. For indirect IF test (a–d), MAb was added as the first\nantibody and incubated for 1 hr at 37 C. After washing with PBS, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel\nLab., Westchester, Penn., U.S.A.) as the second antibody was reacted for 30 min at 37 C. For the direct IF test (e, f),\nFITC-conjugated MAb was dropped and incubated for 30 min at 37 C. MAbs: (a) C1321, granular fluorescence of\ncytoplasm; (b) C4413, pin spot-like staining in the cytoplasm; (c) C3716, cell surface and diffuse cytoplasmic stain-\ning; (d) ATI, staining of cytoplasmic A-type inclusions as a control; (e) FITC-labeled V1141, granular fluorescence of\ncytoplasm; (f) FITC-labeled VL101, cell surface and diffuse cytoplasmic staining.\n\n\n\nthe partial proteolysis of these 65 K polypeptides by V8\nprotease digestion (1).  The peptide pattern of the 65 K\npolypeptide reacting with C4413 was different from\nthat recognized by clones of group A. The cross-reactiv-\nity of C4413 with each virus and with the 65 K\npolypeptide was the same as those of group A. Howev-\ner, the IF staining and polypeptide patterns of MAb\nC4413 appeared to be different from these of the clones\nin group A.\n\nThe C3716, V1771 and VL101 MAbs had neutraliz-\ning activity.  These MAbs recognizing an envelope pro-\ntein of VV have been reported to show neutralizing\nactivity and to react with the 14 K polypeptide (27) or\nthe 28–29 K polypeptide (14, 20).  The C3716 clone\nwas established from mice immunized with the LB red\nstrain of CPV, and the V1141 and V1771 clones were\nestablished from mice immunized with the Ikeda strain\nand Lister strain of VV, respectively.  These antibodies\ncross-reacted with cells infected with each strain of\nCPV and VV.  Therefore, the 28 K polypeptide associ-\nated with neutralization shows a high degree of protein\nconservation in the Orthopoxvirus genus.\n\nThe final aim of this study was to establish a diagno-\nsis of the smallpox infection.  The IF test using MAbs\nwas examined for the detection of the orthopoxviruses.\nAlthough the methods using PCR and EM were already\n\navailable for detecting poxvirus, the IF test using MAbs\nmight be no less specific than PCR and EM.  Also, the\nIF test is simpler, manageable at a lower cost and\napplicable for more samples than the PCR and EM\ndiagnoses.  In the indirect IF test, MAbs will be used as\nthe primary antibodies for the detection of the poxvirus\nantigen in fresh tissue impression smears.  This assay\nrequired only 2–3 hr to detect the viral antigen.  The\nELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay),\nimmunochromatography and microarray assays using\nMAbs might also be rapid and capable ways of detect-\ning the virus in tissue samples.  In preliminary study,\nELISA using our MAbs will make it possible to detect\nthe orthopoxviruses.  However, a treated or solubilized\nantigen sample has to be prepared.  In contrast, in the IF\ntest, only fresh tissue impression smears from skin\nlesions will serve this purpose.  In our preliminary\nstudy, we determine that the direct IF test will prove to\nbe sensitive and reliable against infected tissues of labo-\nratory animal.  BALB/c mice were infected intramuscu-\nlarly or intracutaneously with Lister strains of VV.\nThree or 4 days later, tissue impression smear samples\nwere obtained from vesicular or pustular lesions and\nexamined with the direct IF test.  The MAbs NT1 and\nNP1 showed clear positive reactions as well as tissue\nculture infected cells.  It is important to prepare for the\n\n223ORTHOPOXVIRUS DIAGNOSIS USING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES\n\nFig. 2. Western blot (WB) of polypeptides from CPV (cowpox virus)- and VV (vaccinia virus)-infected RK13 cells\nreacting with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The results shown are for MAbs, C1321, V1141, C4413, C3716,\nV1771, VL101 and ATI (as a control), and for antigen, LB red strain of CPV (C) and Lister strain of VV (V). Pro-\nteins in the cells were boiled for 2 min, lysed with sample buffer (about 10 to 20 µg/well) and SDS-PAGE was con-\nducted in 10% polyacrylamide gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose sheets which were incu-\nbated overnight at room temperature with the indicated MAbs (at 1:1,000 dilution of ascites), and then incubated with\nhorseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cappel Lab.) for 1 hr at 37 C and treated with sub-\nstrate (4-chloro-1-naphthol). Calibration kits were used for the molecular weight determination (M); numbers on the\nleft side indicate the apparent molecular weight (�1,000). Each MAb reacted with all strains of the genus\nOrthopoxvirus, with the major polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 65 K, 40 K or 28 K.\n\n\n\nrapid diagnosis of smallpox in an emergency.  The\ndirect IF test requires only 45 min to perform and multi-\nple samples can be tested at one time.\n\nRelationships between poxviruses were evaluated by\ncomparing the genome size, number of unique genes,\ngene arrangement and phylogenetic analyses of protein\nsequences (3).  Genus Avipoxvirus is the most diver-\ngent.  The next most divergent is Molluscipoxvirus,\nwhose sole member, MCV, infects only man.  Within\nthe genus Orthopoxvirus, monkeypox virus, EV, CPV\nand VV are closely related to variola virus and are dis-\ntinct from SFV of the genus Leporipoxvirus. Immuno-\nfluorescence staining technique using polyclonal anti-\nbodies has been examined (15, 25).  The results indicat-\ned high sensitivity for the IF test in diagnosing variola\nmajor, but also showed a high rate of false-positive\nresults (25).  Our previous study, hyper immune mouse\nsera to VV showed faint positive reactions with MCV,\nwhich has low homology to orthopoxviruses.  Our\nMAbs did not react in the least with MCV.  These\nresults suggest that MAbs are more specific for\northopoxviruses.\n\nIt has been reported that MAbs reactive against each\nof the five outer layer proteins neutralized infectivity\n(20).  Several neutralization epitopes were also mapped\nto within the short consensus repeat domain (18).  Fur-\nther studies are necessary to define the molecular loca-\ntion of these epitopes recognized with our MAbs, and to\nexamine the reaction to synthetic peptides homologous\nto variola virus.  Although we actually cannot attempt to\ndevelop human samples, it is also necessary to demon-\nstrate that these MAbs react with infected cells with\nmonkeypox virus belonging to the same genus.  It is\nimportant to take measures to deal with the situation\nand to prepare for the diagnosis of smallpox in an emer-\ngency.  The direct IF test using MAbs is a rapid, simple\nand useful routine screening for multiple samples of tis-\nsue impression smears from skin lesions in most labora-\ntories or institutes.  These are the major advantages of\nthe assay developed in this study.  Virus isolation, PCR\nor EM examination could be used as a definite diagnosis\nfor smallpox infection.\n\nWe thank Eriko Goto, Kenzi Hiroi and Satoru Tanimoto,\nmembers of the Department of Microbiology, Wakayama Med-\nical College, for their help with this work.\n\nReferences\n\n1) Cleveland, D.W., Fischer, S.G., Kirschener, M.W., and\nLaemmli, U.K. 1977.
