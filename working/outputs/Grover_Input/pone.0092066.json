Glucotoxicity mediated by chronic hyperglycaemia is detrimental to the function and survival of\npancreatic beta cells. The aim of our study was to determine whether proteasome dysfunction could be involved in beta cell\napoptosis in glucotoxic conditions, and to evaluate whether such a dysfunction might be pharmacologically corrected.\nTherefore, UPS activity was measured in GK rats islets, INS-1E beta cells or human islets after high glucose and/or UPS\ninhibitor exposure. Immunoblotting was used to quantify polyubiquitinated proteins, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\nthrough CHOP expression, and apoptosis through the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3, whereas total cell death was\ndetected through histone-associated DNA fragments measurement. In vitro, we found that chronic exposure of INS-1E cells\nto high glucose concentrations significantly decreases the three proteasome activities by 20% and leads to caspase-3-\ndependent apoptosis. We showed that pharmacological blockade of UPS activity by 20% leads to apoptosis in a same way.\nIndeed, ER stress was involved in both conditions. These results were confirmed in human islets, and proteasome activities\nwere also decreased in hyperglycemic GK rats islets. Moreover, we observed that a high glucose treatment hypersensitized\nbeta cells to the apoptotic effect of proteasome inhibitors. Noteworthily, the decreased proteasome activity can be\ncorrected with Exendin-4, which also protected against glucotoxicity-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings reveal\nan important role of proteasome activity in high glucose-induced beta cell apoptosis, potentially linking ER stress and\nglucotoxicity. These proteasome dysfunctions can be reversed by a GLP-1 analog. Thus, UPS may be a potent target to treat\ndeleterious metabolic conditions leading to type 2 diabetes.\n\nCitation: Broca C, Varin E, Armanet M, Tourrel-Cuzin C, Bosco D, et al.

Although glucose is the main regulator of beta cell functional\n\nmass, it can be deleterious when present in excessive amounts\n\nduring prolonged exposure [2]. Such a glucotoxicity is responsible\n\nfor apoptosis of beta cells [3], mainly through inducing an\n\noxidative stress, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and an\n\ninflammatory reaction. Understanding the exact mechanisms that\n\nlink glucotoxicity to beta cell apoptosis is crucial for the\n\npreservation of a functional pancreatic beta cell mass.\n\nThe ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) is one of the major\n\ndegradation pathways for maintaining protein homeostasis. It\n\ndegrades misfolded, oxidized or damaged proteins, but also\n\nregulates proteins involved in many cellular processes, such as\n\nsignal transduction, cell cycle regulation, cell death, and gene\n\ntranscription [4,5]. Proteins to be degraded in the UPS are first\n\ntagged with a polyubiquitin chain, then enter the 26S proteasome,\n\na multicatalytic complex that associates a regulatory complex (19S\n\nproteasome) with a catalytic core (20S proteasome). The 20S\n\nproteasome is a cylindrical structure made of two outer rings of a-\nsubunits and two inner heptameric rings of b-subunits that carry\nthe proteolytic activities, classified as caspase-like (b1), trypsin-like\n(b2), and chymotrypsin-like (b5), which cleave after acidic, basic\nand hydrophobic amino acids, respectively [6].\n\nThe precise role of UPS in the beta cell remains elusive. UPS\n\nregulates key proteins of the beta cell secretory cascade such as\n\nKATP channels [7], voltage-dependent calcium channels [8], or\n\nproinsulin [9], thus playing a major but complex role in the\n\nregulation of insulin secretion [10,11,12,13]. The role of UPS in\n\nthe control of apoptosis/survival balance is also controversial [14].\n\nIndeed, UPS regulates key proteins for beta cell survival such as\n\nIRS-2, MafA, or CREB [15], but also major regulators of\n\napoptosis such as caspases (review in [16]). High doses of\n\nproteasome inhibitors (PIs), that totally block UPS activities,\n\ninduce severe apoptosis in beta cell lines [13,17] but only limited\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\n\ndecrease in viability in human islets [17], have no impact on rat\n\nislet viability [13], or can improve rat islets viability in the presence\n\nof cytokines [13].\n\nA link between an alteration of the UPS and the progression of\n\ndiabetes has never been demonstrated. Indeed, proteasome\n\ndysfunction correlates with obesity in humans [10,18,19], and\n\nkidneys from diabetic Akita rats or streptozotocin-injected mice\n\nshow a decrease in chymotrypsin-like activity and an increase in\n\npolyubiquinated proteins [20], but this is not seen in others tissus.\n\nPancreatic islets from Zucker diabetic rats [21] or human diabetic\n\nobese donors [22] also exhibit an increased level of polyubiqui-\n\ntinated proteins, suggesting a default in the elimination of\n\ndamaged/misfolded proteins, but the implication of a proteasome\n\nactivity default is lacking. A recent study shows a decreased in islets\n\nproteasome activity of type 2 diabetic patients [23] together with a\n\ndecrease of UPS proteins transcription and expression. However,\n\nwhether hyperglycemic environment is deleterious for beta cells\n\nthrough an alteration of the proteasome is still unknown.\n\nIn this aim, we studied the importance of proteasome\n\ndysfunction as a potential molecular mechanism associated with\n\nbeta cell failure in glucotoxic conditions, in the INS-1E beta cell\n\nline and in primary rat and human islets. We chose to explore the\n\nrole of ER-stress in this process. Finally, we investigated if this\n\ndecreased proteasome activity can be pharmacologically corrected\n\nthrough the use of GLP-1 analogs. Our results clearly show that\n\nproteasome activity is a key determinant of the survival/apoptosis\n\nbalance in beta cells, that could be part of the glucotoxicity\n\nmechanisms involved in diabetes pathophysiology.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics statement\nMale diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats and Wistar control rats\n\nwere obtained from the Paris colony (GK/Par), and maintained at\n\nthe University Paris-Diderot animal core (Agreement A-75-13-17).\n\nThe experimental protocol was approved by the institutional\n\nAnimal Care and Use Ethical Committee of the Paris-Diderot\n\nUniversity (registration number CEEA-40), in accordance with\n\naccepted standards of animal care as established in the French\n\nNational Center for Scientific Research (CNRS) guidelines.\n\nHuman pancreas were harvested from brain-dead non-diabetic\n\ndonors, identified from the CRISTAL register of the Agence de la\n\nBiomedecine, which inventories all graft recipients in France.\n\nInformed consent from the donor family and agreement for\n\nscientific research was obtained through the Departement de la\n\nCoordination Hospitalière de Prélèvements d’Organes of Mon-\n\ntpellier Hospital. Experiments were performed in agreement with\n\nthe Institutional Ethical Committee of the French Agence de la\n\nBiomedecine (ref. PFS13-008).\n\nCell culture\nINS-1E beta cells were originally cloned and characterized [24]\n\nby Pr. P. Maechler from the parental rat INS-1 cell line in the\n\nLaboratory of Pr. C.B. Wollheim (CMU, University of Geneva,\n\nSwitzerland). INS-1E cells (a kind gift from Pr. P. Maechler) were\n\ncultured between passages 55-90 in RPMI-1640 medium contain-\n\ning 10 mM glucose and 5% FCS (InVitrogen, St-Aubin,\n\nFrance)[24]. Cells were grown for four days in RPMI-1640 to\n\nreach 75% confluency, then incubated for 48 hours in RPMI-\n\n1640 medium with glucose ranging from 10 to 33 mM, in the\n\npresence of BSA 0.5% instead of FCS in order to sensitize cells to\n\nglucotoxicity [25]. Proteasome inhibitors MG-132, ALLN,\n\nlactacystin (Calbiochem, VWR, France) or Bortezomib (VelcadeH\nJanssen, France) were added during the last 16 hours. Exendin-4\n\nwas from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland). Following treatments,\n\ncells were washed in PBS and harvested in lysis buffer (see\n\ncomposition in [26]) for Western-blot analysis, or in proteasome\n\nlysis solution (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EDTA, 20%\n\nglycerol, 0.05% Nonidet-P40, 1 mM mercapto-ethanol, and\n\n1 mM ATP) for proteasome activities measurement.\n\nAnimals\nTwelve-week-old male non-diabetic Wistar and diabetic Goto-\n\nKakizaki (GK) rats were maintained at constant temperature (21–\n\n23uC) with a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle. Food and water were\navailable ad libitum. Rat pancreatic islets were isolated as previously\n\ndescribed [27] and groups of 300–500 islets were stored at 280uC\nuntil studied. Islets were harvested in similar lysis buffer than INS-\n\n1E for Western-blot analysis or proteasome activities measure-\n\nment.\n\nHuman pancreatic islets processing\nHuman islets were isolated from four brain-dead non-diabetic\n\ndonors at the Laboratory for Diabetes Cell Therapy (Montpellier,\n\nFrance) or the Cell Isolation and Transplantation Center (Geneva,\n\nSwitzerland) according to a modified version of the automated\n\nmethod [28,29]. After isolation, islets were cultured for recovery\n\nduring 1–5 days in CMRL-1066 medium (InVitrogen) containing\n\n5.6 mM glucose, 10% FBS, antibiotics and glutamine [15]. For\n\nexperiments with proteasome inhibitors, islets were then cultured\n\nduring 16 h in RPMI-1640 medium containing 5.6 mM glucose\n\nand 1% human albumin (LFD Biomedicaments, Les-Ulis, France),\n\nand treated like rat islets. For chronic high-glucose experiments,\n\nislets were cultured for 14 days in RPMI-1640 medium containing\n\n5.6 or 33.3 mM glucose, in the absence of FCS but the presence of\n\n0.4 mM palmitate bound to BSA (0.5% BSA, molar ratio\n\npalmitate/BSA = 5:1) in order to sensitize islets to glucotoxicity\n\n[30].\n\nWestern-blot analysis\nFollowing treatments, INS-1E cells, rat or human islets were\n\nlysed for 30 min at 4uC in a cold lysis buffer as described above,\nthen rapidly sonicated and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min.\n\nSupernatants were denatured by boiling them in Laemmli’s\n\nsample buffer, normalized for protein content by a BCA assay, and\n\nequal amounts of proteins (25 mg of protein/lane) resolved by 10%\nSDS-PAGE. After immunoblotting on nitrocellulose membranes,\n\nmembranes were cut up into 3 or 4 pieces according to the\n\nmolecular weights profile, in order to observe simultaneously\n\ndifferent proteins on the same blot. Each piece was incubated with\n\nprimary then secondary antibodies, and proteins were visualized\n\nby chemiluminescence detection, as previously described [15].\n\nBand densities were quantitatively analyzed by Image J (NIH,\n\nUSA) and normalized to actin, used as our loading control. Anti-\n\ncleaved caspase-3, anti-PARP (Poly-ADP-ribose-polymerase), anti-\n\nubiquitin, anti-CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein), and anti-\n\nrabbit IgG antibodies were from Cell-Signaling (Ozyme, St-\n\nQuentin-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-proteasome 20S-b5 subunit\nand anti-mouse IgG antibodies were from Santa-Cruz (Tebu-bio,\n\nLe-Perray-en-Yvelines, France). Anti-b-actin was from Sigma-\nAldrich (St-Quentin-Fallavier, France).\n\nProteasome activities measurement\nFollowing treatments, INS-1E cells and islets were lysed and\n\nprocessed for proteasome activity as described [31]. After rapid\n\nsonication, lysates were centrifuged (12,000 g) and supernatants\n\ncollected. After proteins level equalization, 5 mg supernatants were\n\nProteasome Dysfunction Mediates Glucotoxicity in Beta Cells\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 March 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 3 | e92066\n\n\n\ncombined with substrate buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 5 mM\n\nEGTA) and 50 mM of each proteasome substrate; Z-ARR-MCA,\nSuc-LLVY-MCA, and Z-LLE-MCA (Calbiochem) were used to\n\nmeasure trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like, and caspase-like activities,\n\nrespectively. The three proteasome activities were distinguished\n\nfrom background proteolytic activities by using a proteasome\n\ninhibitor that nearly totally inhibit fluorescence changes. The\n\nfluorescence intensity was measured at 380 nm excitation and\n\n460 nm emission with a Flexstation3 Reader (Molecular Devices,\n\nFrance) using free MCA as standard. Proteasomal activities were\n\nexpressed as arbitrary units.\n\nApoptosis and cell death detection\nApoptosis was investigated using immunoblot by evaluating\n\ncleavage of caspase-3 into a 17/19 kDa fragment corresponding to\n\nthe active pro-apoptotic form of caspase-3, and cleavage of PARP\n\n(a caspase-3 target involved in DNA repair and cell survival) into a\n\n89 kDa fragment. Total cell death was evaluated using the Cell\n\nDeath Detection ELISA\nPLUS\n\nkit (Roche), as per the manufactur-\n\ner’s instructions, using 20 ml of culture supernatant. Due to our\nprolonged treatments ($48 h), DNA fragments will be present in\n\nthe supernatant of cells culture as the result of the lysis of late\n\napoptotic cells as well as necrotic cells. Absorbance was measured\n\nat 405 nm using a Mithras LB940 Reader (Berthold, Thoiry,\n\nFigure 1. Chronic high glucose induces apoptosis and proteasome activities decrease in INS-1E cells.

In parallel, the polyubiquitinated proteins level is\n\nincreased by 26% in the presence of high glucose, whereas the\n\n20S-b5 proteasome subunit level is not significantly altered\n(Figures 1E and 1F). Finally, we confirm that endoplasmic\n\nreticulum (ER) stress, as evidenced by the two fold increase in\n\nCHOP expression (Figures 1E and 1F), is involved in the increased\n\napoptosis observed in beta cells submitted to high glucose.\n\nImpaired proteasome activities in hyperglycemic GK rat\nislets\n\nWe assess ex vivo the impact of a hyperglycemic environment on\n\nbeta cell proteasome function using the GK rat diabetic model\n\n[32,33]. Pancreatic islets from 5 GK rats exhibiting mild\n\nhyperglycemia (around 9.0 mM) are compared to islets from 9\n\nWistar control rats exhibiting normoglycemia (around 5.0 mM).\n\nGK rats islets show a slight increase in apoptosis, as revealed by\n\nPARP cleavage (Figures 2A and 2B). More importantly, GK rat\n\nislets display a 25% reduction in caspase-like activity (p,0.01), a\n\n40% reduction in trypsin-like activity (p,0.01), whereas chymo-\n\ntrypsin-like activity was not significantly decreased (210%,\n\np = 0.20) (Figure 2C). This suggests that the hyperglycemic\n\nenvironment could be linked to decreased proteasome activities\n\nin vivo.\n\nLoss of proteasome activity leads to apoptosis in INS-1E\ncells\n\nIn order to implicate a proteasome dysfunction in beta cell\n\napoptosis, we treated INS-1E cells with the widely used\n\nproteasome inhibitor (PI) MG-132. In cells cultured into optimal\n\nglucose concentration for survival (i.e. 10 mM), MG-132 (150 nM)\n\ninduces a 90, 80 and 50% inhibition of chymotrypsin-like, caspase-\n\nlike, and trypsin-like activities, respectively (Figure 3A). This is\n\naccompagnied by a significant increase (+150%) in polyubiquiti-\n\nFigure 2.

In\nparallel, MG-132 induces the emergence of a caspase-dependent\n\napoptosis as revealed by the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP\n\n(Figure 3C). The implication of ER stress in the apoptotic effect of\n\nMG-132 is confirmed by the emergence of CHOP expression\n\n(Figure 3C).\n\nThe pro-apoptotic effect of PIs is also found using the\n\nstructurally different inhibitors ALLN (Figure 3D) and lactacystin\n\n(data not shown). Moreover, increasing MG-132 concentration\n\nfrom 10 to 1000 nM gradually inhibits chymotrypsin-like activity\n\n(Figure 3E). This sigmoidal-shaped effect shows a low Ki at 50 nM\n\nand a near-total inhibition of UPS activity around 1 mM MG-132.\nThis gradual decrease in proteasome activity is concommittant\n\nwith an increase in cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 3F), definitely linking\n\nproteasome dysfunction and apoptosis. Finally, a 50 nM MG-132-\n\nexposure, leading to a minimal loss of proteasome activity about\n\n20%, is sufficient to induce apoptosis (Figure 3G). Interestingly,\n\nchymotrypsin-like activity and apoptotic level are similarly affected\n\nin INS-1E cells exposed either to low dose (50 nM) of MG-132 or\n\nFigure 3.

Thus, slight\n\nimpairment of UPS activity in beta cells induced similar apoptosis\n\nthan high-glucose exposure.\n\nChronic high-glucose induces apoptosis and proteasome\ndysfunction in human islets\n\nIn human islets, a 14 days-chronic high glucose (33 mM)\n\nexposure clearly induces a three-fold increase in total cell death\n\n(Figure 4A) and an increase in apoptosis as seen by caspase-3 and\n\nPARP cleavage (Figure 4B). More importantly, all the three\n\nproteasome activities were significantly reduced by 40–50% in\n\nhigh glucose-exposed islets (Figure 4C). Finally, polyubiquitinated\n\nproteins and CHOP expressions increase in these glucotoxic\n\nconditions (Figure 4B), thus confirming the presence of an ER\n\nstress linked to UPS dysfunction in human islets.\n\nLoss of proteasome activity leads to apoptosis in human\nislets\n\nIn human islets, MG-132 (0.05–1 mM) induces a progressive\ndecrease in chymotrypsin-like and caspase-like activities, without\n\nsignificantly affecting trypsin-like activity (Figure 5A). In parallel,\n\nMG-132 dose-dependently increases the expression of polyubiqui-\n\ntinated proteins, CHOP, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP\n\n(Figure 5B and 5C). These effects are also found with 5 mM\nlactacystin or 100 nM bortezomib (data not shown). Thus PIs, by\n\nreducing proteasome activities, clearly induce polyubiquitinated\n\nproteins accumulation and the emergence of a caspase-dependent\n\napoptotic program through the promotion of ER-stress in rodent\n\nbeta cells and human islets.\n\nChronic exposure of INS-1E cells to high-glucose induces\nhypersensitivity to proteasome inhibitors\n\nWe further investigated the role of combination of high-glucose\n\nexposure and proteasome inhibitors on beta cells. While 150 nM\n\nMG-132 induces a slight but significant apoptosis in INS-1E cells\n\ncultured in 10 mM glucose medium (Figure 6A), this same\n\nconcentration of MG-132 induces a drastic apoptosis in INS-1E\n\ncells cultured at high-glucose, as evidenced by the 8-fold increase\n\nof cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP (Figure 6B). However, the\n\npolyubiquitinated proteins level induced by MG-132 is similarly\n\nhigh in normal or high-glucose concentrations (Figure 6C) as if a\n\nceiling was reached. Similar results on apoptosis are obtained with\n\nALLN (Figure 6D and 6E) or lactacystin (data not shown). This\n\ndrastic increase of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors coupled to\n\nhigh glucose culture reveals hypersensitivity of beta cells to UPS\n\ninhibition in glucotoxic conditions.\n\nExendin-4 prevents proteasome activity dysfunction and\nprotects INS-1E cells from apoptosis\n\nWe finally investigated whether pharmacological agents that\n\nactivate PKA in beta cells, such as the GLP-1 analog Exendin-4,\n\ncould positively interact with proteasome activities. First, in INS-\n\n1E cells cultured into optimal 10 mM glucose medium, Exendin-4\n\ndoes not significantly modify the chymotrypsin-like activity\n\n(Figure 7A), nor the others proteasome activities (data not shown)\n\nor the cleaved caspase-3 expression (Figure 7B).\n\nThen, in INS-1E cells cultured in the presence of chronic high-\n\nglucose (33 mM), we observe, as expected, an increased caspase-\n\ndependent apoptotic program, decreased UPS activities, and\n\naccumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins (Figure 7C and 7D). In\n\nthese glucotoxic conditions, Exendin-4 (25 nM) clearly improves\n\ncell survival, with a significant reduction in the emergence of\n\ncleaved caspase-3 induced by high-glucose (236%, p,0.05)\n\n(Figure 7C). Of importance, Exendin-4 also prevents proteasome\n\ndysfunction induced by high-glucose as shown on chymotrypsine-\n\nlike activity (Figure 7D) and other proteasome activities (data not\n\nshown). Noteworthily, Exendin-4 tends to decrease (p = 0.13 vs.\n\nG33 alone) the polyubiquitinated levels observed in the presence of\n\nchronic G33 (Figure 7C). Finally, this protective effect of Exendin-\n\n4 is dose-dependent on both proteasome activity and cell survival,\n\nreaching an optimum at 25 nM (Figure 7E).\n\nFigure 4. A chronic high glucose treatment decreases protea-\nsome activities and increases apoptosis in human islets. Human\nislets were cultured for 14 days in RPMI medium containing an optimal\n(5.6 mM, G5) or a high (33 mM, G33) glucose concentration.

We report here\n\nthat a chronic exposure of rat beta cells or human islets to high-\n\nglucose concentrations leads to a decrease in the proteasome\n\nactivity and to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins.\n\nThis inhibition of UPS activity leads to beta cell apoptosis in a\n\ndose-dependent manner. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of\n\nUPS in the context of glucotoxicity drastically increases these\n\napoptotic effects, drawing the concept of hypersensitization of beta\n\ncells to proteasome inhibitors (PIs). UPS activity -in this context of\n\nglucotoxicity- can be partially restored by Exendin-4.\n\nFirst, we demonstrate that glucotoxic conditions can alter\n\nproteasome activities. This major finding must be connected to a\n\nprevious study [20] showing that proteasome activities were\n\ndecreased in endothelial cells cultured in high-glucose medium,\n\nand in kidney cells from diabetic mice but not in other tissues. We\n\nshow here that this cell type-specific phenomenon can also affect\n\nbeta cell population. Accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins\n\nhas been previously observed in several models of diabetic beta\n\ncells [21,22], suggesting indirectly an UPS alteration in hypergly-\n\ncemic environment. However, authors attributed this accumula-\n\ntion either 1) to a default in the autophagy system [21], or 2) to a\n\ndeficiency in the deubiquitinating enzyme UCH-L1 [22]. Our\n\nresults clearly indicate that a decrease in proteasome activity is also\n\nimplicated in the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins\n\nobserved in beta cells submitted to a glucotoxic environment.\n\nWhen studying proteasome function in beta cells, special\n\nattention should be paid to the specific proteasome activity\n\nobserved. Here we observed that the inhibitory effect of MG-132\n\non trypsin-like activity is less important in INS-1E cells and totally\n\nabsent in human islets compared to the chymotrypsin-like and\n\ncaspase-like activities. Indeed proteasomes are very heterogeneous\n\nprotein complexes: differences exists in the molecular assembly of\n\nthe catalytic active b subunits, as well as differences in their\nposttranslational modifications and in the presence of distinct\n\nassociating partners [34]. Thus, each cell contains a specific set of\n\nproteasome subtypes, exhibiting specific proteasomal activities that\n\nstrongly vary between tissues and age in the same animal, and\n\nexpress different susceptibilities to proteasome inhibitors such as\n\nMG-132 [35]. In this context, it was very recently noticed that\n\ntrypsin-like activity shows the greatest interspecies difference [36].\n\nFinally, in both INS-1E and human islets, the decrease of two of\n\nthe three proteasome activities in the presence of MG-132 is\n\nenough to induce a global decrease of proteasome activity as\n\nobserved with the increase in polyubiquitinated protens level.\n\nThe other main point of this study is that the inhibition of\n\nproteasome activity can have per se a deleterious impact on beta\n\ncell survival. Noteworthily, this pro-apoptotic effect of PIs exists\n\neven for a slight 220%- reduction of proteasome activity, the same\n\npercentage of inhibition induced by high-glucose culture or 50 nM\n\nMG-132. Our results are in accordance with previous studies\n\nFigure 5. Pharmacologic inhibition of proteasome activity in human islets increases apoptosis. Human islets were treated for 16 hours\nwith the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 at increasing concentrations from 50 nM to 1 mM.

For entire islets, the literature data were\n\ncontroversial, as a decrease in viability was observed in human\n\nislets cultured with epoxomycin [17], whereas lactacystin had no\n\nimpact on beta cell viability of young rats [13]. We confirm here\n\nthat immortalized cell lines are more sensitive to the pro-apoptotic\n\neffect of PIs than primary cells, even if the latter can still be\n\nimpacted by higher dose of PIs [37].\n\nWe show that inhibition of proteasome activity in beta cells\n\ncould be a new link between glucotoxicity and apoptosis. This\n\nphenomenon -via genetic predisposition or epigenetic regulation-\n\nmay thus exist in diabetic patients, participating in beta cell\n\ndysfunction. Indeed, Bugliani et al. [23] recently showed that UPS\n\ngenes and activity were particularly altered in beta cells of type 2\n\ndiabetic patients. Our study underlines the direct effect of high-\n\nglucose on UPS dysfunction, at a molecular level (probably at a\n\npost-traductional level) and not, as suggested in the latter study, at\n\na transcriptional level. This is compatible with the hypothesis of\n\nQueisser et al. [20] suggesting that glycation of the 20S-b5\nproteasome subunit by high-glucose treatment could affect its\n\nactivity. Further studies should be done to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nEndoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stresses are widely known\n\nto be the main mechanisms of glucotoxicity [38,39], even if\n\ncytokine production [40] or hypoxia also represent others putative\n\nstressors (review in [2]). Besides, the role of proteasome inhibition\n\nin glucotoxicity is poorly defined. Indeed, the relationships\n\nbetween ER and proteasome are complex since they can influence\n\neach other. In our study, UPS dysfunction directly participates in\n\ntriggering ER stress, CHOP expression, caspase cleavage and\n\napoptosis onset. This results confirms previous studies showing\n\nthat proteasome inhibition by MG-132 or bortezomib can induce\n\nER stress, thus activating caspases cleavage and apoptosis in\n\ncancerous or primary epithelial cells [41,42]. However, the\n\nopposite is also true since Menendez-Benito et al. [43] first\n\nobserved in a panel of UPS reporter cell lines as well as in an in vivo\n\ntransgenic mice model that ER stress could have an inhibitory\n\nFigure 6.

In brief, proteasome inhibition by MG-132 or\n\nhigh-glucose exposure could induce ER stress and apoptosis, but\n\nER stress alone could also induce a progressive proteasome\n\ninhibition in parallel to caspase-dependent apoptosis. Taken\n\ntogether, this suggests that the glucotoxic-induced proteasome\n\ndysfunction observed in our study could be placed both above and\n\nbelow ER stress in the cascade leading from chronic hyperglyce-\n\nmia to beta cell apoptosis and diabetes.\n\nUPS dysfunction and proteasome activity inhibition can\n\npromote neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington and\n\nAlzheimer diseases, both characterized by protein misfolding,\n\naggregates accumulation, and ER stress increase. Diabetes is often\n\ncompared to them because of islet amyloidosis, supposed to be due\n\nto the UPS dysfunction [22]. Here, our study clearly reinforces the\n\nparallel between diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases through\n\nthe demonstration of the role of UPS dysfunction and ER stress in\n\nbeta cells exposed to high glucose.\n\nDepending on situations and cell types, UPS may play more\n\nthan a simple role of garbage collector and can direct cell function\n\nand survival. In lymphocytes, glioma cells or hematopoietic\n\nprogenitor cells, UPS is placed at the top of the apoptotic\n\nmachinery, upstream of the mitochondrial and caspase activation\n\n[44,45]. Our results support a similar central role of UPS in the\n\nbeta cell apoptosis machinery. Indeed, in our study, glucotoxic\n\nconditions - mainly via ER and oxidative stresses- added to\n\ndecreased proteasome activity with PIs led to a drastic apoptosis.\n\nThis observation is compatible with the recent concept of\n\nsensitization already described on myeloma cells cultured with\n\nFigure 7.

The sensitivity of myeloma cells to\n\napoptosis induction by PIs varies greatly between cell types and\n\ncorrelates with expression levels of proteasome subunits and/or\n\nthe proteasome activity itself, as a result of a balance between\n\nproteasome workload and degradation capacity [46]. Similarly,\n\nhigh-glucose-treated beta cells display a decrease in proteasome\n\nactivities together with an increased workload in insulin synthesis\n\nand secretion. In glucotoxic conditions, it seems thus logical that\n\nUPS inhibition can lead to an over-workload, majored ER stress,\n\nand drastic apoptosis. That confirms that the maintenance of UPS\n\nintegrity is a key player in the misfolded protein clearance and in\n\nthe regulation of essential functions of beta cells. This beta cell\n\nhypersensitivity to PIs under glucotoxicity could have clinical\n\nimplications, suggesting hypersensitivity of diabetic patients to\n\nproteasome inhibitors like bortezomib used in myeloma. Indeed,\n\nPIs efficacy may be reinforced on cancerous cells, but their adverse\n\neffects -peripheral neuropathy or anemia- may be more numerous\n\nand severe in diabetic patients [47].\n\nFinally, the demonstration that the GLP-1-receptor agonist\n\nExendin-4 preserves proteasome activity from the deleterious\n\neffects of chronic high glucose reinforces the fact that the\n\npreservation of UPS activity is crucial for beta cell survival,\n\nespecially in glucotoxic conditions. Moreover, a parallel exists\n\nbetween Exendin-4 dose-responses on proteasome activity increase\n\nand caspase-3 cleavage reduction. This restoration of UPS activity\n\nby a GLP-1 analogue can be explained by the role of PKA in beta\n\ncells. Indeed, GLP-1 analogues act through PKA in beta cells and\n\nPKA has been shown to be a direct activator of proteasome\n\nactivity [48,49]. This opens the possibility to increase in vivo the\n\nactivity of GLP-1 analogues with activators of UPS.\n\nIn conclusion our work integrates UPS as a new key player in\n\nthe mechanism of glucotoxicity in beta cells. We report here that\n\nchronic high-glucose exposure decreases proteasome activities in\n\nbeta cells, leading to UPS dysfunction. Proteasome dysfunction\n\ncould be part of the glucotoxic mechanisms through inducing ER\n\nstress and apoptosis. Apoptotic hypersensitization of beta cells\n\nexists when pre-existing glucotoxicity and UPS inhibition are\n\nadded: this creates a vicious circle resulting in increased apoptosis\n\nof beta cells. GLP-1 analogues can help stopping this vicious circle.\n\nOur results suggest that proteasome function constitutes an\n\nimportant and underestimated target for restoring pancreatic beta\n\ncell survival and GLP-1 analogues efficacy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thanks M.
