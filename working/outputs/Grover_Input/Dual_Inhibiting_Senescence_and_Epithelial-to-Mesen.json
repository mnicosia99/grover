UUO or sham-operated mice were randomly assigned to receive\nrhEPO or vehicle treatment and were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14. Kidney specimens were fixed for histopathological and\nimmunohistochemical study. The expression of S100A4, TGF-ùõΩ1, BMP-7, Smad2/3, Smad1/5/8, and p16INK4a was determined by\nwestern blot and real-time RT-PCR. Vehicle treated UUOmice had increased tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis within 3 to 14\ndays. An increase in TGF-ùõΩ1, Smad2/3, S100A4, and p16INK4a expression and a decrease in BMP-7 and Smad1/5/8 expression were\nobserved in the obstructed kidneys. p16INK4a was positively correlated with TGF-ùõΩ1/Smad2/3 and negatively correlated with BMP-\n7/Smad1/5/8 in UUO mice. rhEPO treatment significantly suppressed the upregulation of TGF-ùõΩ, Smad2/3, S100A4, and p16INK4a\nand preserved the downregulation of BMP-7 and Smad1/5/8, resulting in markedly reduced TA/IF compared to the vehicle treated\nmice.The renoprotective effects of rhEPO could ameliorate renal TA/IF by modulating senescence and EMTwhich could be a part\nof therapeutic option in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nOne striking feature observed during chronic kidney disease\n(CKD) is tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis (TA/IF).\nDuring chronic kidney injury, tubular epithelial cells (TEC)\nattempt to survive by activating proliferation, differentiation,\nstress induced senescence, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal\ntransition (EMT) or apoptosis [1‚Äì3]. Proliferating cells can\nresponse by providing state of permanent cell cycle arrest\ntermed cellular senescence [4, 5]. TGF-ùõΩ is the potent cell\ncycle inhibitor, and Smad3 is a key mediator for TGF-ùõΩ\n\nmediating the antiproliferative responses by inhibiting cell\ncycle progression from G\n\n1\nto S phase [6]. The p16INK4a is\n\nthe major CDK inhibitors which prevent the passage through\nthe G\n\n1\nphase of the cell cycle by inhibiting CDK4 and\n\nCDK6 [7]. Furthermore, overexpression of Smad3 and TGF-\nùõΩ treatment induces p16INK4a protein and mRNA expression\nin keratinocytes which contributes to growth arrest [8, 9].\nCellular senescence is characterized by not only the inability\nof cells to proliferation existing by lost the ability to divide\nand failed to grow, but also the maintenance of the cell\nviability and metabolic activity develop of the resistance\n\n\n\n2 BioMed Research International\n\nto apoptosis and an altered pattern of gene expression by\nexpression of cell cycle inhibitor genes [5]. Stress can be\ninduced by extrinsic factors causing upregulation of cyclin\ndependent kinase inhibitor p16INK4a, resulting irreversible\ncell cycle arrest which could exhaust the repairing processes\nof TECs [10].\n\nEMT is another important process affecting the pop-\nulation of interstitial fibroblasts which lose their epithelial\nphenotype and show the progressive development of a mes-\nenchymal phenotype that leads to TEC damage and fibrosis\nin the kidney [11]. Many studies have demonstrated that\nTGF-ùõΩ promotes renal fibrosis through EMT by activation of\nSmad2/3 [12‚Äì14] and was counteracted with BMP-7 by moti-\nvation of Smad1/5/8 to maintain the epithelial phenotype of\nTECs [15, 16].The expression of the mesenchymal phenotype\nin TECs and fibroblasts using S100A4 as a marker has been\nobserved in many kidney diseases [17, 18]. Consequently, it is\nimportant to develop a potential therapeutic target to prevent\nor reverse the process of stress-induced senescence and EMT\nto slow down the progression of CKD.\n\nRecombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) has been\ndemonstrated to exert a renoprotective effect in addition to\na hematopoietic effect in acute and chronic kidney injury\n[19‚Äì21]. It plays an important role in antiapoptosis, anti-\ninflammation, and antioxidation in many models of kidney\ndiseases [19, 22]. Moreover, it has been reported that rhEPO\ntreatment could slow progression of kidney injury through\nexpansion of endothelial progenitor cells [23, 24]. Many clin-\nical studies demonstrate that the early treatment of anemia in\nCKD patients with rhEPO can slow the progressive decline of\nrenal function [25, 26].\n\nIn the present study, we investigated the advantage of\nrhEPO treatment in an unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO)\nmouse model. We hypothesized that rhEPO treatment could\nhave a renoprotective effect mediated through amelioration\nof stress-induced senescence and EMT.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Animals Care and Experimental Model. The ethics com-\nmittee in Thammasat University approved all experiments\non animals. All animal experimentation was conducted\nin accord with the Thammasat Animal Experimental Unit\nGuidelines. Male ICR mice weighing 25‚Äì30 g were obtained\nfrom National Laboratory Animal Center (Mahidol Univer-\nsity). All mice received tap water and a standard diet. Mice\nwere anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium by intraperi-\ntoneal (IP) injection. The abdomen was shaved and soaked\nwith betadine. A midline abdominal incision was made, and\nboth kidneys and ureters were identified. The left ureter was\ndissected out and ligated with 4.0 silk at two points. The\nabdominal wound was sutured and the animals returned to\nthe cages. Mice were divided into four experimental groups\n(total = 48). (1) Sham group (ùëõ = 6): mice were subjected\nto the surgical procedures except for the ureter ligation and\nreceived IP injection with vehicle. (2) Sham + EPO group\n(ùëõ = 6): these mice received IP injection with EPO dose\n1,000U/kg BW. (3) UUOgroup (ùëõ = 18): mice were subjected\n\nto the unilateral ureteral ligation and received IP injection\nwith vehicle. (4)UUO+EPOgroup (ùëõ = 18): thesemicewere\nadministered IP injection with EPO dose 1,000U/kg BW.\nEPO and vehicle were administrated every other day from\nthe day before operation to day 14. One-third of mice were\nsacrificed on day 3, one-third on day 7, and the other on day\n14. Blood samples from all mice were obtained from hearts\nto measure hematocrit levels. The kidneys were harvested for\nvarious biochemical and morphological studies.\n\n2.2. Hematocrit Measurement. At the end of each study\ngroup, hematocrit was measured for all mice. Blood sample\nwas collected using heparin coated capillary tubes which\nwere centrifuged and used tomeasure hematocrit withMicro\nCapillary reader (International Equipment Company, Inc.;\nChattanooga, TN).\n\n2.3. Renal Histology and Immunohistochemistry. Kidneys tis-\nsue was embedded in paraffin and 4 micrometer sections\nwere stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic\nacid-Schiff (PAS), and Masson‚Äôs trichrome. The percentage\nof histology changes, such as degree of glomerulosclerosis,\ntubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis, were evaluated under\nhigh power magnification (400x) in 5 to 10 consecutive\nfields, andmean percentages of histological change were then\ncalculated.\n\nOrgans were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Five-\nmicrometer paraffin sections were dewaxed and rehydrated.\nEndogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H\n\n2\nO\n2\nfor\n\n20min and nonspecific binding blocked with 20% normal\ngoat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Sections were\nincubated at 4‚àòC with primary antibodies against S100A4\n(1 : 200; Abcam: Biomed Diagnostics (Thailand) Co. Ltd.),\nTGF-ùõΩ (1 : 500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), BMP-7 (1 : 200;\nAbcam: Biomed Diagnostics (Thailand) Co. Ltd.), Smad2/3\n(1 : 200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and P16INK4a (1 : 500;\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology), for at least 1 hr followed by\nsecondary antibodies, and finally with diaminobenzidine\nsubstrate. Nuclei were counterstained with hematoxylin, and\nslides were dehydrated and mounted with permount.\n\n2.4. Western Blotting. Protein samples were electrophoresed\non 12% SDS-PAGE mini-gels and wet-transferred (Bio-Rad,\nON, Canada) onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes\nwere treated with blocking solution followed by an overnight\nincubation at 4‚àòC with rabbit polyclonal antibody to TGF-\nùõΩ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1 : 10,000 dilution), rabbit\npolyclonal antibody to Smad2/3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-\nogy; 1 : 1,000 dilution), rabbit polyclonal antibody to BMP-\n7 (Abcam: Biomed Diagnostics (Thailand) Co. Ltd.); 1 : 500\ndilution), rabbit polyclonal antibody to Smad1/5/8 (Santa\nCruz Biotechnology; 1 : 1,000 dilution), mouse monoclonal\nantibody to P16INK4a (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1 : 1000\ndilution), and rabbit polyclonal antibody to S100A4 (Abcam:\nBiomed Diagnostics (Thailand) Co. Ltd.); 1 : 1,000 dilution)\nin 5% BSA-TTBS. The secondary antibody (PIERCE, IL,\nUSA) was diluted to 1 : 5,000 in 5% BSA-TTBS and mem-\nbranes treated for 1 hour at room temperature.

Signals were\nquantified using GeneGnome Syngene Bio Imagine and\nGeneSnap image acquisition software (Syngene, MD, USA).\n\n2.5. Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Total\nRNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen,\nChatworth, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers‚Äô\ninstructions. High-quality RNA was eluted in 35 ùúáL RNase-\nfree water. An aliquot of each RNA preparation was used to\ndetermine total RNA quality and concentration, measured\nat 260 nm (OD\n\n260\n). Pure RNA possessed an OD\n\n260\n/OD\n280\n\nratio of 1.6‚Äì1.9. Total RNA (0.25 ùúág) was reverse-transcribed\nto cDNA by Taqman Reverse Transcriptase Reagent (Applied\nBiosystems, Roch Molecular Biochemical, NJ, USA) using\nrandom primers under the following cycling conditions:\n25‚àòC, 10min; 48‚àòC, 30min; 95‚àòC, 5min. The mRNA levels of\nTGF-ùõΩ, BMP7, Smad3, Smad8, P16INK4a, and hypoxanthine\nphosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) were measured using an\nABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (SDS version\n1.6; PE Applied Biosystems). The primers and probes used\nare detailed in Table 1. All samples were subjected to RT-\nPCR along with the house keeping gene HPRT which was an\ninternal standard and calibrator. The results were shown as\nfold increased or decreased over normal mice.\n\n2.6. Statistical Analyses. Data were expressed as mean ¬± SD.\nStatistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS soft-\nware (version 12.0). Statistically significant differences among\ngroups were calculated by ANOVA Bonferroni and Mann-\nWhitneyùëà tests using the least significant difference method.\nStatistical significance was defined as ùëÉ < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. rhEPO Treatment Did Not Affect Hematocrit Levels in\nUUOMice. In shamcontrol, hematocrit levels did not change\nduring two weeks of experiment. Hematocrit levels in sham\nwith rhEPO administration increased slightly at the end of\nthe first week and then significantly increased only at the end\nof study (ùëÉ < 0.05) when comparedwith vehicle treated sham\n(Figure 1). There were slightly increased hematocrit levels in\nrhEPO treated UUO mice during two weeks of experiment\nbut no statistically significant difference when comparedwith\nvehicle treated UUOmice (Figure 1).\n\n3.2. rhEPO Treatment Protected Against Renal Fibrosis inMice\nUUO Model. From H&E and PAS staining, the obstructed\nkidneys exhibited a significant progressive TA over time\ncompared with the sham (ùëÉ < 0.05), which was significantly\nreduced with the rhEPO treatment (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Table 2).\nMasson‚Äôs trichrome stained kidney sections showed a signifi-\ncant progression increase of collagen deposition in interstitial\narea over time after UUO compared with the sham (ùëÉ <\n0.05), which was significantly suppressed with the rhEPO\ntreatment (ùëÉ < 0.05) when compared with the vehicle\ntreatment (Table 2 and Figure 2).\n\nIn sham kidneys, S100A4 was not detected in any tubule\nor interstitial area (Figure 1). However, S100A4 staining was\ndetected in some TECs and cells in interstitial areas that\ndisplayed the outline of lymphocytes within the fibros-\ning obstructed kidneys. Staining of S100A4 progressively\nincreased over time after UUO compared with the sham\n(Figure 2) and was reduced in the rhEPO compared with\nthe vehicle treatment (Figure 2). By western blot analysis,\nthe S100A4 level also increased progressively over time in\nUUO compared with the sham kidneys (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 4)\n\n\n\n4 BioMed Research International\n\nTable 2: The percentage of histopathology changes, such as degree of glomerulosclerosis, tubular atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis in UUO\nmice.\n\nSham UUO\nDay 0 Day 3 Day 7 Day 14\n\nPlacebo EPO Placebo EPO Placebo EPO Placebo EPO\nGlomerular sclerosis (%) 0.2 ¬± 0.4 0.2 ¬± 0.5 0.4 ¬± 0.5 0.3 ¬± 0.5 0.6 ¬± 0.5 0.5 ¬± 0.6 1.6 ¬± 0.5 1.5 ¬± 0.5\nTubular atrophy (%) 0.6 ¬± 0.5 0.4 ¬± 0.4 9 ¬± 2‚àó 3 ¬± 1# 17 ¬± 4‚àó 7 ¬± 3# 46 ¬± 2‚àó 18 ¬± 3#\n\nInterstitial fibrosis (%) 0.6 ¬± 0.5 0.4 ¬± 0.5 8 ¬± 3‚àó 4 ¬± 2# 21 ¬± 4‚àó 9 ¬± 2# 49 ¬± 4‚àó 25 ¬± 4#\n\nValues are means ¬± SD.\nSignificant difference ‚àóùëÉ < 0.05 compared to sham group; #ùëÉ < 0.05 compared to UUO group by Mann-Whitney ùëà test.\n\n40\n\n50\n\nDay 0 Day 3 Day 7 Day 14\n\nH\nem\n\nat\noc\n\nri\nt (\n\n%\n)\n\nSham\nSham + EPO\n\nUUO\nUUO + EPO\n\n‚àó\n\nFigure 1: Representing the hematocrit values in sham and UUO\nmice treated with either vehicle or rhEPO.

By immunohistochemistry,\nTGF-ùõΩ revealed no labeling in sham kidneys but was strongly\ndetected with increasing intensity in interstitial areas of\nvehicle treated obstructed kidneys over time after UUO\n(Figure 3). Western blot analysis demonstrated the progres-\nsively increased TGF-ùõΩ in the obstructed kidneys compared\nwith the sham kidneys (Figure 4). In contrast, UUO mice\ntreated with rhEPO had decreased TGF-ùõΩ staining over\ntime (Figure 3) similar to western blot analysis revealing\n\nthe significantly decreased TGF-ùõΩ protein when compared\nwith the vehicle treatment (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 4). Similarly,\nupregulation of TGF-ùõΩmRNA expression was demonstrated\nin the obstructed kidneys by RT-PCR (Figure 5) which\nsignificant downregulation in the rhEPO treated UUOmice.\n\nIn the sham kidneys, staining of BMP-7 was demon-\nstrated in the cytoplasm of TECs, whereas in vehicle treated\nUUO kidneys there was a progressive loss of BMP-7 staining,\nparticularly in dilated and atrophic tubules (Figure 3), which\npreserved staining in rhEPO treated UUO mice (Figure 3).\nWestern blot analysis demonstrated significantly decreased\nBMP-7 in the obstructed kidneys compared with the sham\n(ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 4), but significantly preserved BMP-7\nin the rhEPO compared with the vehicle treated UUO mice\n(ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 4). Moreover, a significant downreg-\nulation of BMP-7 mRNA expression was observed during\nthe obstructive process (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 5). In contrast,\nthe downregulation of BMP-7 mRNA expression in the\nUUO mice with the rhEPO was significantly slowed down\ncompared with the vehicle treatment (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 5).\n\n3.4. rhEPO Treatment Attenuated Increased Expression of\nProfibrosis Smad2/3 and the Decreased Expression of Antifi-\nbrosis Smad1/5/8 in UUO Kidneys. In sham kidneys, there\nwas no Smad2/3 staining in the nucleus of TECs, whereas the\nstaining of Smad2/3was prominent in nucleus and someparts\nof cytoplasm of TECs particularly in dilated and atrophic\ntubules of the obstructed kidneys (Figure 3). In contrast,\nrhEPO treatment inmicewithUUOdemonstrated the signif-\nicantly reduced nucleus staining intensity of Smad2/3 in the\nobstructed kidneys (Figure 3). Western blot analysis demon-\nstrated the progressively increased Smad2/3 and decreased\nSmad1/5/8 protein in the obstructed kidneys compared with\nthe sham (Figure 4). In contrast, rhEPO treated UUO mice\nshowed significantly inhibited the rising of the Smad2/3 and\nmaintained the declining of Smad1/5/8 compared with the\nvehicle treatment (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 4). Upregulation of\nSmad3 anddownregulation of Smad8mRNAexpressionwere\nsignificantly changed during the obstructive processes (ùëÉ <\n0.05) (Figure 5). On the other hand, treatment with rhEPO\nin UUO mice significantly suppressed the upregulation of\nSmad3 mRNA and defended the downregulation of Smad8\nmRNA expression compared with vehicle treated UUOmice\n(ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figure 5).\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 5\n\nSham UUO D3 UUO D7 UUO D14\nPl\n\nac\neb\n\no\nM\n\nas\nso\n\nn\nEP\n\nO\nPl\n\nac\neb\n\no\nEP\n\nO\n\nS1\n00\n\nA\n4\n\nFigure 2: Masson‚Äôs trichrome staining for assessing interstitial fibrosis in UUO mice.

For\nimmunohistochemistry, no S100A4 staining was detected in the sham kidneys. In UUO advanced increased S100A4 staining was seen on\ncells in interstitial area that displays the outline of lymphocytes and some TEC within the fibrosing obstructed kidneys at days 3, 7, and 14.\nHowever, decreased of S100A4 expression was observed in UUOmice with rhEPO treatment.Original magnifications √ó400.\n\n3.5. rhEPO Treatment Inhibited Increased Expression of\nP16ùêºùëÅùêæ4ùëé in UUO Kidneys. In the sham kidneys, P16INK4a\nstaining was not detected in the nucleus of TECs, whereas\nP16INK4a staining was prominent in the nucleus and some\ncytoplasm of TECs particularly in dilated and atrophic\ntubules of the UUO kidneys (Figure 3). rhEPO treated UUO\nmice showed significantly attenuated staining intensity of\nP16INK4a in the nucleus and/or cytoplasm of TECs in the\nobstructed kidneys (Figure 3). Western blot and RT-PCR\nanalyses also confirmedmarkedly increased P16INK4a protein\nand mRNA expression in the UUO kidneys compared with\nthe sham kidneys (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figures 4 and 5). In contrast,\ntreatment with rhEPO in UUO mice showed significantly\n\ndecreased P16INK4a protein and mRNA expression compared\nwith vehicle treatment (ùëÉ < 0.05) (Figures 4 and 5).\n\n3.6.

Obstructed kidneys had\nsignificantly increased TGF-ùõΩ, Smad2/3, and p16INK4a but\ndecreased BMP-7, Smad1/5/8 protein, and mRNA. The\np16INK4a protein concentration was positively correlated with\nTGF-ùõΩ (ùëÖ2 = 0.97, ùëÉ < 0.001) and Smad2/3 (ùëÖ2 = 0.95,\nùëÉ < 0.001) (Figure 6) but was negatively correlated with\nBMP-7 (ùëÖ2 = 0.6, ùëÉ < 0.001) and Smad1/5/8 (ùëÖ2 = 0.71,\nùëÉ < 0.001) (Figure 6).\n\n\n\n6 BioMed Research International\n\nSham UUO D3 UUO D7 UUO D14\n\nPl\nac\n\neb\no\n\nT\nG\n\nF-\nùõΩ\n\nEP\nO\n\nPl\nac\n\neb\no\n\nEP\nO\n\nPl\nac\n\neb\no\n\nEP\nO\n\nPl\nac\n\neb\no\n\nEP\nO\n\nBM\nP-\n\n7\nSm\n\nad\n2/\n\n3\np1\n\n6\nIN\n\nK\n4a\n\nFigure 3: Representative photographs of kidney sections stainedwithTGF-ùõΩ, BMP-7, Smad2/3, and p16INK4a inUUOmodel.

Advanced increased TGF-ùõΩ labelling was seen in the interstitium area in the obstructed kidneys\ncompared with the sham at days 3, 7, and 14. In contrast, decrease of TGF-ùõΩ staining was observed in UUO mice with rhEPO treatment.\nIn contrast, BMP-7 was demonstrated in the cytoplasm of TEC in sham kidneys, whereas the labeling of BMP-7 was decreased in cytoplasm\nof TEC particularly in dilated and atrophic tubules of the placebo treated UUO kidneys since day 3 after UUO and progressive loss until day\n14. rhEPO treatment in mice with UUO demonstrated the significantly preserved cytoplasm staining intensity of BMP-7 in the obstructed\nkidneys. Moreover, no Smad2/3 and p16INK4a staining was seen in TEC in sham kidneys.

Discussion\n\nThe present study demonstrates the renoprotective effects\nof rhEPO which ameliorate TA/IF in UUO mice and pro-\nvides robust evidence for its mechanism of action. rhEPO\nreduced the effects of TGF-ùõΩ, Smad2/3, p16INK4a, and S100A4\nand enhanced the effects of BMP-7 and Smad1/5/8 which\npromote the regenerative process of TECs by inhibiting stress\ninduced senescence and reduce fibrosis by attenuating EMT.\n\n4.1. Upregulation of TGF-ùõΩ/Smad3 and Downregulation of\nBMP-7/Smad1/5/8 Expression in UUO Kidneys Associated\nwith Senescence. Ligating the ureter resulting in stress\ninduced cellular senescence originates cell cycle arrest in\nobstructed kidney mice. The expression of p16INK4a protein\nwas present in most nuclei and some cytoplasm of TECs.\n\nUpregulation of p16INK4a had a positive relationship with\ndegree of TA/IF in obstructed kidney similar to renal aging\nandmany kidney diseases [27‚Äì29]. TGF-ùõΩ is known to be one\nof the most important cytokines for triggering stress induced\nsenescence by increasing p16INK4a [30] and Smad3, whereas\nSmad3 depletion reduced senescence [8, 9]. In contrast,\nBMP activated Erk1/2 and Smad1/5/8-Id1 pathways regulate\np16INK4a expression through phosphorylating BMP receptor\nIA inhibiting cellular senescence [31]. We showed a positive\nrelationship between TGF-ùõΩ, Smad3, and p16INK4a and a neg-\native relationship between BMP-7, Smad1/5/8, and p16INK4a.\nThus, overexpression of TGF-ùõΩ/Smad3 and underexpression\nof BMP-7/Smad1/5/8 during chronic kidney injury induce\ncellular senescence resulting in a widespread irreversible cell\ncycle arrest with limited TECs regeneration.\n\n\n\n8 BioMed Research International\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n+\n\n+‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àíPlacebo\nEPO\n\nSham UUO D3 UUO D7 UUO D14\n\n+\n\n+‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àíPlacebo\nEPO\n\nSham UUO D3 UUO D7 UUO D14\n\n+\n\n+‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àíPlacebo\nEPO\n\nSham UUO D3 UUO D7 UUO D14\n\n+\n\n+‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àíPlacebo\nEPO\n\nSham UUO D3 UUO D7 UUO D14\n\n+\n\n+‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí +\n\n+‚àí\n\n‚àí\n\n+\n\n‚àíPlacebo\nEPO\n\nSham UUO D3 UUO D7 UUO D14\n\nFo\nld\n\n in\ncr\n\nea\nse\n\nd\n\nFo\nld\n\n in\ncr\n\nea\nse\n\nd\nFo\n\nld\n in\n\ncr\nea\n\nse\nd\n\nFo\nld\n\n in\ncr\n\nea\nse\n\nd\nFo\n\nld\n in\n\ncr\nea\n\nse\nd\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n‚àó\n\n#\n\n#\n#\n\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n1.8\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12 BMP-7 mRNATGF-ùõΩ mRNA\n\nSmad3 mRNA Smad8 mRNA\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n\n1\n1.2\n1.4\n1.6\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n‚àó\n\n#\n\n#\n\n#\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n‚àó\n\n#\n#\n\n‚àó\n\n#\n‚àó\n\n#‚àó\n\n#‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n#\n\n##\n\n#\n\np16INK4a mRNA\n\nFigure 5: Real-time RT-PCR for TGF-ùõΩ, BMP-7, Smad3, Smad8, and p16INK4a mRNA expression in vivo after rhEPO treatment in UUO\nmodel.

Upregulation of TGF-ùõΩ/Smad2/3 and Downregulation\nof BMP-7/Smad1/5/8 Expression in UUO Kidneys Associ-\nated with EMT. During kidney development, BMP-7 plays\nan important role in promoting mesenchymal-to-epithelial\ntransition (MET) and maintaining TEC epithelial phenotype\n[32] whereas TGF-ùõΩ is a major cytokine that regulates EMT.\nUUO mice had increased TGF-ùõΩ/Smad2/3 and decreased\nBMP-7/Smad1/5/8 expression that were directly associated\nwith the degree of fibrosis. We showed increased staining\nand expression of S100A4 in the UUO mice, consistent\nwith the development of EMT. Others have found that\nS100A4 is an early marker of fibroblast activity and that\nthese fibroblasts are derived from epithelial cells and are\na key pathophysiological step in the development of fibrosis\n\n[17, 33]. These findings suggest that, during the process\nof chronic kidney injury, TECs could be transformed into\ninterstitial fibroblasts causing progression of renal fibrosis\ninduced by overexpression of TGF-ùõΩ/Smad2/3 and loss of\nBMP-7/Smad1/5/8 expression.\n\n4.3. Stress Induced Cellular Senescence and EMT Act Together\nto Limit Regenerative Capacity and Promote Fibrosis as the\nChorus in Obstructed Kidney. In present study, we demon-\nstrated that TECs exposed to cytokine majority by TGF-\nùõΩ/Smad2/3 and loss BMP-7/Smad1/5/8 which could coac-\ncelerate the process of both senescence and EMT like the\norchestra.We propose the hypothesis that the development of\n\n\n\n10 BioMed Research International\n\nfibrosis during chronic kidney injury has two phases. In the\nearly phase, stress induced cellular senescence is the major\nmechanism which promotes fibrosis. The changes in gene\nexpression of any cell types are different during stress induced\ncellular senescence, suggesting that inflammatory response\nis cell type specific [5]. Because of senescent cells resistance\nto apoptosis, senescent TECs may accumulate over time as\nwe found by p16INK4a staining since day 3 after UUO and\nsecrete a variety of proteins which stimulate the fibroblast\ncome into the injured kidney. These fibroblasts display the\nhighly activated phenotype characteristic of myofibroblasts\nby S100A4 expression but senescent TECs did not express it.\nThus, fibroblasts from immune response play a major role to\ndevelop fibrosis in the early phase. In the later phase, EMT is\nthe major mechanism which promotes fibrosis. We found the\nprogressive staining of S100A4 in TECs at days 7 and 14which\ncorrelated with fibrosis in the obstructed kidney.This finding\nmeans that TECs express more myofibroblasts phenotype\nand transformed to mesenchymal cells which invade into the\ninterstitium area and turn to be the fibrosis. Hence, EMT by\nTECs plays a major process to develop fibrosis in the late\nphase.\n\n4.4. rhEPO Treatment Demonstrated Renoprotective Effects\nin UUO Kidneys by Inhibiting Senescence and EMT. In the\npresent study, TECs exposed to majority of proinflammatory\nTGF-ùõΩ/Smad2/3 and loss of prosurvival BMP-7/Smad1/5/8\ncytokines which could coaccelerate the process of both stress\ninduced senescence by increasing p16INK4a and EMT by\nincreasing S100A4 during chronic inflammatory process.\nrhEPO suppressed the profibrotic TGF-ùõΩ/Smad2/3 and\nmaintained the anti-fibrotic BMP-7/Smad1/5/8 during the\ndynamic process of EMT by reducing mesenchymal marker\nS100A4 expression and fibrosis. Moreover, rhEPO treatment\nreduced senescent TECs in obstructed kidneys by inhibiting\np16INK4a expression thereby improving TECs regeneration.\n\nChronic inflammatory processes frequently response\nduring chronic kidney injury is characterised by increased\nthe expression of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines\nsuch as TGF-ùõΩ/Smad, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-\n6 activated fibrosis in the kidney [34‚Äì36]. Moreover, chronic\nkidney injury could accelerate stress induced senescence\nvia increased p16INK4a expression in the kidneys, as seen\nin chronic glomerulonephritis and chronic kidney allograft\nnephropathy that is associated with disease progression and\nlimits regenerative capacity [29, 37, 38]. Activation of cells\nundergo senescence under chronic stress were stimulated\nthrough proinflammatory TGF-ùõΩ/Smad3, tumor necrosis\nfactor-ùõº and Ras-MAPK pathways [39‚Äì41]. Many experi-\nmental studies have demonstrated that EPO administration\nprotects TECs against apoptosis, chronic inflammation, and\nattenuated renal fibrosis through the interaction with the\nEPO receptor beyond anemia correction as seen in rats with\n5/6 nephrectomy, fullMHC-mismatched kidney transplanta-\ntion, and UUO [42‚Äì45]. In rats with 5/6 nephrectomy, treat-\nment with low dose long acting rHuEPO analogue protected\nthe remnant kidneys by attenuated glomerulosclerosis and\nTA/IF with preserved renal function when compared with\n\nsaline treatment which demonstrated the similar hematocrit\nlevels. Lowdoses of rHuEPO treatmentwere safe and effective\nto protect the remnant kidneys and avoids adverse effects\nof high rHuEPO doses which cause an increase in hema-\ntocrit accompanied with changes in viscosity and activate\nthrombosis [42]. Recent study in rats with kidney trans-\nplantation and EPO treatment prevented chronic allograft\ndysfunction by ameliorated glomerulosclerosis, TA/IF, and\ninflammatory cell infiltration and preserved graft function.\nCorrection of anemia in posttransplant anemic rats by blood\ntransfusion did not prevent chronic allograft injury [43].\nIn UUO rat model, long term treatment with high dose\nEPO or carbamylated-erythropoietin (CEPO) significantly\nattenuatedTA/IFwhen comparedwith saline.High dose EPO\ntreatment significantly increased hematocrit than saline and\nCEPO treated rats but only CEPO treated rats had decreased\nTGF-ùõΩ1 mRNA and fibrosis marker [44]. The present study,\ndemonstrated that rhEPO treatment ameliorates TA/IF in\nUUO mice when compared with vehicle which display the\ncomparable hematocrit levels. Thus, rhEPO treatment was\nassociated with significantly reduced chronic kidney injury\nbeyond the anemia correction, suggesting that improved\nanemia per se is unlikely to have a significant role in renal\nprotection.\n\nThe renoprotective effect of EPO was mediated by acti-\nvation of the antiapoptotic PI3K/Akt pathway in renal TECs\n[42, 43] and simultaneous decreases in TGF-ùõΩ/Smad and\ntumor necrosis factor-ùõº in the kidney [20, 21, 44‚Äì46].\nActually, EPO is secreted by fibroblast-like cells in the renal\ninterstitium and acts on erythroid progenitor cells [47]. How-\never, the interplay between EPO secreting cells, endothelial\ncells,mesangial cells, andTECs could facilitate endocrine and\nparacrine actions of EPO in the kidney. EPO receptors are\npresent on many renal cells, including TECs [48]. Binding\nof a single EPO molecule to two adjacent EPO receptors\non the membrane of target cells leads to homodimerization\nof the receptors and the triggering of different intracellular\nsignaling pathways that might play an as yet unidentified role\nin cellular protection from stress. However,many studies pro-\nposed that the tissue protective effects of EPO are mediated\nthrough a tissue protective receptor that is distinct from the\nclassical EPO receptor and is supposed to be a heteromeric\nreceptor complex composed of EPO receptor and the ubiq-\nuitous ùõΩ-common receptor (ùõΩcR, CD131) [49‚Äì52]. In the\npresent study, we have shown that the major renoprotective\neffect of rhEPO was anti-inflammatory property. This effect\nnot only decreases proinflammatory TGF-ùõΩ/Smad2/3 but\nmaintains anti-inflammatory BMP-7/Smad1/5/8 cytokines\nalso. Moreover, we found the evidence that rhEPO treatment\ncan dual inhibit stress induced senescence and EMT, result-\ning simultaneously in supporting regenerative capacity and\nslowing the progression of fibrosis in the kidney.\n\n5. Conclusions\n\nIn summary, we have provided robust evidence of the reno-\nprotective effect of rhEPO which could ameliorate the pro-\ngression of TA/IF in a mouse model of UUO as the source\n\n\n\nBioMed Research International 11\n\nof cellular stress. rhEPO treatment protects against chronic\nrenal injury by inhibiting stress induced senescence and\nEMT. These findings may explain partly the reduced rate of\ndecline in renal function seen in CKD patients who have\nbeen treated with rhEPO for anemia and are consistent with\nthe well-characterised antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory\nproperties of rhEPO in many models of chronic kidney\ninjury. Studies on the role of rhEPO in reducing the rate of\ndecline of renal function in different forms of CKD should be\nconducted.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nAll authors declare that they have no conflict of interests to\ndisclose.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThe study was supported by grant from the Thammasat\nResearch Fund.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] L.
