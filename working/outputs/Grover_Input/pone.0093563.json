The mechanism by which quiescent TECs re-obtain a potential to regenerate remains unknown. In this study,\nwe observed a transient re-expression of embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2) in adult rat TECs in vivo during ischemia-\nreperfusion induced AKI and most Pax2 positive TECs co-expressed kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker.\nThe re-expression of Pax2 was accompanied by increased levels of intrarenal Angiotensin II, which is a crucial injury factor of\nAKI. Furthermore, we also found a temporary re-expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells under the stimulation of Angiotensin II.\nThis stimulatory effect could be blocked by PD123319 (Angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) inhibitor) and AG490 (Janus\nKinase 2 (JAK2) inhibitor). As Pax2 is essential for the phenotypic conversion from mesenchymal stem cells to TECs during\nkidney development, we proposed that the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be an indicator of ‘‘atavistic’’\ntransition which mimics but reverses the processes of development of TECs. This could be proved by that a progenitor\nmarker, CD24, was also found to be transiently expressed shortly after the expression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells stimulated\nwith Angiotensin II. The expression of CD24 was also suppressed by PD123319 and AG490. Moreover, knockdown of Pax2\nby RNA interference could significantly reduce the expression of CD24 in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotension II.\nThose findings suggest that mature TECs can trans-differentiate into progenitor-like cells by ‘‘atavistic transition’’, which may\nparticipate in the recovery of tissue structure and Pax2 may play a pivotal role in this process. That might have important\nimplications for further understanding of tubular regeneration after injury.\n\nCitation: Jiang Y, Jiang T, Ouyang J, Zhou Q, Liang Y, et al.

The recovery of renal function after AKI depends on the\n\nrecovery of renal tubular epithelium[1], but the mechanism of\n\ntubular epithelial reconstruction remains unclear. It has been\n\nproposed that surviving tubular epithelial cells (TECs) re-enter cell\n\ncycle and replace damaged TECs by proliferating, but the\n\nmechanism by which quiescent TECs regain the potential to\n\nregenerate is still unknown. Meanwhile, this model has been\n\nchallenged by recent studies which suggest a role for stem/\n\nprogenitor cells in kidney repair. Nevertheless, the origin of these\n\nstem/progenitor cells remains unclear [2,3,4,5].\n\nOur previous study demonstrated that TECs could be induced\n\nto temporarily re-express embryonic gene Paired box 2 (Pax2)\n\nduring chronic kidney injury, which indicated that TECs could\n\ntransform into an immature cell phenotype and participate in\n\nkidney repair during chronic kidney injury [6]. We then proposed\n\nthat a similar "atavistic" phenotype transition might also occur\n\nduring AKI [7]. This notion is supported by the finding that a\n\nmesenchymal cell marker, vimentin, could be expressed in tubular\n\nepithelium during the recovery stage of AKI [8].\n\nThe transition of TECs from one phenotype to another is not a\n\nnew concept. During the embryonic stage of the kidney, the\n\nmesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) which mesenchymal\n\nstem cells (MSCs) are converted into a polarized tubular epithelial\n\nphenotype is a pivotal event for the differentiation of TECs. Pax2\n\nis expressed during MET and essential for this phenotype\n\ntransition [9]. During chronic kidney injury, epithelial to\n\nmesenchymal transition (EMT) has been proven to occur in\n\nmature TECs. Pax2 is also expressed during EMT and essential\n\nfor this phenotype transition [6]. Those findings suggest that the\n\nexpression of Pax2 controls the phenotype transition between\n\nstem/progenitor cells and epithelial cells. Therefore, we believe\n\nthat the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs may be a sign of\n\ncell atavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic and\n\ncellular processes of tubular development. This atavistic transition\n\nallows mature TECs to gain a characteristic of stem/progenitor-\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093563&domain=pdf\n\n\nlike cells, which could re-differentiate into TECs that restore tissue\n\nstructure.\n\nIn this study, we demonstrated that Pax2 was re-expressed in\n\nTECs during AKI in vivo, and we also found that Pax2 and a\n\nstem/progenitor cell marker, CD24, were temporarily re-\n\nexpressed in NRK-52E cells stimulated with Angiotensin II (Ang\n\nII) in vitro. Both AT2R/JAK2 inhibitor and Pax2 iRNA could\n\nblock the re-expression of Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells\n\ninduced by Ang II. These findings led us to propose that mature\n\nTECs can undergo an atavistic transition to convert into stem/\n\nprogenitor-like cells and participate in renal repair during AKI.\n\nPax2 may play a central role in this process.\n\nResults\n\nThe construction of AKI animal model\nAKI was induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) in Wistar\n\nrats as IRI is the most common cause of AKI [1]. The heart rate\n\nand glucose levels did not statistically differ before, during, or after\n\noperation both in experimental groups (IRI groups) and control\n\ngroups (sham operation groups) (data not shown). The total\n\nelimination rate (due to death in all cases) was 5/96 (3/48 for IRI\n\ngroups and 2/48 for sham operation groups).\n\nThe induction of renal damage by IRI was verified by\n\nbiochemical and histological measurements. Both blood ureani-\n\ntrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Cr) increased significantly during the\n\nearly stage of AKI in IRI groups (24 to 48 hours (h) after\n\noperation). No alteration of BUN and Cr levels was observed in\n\nsham operation groups (figure 1).\n\nKidney sections stained with hematoxylin-eosin (HE) showed\n\nremarkable changes consistent with AKI in IRI groups 24 h after\n\nIRI, such as disrupted brush borders and flattened epithelia.\n\nEpithelial cell proliferation changes were observed 72 h after IRI\n\n(figure 2A). Pathology scores of kidney showed significant increases\n\nafter IRI in experimental groups, indicating remarkable renal\n\ntissue damages were induced by IRI (figure 2B). No significant\n\nchanges were observed in animals of sham operation groups. Both\n\nthe biochemical and histological results showed that the IRI-\n\ninduced AKI rat model was successfully established.\n\nRe-expression of Pax2 in proximal tubular epithelium\nduring recovery stage of AKI\n\nThe re-expression of Pax2 in the tubular epithelium during AKI\n\nwas verified via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction\n\n(RT-PCR), western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) detec-\n\ntions. A remarkable raise of Pax2 mRNA and protein levels was\n\nobserved in the renal cortex of animals in IRI groups. The\n\nexpression levels of Pax2 increased at 24 h, maximized at 72 h\n\nand decreased at 96 h after IRI. No apparent expression of Pax2\n\ncould be observed in sham operated animals (figure 3). The IHC\n\ndetection showed that Pax2 could not be detected in proximal\n\nTECs in normal kidney, while 24-72 h after IRI, Pax2 was\n\nexpressed in the nuclei of proximal TECs (figure 4). No changes of\n\nPax2 expression pattern was observed in sham operation groups.\n\nPax2 re-expression occurs primarily in injured epithelia\ncells\n\nTo elucidate the relationship between Pax2 expression and\n\ntubular injury, we co-stained for Pax2 and kidney injury\n\nmolecular-1 (KIM-1), a tubular injury marker, We found that\n\n77.0612.5% of Pax2-positive cells co-expressed KIM-1 (figure 5).\n\nThis result indicates that most if not all Pax2 re-expression occur\n\nin injured TECs during AKI.\n\nPax2 expression was accompanied by intrarenal Ang II\nincreases in vivo\n\nThe intrarenal Ang II concentration significantly increased after\n\noperation and maintained a high level in IRI groups. The levels of\n\nintrarenal Ang II also slightly increased in sham operation groups\n\nand gradually decreased to a lower level thereafter (figure 6).\n\nAng II stimulated Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells via\nAT2R and JAK2\n\nIn vivo studies proved that the level of intrarenal Ang II\n\nincreased during AKI and was accompanied by Pax2 re-\n\nexpression. Therefore, we used Ang II to stimulate NRK-52E\n\ncells to verify that mature TECs have the ability of Pax2 re-\n\nexpression. Pax2 was observed to be transiently expressed in\n\nNRK-52E cells in response to Ang II stimulation. Ang II\n\nstimulated Pax2 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner\n\n(figure 7A, figure 7B). The immunofluorescence analyses showed\n\nthat Pax2 was expressed in the nuclei of NRK-52E cells,which is\n\nconsistent with the fact that Pax2 is a nuclear transcription factor\n\n(figure 7C).\n\nTo investigate signaling mechanisms that mediate Ang II\n\ninduced Pax2 expression in NRK-52E cells, we pre-incubated\n\nFigure 1. BUN (A) and Cr (B) results. In sham operation groups,\nthere was no alteration of BUN and Cr levels after operation. In IRI\ngroups, BUN and Cr levels increased significantly during the early stage\nof AKI (24 to 48 h after operation)(N = 6 for each time point, *P,0.05, IRI\ncompared with sham), indicating impaired kidney function in IRI groups\n24 to 48 h after operation. 72 h after operation, BUN and Cr levels in IRI\ngroups decreased significantly and showed no difference with sham\noperation groups, indicating the recovery of renal function in IRI groups\n72 h after operation.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0093563.g001\n\nCell Atavism of Tubular Epithelial Cells\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93563\n\n\n\nNRK-52E cells before Ang II administration with PD123319\n\n(AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor). Results with\n\nwestern blot and RT-PCR showed that both PD123319 and\n\nAG490 could block the stimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2\n\nexpression in NRK-52E cells (figure 8), suggesting that the\n\nstimulatory effect of Ang II on Pax2 expression in TECs is\n\nmediated by AT2R and JAK2 pathways.\n\nThese data indicate that mature TECs can re-express embry-\n\nonic gene Pax2 in response to stimulation of injury factors like Ang\n\nII and the re-expression of Pax2 might be a sign of cell atavistic\n\ntransition.\n\nPax2 expression was accompanied by CD24 expression in\nNRK-52E cells induced by Ang II\n\nTo further confirm that mature TECs have the ability of cell\n\natavistic transition in response to stimulation of injury factors like\n\nAng II, we measured the expression of a stem/progenitor cell\n\nmarker, CD24[10], in NRK-52E cells stimulated by Ang II. We\n\nobserved a transient expression of CD24 shortly after the\n\nexpression of Pax2 in NRK-52E cells in response to Ang II\n\nstimulation. The immunofluorescence analyses showed that CD24\n\nwas expressed at the surface of NRK-52E cells, which consistent\n\nwith the fact that CD24 is a cell membrane protein (figure 9).\n\nWe also used PD123319 (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2\n\ninhibitor) to examine whether the mechanisms that mediate Ang II\n\ninduced CD24 expression are similar with that mediate Ang II\n\ninduced Pax2 expression. Western blot and RT-PCR showed that\n\nboth PD123319 and AG490 could inhibit Ang II induced CD24\n\nexpression (figure 10). These data suggest that Ang II stimulates\n\nthe atavistic transition of TECs via the AT2R and JAK2 pathways.\n\nKnockdown of Pax2 suppressed Ang II induced CD24\nexpression in NRK-52E cells\n\nThe experiments above demonstrated that both Pax2 and\n\nCD24 could be stimulated in mature TECs by Ang II via the same\n\nsignal pathways. Therefore, we used shRNA (pshRNA-Pax2-983)-\n\nmediated RNA interference of Pax2 to further determine the\n\nrelationship between Pax2 and CD24 in NRK-52E cells induced\n\nby Ang II.\n\nTransfection of NRK-52E cells with Pax2 shRNA resulted in a\n\nsignificant decrease in Ang II induced Pax2 expression levels as\n\nshown by western blot and RT-PCR. The repression rate was\n\n74.368.2% as judged by western blot. Transfection with emptily\n\nplasmid vector failed to reduce Pax2 expression. The effect of Pax2\n\nshRNA was specific in that it failed to knock down the expression\n\nof unrelated protein b-actin (figure 11).\nWestern blot and RT-PCR showed that the knockdown of Pax2\n\nsignificantly suppressed Ang II induced CD24 expression in NRK-\n\n52E cells (figure 12). These data suggest that Pax2 regulates the\n\nexpression of CD24 in mature TECs induced by Ang II. That\n\nmight indicate a central role of Pax2 in the cell atavistic transition\n\nprocess of TECs.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPax2 is a transcription control factor which plays a crucial\n\nregulatory role during kidney development. During fetal life, Pax2\n\nis essential for the mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET),\n\nwhich mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are converted into tubular\n\nepithelial phenotype[9]. Pax2 is not originally expressed in MSCs,\n\nbut is only induced when MSCs meet the ureteric bud. Pax-2\n\ncontrols the process of MET by initiating a genetic cascade that\n\nincludes WT1, Wnt4, Six2 and c-Ret to suppress the expression of\n\nmesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, and promote epithelial\n\nmarkers, such as E-cadherin and cytokeratin [11,12,13]. Pax2 is\n\ndown-regulated once nephrogenesis is complete, showing a\n\ntransient expression pattern [14].\n\nAcute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and severe clinical\n\nproblem. The recovery of renal tubular epithelium after AKI is\n\ncritical for the recovery of renal structure and function. It is still\n\nnot clear how quiescent TECs regain the potential to regenerate\n\nand whether a group of specialized stem/progenitor cells play a\n\nrole during kidney repair [2,3,4]. Our previous study demonstrat-\n\ned that TECs could be induced to temporarily re-express Pax2\n\nduring chronic kidney injury [6], which suggested that mature\n\nTECs could transform into an immature cell phenotype during\n\nchronic kidney injury. We then proposed that a similar atavistic\n\ntransition might also occur during AKI.\n\nIn this study, we observed a transient Pax2 re-expression in\n\nproximal tubular epithelium of IRI-induced AKI animals. Pax2\n\nFigure 2. Pathology results of renal cortex sections. IRI groups\nshowed remarkable changes on tubular structures detected by HE\nstaining (A).

Most Pax2\n\npositive epithelial cells co-expressed a tubular injury marker, KIM-\n\n1, indicating that Pax2 was primarily expressed in injured TECs.\n\nThese data suggest that Pax2 re-expression might have a\n\nfunctional link with kidney epithelium injury and repair.\n\nIt remains to be shown which factors induce the transient re-\n\nexpression of Pax2 in TECs after IRI. Intrarenal Angiotensin II\n\n(Ang II) is one of the most important injury factors in IRI-induced\n\nAKI [15,16]. We verified a dramatic increase of intrarenal Ang II\n\nafter IRI by RIA. Ang II plays an important role during tubular\n\ndevelopment and up-regulates Pax2 expression in fetal kidney\n\nepithelial cells [17,18]. Thus, we hypothesized that Ang II might\n\nalso stimulate the re-expression of Pax2 in mature TECs. We then\n\nused Ang II to simulate NRK-52E cells in vitro and verified that\n\nAng II could stimulate Pax2 expression in mature TECs in a time-\n\nand dose-dependent manner. The expression of Pax2 in NRK-\n\n52Es also showed a transient pattern, which is consistent with the\n\ntransient expression feature during tubular development.\n\nDuring embryonic stage, the stimulatory effect of Ang II on\n\nPax2 is mediated by AT2R. Pax2 and AT2R share a similar\n\ntransient expression pattern during renal development, both of\n\nthem are down-regulated in TECs when nephrogenesis is\n\ncompleted [17,19,20]. Interestingly, AT2R is also up-regulated\n\nin TECs after kidney injury [21,22]. In fetal kidney epithelial cells,\n\nAT2R activates Pax2 via JAK2 pathway [18]. Therefore, we pre-\n\nincubated NRK-52E cells before Ang II administration with\n\nPD123319 (AT2R inhibitor) and AG490 (JAK2 inhibitor) to\n\ninvestigate signaling mechanisms that mediate Ang II induced\n\nPax2 expression in NRK-52E cells. We found that both AT2R\n\ninhibitor and JAK2 inhibitor could block Ang II induced Pax2\n\nexpression in NRK-52E cells, indicating that the stimulatory effect\n\nof Ang II on Pax2 expression in mature TECs is mediated by\n\nAT2R-JAK2 pathway.\n\nRenal Pax2 is down-regulated once nephrogenesis is complete\n\nand is not normally expressed in mature TECs. We believe that\n\nthe re-expression of Pax2 in TECs is an initiating event of cell\n\natavistic transition, which mimics but reverses the genetic and\n\ncellular processes of tubular development. This process could\n\nallow mature TECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/\n\nprogenitor cells. We provided evidence for this hypothesis by the\n\nobservation that a progenitor marker, CD24 [10],was transiently\n\nexpressed in Ang II induced NRK-52E cells shortly after the\n\nexpression of Pax2. This model could also be supported by a\n\nprevious study which showed that a mesenchymal cell marker,\n\nvimentin, was expressed in the tubular epithelium during the\n\nrecovery stage of AKI[8].\n\nMoreover, we found that both AT2R inhibitor (PD123319) and\n\nJAK2 inhibitor (AG490) which could not only block Ang II\n\ninduced Pax2 expression, but CD24 expression as well in NRK-\n\n52E cells. This result indicaed a regulative role of Pax2 on CD24\n\nexpression. We then used shRNA-mediated RNA interference of\n\nPax2 to further determine the relationship between Pax2 and\n\nCD24 in NRK-52E cells induced by Ang II. We found that\n\nknockdown of Pax2 expression resulted in an apparent suppress of\n\nAng II induced CD24 expression in NRK-52E cells. These data\n\ndemonstrate that CD24 is regulated by Pax2 in NRK-52E cells\n\nstimulated with Ang II.\n\nIn summary, our findings demonstrated that mature TECs can\n\nundergo an atavistic transition under the induction of acute injury\n\nfactors such as Ang II. This atavistic transition allows mature\n\nTECs to re-gain the characteristics of stem/progenitor cells, which\n\ncould re-differentiate into TECs to restore tissue structure. Pax2\n\nmight play a central part in this process. Currently, exogenous\n\nstem cells used for AKI treatment are difficult to obtain and\n\nextremely expensive. It is very likely that enhancing the atavistic\n\ntransition of surviving TECs could be more effective than injecting\n\nFigure 3.
