Mesenchymal cells including microvascular\nmural cells (pericytes) are major progenitors of scar-forming my-\nofibroblasts in kidney and other organs. Here we show pericytes in\nhealthy kidneys have active WNT/β-catenin signaling responses\nthat are markedly up-regulated following kidney injury. Dickkopf-\nrelated protein 1 (DKK-1), a ligand for the WNT coreceptors low-\ndensity lipoprotein receptor-related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP-5 and LRP-\n6) and an inhibitor of WNT/β-catenin signaling, effectively inhibits\npericyte activation, detachment, and transition to myofibroblasts in\nvivo in response to kidney injury, resulting in attenuated fibrogen-\nesis, capillary rarefaction, and inflammation. DKK-1 blocks activa-\ntion and proliferation of established myofibroblasts in vitro and\nblocks pericyte proliferation to PDGF, pericyte migration, gene ac-\ntivation, and cytoskeletal reorganization to TGF-β or connective\ntissue growth factor. These effects are largely independent of\ninhibition of downstream β-catenin signaling. DKK-1 acts predom-\ninantly by inhibiting PDGF-, TGF-β–, and connective tissue growth\nfactor-activatedMAPK and JNK signaling cascades, acting via LRP-6\nwith associated WNT ligand. Biochemically, LRP-6 interacts closely\nwith PDGF receptor β and TGF-β receptor 1 at the cell membrane,\nsuggesting that it may have roles in pathways other than WNT/\nβ-catenin. In summary, DKK-1 blocks many of the changes in\npericytes required for myofibroblast transition and attenuates estab-\nlished myofibroblast proliferation/activation by mechanisms de-\npendent on LRP-6 and WNT ligands but not the downstream\nβ-catenin pathway.\n\nFibrosis of the internal organs, resulting from subclinical injuryto the organ over a period of time or from acute severe injury\nor inflammation, is a major global health problem. All organs may\nbe affected by fibrosis, which matures into microscopic or mac-\nroscopic scarring within the tissue parenchyma. At present there\nare few therapies that specifically target the process of fibro-\ngenesis, despite increasing evidence suggesting that fibrogenesis\nper se provokes further decline in organ function, inflammation,\nand tissue ischemia (1). In addition, myofibroblasts themselves\nare inflammatory cells that generate cytokines, chemokines, and\nradicals that promote injury. Myofibroblasts appear as a result of\na transition from pericytes, cells that normally nurse, maintain,\nand regulate the microvasculature (2, 3). The transition from\npericytes to myofibroblasts results in an unstable microvascula-\nture leading to aberrant angiogenesis or rarefaction (3). These\nmicrovascular changes ultimately provoke tissue ischemia. There-\nfore, the myofibroblast and its transition from resident pericyte or\nfibroblast is a major new target for therapeutics to counter the\ndeleterious consequences of tissue injury.\nRecently, SNPs in LRP-6, a transmembrane coreceptor for\n\nWNTs that binds to Frizzled (Frz) receptors and thereby to\nthe WNT/β-catenin signaling cascade, have been identified as\nindependent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. However,\nthe mechanisms still are obscure (4, 5).\n\nThe WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway is a major regulator of\ncell function both in embryonic development and in adults. Both\nelevated and attenuated levels of signaling that fall outside the\nnormal homeostatic range of WNT signaling are linked to ab-\nnormal embryonic development and to diverse disease states (6).\nIncreasing evidence indicates that WNT signaling plays critical\nroles in tissue regeneration and immune responses to injury and\ninfection (7). However, the signaling cascade and the cellular\nresponses are complex and context specific (8).\nPrevious studies have highlighted the importance of WNT/\n\nβ-catenin in kidney regeneration (9), and studies of chronic dis-\nease of the kidney glomerulus and liver sinusoids suggest that\npersistent activation ofWNT/β-catenin is deleterious (10), but the\nrole of WNT signaling in myofibroblasts and their precursors,\npericytes of the kidney capillaries, was not studied (2). Here we\nexplore the consequences of reactivating WNT/β-catenin signal-\ning in pericytes and myofibroblasts after kidney injury.\n\nResults and Discussion\nWnt/β-Catenin Pathway Is Up-Regulated in Myofibroblasts in Kidney\nDisease. To explore the extent of the activation of the canonical\nWNT pathway in cells of the normal kidney, we studied two\ndistinct lines of mice that are transgenic for reporters of WNT/\nβ-catenin signaling. Axin2+/lacz generates β-gal in cells expressing\nthe endogenous WNT/β-catenin target gene, Axin2. (Fig. 1A)\n(11). TCF/LEF-H2B-GFPTr is a recently validated transgenic line\nof mice reporting β-catenin activity by nuclear GFP expression. It\nexhibits enhanced sensitivity and specificity over previous re-\nporters of β-catenin nuclear activity (Fig. 1A) (12). In normal\nkidneys of Axin2+/lacz mice there is extensive WNT/β-catenin\nsignaling in the papilla, and there are more restricted responses\nin the normal medulla and kidney cortex, as we have demon-\nstrated previously (Fig. S1A) (9). Among the cells expressing\nlacZ were podocytes, vascular smooth muscle of arterioles, and\nsome pericytes (Fig. 1 B–D and Fig. S1 A and B). In response to\ninjury initiated by obstructing urine flow from the kidney (the\nunilateral ureteric obstruction [UUO] model), there was marked\nincrease in lacZ staining in the scar-forming cells known as\n“myofibroblasts” that derive from pericytes (Fig. 1 B–D). Although\ncollecting duct cells and cells of the loop of Henle showed Axin2-\n\nAuthor contributions: S.R. and J.S.D. designed research; S.R., B.G.J., C.I., S.-L.L., and J.S.D.\nperformed research; Y.K., K.C.D., S.-L.L., A.K., R.A.L., A.-K.H., R.T.M., and J.S.D. contrib-\nuted new reagents/analytic tools; S.R., B.G.J., C.I., and J.S.D. analyzed data; and K.C.D.,\nR.T.M., and J.S.D. wrote the paper.\n\nConflict of interest statement: S.R. and J.S.D have submitted patent applications for the\nuse of DKK-1 in fibrosis.\n\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\n1To whom correspondence should be addressed.

In normal\nkidney, β-catenin responses were more extensive than previously\nappreciated. We have shown previously that in normal kidney,\nproximal and distal epithelium exhibits little endogenous WNT/\nβ-catenin reporter activity (9). In contrast, in TCF/LEF-H2B-GFPTr\nmice there was evidence of WNT reporter activity in many of these\ncells (Fig. 1E and Fig. S1 C–G). However, like the Axin2+/lacz re-\nporter, a minority of pericytes showed active signaling in normal\nkidney. Following kidney injury, WNT/β-catenin reporter activity\nincreased in epithelial cell compartments, but there was a much\ngreater increase in the pericyte/myofibroblast population of cells\n(Fig. 1 E–G and Fig. S1C).\n\nKidney Myofibroblasts Up-Regulate Wnt Pathway Genes and Wnt\nReporter Activity. To explore further the activation of the WNT\npathway in kidney myofibroblasts, we purified nonactivated peri-\ncytes (normal kidney), activated pericytes (from day 2 after\nUUO), and myofibroblasts transitioned from pericytes (from days\n5, 7, and 10 after UUO) by flow cytometric sorting of single-cell\ndigests from kidneys of the Coll-GFPTr reporter mouse, which\nspecifically expresses GFP in these cells (13). Purified cells showed\nmarked up-regulation of pericyte genes, including P75 NGFR\n(Ngfr) (Fig. S2A), and at baseline expressed detectable levels of\nNG2 (Cspg4) and PDGFRβ (Pdgfrb) that were modestly up-reg-\nulated over time postinjury (Fig. S2D, Table S1). We found pro-\ntotypical profibrotic genes expressed in normal kidney and up-\nregulated over time postinjury in our disease model, including\nCol1a1, Tgfb1, Ctgf, and Fgf2. We also observed up-regulation of\nthe phosphatonin Fgf23, which has been implicated in the path-\nogenesis of cardiovascular disease (Fig. S2A). WNT ligands, in-\ncluding Wnt2, 3, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 10a, were up-regulated. Pericytes\nalso express cell-surface receptors (Fzd) and coreceptors (Lrp5,\n\nLrp6) forWNT responsiveness (Fig. S2B). As the course of kidney\ndisease progressed, there was a modest up-regulation of the\nDickkopf-related protein (DKK) family of mRNAs known to in-\nhibit canonical WNT signaling via direct binding to the LRP-5 and\nLRP-6 coreceptors (Fig. S2C). Other WNT downstream target\ngenes, including sFLT1 and WISP1, which play important roles in\nnoncanonical and canonical WNT signaling pathways, re-\nspectively, also were up-regulated, consistent with activatedWNT/\nβ-catenin and also noncanonical WNT pathways (Fig. S2C).\n\nDKK-1 Triggers G1 Cell-Cycle Arrest and Down-Regulates Activation in\nMyofibroblasts. To test the function of WNT/β-catenin pathway\nactivation in myofibroblasts, we generated primary myofibroblast\ncultures from Coll-GFPTr mice that had kidney fibrosis (13).\nMyofibroblasts also expressed WNT ligands and receptors (Fig.\nS3A). DKK-1 has been reported to inhibit the WNT/β-catenin\npathway by binding to LRP-5 or LRP-6. We cloned Dkk1 and\nexpressed soluble DKK-1 or the DKK-1-GFP fusion protein\n(Fig. S3B) in HEK293 cells. Soluble DKK-1-GFP binding to\nunlabeled cell lines was markedly enhanced by overexpression of\nLRP-5 or LRP-6 (Fig. S3C), and DKK-1-GFP readily bound to\nthe surface of cultured myofibroblasts without the requirement\nfor receptor overexpression (Fig. S3D), indicating high receptor\ndensity for DKK-1 on myofibroblasts. DKK-1 protein specifically\nblocked entry of myofibroblasts into the cell cycle induced by\nserum at the G1 checkpoint (Fig. 2 A–F and Fig. S3E), resulting\nin inability to proliferate (Fig. 2B).\nTo understand the mechanisms better, we tested the effect of\n\nDKK-1 on the steady-state level of β-catenin protein. Cytosolic\nand nuclear β-catenin increased 1 h and 16 h after serum acti-\nvation, an effect decreased by DKK-1 at 16 h (Fig. 2G), con-\nfirming DKK-1 inhibits WNT/β-catenin signaling but suggesting\nearly DKK-1 responses may occur independent of regulation of\nβ-catenin protein (Fig. 2G). Transcripts for αSMA (Acta2), a\nmarker of myofibroblast activation, were increased by serum at\n24 h, and DKK-1 significantly reduced this activation (Fig. 2H),\nsuggesting that DKK-1 may regulate activation also.\n\nSystemic Delivery of DKK-1 Inhibits Myofibroblast Expansion and\nFibrosis. Next we tested whether DKK-1 inhibited pericytes and\nmyofibroblasts in vivo. DKK-1 was delivered systemically using an\n\nFig. 1.

In preventative\nstudies using the UUO model, DKK-1 profoundly inhibited peri-\ncyte expansion, proliferation, and transition to myofibroblasts (Fig.\n3 C–I), resulting in reduced fibrosis (Fig. S4). The inhibition on\nday 4 after UUO was associated with a marked reduction in\ninflammation (Fig. 3J) and epithelial injury (Fig. S4 A and B).\nMoreover, expression of the WNT/β-catenin reporters in kidney\nmyofibroblasts was reduced, particularly at the earlier time points\n(Fig 3K). These studies were extended to day 10 after UUO in-\njury, and there was a substantial reduction in organ fibrosis and\ncollagen transcripts (Fig. 3 L–M).\nTo study this effect in more detail, we performed a reversal\n\nstudy in which DKK-1 was delivered after disease onset, and fi-\nbrosis extent was assessed 10 d after UUO (Fig. 3 N–P). Myofi-\nbroblast accumulation, proliferation, deposition of interstitial\nfibrosis, and rarefaction of the capillaries were inhibited. Fur-\nthermore, as in the preventative studies, DKK-1 inhibited in-\nflammation and epithelial injury (Fig. S4 A–C). Because recent\nevidence indicates that myofibroblasts in kidney arise from peri-\ncyte precursors which detach from peritubular capillaries in re-\nsponse to injury (2), we examined the effect of DKK-1 on pericyte\nprecursor detachment, spreading, and migration in Coll-GFPTr\nreporter mice. DKK-1 inhibited pericyte detachment from capil-\nlaries at early time points in this model (Fig. 3Q).\nWe tested whether DKK-1 could inhibit disease in a second\n\nmodel of inflammation and fibrosis, ischemia reperfusion injury\n(U-IRI) of a single (unilateral) kidney, a recognized model of\nchronic kidney disease following acute kidney injury (9). We\nperformed a reversal study in this model and characterized the\nextent of scarring in the kidney 10 d after the initial U-IRI. Cir-\nculating DKK-1 inhibited myofibroblast accumulation, inflamma-\ntion, and interstitial fibrosis and reduced epithelial injury (Fig. S4\nE–K) sufficiently to reverse existent fibrosis (Fig. S4L).\n\nDKK-1 Blocks PDGF-Stimulated Proliferation of Kidney Pericytes by an\nLRP-6, P42/P44 MAPK-Dependent Mechanism. To study the mecha-\nnism of action of DKK-1, we tested its effects on primary kidney\npericyte cultures, the precursors of myofibroblasts (2, 13). PDGF\nand TGF-β signaling in pericytes are important factors in the\ndetachment of pericytes from capillaries and their transition to\nmyofibroblasts (3, 14) and as such are important factors in\ndriving fibrosis. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and its\nhomolog CCN1 (Cyr61) also have been implicated in fibrosis and\nwound healing (15). Pericytes were stimulated by PDGF-BB to\nenter the cell cycle (Fig. 4A), but other profibrogenic growth fac-\ntors had no effect. Unexpectedly, exogenous addition of WNT3a\ndid not stimulate proliferation. DKK-1 markedly attenuated\nPDGF-BB–stimulated proliferation (Fig. 4B). PDGF stimulation\ndown-regulated transcripts for the activation markers CTGF,\nαSMA, and collagen Iα (1), and DKK-1 further down-regulated\nthose transcripts (Fig. 4C), suggesting that DKK-1 therefore may\nenhance certain PDGF-mediated transcriptional events. None of\nthe factors applied to pericytes affected viability (Fig. 4D).\nIn keeping with a link between PDGF signaling and the WNT\n\npathway in pericyte proliferation, PDGF regulates a number of\nWNT ligands, including up-regulating Wnt2 and 5a and down-\nregulating Wnt7a, 10a, and 16 (Fig. 4E). However, inconsistent\nwith such a link, exogenous WNT3a had no stimulatory effect on\nproliferation (Fig. 4A). Because DKK-1 acts via LRP-5 and\nLRP-6, and because PDGF regulates WNT transcripts (Fig. 4E),\nwe expected DKK-1 to block the endogenous WNT/β-catenin\n\nFig. 3.

Binding of WNT ligands to Fzd receptors and LRP-6\ncoreceptors leads to activation and phosphorylation of LRP-6\n(pLRP-6). Surprisingly therefore, PDGF-BB alone stimulates\n\npLRP-6 (Fig. 4F), and DKK-1 initially augments pLRP-6 mod-\nestly and inhibits it only at later time points (Fig. 4F and Fig. S5\nA–C), indicating that PDGF may coactivate the WNT/β-catenin\npathway and that DKK-1 regulates this coactivation. To test this\npossibility, we assessed whether PDGF-BB regulates the WNT/\nβ-catenin pathway in pericytes cultured from the β-catenin re-\nporter mouse (TCF/Lef:H2B-GFPTr) (Fig. 4G). After 16 h with\nPDGF, nuclear β-catenin activity was increased significantly.\nThis increase was inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 4G), although the\nextent of β-catenin activation was much lower than the extent of\ncells triggered into the cell cycle (Fig. 4A), a finding that is\nconsistent with the possibility that DKK-1 inhibits proliferation\nby a β-catenin–independent pathway.\nWe therefore explored signaling pathways activated by PDGF-\n\nBB but inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 4H and Fig. S5D). PDGF-BB\nstimulates the P42/P44 MAPK and the JNK signaling pathways.\nDKK-1 inhibits both these responses. PDGF-BB activates the P38\nMAPK pathway, but DKK-1 enhances this response, perhaps\nexplaining why DKK-1 can enhance PDGF-mediated transcrip-\ntion (Fig. 4C). As expected, PDGF-BB enhances cyclin D1 ex-\npression (Fig. 4H and Fig. S5D), an effect inhibited by DKK-1.\nAlthough WNT3a alone had no apparent impact on cell prolif-\neration (Fig. 4A), it nevertheless stimulated the activation of\nLRP-6 and accumulation of cyclin D1 (Fig. S5E), providing ev-\nidence that LRP-6 activation by PDGF-BB results in distinct\nsignaling vs. activation by WNT3a.\nBecause DKK-1 specifically inhibits PDGF-stimulated P42/\n\nP44 MAPK and JNK activation (Fig. 4H), the relative impor-\ntance of these pathways was tested using specific inhibitors. The\nP42/P44 inhibitor U0126 completely replaced DKK-1 function in\nPDGF-BB–stimulated pericyte proliferation (Fig. 4I), whereas\nthe JNK inhibitor SP600125 had no impact. Because there was\nno apparent linkage between the PDGF-BB–mediated activation\nof the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway and its capacity to\nstimulate proliferation, we tested whether the WNT/β-catenin\npathway is necessary for PDGF-mediated proliferation using\na small-molecule inhibitor of β-catenin, XAV939 (a Tankyrase\ninhibitor). Strikingly, XAV939 had no effect (Fig. 4I). To con-\nfirm this finding, cultured pericytes from kidneys homozygous for\nthe floxed alleles of β-catenin (Ctnnb1fl/fl) underwent recombi-\nnation in vitro by transduction with Lenti-Cre virus, and Lenti-\nGFP virus was used as a control that does not catalyze recom-\nbination. One hundred percent of pericytes were transduced by\nGFP expression, and β-catenin protein was lost 48 h after trans-\nduction with Lenti-Cre (Fig. S6). Pericytes lacking β-catenin\nresponded to PDGF and its inhibition by DKK-1 similarly to\npericytes with β-catenin (Fig. 4J), confirming that PDGF stim-\nulates and DKK-1 inhibits proliferation independently of the\ncanonical WNT pathway, even though LRP-6 is activated. To\nstudy whether DKK-1 mediates its effects through an alternative\ncell-surface signaling mechanism or whether LRP-6 is necessary\nfor the PDGF signaling pathway in this context, we immunopre-\ncipitated PDGFRβ from pericytes and pulled down active pLRP-\n6 only when the receptor was engaged with ligand (Fig. 4K), in-\ndicating a close relationship between the two receptors at the time\nof signaling. Next, we overexpressed dominant-negative mutated\nforms of LRP-6 in a mouse embryonic fibroblast cell line (3T3)\nthat endogenously expresses PDGFRβ (Fig. 4L and Fig. S6).\nExpression of two different dominant-negative forms of LRP-6,\nbut not theWT form, was sufficient to inhibit proliferation of 3T3\ncells in response to PDGF-BB and to prevent DKK-1 effects (Fig.\n4L), indicating that DKK-1 inhibits proliferation through signal-\ning via LRP-6 and revealing that LRP-6 can be detected in a\ncomplex containing PDGFRβ. Finally, because LRP-6 is required\nfor PDGF-induced proliferation, we assessed whether WNT\nligands are necessary for PDGF responses by blocking WNT se-\ncretion in pericytes using the Porcupine homolog inhibitor, IWP2\n(Fig. S7). Porcupine homolog is required for palmitoylation and\nsecretion of all WNTs from cells (16). IWP2, blocked PDGF-\nstimulated proliferation in a dose-dependent manner without\naffecting viability, suggesting that WNT engagement of LRP-6 at\nthe cell surface is necessary for PDGF responses in pericytes.\n\nFig. 4.

Our in vivo stud-\nies showed that DKK-1 prevents pericyte activation, detachment\nfrom capillaries, migration, and expression of the myofibroblast\nmarker αSMA (Fig. 3). Previous and current studies (2, 14)\nsuggest that PDGFR signaling does not affect these pericyte\nchanges directly. Therefore we tested the effect of DKK-1 on\npericyte activation and migration in response to other cytokines\nimplicated in these processes (17, 18). In contrast to PDGF,\nTGF-βmarkedly and rapidly stimulates pericyte migration (Fig. 5\nA–C), and over 48–72 h up-regulates collagen genes and the in-\ntermediate filament αSMA (Fig. 5D). Similar observations on\nmigration were made by treatment of pericytes with CTGF (Fig. 5\nC andD), an extracellular protein that may signal via β1-integrins,\nLRP-1, and possibly LRP-6 (19), and with CCN1 (Fig. S8A).\nTGF-β and CTGF promote marked cytoskeletal reorganization\nof contractile filaments in pericytes after 24 h of cytokine treat-\nment (Fig. 5E). DKK-1 inhibits all migratory, activatory, and\ncytoskeletal changes in pericytes in response to TGF-β or CTGF\n(Fig. 5 A–E) but has no impact on migration in response to CCN1\n(Fig. S8A). Strikingly, primary cultures of kidney epithelial cells\nhave high endogenous migration that is weakly responsive to\nthese cytokines. DKK-1 has a nonsignificant effect on these cul-\ntures (Fig. S3), suggesting DKK-1 has a major effect on pericytes,\nnot epithelium.\nWe next tested the impact of DKK-1 on activation of LRP-6\n\nin the context of these activating ligands. TGF-β, and CTGF both\nactivate LRP-6 within minutes of cytokine exposure, and, as ex-\npected, WNT3a also stimulates LRP-6 activation (Fig. 5F and\nFigs. S5E and S8B). Within 10 min, DKK-1 weakly activates LRP-\n6 (Fig. S5C) and does not block the activation triggered by TGF-β\norWNT3a (Fig. 5F and Fig. S8). However, LRP-6 was deactivated\nby DKK-1 in all activation conditions after 16 h (Fig. S5), indi-\ncating LRP-6 is activated rapidly by non-WNT ligands and DKK-1\neither augments that signal weakly or does not affect it initially but\nsilences it only at later time points. Because DKK-1 blocks TGF-\nβ–mediated changes to pericytes, we tested whether TGF-β signals\nvia the WNT/β-catenin pathway directly or indirectly. TGF-β reg-\nulates WNT ligands in pericytes at 24 h (up-regulating Wnt2, 9a,\nand 11 and down-regulating Wnt2b and 16) (Fig. 5G), but DKK-1\nhad no impact on these changes. Both TGF-β and CTGF triggered\nnuclear β-catenin activity in pericytes (Fig. 5H); this activity was\ninhibited by DKK-1, but, as with PDGF, the effect occurred in\na minority of cells, suggesting that TGF-β and CTGFmay regulate\npericyte activation via aWNT/β-catenin–independent pathway and\nthat DKK-1 may inhibit pericyte activation via that same pathway.\nWe tested the effect of DKK-1 on TGF-β– and CTGF-medi-\n\nated signaling. Both TGF-β and CTGF stimulate the P42/P44,\nP38, and JNK pathways. DKK-1 blocks activation of the P42/44\nand JNK pathways and augments activation of the P38 pathway\n(Fig. 5 I and J). As expected, FAK is activated by both TGF-β\nand CTGF and is inhibited by DKK-1 (Fig. 5 I and J). To test\nwhether components of these DKK-1–regulated signaling cas-\ncades are responsible for the impact on migration, we measured\nthe effect of DKK-1 on TGF-β activation of the canonical SMAD\nactivation pathway (Fig. S8C), which was not affected. Next\nwe used small-molecule inhibitors of activation of TGFβR1\n(SB431542), JNK (SP600125), P42/P44 (U0126), or β-catenin\n(XAV939) in TGF-β– or CTGF-stimulated migration assays.\nP42/P44, TGFβR1, and β-catenin inhibitors had no significant\neffect on TGF-β–stimulated migration, but JNK inhibitors\nblocked migration to TGF-β completely (Fig. 5K and Fig. S8D),\nsuggesting DKK-1–mediated silencing of JNK signaling is central\nto its ability to block TGF-β–stimulated migration. Inhibition of\nCTGF-mediated migration was independent of TGFβR1 activa-\ntion, was partially dependent on β-catenin and P42/P44 activa-\ntion, and was most dependent on JNK activation (Fig. 5L),\nhighlighting similarities to and differences from TGF-β–mediated\nmigration. CCN1-mediated migration occurred independently of\nP42/44 and JNK pathways (Fig. S8A). Because XAV939 showed\nlittle effect on TGF-β–mediated migration, we generated peri-\ncytes lacking β-catenin as described above (Fig. 4J). Compared\n\nwith controls, in the absence of β-catenin, DKK-1 completely\nblocked TGF-β–stimulated migration (Fig. 5M). However,\noverall (nonstimulated) migration was reduced in the absence of\nβ-catenin, indicating that DKK-1 can function independently of\nWNT/β-catenin signaling but that the Wnt/β-catenin pathway\n\nFig. 5.

To test\nwhether LRP-6 also associated with the TGFβR complex,\nTGFβR1 was immunoprecipitated, and pLRP-6 was coprecipi-\ntated in resting cells. This association increased upon active sig-\nnaling (Fig. 5N). To determine the role of LRP-6 in TGF-\nβ–stimulated migration, we studied expression of the dominant-\nnegative LRP-6 mutants in fibroblasts, as described above (Fig.\n4L). Strikingly, although TGF-β–mediated migration occurred in\nthe presence of mutant LRP-6, DKK-1 was now ineffective (Fig.\n5O). Therefore, DKK-1 inhibits TGF-β migration by an LRP-6–\ndependent mechanism, and active LRP-6 can be detected in\na signaling complex with TGFβR1. That TGF-β stimulates mi-\ngration in the presence of dominant-negative LRP-6 but DKK-1\nno longer functions suggests that the endogenous LRP-6 still may\nbe able to interact with TGF-β, whereas DKK-1 binds equally to\nthe mutant forms; further studies will be required to understand\nLRP-6 interactions with TGFβR1. Finally, to test the role ofWNTs\nin TGF-β–mediated migration and in DKK-1 inhibition, we\nblockedWNT secretion using IWP2 as described above (Fig. S7).\nIn this setting TGF-β–stimulated migration was blocked com-\npletely, suggestingWNT engagement of LRP-6 at the cell surface\nis necessary for TGF-β response in pericytes.\nThese studies identify LRP-6 and signaling pathways down-\n\nstream of LRP-6 as therapeutic targets to intervene in fibro-\ngenesis of the kidney. In addition, they identify the soluble pro-\ntein DKK-1 and its receptor LRP-6 as important cofactors in\nmultiple signaling pathways activated by TGF-β, CTGF, and\nPDGF (Fig. S8E). Because these multiple pathways are known to\ncontribute to the development of fibrosis and its longer-term\nconsequences on organ function, therapeutically delivered DKK-\n1 or therapeutic targeting of the LRP-6 receptor are attractive\nstrategies for treating fibrosis, microvascular inflammation, tubule\ninjury, and microvascular rarefaction. Recent studies indicate that\nmesenchyme-derived cells, either pericytes or resident fibroblasts,\nare present in all organs and tissues and are the primary source of\nscar-forming myofibroblasts in multiple tissues (2, 20). Therefore\nit is likely that the DKK-1/LRP-6 signaling pathway regulates\nfibrogenesis in multiple organs and tissues.\nThe MAPK signaling pathways from TGFβR signaling, CTGF\n\nsignaling, and PDGFR signaling appear to be functionally critical\nin the mesenchyme-derived perivascular cells in kidney. These\npathways have received relatively little attention, and earlier\nstudies have assumed that the canonical pathways activated by\nthese receptors have been dominant in the process of fibrogenesis\n(14, 21); further studies should focus on these pathways in peri-\ncytes and fibroblasts. Our studies show that LRP-6 (and poten-\ntially LRP-5), when bound by WNT ligands, interacts physically\nwith PDGFRβ and TGFβR1 upon cognate ligand interaction\n(Fig. S8E). It is possible, therefore, that LRP-6 is responsible for\n\ntransducing the signal that activates the MAPK pathways. Fur-\nther studies should address this question. The fact that LRP-6 can\nfunction as a coreceptor for multiple pathways raises the question\nwhether it requires an extracellular ligand, distinct from WNT\nligands, to effect this interaction. It is likely that soluble ligands\nsuch as TGF-β and PDGF are presented at the cell surface bound\nto extracellular modulators and that these complexes may bind to\nand be responsible for the recruitment of LRP-6. The studies also\nindicate that in pericytes and myofibroblasts CTGF activates cells\nindependently of TGF-β, whereas previous reports have sug-\ngested CTGF augments TGF-β responses in fibrogenesis. These\nstudies suggest CTGF has a distinct receptor on pericytes and\nmyofibroblasts that has not been fully appreciated. Further\nstudies should define the CTGF receptor in these cells and the\ninteraction of LRP-6 with that receptor.\nGenetic studies of LRP-6 and LRP-5 function in mice point to\n\ntheir major role in WNT pathway signal transduction in early and\nlater embryogenesis (5). However, the initial studies suggested\nthat LRP-5/LRP-6 mutations interfered with other signaling\npathways, including FGFR1 and Notch Delta (22). Recently,\nLRP-6 mutations have been found not only in humans with re-\nduced bone mineral density but also in patients with premature\ncardiovascular disease (4, 5). These reports also have suggested\na potential link between LRP-6 and PDGFR signaling. In the\ncontext of our current findings, these studies suggest that LRP-6\nmay regulate multiple signaling pathways in mesenchyme-de-\nrived cells that play critical roles in bone mineralization, arterial\nwall functions, and microvascular wall functions.\nWe conclude that DKK-1 is antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory\n\nby inhibiting multiple signaling pathways in pericytes and myofi-\nbroblasts through binding to the cell-surface receptors LRP-5/-6,\nwhich in turn act as coreceptors for multiple signaling pathways.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nMouse Models.
