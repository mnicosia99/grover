These putative relationships, indicated by PCR genotyping, were\ntested in the present study by further genotyping and phenotyping of 23 cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates\nfrom horses with GI disease (referred to hereafter as horse GI disease isolates). Our beta2-toxin (CPB2)\nWestern blot analyses demonstrated that all of the tested isolates were unable to produce detectable levels of\nCPB2. However, Southern blot and nucleotide sequencing analyses identified intact cpb2 open reading frames\nin all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates. Furthermore, reverse transcriptase PCR and Northern blot\nanalyses showed that cpb2 genes in all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates were transcriptionally active,\ni.e., an �1.2-kb cpb2-specific mRNA was identified in total RNA from our surveyed isolates. The levels of cpb2\nmRNA in CWC245 (a high-CPB2-producing pig strain) and our surveyed horse GI disease isolates differed to\nsuch an extent (35-fold) that this difference could be considered as a major cause of the difference in levels of\nCPB2 production by CWC245 and horse GI disease isolates. This finding received further support from our\nobservation that the complementing strain 106902(pMRS140), which produced significantly higher levels of\nmRNA than strain 106902, produced high levels of CPB2. Collectively, our results indicated that there is a\npositive correlation between cpb2 transcription levels and the amount of CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell\nand that decreased transcription and/or message instability may be involved, at least in part, in the low CPB2\nproduction noted for horse GI disease isolates in comparison to that noted for pig GI disease isolate CWC245.\n\nClostridium perfringens is an important cause of histotoxic\nand gastrointestinal (GI) diseases in both humans and animals\n(20, 26). The virulence of this bacterium results largely from its\nability to produce at least 15 different toxins (21). C. perfringens\nisolates are commonly classified (21) into one of five types, A\nto E, based upon their ability to produce the four major lethal\ntoxins (i.e., alpha-, beta-, epsilon-, and iota-toxins). The major\nlethal toxins, however, are not the only biomedically important\ntoxins; some C. perfringens isolates (mostly those belonging to\ntype A) produce C. perfringens enterotoxin (20), and many\nisolates of both types A and C produce beta2-toxin (CPB2) (5,\n9, 11, 29)\n\nThe 28-kDa CPB2 was first purified from C. perfringens type\nC strain CWC245 and shown to be cytotoxic for Chinese ham-\nster ovary cells (15). Fisher et al. (9) recently demonstrated\nthat CPB2 produced by a non-food-borne human GI disease\nisolate is cytotoxic for CaCo-2 cells. Although cpb2 was initially\nidentified in C. perfringens type C isolates, a recent study (5)\ndemonstrated the presence of cpb2 sequences in all types of C.\nperfringens. The deduced amino acid sequence of CPB2 is\nhighly conserved in type A and C strains of C. perfringens\nisolated from diarrheic pigs (11, 29). However, the variability\nin CPB2 sequences in type A human isolates (9) coupled with\n\nCPB2 sequence differences in isolates from nonporcine ani-\nmals (16) indicate that CPB2 is an unusual C. perfringens toxin.\n\nSeveral epidemiological studies suggested that cpb2-positive\nC. perfringens isolates are highly associated with enteric dis-\neases in domestic animals, particularly enteritis in piglets (10,\n11, 18), typhlocolitis in horses (2, 13), diarrhea in dogs (27),\nulcerative enteritis in an African elephant (1), and enterotox-\nemia in calves (19). These putative associations between cpb2-\npositive isolates and GI diseases in animals remained tentative\nbecause this conclusion was drawn on the basis of PCR geno-\ntyping, in which only the presence of cpb2 sequences and not\nthe expression of cpb2 was demonstrated. Although a recent\nstudy (29), by demonstrating that all of the surveyed cpb2-\npositive isolates from pigs with GI disease (referred to here-\nafter as pig GI disease isolates) can, in fact, produce CPB2,\nconfirmed the association of cpb2-positive isolates with GI\ndiseases in piglets, no such evidence with a large number of\nclinical isolates has been provided in favor of an association of\ncpb2-positive isolates with GI diseases in nonporcine animals.\nEven though a recent study (5) demonstrated the production\nof CPB2 in 100% (n � 2), 50% (n � 10), and 40% (n � 5) of\nthe surveyed horse, bovine, and avian GI disease isolates, re-\nspectively, the correlation between PCR genotype and CPB2\nproduction in horse GI disease isolates still remained quite\ntentative due to the minute surveyed population.\n\nThe putative associations thus noted between cpb2-positive\nisolates and CPB2-associated horse GI diseases clearly require\nverification by analyzing larger numbers of horse GI disease\n\n* Corresponding author.

In response to this issue, our present study has per-\nformed the first in-depth molecular genetic and phenotypic\nanalysis of a large number of European cpb2-positive C. per-\nfringens type A isolates obtained from horses with GI diseases.\nResults from the present study indicate that there is a positive\ncorrelation between cpb2 transcription levels and the amount\nof CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and that decreased\ntranscription and/or message instability may be involved, at\nleast in part, in the low cpb2 expression levels observed in\nhorse isolates compared to the level in pig isolate CWC245.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial strains. The C. perfringens isolates used in this study are listed and\ndescribed in Table 1. The cpb2-positive C. perfringens horse GI disease isolates\nused in this study were identified earlier by multiplex PCR analysis (10, 13) as\ncpe-negative type A isolates. In this study, by using the reverse CAMP test (12),\nwe reconfirmed that all cpb2-positive type A isolates surveyed in this study\nproduced (data not shown) the arrow-shaped zone of synergistic hemolysis in-\ndicative of alpha-toxin expression.\n\nGrowth conditions. A starter culture (6 ml) of each C. perfringens isolate was\nprepared by overnight growth at 37°C in fluid thioglycolate broth (Difco) as\ndescribed previously (8). For DNA and RNA isolation or culture supernatant\nprotein preparation, an aliquot (0.2 ml) of each fluid thioglycolate broth culture\nwas inoculated into 10 ml of TGY broth (3% Trypticase, 2% glucose, 1% yeast\nextract, 0.1% cysteine [8]), which was then incubated at 37°C for 3 to 24 h without\nshaking. (Note that, because of moderate aerotolerance, C. perfringens can grow\nin liquid medium without anaerobic incubation). For selection of C. perfringens\ntransformants carrying pMRS140, C. perfringens cultures were plated onto a\nbrain heart infusion agar plate containing erythromycin (50 �g/ml) and incu-\nbated at 37°C for 18 h in an anaerobic jar with BBL GasPak (Becton Dickinson\nand Company).\n\nProtein preparations and Western blot analysis. Culture supernatant fluid was\nseparated by centrifugation at 500 � g from 20-ml TGY cultures of C. perfringens\nisolates grown for 18 h at 37°C. This culture supernatant fluid was used to isolate\nsupernatant proteins by ammonium sulfate precipitation (29) or to concentrate\nto 20-fold at 4°C using Amicon Centricon Ultra centrifugal filter devices (Mil-\nlipore). Total cell protein was prepared from the bacterial pellet of a 20-ml TGY\nculture which was used to prepare culture supernatant proteins as previously\ndescribed (29). Prepared proteins were electrophoresed on a 0.1% sodium do-\ndecyl sulfate–12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a Sequi-Blot polyvi-\nnylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and CPB2 Western blot analysis was\nperformed as previously described (29).\n\nRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Southern blot anal-\nyses. A 318-bp digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled cpb2-specific DNA probe was pre-\npared by using a two-step PCR amplification method as previously described\n(29). Isolated C. perfringens DNA samples, prepared as previously described (8,\n23), were digested with EcoRV or HpaI (New England Biolabs), separated by\nelectrophoresis on 1% agarose gels, and Southern transferred. The blots were\nhybridized with the DIG-labeled cpb2 probe, which was then detected using a\nDIG chemiluminescence detection system utilizing CSPD [disodium 3-(4-\nmethoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2�-(5-chloro)tricyclo[3,3.1.13.7]decane}-4-yl)phenyl\nphosphate] ready-to-use substrate (Roche) as described earlier (23).\n\nPFGE and Southern blot analyses. Cells from overnight TGY cultures were\ncollected by centrifugation and used to prepare agarose plugs containing\ngenomic C. perfringens DNA as previously described (4, 6, 7, 24, 25). The undi-\ngested total unsheared genomic DNA in 100 �l of an agarose plug was electro-\nphoresed at 200 V with a Bio-Rad CHEF-DRII apparatus, with a pulse ramped\nfrom 50 to 90 s over 20 h (24, 25). These pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)\ngels were then subjected to cpb2 Southern blot analysis using the same procedure\ndescribed above.\n\nCloning and sequencing of the cpb2-containing fragment from various cpb2-\npositive isolates. A 1,373-bp DNA fragment carrying cpb2 open reading frame\n(ORF) and 262-bp upstream and 312-bp downstream sequences from each of\nthree horse GI disease isolates (106902, 106903, and AHT3553) was PCR am-\nplified using primers 5�-GCTCTAGAGGATATCTTAAATTTAGCACAG-3�\n\nTABLE 1.

PERFRINGENS 4003\n\n\n\nand 5�-CCGGAATTCTTTTTTAAGCTCAATTTTTACTGG-3� as previously\ndescribed (29). These PCR products were then cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO\nvector using the TOPO XL cloning kit (Invitrogen). Both strands of the cpb2-\ncontaining DNA insert, from two clones for each isolate, were then sequenced\nusing M13 forward and reverse primers.\n\nRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA was isolated from TGY cultures of C. perfrin-\ngens strains as previously described (8, 14). The primer set 5�-AAACTGAATT\nTTTAAATGGTGC-3� and 5�-TCCACATCCAATGATCTACAA-3�, which am-\nplified a 318-bp cpb2 internal fragment, was used to detect cpb2-specific mRNA\nin total RNA preparations by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis with the\ncommercially available Access RT-PCR kit (Promega). After RT-PCR, the pres-\nence of an amplified product was analyzed by subjecting an aliquot of each\nsample to agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide staining and\nvisualization under UV illumination. The presence of an amplified product of the\nexpected size was indicative of the presence of specific mRNA transcripts in total\nRNA preparations.\n\nNorthern blot analysis. A 560-bp internal cpb2 DNA fragment was amplified\nfrom CWC245 by PCR using primer set 5�-GGAGCAATAAGTCCAATGA\nA-3� and 5�-TCCACATCCAATGATCTACAA-3� and labeled with alkaline\nphosphatase using the Gene Images AlkPhos direct labeling and detection sys-\ntem (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA isolated from C. perfringens strains\ngrown in TGY broth at 37°C for different time periods as previously described (8,\n14) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and Northern trans-\nferred. The blots were hybridized with the alkaline phosphatase-labeled cpb2\nprobe, and hybridized probe was then detected by CDPstar chemiluminescence\n(Amersham Biosciences). The relative levels of cpb2 mRNA in horse GI disease\nisolates were determined from a calibration curve, which was made using various\namounts (0.1 to 5 �g) of RNA prepared from high-CPB2-producing pig strain\nCWC245. The densitometric analysis was performed on a Macintosh computer\nusing the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the U.S. National\nInstitutes of Health and available on the Internet at http://rsb.info.nih.gov/nih\n-image/).\n\nConstruction of complementing strains 106902(pMRS140) and 106903\n(pMRS140). A 1,373-bp KpnI-XhoI fragment was extracted from pMW1 and\ncloned into KpnI/SalI sites of pJIR751 (3). Plasmid pMW1, which is a derivative\nof the pCR-XL-TOPO vector carrying the 106902 cpb2 ORF and its upstream\nand downstream sequences, was constructed for nucleotide sequencing analyses\nas described above. The plasmid pMRS140 was introduced into C. perfringens\n106902 and 106903 electrocompetent cells by electroporation as previously de-\nscribed (8, 23).\n\nRESULTS\n\nCPB2 production by cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates.\nOur collection of European horse GI disease isolates has been\npreviously identified (10, 13) as cpb2 positive by using a mul-\ntiplex PCR assay. Since a recent study (5) reported that only\n50% of nonporcine cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates can\nproduce CPB2, in this study we first evaluated whether our\ncollection of European horse GI disease isolates positive for\ncpb2 by PCR (cpb2 PCR-positive isolates) could, in fact,\nproduce CPB2. We first analyzed culture supernatant pro-\nteins from cpb2-positive C. perfringens. When CPB2 Western\nblotting was performed with supernatant proteins from a\ncontrol CPB2-producing C. perfringens pig isolate, CWC245\n(11), an �28-kDa immunoreactive band was obtained (Fig.\n1), consistent with previous reports (11, 29). However, no\nCPB2 production could be detected in the culture superna-\ntant of a cpb2-negative isolate, 106527 (data not shown).\n\nWhen similar CPB2 Western blot analyses were performed\non culture supernatant proteins prepared from our unknown\n23 horse GI disease isolates, no CPB2-specific immunoreactive\nband was detected (Table 1; representative results are shown\nin Fig. 1). To investigate whether this lack of CPB2 production\nin our surveyed cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates was due\nto impaired secretion of CPB2, we compared the production of\nCPB2 in culture supernatant with that in total cell protein\npreparations (Fig. 1) using CPB2 Western blotting analysis.\nAgain, no CPB2-specific immunoreactive band was observed in\nthe assays with either supernatant or total cell proteins of horse\nGI disease isolates (Fig. 1). These results suggested that all of\nour surveyed horse GI disease isolates were incapable of pro-\nducing detectable levels of CPB2.\n\nRFLP genotyping of cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates. To\nevaluate whether CPB2 Western blotting-negative isolates\n\nFIG. 1. Western blot analysis of CPB2 production by selected horse GI disease isolates. (A) Culture supernatant (sup) or total cell (cell)\nproteins, prepared from each of the specified C. perfringens isolates, were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\nand stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. Migration of the supernatant proteins is shown by arrows. (B) Western blot of the gel shown in panel\nA. The blot was probed with CPB2 antibodies and developed by chemiluminescent detection to identify immunoreactive species. Results shown\nfor control isolates include those for CWC245 (a cpb2-positive type C strain). Results shown for representative horse GI disease isolates include\nthose for isolates 106902 and 106903. Molecular mass markers are shown in the middle.\n\n4004 WATERS ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\nwere truly cpb2 positive, our collection of horse GI disease\nisolates was subjected to RFLP analysis. We first performed\nRFLP-Southern blot analysis on representative cpb2-positive\n(CWC245) and cpb2-negative (106527) C. perfringens isolates\nusing HpaI or EcoRV restriction enzymes which have no cleav-\nage site within the cpb2 ORF. As expected, a DIG-labeled cpb2\nprobe hybridized to an �5-kb HpaI or �7.5-kb EcoRV DNA\nfragment of CWC245, respectively (reference 29 and data not\nshown). However, no hybridizing band was observed with\nDNA from cpb2-negative isolate 106527 (Fig. 2).\n\nWhen the same HpaI RFLP-Southern blot assay was applied\nto our collection of horse GI disease isolates, the cpb2 probe\nhybridized to �20-kb HpaI DNA fragments from 21 out of 23\nsurveyed isolates (Table 1; representative results are shown in\nFig. 2). Two isolates, AHT2600 and AHT2779, produced hy-\nbridizing bands of �8 kb and �14 kb, respectively (Table 1 and\nFig. 2). In order to confirm that these differing HpaI RFLP\nresults were not simply due to the loss of an HpaI restriction\nsite, further RFLP analyses were performed on EcoRV-di-\ngested DNA (Fig. 2). These EcoRV RFLP results confirmed\nour HpaI RFLP results, demonstrating that the EcoRV RFLP\npatterns of these two isolates are different from that of the\nother surveyed horse GI disease isolates (Fig. 2). These results\nsuggest that all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates carry\nthe cpb2 sequences.\n\nPFGE evidence supporting the plasmid localization of cpb2\nin isolates from horses with GI diseases. To determine\nwhether cpb2 is located on the chromosome or plasmid in\nhorse GI disease isolates, representative cpb2-positive C. per-\nfringens isolates were subjected to PFGE-Southern blot anal-\nysis, which has been successfully used (4, 6, 7, 24, 29) to for-\nmally establish the chromosomal or plasmid localization of cpe\nand cpb2. As expected, the cpb2-containing DNA from control\nstrain CWC245 entered the pulsed-field gel in the absence of\n\nrestriction enzyme digestion and produced a hybridizing band\nof �50 kb (Fig. 3). These PFGE results confirmed previous\nobservations that cpb2 is located on the plasmid of cpb2-pos-\nitive isolate CWC245 (11, 29).\n\nWhen similar PFGE genotyping analyses were performed on\nDNA of representative cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates,\ntheir cpb2-containing plasmid DNA entered the pulsed-field\ngels and produced hybridizing bands that comigrated with the\ncpb2-containing plasmid DNA from CWC245 (Table 1; repre-\nsentative results are shown in Fig. 3). These results indicated\nthat the cpb2-positive C. perfringens horse GI disease isolates\ncarry cpb2 on a plasmid.\n\nComparison of the cpb2 ORFs present in different cpb2-\npositive horse GI disease isolates. To examine whether horse\nGI disease isolates carry intact cpb2 ORFs, both strands of a\n1,373-bp PCR-amplified DNA insert carrying the cpb2 ORFs\nfrom three different horse GI disease isolates were nucleotide\nsequenced. These analyses (data not shown) revealed that no\nframeshift mutations or premature termination codons were\nfound in the cpb2 ORF sequences of the horse GI disease\nisolates which we surveyed. The cpb2 ORF sequences present\nin horse GI disease isolates were identical to one another.\nFurthermore, the cpb2 ORF sequences present in three of\nthese isolates match the previously determined (11) cpb2 ORF\nsequence from CWC245 (a type C strain isolated from a dis-\neased pig in France) except for one nucleotide change. The\nreplacement of G with A at position 408 (from ATG) in cpb2\nORFs of surveyed horse GI disease isolates creates a replace-\nment of valine with isoleucine. These results suggest that our\nsurveyed three horse GI disease isolates carry a consensus, but\n\nFIG. 2. RFLP-Southern blot analysis of HpaI- or EcoRV-digested\nDNA from horse GI disease isolates. Total DNA isolated from each of\nthe specified C. perfringens strains was digested with HpaI (A) or\nEcoRV (B) and then Southern transferred. The Southern blots were\nprobed with a 318-bp DIG-labeled cpb2-specific probe. Results shown\nfor control isolates include those for 106527 (a cpb2-negative type C\nstrain). Representative cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates include\nAHT2600, AHT2779, AHT2911, AHT3553, and AHT3992.

Results shown for control isolates include those for\nCWC245 (a cpb2-positive type C isolate carrying the cpb2 gene on a\nlarge plasmid) and 106527 (a cpb2-negative type C isolate). Represen-\ntative results shown for cpb2 horse GI disease isolates include those for\n106902, 106903, AHT3992, and AHT4578.

PERFRINGENS 4005\n\n\n\nnot atypical, cpb2 gene (16). Comparison of the cpb2 upstream\nand downstream sequences present in all three isolates re-\nvealed that both upstream and downstream sequences were\nidentical in all three horse GI disease isolates and matched the\npreviously determined cpb2 upstream and downstream se-\nquences of CWC245 (11).\n\nRT-PCR analysis of cpb2-positive horse GI disease isolates.\nHaving obtained evidence for the presence of intact cpb2\nORFs in all of our surveyed CPB2 Western blotting-negative\nhorse GI disease isolates, we performed RT-PCR analyses to\nevaluate whether the cpb2 ORFs in these isolates were tran-\nscriptionally active. When control experiments were performed\nto confirm the specificity and reliability of the RT-PCR assay,\nno detectable RT-PCR-amplified product was observed with\nRNA of a cpb2-positive isolate, CWC245, in the absence of RT\n(Fig. 4A), indicating that no contaminating DNA was present\nin the RNA preparation. However, as expected, a 318-bp am-\nplified product was detected in RNA of CWC245 in the pres-\nence of RT (Fig. 4A). The size of the RT-PCR-amplified\nproduct exactly matched the size of the product obtained in the\ncontrol PCR using CWC245 chromosomal DNA as a template\nand the same primers (Fig. 4B). These results indicated that\nthe cpb2 mRNA is present in total RNA of CWC245.\n\nWhen the same RT-PCR analysis was applied to RNA from\nour four representative horse GI disease isolates (106902,\n106903, AHT327, and AHT3992), the 318-bp RT-dependent\namplified product was detected in total RNA of all four sur-\nveyed isolates (Fig. 4A and data not shown). The size of each\nRT-PCR-amplified product exactly matched the size of the\n\nPCR product obtained with DNA of each surveyed isolate\n(Fig. 4B and data not shown). These results suggest that the\nhorse GI disease isolates are able to produce cpb2-specific\ntranscripts and that the negative CPB2 production in these\nisolates may not be due to the transcriptional inactivation of\ncpb2.\n\nComparative Northern blot analysis of cpb2-positive horse\nGI disease isolates. After we demonstrated the presence of\ncpb2 transcripts in RNA of our surveyed isolates, it became of\ninterest to compare the level of cpb2 mRNA synthesis in CPB2\nWestern blotting-negative horse GI disease isolates with that\nin the CPB2-producing pig isolate CWC245 by Northern blot\nanalysis. As shown in Fig. 5, our cpb2-specific probe hybridized\nto an �1.2-kb mRNA species present in RNA samples ex-\ntracted from CWC245. The size of the CWC245 cpb2 tran-\nscript matched the size of the cpb2 transcript (�1.4 kb) from\nstrain 13 (22) and was in close agreement with the cpb2 coding\nsequence from CWC245 (10). However, as expected, this\nprobe showed no hybridization to RNA samples extracted\nfrom a cpb2-negative isolate, 106527 (Fig. 5), even though\nethidium bromide staining (data not shown) confirmed that\nequivalent amounts of RNA samples from both CWC245 and\n106527 had been electrophoresed. These results indicated that\nour Northern blot results were reliable and specific.\n\nWhen these Northern blot analyses were applied to RNA\nprepared from C. perfringens horse GI disease isolates, a single\n1.2-kb band, which comigrated with the cpb2 probe-reactive\nband of CWC245, was detected in RNA from all our surveyed\nisolates (Fig. 5 and Table 1). However, the expression of cpb2\nin horse GI disease isolates was significantly low compared to\nthat in pig isolate CWC245 (Fig. 5A). Over three experimental\nrepetitions, the 1.2-kb cpb2 probe-reactive species was repro-\nducibly less abundant in RNA samples extracted from our\nsurveyed horse GI disease isolates than in RNA samples ex-\ntracted from CWC245, possibly because these strains produced\ntoo little cpb2 message, as would be consistent with Western\nblotting results indicating no detectable CPB2 production by\nhorse GI disease isolates. Time course experiments demon-\nstrated that the maximal cpb2 transcription in 3-h growth cul-\ntures of both pig isolate CWC245 and horse isolate 106903 and\nthe transcription level gradually decreased over the time pe-\nriod. Although expression of cpb2 was continued up to 10 h in\nthe growth culture of CWC245, no cpb2 transcript could be\ndetected in the 106903 culture after 8 h (Fig. 5B). When the\nrelative cpb2 mRNA levels were determined by semiquantita-\ntive Northern blot analysis, an average difference of 35-fold in\ncpb2 transcription levels was observed between a pig strain\n(CWC245) producing high levels of CPB2 and five surveyed\nhorse GI disease strains (170, AHT327, AHT3992, 106902, and\n106903) producing undetectable levels of CPB2 (Fig. 5C and\ndata not shown). These results suggest that decreased tran-\nscription and/or message instability may be involved, at least in\npart, in the low CPB2 production levels noted for the horse GI\ndisease isolates compared with that for pig GI disease isolate\nCWC245.\n\nOverexpression of cpb2 in horse GI disease isolates 106902\nand 106903 by a recombinant plasmid carrying the cpb2 gene\nfrom 106902. To confirm that undetectable CPB2 production\nin horse GI disease isolates was due to low expression of cpb2\nmRNA, we introduced plasmid pMRS140, which is a deriva-\n\nFIG. 4.

When total RNA extracted from TGY cul-\ntures of either 106902(pMRS140) or 106903(pMRS140) was\nsubjected to Northern blot analyses, a single 1.2-kb cpb2\n\nprobe-specific band was detected (Fig. 5A and data not\nshown). The 1.2-kb cpb2 probe-reactive species was reproduc-\nibly more abundant in RNA samples extracted from\n106902(pMRS140) and 106903(pMRS140) than in RNA sam-\nples extracted from host strains 106902 and 106903, respec-\ntively (Fig. 5A and data not shown). There were no differences\nin the abundance of the 1.2-kb species in RNA samples ex-\ntracted from 106902(pMRS140), 106903(pMRS140), and\nCWC245 (Fig. 5A and data not shown). These results suggest\nthat the cpb2 gene present on the multicopy plasmid pMRS140\ncould overexpress cpb2 mRNA in 106902 and 106903.\n\nCPB2 Western blot analyses (Fig. 6) demonstrated that the\nplasmid pMRS140 could overproduce CPB2 in 106902 and\n106903. pMRS140 transformants were able to produce CPB2\nin a secretion-dependent manner reminiscent of CPB2 produc-\ntion by CWC245; that is, neither pMRS140 transformant pro-\nduced detectable CPB2-specific immunoreactivity in total cell\nproteins (data not shown), but the transformants did produce\nCPB2-specific immunoreactivity in culture supernatant pro-\nteins (Fig. 6). CPB2 Western blots also demonstrated, as ex-\npected, that CPB2 production (Fig. 6 and data not shown) was\nabsent from both total cell and culture supernatant proteins\nwhen the shuttle vector pJIR751 alone was introduced into\n106902 or 106903, confirming that the observed overproduc-\ntion of CPB2 in 106902(pMRS140) and 106903(pMRS140)\nwas specifically caused by transcomplementation of the wild-\ntype cpb2 gene present in pMRS140. Collectively, these results\nindicated that the cpb2 gene present in horse GI disease isolate\n106902 was functional and that there was a positive correlation\n\nFIG. 5.

PERFRINGENS 4007\n\n\n\nbetween cpb2 message levels and the amount of CPB2 pro-\nduced by C. perfringens.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nOur present study reports an array of evidence supporting\nthe hypothesis that all of our surveyed horse GI disease isolates\ncarry a functional cpb2 gene and that the lack of CPB2 pro-\nduction is not due to the inactivation or loss of the cpb2 gene.\n(i) RFLP- and PFGE-Southern blot analyses reconfirmed the\npresence of cpb2 sequences on a large plasmid in all of our\nsurveyed horse GI disease isolates. (ii) Nucleotide sequencing\nidentified intact cpb2 ORFs in our surveyed CPB2 Western\nblotting-negative isolates. The cpb2 ORF sequences present in\nthree surveyed horse GI disease isolates are identical to one\nanother and to previously determined (11, 29) cpb2 ORF se-\nquences. (iii) Finally, complementation studies demonstrated\nthat a recombinant plasmid carrying 106902 cpb2 increased\nCPB2 production in 106902 cells to a detectable level (Fig. 6),\nindicating that the 106902 cpb2 gene is fully functional. Col-\nlectively, these results suggested that the differences in CPB2\nproduction levels observed between CWC245 and our sur-\nveyed horse GI disease isolates may be due to differences in\ncpb2 transcription levels.\n\nThe most significant finding of this study is the presentation\nof the first evidence that cpb2 is transcriptionally active in all of\nour surveyed CPB2 Western blotting-negative isolates and the\nobservation of an average of 35-fold-lower mRNA levels in\nhorse GI disease isolates than in pig GI disease isolate\nCWC245. This lower level of mRNA synthesis might be a\nmajor cause of the undetectability of CPB2 production in horse\nGI disease isolates. This idea received further support from\nour observation that the complementing strain\n106902(pMRS140), which produced significantly higher levels\nof mRNA than its parent strain, 106902 (Fig. 5A), produced\nCPB2 at a level similar to CWC245 (Fig. 6). These findings\nprovide a genetic basis, at least in part, for the lack of a\ndetectable level of CPB2 production in vitro in C. perfringens\nhorse GI disease isolates, which may also be applicable to\nother nonporcine isolates characterized previously (5), where\nonly 50% of cpb2-positive nonporcine isolates produced CPB2.\n\nOur complementation studies also suggest that there is a\npositive correlation between cpb2 transcription levels and the\namount of CPB2 produced by a C. perfringens cell and that\ndecreased transcription and/or message instability may be in-\nvolved, at least in part, in the lower CPB2 production noted for\nthe horse GI disease isolates than for pig isolate CWC245. We\ndid not examine stabilities of cpb2 mRNAs and therefore can-\nnot rule out the possibility that the cpb2 mRNAs of horse GI\ndisease isolates are less stable than that of CWC245. However,\nno degraded cpb2 transcript was detected on the Northern blot\nof our surveyed isolates (Fig. 5), suggesting that the difference\nin CPB2 production levels in vitro between CWC245 and horse\nGI disease isolates may have arisen due to different rates of\ncpb2 transcription. The differential level of alpha-toxin gene\n(plc) transcription in C. perfringens was previously reported;\nthe levels of plc transcripts differ up to 40-fold from one C.\nperfringens type to another, and the greater production of al-\npha-toxin by the type A strains is due mainly to an increased\nlevel of plc transcripts (17, 28). Further transcriptional analyses\n\nof a large number of cpb2-positive type C isolates should ad-\ndress whether the difference in the levels of cpb2 transcription\nin CWC245 (type C pig strain) and horse GI disease isolates\n(type A) observed in our present study is typically due to\nisolates’ type (type A versus type C) or origin (pig versus\nhorse).\n\nWhat could be responsible for the different rates of cpb2\ntranscription between CWC245 and horse GI disease isolates?\nAn inverted repeat sequence identified in the downstream\nregion of the CWC245 cpb2 sequence (11) is also present in\nour surveyed horse GI disease isolates. The cpb2 upstream\npromoter region is identical in both pig and horse isolates. The\n1,373-bp sequenced fragment does not contain any features\nwhich would account for different cpb2 expression levels be-\ntween pig strain CWC245 and surveyed horse GI disease iso-\nlates. Therefore, it can be envisioned that the relevant differ-\nence(s) might be present outside of this fragment and be\ninvolved in regulating cpb2 expression.\n\nThe association of cpb2-positive C. perfringens type A iso-\nlates with GI diseases in horses raises an important, but still\nunanswered, question. Is this low-level expression of cpb2\nenough to cause any GI symptoms of CPB2-associated GI\ndiseases, or do these symptoms also result from expression of\nother C. perfringens toxin(s)? Our present study does not rule\nout the possibility that these cpb2-positive type A horse GI\ndisease isolates acquire high-level expression of cpb2 in vivo,\nwhich could be enough to cause symptoms of CPB2-associated\nGI diseases in horses. All of the type A horse GI disease\nisolates surveyed in this study were classified as cpe-negative\ntype A isolates, indicating that the production of C. perfringens\nenterotoxin or beta-, iota-, or epsilon-toxin is not required for\na CPB2-producing type A isolate to cause GI diseases in\nhorses. Since the present study confirmed that cpb2-positive\ntype A horse GI disease isolates can produce both CPB2 and\nalpha-toxin, it is possible that alpha-toxin also can be a major\ncontributor to the pathogenesis of diseases caused by these\nisolates. Further CPB2 and alpha-toxin knockout studies\nshould address the relative contributions of CPB2 and alpha-\ntoxin in cpb2-positive C. perfringens type A-associated GI dis-\neases in animals.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was supported by a grant from the N.
