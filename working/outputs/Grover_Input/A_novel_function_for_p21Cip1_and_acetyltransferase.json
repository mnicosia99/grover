ARTICLE Open Access\n\nA novel function for p21Cip1 and acetyltransferase\np/CAF as critical transcriptional regulators of TGFb-\nmediated breast cancer cell migration and invasion\nMeiou Dai1, Amal A Al-Odaini1, Ani Arakelian2, Shafaat A Rabbani2, Suhad Ali1 and Jean-Jacques Lebrun1*\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: Tumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation steps in the process of breast cancer\nmetastasis, the primary cause of breast cancer morbidity and death. Here we investigated the role of p21Cip1\n(p21), a member of the core cell cycle machinery, in transforming growth factor-beta (TGFb)-mediated breast\ncancer cell migration and invasion.\n\nMethods: A mammary fat pad xenograft mouse model was used to assess the mammary tumor growth and local\ninvasion. The triple negative human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB231 and its sub-progenies SCP2 and SCP25,\nSUM159PT, SUM149PT, SUM229PE and SUM1315MO2 were treated with 5 ng/ml TGFb and the protein expression\nlevels were measured by Western blot. Cell migration and invasion were examined using the scratch/wound healing\nand Transwell assay. TGFb transcriptional activity was measured by a TGFb/Smad reporter construct (CAGA12-luc) using\nluciferase assay. q-PCR was used for assessing TGFb downstream target genes. The interactions among p21, p/CAF and\nSmad3 were performed by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, Smad3 on DNA binding ability was measured by DNA\nimmunoprecipitation using biotinylated Smad binding element DNA probes. Finally, the association among active\nTGFb/Smad signaling, p21 and p/CAF with lymph node metastasis was examined by immunohistochemistry in tissue\nmicroarray containing 50 invasive ductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node positive.\n\nResults: We found p21 expression to correlate with poor overall and distant metastasis free survival in breast\ncancer patients. Furthermore, using xenograft animal models and in vitro studies, we found p21 to be essential for\ntumor cell invasion. The invasive effects of p21 were found to correlate with Smad3, and p/CAF interaction\ndownstream of TGFb. p21 and p/CAF regulates TGFb-mediated transcription of pro-metastatic genes by controlling\nSmad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional activity. In addition, we found that active TGFb/Smad signaling\ncorrelates with high p21 and p/CAF expression levels and lymph node involvement using tissue microarrays from\nbreast cancer patients.\n\nConclusions: Together these results highlight an important role for p21 and p/CAF in promoting breast cancer cell\nmigration and invasion at the transcriptional level and may open new avenues for breast cancer therapy.\n\nIntroduction\np21 was originally identified as a cell cycle regulator\nthrough inhibition of different cyclin/cyclin-dependent\nkinase complexes [1]. p21 is a member of the Cip/Kip\nfamily of cell cycle inhibitors, which also includes\np27Kip1 and p57Kip2 [2-4]. In addition to its role in cell\ncycle control, p21 is involved in the regulation of cellular\n\nsenescence, gene transcription, apoptosis and actin cytos-\nkeleton [5-7]. The role of p21 in breast cancer develop-\nment and progression has not been fully investigated.\nWhile p21 is involved in cell cycle control and is a down-\nstream target of the tumor suppressor p53, it does\nnot fulfill the classic definition of a tumor suppressor.\nGermline or somatic mutations in the p21 gene are not\ncommon in human cancers [8]. Furthermore, in vivo stu-\ndies using p21 knockout mice showed that, while loss of\np21 expression efficiently blocked the ability of the cells\nto undergo G1 arrest following DNA damage, these\n\n* Correspondence: jj.lebrun@mcgill.ca\n1Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University\nHealth Center, Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\nDai et al.

Intriguingly, p21 is often\noverexpressed in aggressive tumors, including carcino-\nmas of the pancreas, breast, prostate, ovary and cervix\n[10-13]. Together these observations suggest that the role\nplayed by p21 in cancer is more complex than initially\nthought and that, in addition to its well-known cell cycle\nregulatory effect, it may have uncharacterized roles in\npromoting carcinogenesis.\nTumor cell migration and invasion are critical steps in\n\nthe metastatic process and are regulated by numerous\ntumor-secreted factors which modify the tumor microen-\nvironment by acting on stromal recruitment and extracel-\nlular matrix (ECM) degradation, resulting in tumor cell\nmigration and invasion [14]. Among these tumor-secreted\nfactors, TGFb has been shown to play a pivotal role in\npromoting tumor metastasis [15]. The TGFb family regu-\nlates asymmetric cell division and cell fate determination\nduring embryogenesis and exerts profound effects on\nreproductive functions, immune responses, cell growth,\nbone formation, tissue remodeling and repair throughout\nadult life [16]. The effects of TGFb in breast cancer are\ncomplex. TGFb is thought to play a dual role in breast\ncancer progression, acting as a tumor suppressor in nor-\nmal and early carcinoma, and as a pro-metastatic factor in\naggressive carcinoma [17]. The growth inhibitory effects of\nTGFb are known to be mediated through transcriptional\nrepression of the c-myc gene [18] and induction of the cell\ncycle inhibitors p15Ink4b (p15) and p21, leading to G1\narrest [19,20]. During tumor progression, however, the\nloss of TGFb growth-inhibitory effects is frequently due to\ndefects in c-myc and p15 regulation by TGFb [18]. Mean-\nwhile, other TGFb responses prevail, unrelated to growth\ninhibition and favoring tumor progression and metastasis\n[21-25]. Indeed, TGFb induces degradation of the ECM,\ninhibits cell adhesion and stimulates cell migration and\ninvasion, thereby promoting tumor metastasis [21-23,25].\nMoreover, during cancer progression, tumor cells secrete\nincreasing quantities of TGFb, which in turn alter the\nstroma environment, leading to stimulation of tumor\nangiogenesis and causing local and systemic immunosup-\npression, thus further contributing to tumor progression\nand metastasis [21-23,25]. Together these studies highlight\nan important role for TGFb in advanced breast cancer.\nHowever, the function for p21 downstream of TGFb has\nnot been described in breast cancer.\nIn this study, we found that high p21 expression corre-\n\nlates with poor survival in breast cancer patients. The\nexpression of p21 is required to promote tumor cell\nmigration and invasion in vitro and local invasion in vivo.\nFurthermore, p21 expression is tightly regulated by\nTGFb/Smad3 signaling in a panel of human basal-like tri-\nple negative breast cancer cell lines. We found p21 to\nphysically interact with Smad3 and the histone acetyl-\ntransferase p/CAF in response to TGFb and identified\n\np21 and p/CAF as key regulators of TGFb-mediated\nbreast cancer cell migration and invasion. We also\nshowed that p21 and p/CAF regulate TGFb transcrip-\ntional activity on multiple tumor-promoting target genes\nby controlling Smad3 acetylation and Smad3 occupancy\non its DNA binding elements. Immunohistochemical\nanalysis of tissue arrays from breast cancer patients\nrevealed a significant correlation between active TGFb/\nSmad3 signaling and high expression levels of both p21\nand p/CAF in lymph node-positive invasive ductal carci-\nnomas. Together, our findings identified p21 and p/CAF\nas critical regulators of cell migration and invasion down-\nstream of TGFb/Smad3 pathway in advanced breast\ncancer.\n\nMethods\nCell culture and transfection\nHuman breast carcinoma MDA-MB231, SCP2 and SCP25\ncells (provided by Dr. Joan Massagué) and HEK293 cells\nwere grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal\nbovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine at 37°C in 5%\nCO2.

The absorbance at 570 nm was mea-\nsured on a plate reader.\n\nCell cycle analysis\nSCP2 cells were stimulated with TGFb for 0, 2, 6 and\n24 hrs. Cells were then fixed with 70% ethanol over-\nnight, treated with 20 μg/ml RNase (Sigma), and stained\nwith 0.5 mg/ml propidium iodide (Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology). DNA content was determined using a FACScan\nflow cytometry analyzer.\n\nKinetic cell migration assay\nCells were transfected with different siRNAs and plated in\nEssen ImageLock 96-well plates (Essen Bioscience, Ann\nArbor, Michigan, USA) at 50,000 cells per well. The use of\nImageLock 96-well plates ensures that images/videos of\nthe wound are automatically taken at the exact same loca-\ntion by the IncuCyte™software (Essen Bioscience). Cells\nwere then serum-starved for six hours and confluent cell\nlayers were scratched using the Essen Wound maker to\ngenerate approximately 800 μm width wounds. After\nwounding, cells were washed two times with PBS and sti-\nmulated in the presence or the absence of 5 ng/ml of\nTGFb. ImageLock 96-well plates were then placed into\nIncuCyte (Essen Bioscience) and imaged every hour for\n24 hrs. The data were analyzed by three integrated metrics:\nwound width, wound confluence or relative wound density\nautomatically measured by the IncuCyte software.\n\nMatrigel invasion assay\nFor the Transwell assays, 30 μl of growth factor reduced\n(GFR) Matrigel (BD Biosciences, diluted 1:3 in pre-chilled\nH2O) was coated onto each insert of 24-Tranwell inva-\nsion plate (8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences) and incu-\nbated for two hours in the cell culture incubator. SCP2\nor SUM159PT (6 × 104 cells/insert) were seeded on\nTranswell Insert coated GFR-Matrigel and cells in the\nupper chamber were stimulated or not with 5 ng/ml\nTGFb for 24 hrs. For SCP2 cells, bottom chambers con-\ntained 10% FBS in DMEM medium. For SUM159PT\n\ncells, bottom chambers were added to F-12 HAM’S med-\nium with 5% FBS. After 24 hrs, cells from the upper\nchamber were removed by cotton swab and cells invaded\nthrough GFR-Matrigel were fixed with 3.7% formalde-\nhyde for 10 minutes and then stained with 0.2% crystal\nviolet for 20 minutes. Images of the invading cells were\nphotographed using an inverted 4× or 10× microscope\nand total cell numbers were counted and quantified by\nImage J software (National Institute of Health, Bethesda,\nMaryland, USA).\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\nCells were grown on coverslips at 50% confluence, stimu-\nlated or not with TGFb overnight. Cells were then fixed\nwith 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 minutes and permeabilized\nin 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 minutes, washed with PBS and\nblocked for 1 hr in 2% BSA. Cells were then incubated\nwith anti-p21 antibody for one hour, washed with PBS and\nincubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor®568\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG (1:800 dilution; Invitrogen) for one\nhour. Stained coverslips were mounted with SlowFade®\n\nGold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen). Confocal\nanalysis was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Axio-\nvert confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Baden-\nWürttemberg, Germany) using 63× objective.\n\nImmunohistochemistry, scoring and statistical analysis\nTissue sections (5 μm) from breast carcinoma microarray\nslides (BCR961 and T088, Biomax) were deparaffinized\nand rehydrated. The patient characteristics are in Table S1\n(Additional file 1). The slides were then placed in 10 mM\ncitrate buffer (pH 6.0) and boiled at 95°C for 15 minutes.\nThe primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry\nstaining were AE1/AE3 (Thermo Scientific), p21 (c-19,\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology), p/CAF (ab12188, Abcam),\nphospho-Smad3 (Cell Signaling). HRP Polymer & DAB\nPlus Chromogen (Thermo Scientific) was used for detec-\ntion of p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3. The slides were\nthen counter stained with hematoxylin (Vector Labora-\ntories, Burlingame, CA, USA) and dehydrated and\nmounted for microscopic examination. All images were\nscanned by ScanScope digital scanners (Aperio, Vista, CA,\nUSA). All samples were reviewed and scored by a patholo-\ngist. The staining for p21, p/CAF and phospho-Smad3 was\nscored from 0 to 4 as follows: 0, no staining; 1, <25%\ntumor cells stained weakly; 2, 25 to 50% tumor cells\nstained moderately; 3, >50% tumor cells stained moder-\nately; 4, >50% tumor cells stained strongly.\nCorrelations between phospho-Smad3, p/CAF and p21\n\nwere examined by the Pearson correlation test using\nSPSS 19 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Associations\nbetween these protein expressions and lymph node status\nwere assessed by Fisher’s exact test. P-value (two-sided)\n<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nDai et al.

The animal study was approved by the ethics\ncommittee and all the experimental animal protocols were\nin accordance with the McGill University Animal Care.\nFollowing the administration of an anesthetic cocktail of\nketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (5 mg/kg) and aceproma-\nzine (1 mg/kg) injected intramuscularly into the mice, par-\nental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were inoculated at 5×\n105 cells per mouse in 100 μl of saline (20% Matrigel) with\na 30-gauge needle into the mammary pad. The tumor size\nwas measured once a week using a caliper. Tumor volume\nwas determined according to the formula: tumor volume\n= shorter diameter2 × longer diameter/2. Sets of mice\n(eight per group) were sacrificed at eight weeks post-injec-\ntion to examine invasiveness of the primary tumor. At the\nend of these studies, mammary tumors with surrounding\nfat pad and tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered for-\nmalin for one day. Sections of mammary tumor were\nembedded in Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (VWR International,\nRadnor, PA, USA) compound and 9 μm thick sections\nwere stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images of the\ntumors were photographed by light microscope using 10×\nand 20× objectives.\nFor intratibia injections, parental and shRNA p21 SCP2\n\ncells (2.0× 106) were injected intramuscularly into the left\ntibia of two group mice (eight per group). The mice were\nmonitored weekly for tumor burden. Digital radiography\nof the hind limbs of all animals was used to monitor the\ndevelopment of skeletal lesions at four, six and eight\nweeks post-injection in a MX-20 cabinet X-ray system\n(Faxitron Bioptics, Tucson, Arizona, USA). On Week 8,\nradiographs of anesthetized mice were taken and the\nosteolytic lesion area was analyzed as previously described\n[30]. The score of lesion area was measured as 0, no\nlesions; 1, minor lesions; 2, small lesions; 3, significant\nlesions with minor break of margins (1% to 10% of bone\nsurface damaged); 4, significant lesions with major break\nin peripheral lesions (>10% of bone surface damaged).\n\nStatistical analyses\nStudent’s t-test was used and differences between\ngroups were considered significant at *P < 0.05.\n\nResults\np21 expression correlates with poor survival in breast\ncancer patients\nPrevious studies have suggested that higher expression\nof cytoplasmic p21 correlated with poor prognosis in\nbreast carcinomas [31-33]. To further explore the corre-\nlation of p21 gene expression level with clinical outcome\n\nin breast cancer patients, we utilized a recently pub-\nlished gene profiling database of breast cancer patients\nto assess p21 gene expression in overall survival (OS)\nand distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) outcomes\n[34]. We analyzed the prognostic value according to the\nmedian, upper and lower quartile expression levels of\np21 in the 20-year follow-up for OS (353 patients) and\nDMFS (761 patients). As shown in Figure 1A-C (left\npanels), elevated p21 expression significantly correlated\nwith poor OS in both median (Hazard Ratio (HR), 1.7;\n1.1 to 2.6; P = 0.012) and upper quartile (HR, 2.1; 1.3 to\n3.2; P = 0.0016), but not in the lower quartile (HR, 1.17;\n0.77 to 1.78; P = 0.47). Furthermore, higher p21 levels\nshowed a similar pattern (HR, 1.3; 0.97 to 1.74; P =\n0.075) in DMFS (Figure 1A-C, right panels). After 20\nyears follow-up, patients who are free of distant metas-\ntasis showed reduced expression of the p21 gene and a\nbetter survival rate. Although the prediction did not\nshow statistically significant results in the median\nexpression, the P-value of the p21 upper quartile (HR,\n1.5; 1.1 to 2.1; P = 0.0099) did reach statistical signifi-\ncance (Figure 1B, right panel). We also analyzed the\nrelationship of p21 expression and clinical outcomes in\nboth estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and negative (ER-\n) breast cancer patients. p21 expression is highest in\npatients with poor prognosis regardless of ER status\n(Additional file 2, Figure S1). Even though one cannot\nrule out that elevated p21 levels could also be found in\nthe stroma rather than the tumor cells themselves, these\ndata demonstrate that high p21 expression correlates\nwith poor clinical outcomes and suggest that elevated\np21 expression may play a role in promoting tumor\nprogression.\n\nSilencing p21 prevents breast tumor local invasion in vivo\nand cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro\nTo investigate the contribution of p21 to tumor formation\nand progression in breast cancer, we used a bone-meta-\nstatic cell line SCP2, a sub-progeny of the human triple\nnegative breast cancer MDA-MB231 (hereafter referred to\nas MDA) cells [35]. We first assessed the effect of suppres-\nsing p21 on tumor growth using a mammary fat pad xeno-\ngraft mouse model. A specific p21 shRNA was stably\ntransfected to generate a pool of p21-deficient SCP2 cells.\nKnockdown of p21 using shRNA efficiently reduced p21\nprotein expression, as compared to parental SCP2 cells\n(Figure 2A). Parental and shRNA p21 SCP2 cells were\northotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of\nfemale Balb/c nude mice (eight mice per group). Tumor\ngrowth was monitored weekly. There was no difference in\nthe rate of primary tumor formation or tumor size\nbetween animals injected with parental or p21-deficient\ncells (Figure 2B), suggesting p21 is not likely involved in\ntumor formation. Next, we evaluated the effect of p21\n\nDai et al.

Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R127\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/R127\n\nPage 7 of 22\n\n\n\ndepletion on tumor invasiveness, a critical step for early\ntumor progression. Intact tumors were taken with the\noverlaying skin and surrounding deep tissues and analyzed\nby a pathologist. Tumor invasiveness was assessed by\ndetermining the extent of infiltration of cancer cells to the\nsurrounding tissue (stroma, fat pad, skin and muscle tis-\nsue), as previously described [36]. As shown in Figure 2C\n(left panels), tumors from the parental SCP2 group dis-\nplayed no clear margin with the surrounding tissues and\nwere deeply invading into nearby structures. In contrast,\ntumors derived from animals transplanted with p21-\ndepleted SCP2 cells formed a well-encapsulated tumor\nmass that did not invade the surrounding tissues (Figure\n2C, right panels), strongly suggesting that p21 plays an\nimportant role in tumor invasion. This was confirmed\nin vitro, as p21 gene silencing in SCP2 cells inhibited\nboth cell migration and invasion (Figure 2D and 2E,\nrespectively).\nAs shown in Figure S2A (Additional file 3), none of the\n\nanimals in which parental or p21-depleted SCP2 cells\n(eight per group) were injected into the mammary fat\npad developed any bone lesions after two months, the\ndate at which mice had to be sacrificed due to the tumor\nsize. This timing may have been insufficient for tumor\ncells to grow into visible distant lesions in the mouse\n[37]. Thus, to investigate whether p21 is involved in the\nlater stage of breast cancer progression, we examined its\ninvolvement in the development of bone osteolytic\nlesions using an intratibia injection model of parental\nand p21-deficient SCP2 cells in female Balb/c nude mice.\nBy by-passing the early steps of metastasis, this experi-\nmental model allows for the assessment of tumor cell\nmetastasis and survival in the bone marrow [38]. As\nshown in Figure S2B, C (Additional file 3), following\nX-ray examination of the bones, both groups of mice\ndeveloped secondary tumors that caused severe osteolytic\nbone lesions, suggesting that p21 does not affect the later\nstages of bone metastasis. Collectively, these results indi-\ncate that while p21 is required for breast cancer cells to\nacquire an invasive phenotype, its effect is restricted to\nthe earlier stages of tumor metastasis, namely induction\nof local cell invasion from the tumor to the surrounding\ntissues.\n\nTGFb induces p21 expression in migratory and invasive\nhuman breast cancer cells\np21 expression is tightly controlled by multiple signaling\npathways [7]. Among these and of particular interest is\nthe TGFb/Smad signaling pathway [15,25,39]. Therefore,\nwe examined the effect of TGFb on the expression levels\nof p21 in several basal-like triple negative human breast\ncancer cell lines. These include the ductal adenocarci-\nnoma MDA and its sub-progenies (SCP2 and SCP25)\n[40], an invasive ductal carcinoma SUM159PT (hereafter\n\nreferred to as SUM159) derived from a patient with ana-\nplastic carcinoma, an inflammatory invasive ductal carci-\nnoma SUM149PT (SUM149), a pleural effusion derived\nSUM229PE (SUM229) and tumor cells derived from\nmetastatic nodule of a patient with infiltrating ductal car-\ncinoma SUM1315MO2 (SUM1315) [41]. As shown in\nFigure 3A, B, with the exception of SUM1315, TGFb\nstrongly induced p21 mRNA and protein levels in these\ncell lines. Interestingly, TGFb showed no regulatory\neffect on the expression levels of other cell cycle regula-\ntory genes, such as c-myc and p15 (Figure 3C), consistent\nwith a loss of the TGFb growth inhibitory responses in\nthese cells (Figure 3C). Although p21 is a cell cycle inhi-\nbitor, the TGFb-induced increases in p21 protein levels\ndid not translate into growth inhibition by TGFb (Addi-\ntional file 4, Figure S3A), nor did it lead to G1 arrest in\nthese breast cancer cells (Figure S3B). We next investi-\ngated the mechanisms by which TGFb regulates p21 pro-\ntein levels. As shown in Figure 3D, the TGFb type I\nreceptor (TbRI) inhibitor SB431542 blocked TGFb-\ninduced p21 protein expression, indicating that TGFb\nregulation of p21 expression is mediated through the\nTGFb receptor signaling cascade. Furthermore, we found\nthis effect to be Smad-dependent and Smad3-specific, as\nTGFb induced both phosphorylation of Smad2 and\nSmad3 (Additional file 4, Figure S3C), but was unable to\ninduce p21 protein levels in MDA cells depleted of\nSmad3 but not of Smad2 (Figure 3E). Collectively, these\ndata indicate that TGFb potently induces p21 expression\nin a Smad3-dependent manner without affecting cell\ngrowth or cell cycle progression in invasive human basal-\ntype breast cancer cells.\n\np21 expression is required for TGFb-mediated cell\nmigration\nTGFb is an important modulator of cell motility in breast\ncancer [25,42]. Thus, we investigated whether p21 could\nact downstream of TGFb to promote cell migration. We\nfirst examined the effect of TGFb on cell migration\ndynamics using the scratch/wound healing assay coupled\nto quantitative time-lapsed imaging (Essen IncuCyte™).\nCell migration was measured by three integrated metrics:\nwound width, wound confluence and relative wound den-\nsity, using the IncuCyte software. As shown in Figure 4A,\nB, TGFb potently induced cell migration in MDA, SCP2\nand SUM149. As a negative control, we also used\nSUM1315 in which TGFb did not regulate p21 expression.\nAs expected, there was no effect of TGFb on cell migra-\ntion in SUM1315 cells (Additional file 5, Figure S4A, B).\nTo then investigate whether p21 is required for TGFb-\n\ninduced cell migration, we knocked down p21 expression\nusing two specific siRNAs in SCP2 cells and assessed the\neffect of TGFb on cell migration dynamics by the\nscratch/wound healing assay.

These results\ndemonstrate that TGFb-mediated migration of human\nbreast cancer cells is dependent on TGFb-induced p21\nexpression.\n\np21 expression is required for TGFb-mediated cell\ninvasion\nTo examine the role of p21 in TGFb-induced tumor cell\ninvasion, SCP2 cells were transiently transfected with a Scr\nsiRNA, a p21 siRNA or a Smad3 siRNA. The invasive\npotential of the cells was assessed using a GFR-Matrigel\nTranswell assay. As shown in Figure 5A, B, in mock and\nScr siRNA transfected breast cancer cells, TGFb signifi-\ncantly promoted cell invasion through the Matrigel and\nthis effect was completely blocked in the absence of p21.\nImportantly, the inhibitory effect of the p21 siRNA on\nTGFb-induced cell invasion was comparable to the effect\nof the Smad3 siRNA. To demonstrate the specificity of the\np21 effect, we performed a rescue experiment. SCP2 cells\nin which endogenous p21 expression was silenced\nwere transfected or not with a flag-tagged p21 cDNA\n(Figure 5C). In this setup, overexpression of the flag-p21\noverrode the siRNA effect and restored p21 protein level\n(Figure 5C) as well as TGFb-induced cell invasion through\nthe GFR-Matrigel barrier (Figure 5D), indicating this effect\nis specifically mediated through p21. To avoid the limita-\ntion of the use of a single cell line, we also assessed the\npro-invasive effect of p21 in SUM159 cells. Overexpressing\nor blocking p21 gene expression in these cells did not\nalter their growth in response to TGFb (Additional file 6,\nFigure S5). Importantly, as shown in Figure 5E, F, we found\nSUM159 to be highly responsive to TGFb-induced cell\ninvasion. However, in the absence of p21 expression, the\nTGFb pro-invasive effect was blocked, while overexpres-\nsion of p21 potentiated this effect, similar to what was\nobserved in SCP2 cells. Our results demonstrate that\nTGFb-mediated migration and invasion of human breast\ncancer cells are dependent on TGFb-induced p21 expres-\nsion. Interestingly, the p21 effects are not limited to TGFb\nsignaling as blocking p21 expression also affected serum\nand EGF-induced cell invasion (Additional file 7, Figure\nS6). These results suggest that p21 plays a broad regulatory\nrole in breast cancer cell invasion and may also explain the\nstrong phenotype observed in vivo, on local tumor cell\ninvasion, following p21 gene silencing (Figure 2C).\n\np21 interacts with Smad3 and modulates TGFb-induced\ntranscriptional activity and downstream genes involved in\ncell invasion\nIt has been previously shown that cytoplasmic p21 regu-\nlates actin cytoskeleton through binding and inhibiting\nROCK1, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of actin-\n\ndepolymerizing protein cofilin and increased cell migra-\ntion in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and HeLa cells [43,44].\nTherefore, we examined the phosphorylation and total\nprotein expression levels of cofilin in breast cancer cells\nin response to TGFb. As shown in Figure S7A (Addi-\ntional file 8), TGFb has no effect on the phosphorylation\nof cofilin. As cytoplasmic p21 contributes to regulate\ncofilin, we then examined the localization of p21 under\nthe stimulation of TGFb. Treatment with TGFb caused\naccumulation of p21 in the nucleus in a time-dependent\nmanner (Figure S7B). This suggests that TGFb-induced\nand p21-driven cell migration and invasion in human\nbreast cancer cells are not mediated through the ROCK/\nLIMK/cofilin pathway. Besides its function as a cell\ncycle regulator, p21 has also been shown to interact\nwith multiple transcription factors [7] to selectively inhi-\nbit or induce expression of sets of genes involved in dis-\ntinct biological functions, such as mitosis, DNA repair,\nsurvival and ECM components [45]. Thus, we investi-\ngated whether p21 could interact with the Smad pro-\nteins to regulate the TGFb pro-invasive effects. Smad/\np21 interactions were analyzed by co-immunoprecipita-\ntion studies in HEK293 and SCP2 cells co-transfected\nwith myc-Smad2, myc-Smad3 and flag-p21. As shown in\nFigure 6A, while we could not detect any ligand-induced\nassociation between Smad2 and p21, we found TGFb to\nclearly induce complex formation between Smad3 and\np21 in the two cell lines. To assess the impact of the\np21/Smad3 interaction on TGFb signaling, we then\nexamined the effect of p21 on TGFb-induced Smad3\nactivity. As shown in Figure 6B, we found that knocking\ndown p21 did not affect TGFb-induced Smad3 phos-\nphorylation. However, using a TGFb/Smad transcrip-\ntional reporter construct (CAGA12-luc), we found that\np21 is required for TGFb-induced Smad transcriptional\nactivity. Indeed, as shown in Figure 6C, p21 gene silen-\ncing abolished TGFb-induced luciferase activity of the\nSmad reporter construct. Conversely, CAGA12-luc\nactivity was markedly potentiated in SCP2 cells overex-\npressing p21 in response to TGFb. These results indi-\ncate that TGFb induces a complex formation between\np21 and Smad3 and that while p21 does not affect the\nearlier stages of Smad3 activation (that is, phosphoryla-\ntion), it is required for TGFb-mediated Smad transcrip-\ntional activity.\nWe next performed gene profiling experiments in par-\nental and p21-deficient SCP2 cells, using transiently\ntransfected p21 siRNA as well as stably transfected p21\nshRNA. Our arbitrary cutoff was set up at a minimum\nof two-fold induction. This led us to identify multiple\np21-dependent TGFb target genes, among which were\nselected those known to be associated with the tumor\nmetastasis process. This shortlist included five candidate\ntarget genes: interleukin 6 (IL6), chemokine (IL8),\n\nDai et al.

D and E, SUM159 and SCP2 cells were treated with or without TGFb for the indicated times. The mRNA levels of\nindicated genes were then analyzed by real-time PCR (error bars indicate SEM; n = 3 independent experiments).\n\nDai et al. Breast Cancer Research 2012, 14:R127\nhttp://breast-cancer-research.com/content/14/5/R127\n\nPage 13 of 22\n\n\n\nprostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), plasmi-\nnogen activator (PLAU) and matrix metalloproteinase\n(MMP9) [46]. To confirm that these genes were TGFb\ndownstream targets, SCP2 and SUM159 cells were sti-\nmulated or not with TGFb and mRNA levels for these\ntarget genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time\nPCR (q-PCR). As shown in Figure 6D, E, TGFb signifi-\ncantly increased the mRNA levels of IL6, IL8, PTGS2,\nPLAU and MMP9 in a time-dependent manner in both\ncell lines.\nTo then address the role of p21 in the transcriptional\n\nregulation of these genes by TGFb, we examined the\neffects of either silencing (using siRNA) or overexpressing\np21 cDNA in SUM159 cells. As shown in Figure 7A,\nknocking down p21 gene expression blocked the TGFb\ntranscriptional regulation of IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9 and\nPTGS2, indicating that p21 is required for TGFb to induce\nexpression of these target genes. The same results were\nobtained in another breast cancer cell line (SCP2; data not\nshown). On the other hand, p21 overexpression in these\ncell lines potentiated the TGFb transcriptional effects on\nthese target genes. As a negative control and to ensure\nspecificity of our results, we also analyzed the effect of\nsilencing p21 on the TGFb-mediated increase in trans-\nforming growth factor beta induced (TGFBI) mRNA.\nTGFb regulated TGFBI mRNA independently of p21\n(Figure 7B).\nTo address the contribution of these identified p21-\n\ndependent TGFb target genes (IL6, IL8, PLAU, MMP9\nand PTGS2) in regulating cell invasion, we silenced their\ngene expression using specific siRNAs. As shown in\nFigure 7C, D, inhibition of all five target genes impaired\nTGFb-induced cell invasion, to a different extent. While\ndepletion of IL6, PLAU and MMP9 drastically antago-\nnized the TGFb response, inhibition of PTGS2 and IL8\nshowed a moderate inhibitory effect. Moreover, examina-\ntion of the siRNA effect on basal cell invasion indicated\nthat IL6 and PLAU did not affect basal invasion, suggest-\ning that they may be specifically required for the TGFb\npro-invasive response. On the other hand, inhibition of\nMMP9, PTGS2 and IL8 clearly affected basal cell invasion\nsuggesting that these target genes have a broader effect\non cell invasion, not limited to the TGFb signaling path-\nway. Together, these results indicate that even though all\nfive genes are important for TGFb signaling leading to\ncell invasion, IL6, PLAU and MMP9 exert more predomi-\nnant roles.\n\np21/p/CAF regulates TGFb transcriptional activity and\nSmad3 DNA binding\np21 has been implicated in the control of gene transcrip-\ntion by associating with various transcription factors [7],\nbut also regulates estrogen receptor-a-dependent gene\nexpression by activating p300-CREBBP-driven (CBP)\n\n[47,48]. Gene transcription downstream of TGFb signal-\ning is also regulated by acetyltransferases, such as p300/\nCBP and p300/CBP-associated factor (p/CAF), a member\nof another HAT family, the so-called GCN5-related N-\nacetyl transferases [49-52]. Thus, we examined whether\np21 could associate with either p300/CBP or p/CAF in\nresponse to TGFb. Interestingly, we found that while\nTGFb did not induce association between p21 and p300/\nCBP, it strongly induced complex formation between p21\nand p/CAF in both SCP2 and SUM159 breast cancer\ncells (Figure 8A, left and right panels).\nA previous report indicated that p/CAF directly binds\n\nto Smad3 [50]. As we have shown that TGFb induces\ncomplex formation between Smad3 and p21 (Figure 6A),\nwe investigated whether endogenous p/CAF is also\nrequired for Smad3 association with p21. For this,\nHEK293 cells were co-transfected with myc-Smad2, myc-\nSmad3 and flag-p21 with or without p/CAF siRNA to\nblock expression of endogenous p/CAF. As shown in\nFigure 8B, TGFb induced complex formation between\np21 and Smad3, independently of Smad2. Interestingly,\ndepletion of p/CAF completely prevented this interac-\ntion, indicating that endogenous p/CAF is required for\nSmad3 interaction with p21.\nTo investigate whether p/CAF is necessary for the regu-\n\nlation of p21-dependent TGFb downstream target genes,\nSUM159 cells were transiently transfected with flag-tagged\np21 in the presence or the absence of two different p/CAF\nsiRNAs. The gene expression of p/CAF (also known as K\n(lysine) acetyltransferase 2B, KAT2B) was measured to\nverify the efficiency of p/CAF knockdown by q-PCR\n(Figure 8C). Overexpression of p21 potentiated induction\nof IL6, IL8 and PTGS2 mRNA by TGFb. However, these\neffects were significantly blocked when p/CAF gene\nexpression was silenced, indicating that p/CAF is required\nfor p21-dependent gene expression of the TGFb targets\n(Figure 8D). The requirement of p/CAF downstream of\nTGFb was further investigated using the Transwell Matri-\ngel assay. As shown in Figure 8E, knocking down p/CAF\ngene expression significantly impaired TGFb-induced cell\ninvasion. Efficiency of the siRNA was verified by Western\nblotting (Figure 8F).\nBecause acetyltransferase p/CAF regulates gene tran-\n\nscription by acetylating histones and transcription factors\n[49], we then assessed whether TGFb could induce global\nchanges in histone acetylation in breast cancer cells. For\nthis, total histone proteins were extracted from SCP2 cells,\ntreated or not with TGFb and subjected to immunoblot-\nting using an acetylated lysine antibody. As shown in Fig-\nure S8 (Additional file 9), TGFb had no effect on global\nhistone acetylation while TSA, a histone deacetylase inhi-\nbitor, showed a marked increase in the acetylation levels.\nThis suggested that the functional relevance of the p/CAF\nrecruitment to the p21/Smad complex may be more\n\nDai et al.

To address this, we examined\nwhether p/CAF could acetylate p21 and/or the Smads.\nInterestingly, we found that p/CAF is capable of interact-\ning with Smad2 and Smad3, leading to an increased acety-\nlation of both Smad proteins (Figure 8G). Moreover, the\nacetylation is specific to Smad2 and Smad3, as p21 did not\nshow any increased acetylation by p/CAF (data not\nshown). Smad3 acetylation has been suggested to be\nrequired for its DNA binding activity [51]. Thus, this led\nus to investigate whether p/CAF could associate with\nDNA-bound Smad3, by DNA immunoprecipitation (DNA\nIP) using biotinylated control and biotinylated Smad bind-\ning element (4× CAGA) DNA probes. As shown in the\nFigure 8H, we found TGFb to specifically induce binding\nof both Smad3 and p/CAF to DNA. Furthermore, we\nfound that gene silencing of p/CAF and p21, using siR-\nNAs, prevented Smad3 binding to the SBE (Figure 8I),\nsuggesting that both p21 and p/CAF are required for\nSmad3 DNA binding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional\nactivity. Having shown that p21 is indeed required for\nSmad3-mediated transcriptional activity (Figure 6C), we\nthen assessed the effect of knocking down p/CAF on\nSmad3 transcriptional activity using the CAGA12-luc\nreporter construct. As shown in Figure 8J, the results\nclearly indicate that p/CAF is required for TGFb-induced\nSmad3 transcriptional activity.\nCollectively, these data indicate that p21 and p/CAF reg-\n\nulate TGFb transcriptional activity by controlling Smad3\noccupancy on its DNA binding elements. TGFb induces a\ncomplex formation between Smad3, p21 and p/CAF,\nfurther leading to Smad3 acetylation by p/CAF. Further-\nmore, both p21 and p/CAF are required for Smad3 DNA\nbinding and Smad3-mediated transcriptional activity,\nhighlighting a novel mechanism by which the p21/p/CAF/\nSmad3 complex contribute to the activation of TGFb tar-\nget gene transcription.\n\nHigh expression of p/CAF/p21/p-Smad3 is associated\nwith lymph node positivity\nLymph node involvement is an important prognostic\nindicator in clinical breast cancer outcomes [53]. High\nexpression of TGFb1 is correlated with a high incidence\nof lymph node metastasis [54]. To examine the associa-\ntion among active TGFb/Smad signaling, p21 and p/\nCAF with lymph node metastasis, we performed immu-\nnohistochemistry to measure the expression levels of\nserine 423/425 phosphorylated Smad3 (pSmad3), p21\nand p/CAF in tissue microarray containing 50 invasive\nductal breast tumors, 25 of which are lymph node posi-\ntive. The immunoreactivity for pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF\nprotein expression in tumor cells was graded and\ndescribed in Methods. We considered a score of 0 to 2\nas a low phosphorylation/expression level and a score of\n\n3 to 4 as a high phosphorylation/expression level. As\nshown in Figure 9A, B, lymph node negative patients\nshowed low levels of pSmad3, p21 and p/CAF expres-\nsions, whereas a significant enrichment of high pSmad3\n(68%), p21 (68%) and p/CAF (80%) was observed in\npatients with positive lymph nodes (P = 0.009, P =\n0.004, and P = 0.001, respectively). To distinguish\nbetween tumor cells and stroma, we used a cytokeratin\nantibody (AE1/AE3), a cell marker specific to neoplastic\ncells of epithelial origin. As shown in Figure S9 (Addi-\ntional file 10), p21 is specifically expressed at a higher\nlevel in breast tumor cells but not in stroma cells. We\nalso examined the relationships between pSmad3 levels\nand p/CAF protein expression with p21 protein levels,\nusing the Pearson’s correlation test. As shown in Figure\n9C, our results clearly indicate that high levels of phos-\nphorylated Smad3 and p/CAF expression significantly\ncorrelate with high p21 protein expression. Collectively,\nthese data indicate that active TGFb/Smad3 signaling is\nassociated with high p21 and p/CAF protein expression\nlevels and significantly correlates with lymph node\nmetastasis in breast cancer.\n\nDiscussion\nWhile p21 was initially characterized as an important cell\ncycle inhibitor, recent studies suggest that cytoplasmic\np21 has anti-apoptotic and actin cytoskeleton regulatory\nfunctions [27,43,55]. The accumulation of cytoplasmic\np21 is associated with Ras and HER2/neu activated\ntumorigenic transformation [32,44]. Moreover, overex-\npression of p21 is associated with poor prognosis of\nmany types of cancer. However, the function of p21 in\nbreast cancer has not been established. In our study, we\nassessed p21 levels with clinical outcomes in breast can-\ncer patients. High p21 expression correlates with poor\noverall survival and distant metastasis free survival.\nFurthermore, using an in vivo model of mammary fat pad\ntransplantation of metastatic human breast cancer cells\nin mice, we showed that while silencing p21 gene expres-\nsion did not affect the primary tumor formation, it\npotently prevented primary tumor cells to invade into\nsurrounding tissues. Together, our results provide evi-\ndence of a tumor-promoting role for p21 in primary\ntumor local invasion.\nPrevious studies have indicated that during breast can-\n\ncer progression, TGFb cytostatic responses are lost while\npro-migratory and pro-invasive effects are maintained\n[56]. Here, we found that all invasive breast cancer cell\nlines tested were resistant to growth inhibition by TGFb\nand that while TGFb did not induce any change in p15\nor c-myc expression levels, it strongly up-regulated p21\nexpression arguing that in advanced breast cancer p21\nfunctions independently of cell cycle regulation. This is\nin contrast to the effect observed in human immortalized\n\nDai et al.

This is interesting in light of previous reports\nindicating that overexpression of a dominant negative\nform of Smad3 reduced the ability of cancer cells to\nmetastasize [57] and that Smad3, but not Smad2, pro-\nmotes breast cancer metastasis in mice [58]. Further-\nmore, while Smad2 mutations in cancer have been\ndescribed, no mutations in Smad3 or p21 have yet\nbeen reported. Together these data suggest that in\nbreast cancer Smad3 pro-invasive functions are\nmediated by p21 and that targeting p21 may prove\nuseful to improve the clinical course of metastatic\npatients.\nTumor cell migration and invasion are critical initiation\n\nsteps in the process of breast cancer metastasis. It has\nbeen suggested that cytoplasmic p21 regulates ROCK/\nLIMK/cofilin pathway to promote cell migration; how-\never, we found that TGFb had no effect on regulating\ncofilin activity in breast cancer cells. In our studies, we\nidentified a novel role for p21 in the transcriptional regu-\nlation of TGFb/Smad3 signaling through the interaction\nof p21 and Smad3 in invasive breast cancer cells. The\ninteraction between p21 and Smad3 was p/CAF-depen-\ndent, but whether this interaction is direct will require\nfurther investigation. Furthermore, the effects of p21 on\ncell migration and invasion are mediated through inter-\nactions with Smad3 and p/CAF, which in turn modulate\nSmad3 acetylation, DNA binding and transcriptional\nactivity, as well as gene transcription of several TGFb\npro-invasive downstream target genes. It will be interest-\ning to further investigate whether p21 is selective for the\npro-oncogenic activity of TGFb or whether it is also\nrequired for the transcriptional regulation of other types\nof TGFb responses and target genes. Taken together, our\nresults demonstrate that p21 is both a direct transcrip-\ntional target of TGFb and a co-stimulatory factor of\nSmad3 in regulation of pro-invasive genes in breast can-\ncer cells (Figure 10).\nFinally, we investigated the clinical relevance of TGFb-\n\nmediated p21/p/CAF pathway in breast cancer. The\nprognosis of breast carcinomas is related to various clini-\ncal and pathological parameters. Axillary lymph node\nmetastasis is one of the most important prognostic para-\nmeters in the absence of distant metastasis. There is a\nsharp difference in survival rate between patients with\npositive and negative lymph nodes. In our studies, we\nfound a significant association of active TGFb/Smad3 sig-\nnaling, p21 and p/CAF expression with lymph node posi-\ntivity, making them potential useful prognosis markers\nfor lymph node metastasis.\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, we described a pro-invasive function for the\ncell cycle regulator p21 in human breast cancer. High\nexpression of p21 positively correlated with poor overall\nand distant metastasis-free survival outcomes in breast\ncancer patients. We identified p21 as a novel downstream\nregulator of TGFb-mediated breast cancer cell migration\nand invasion. We found p21 to interact with Smad3 and\nthe acetyltransferase p/CAF and to regulate the Smad\ntranscriptional activity, as well as gene transcription of sev-\neral TGFb-induced pro-metastatic genes. These results\nhighlight an important role for p21/p/CAF in TGFb-\ninduced breast cancer cell migration and invasion at the\ntranscriptional level.\n\nAdditional material\n\nAdditional file 1: Table S1: Patient characteristics from breast\ncarcinoma microarray tissue sections.
