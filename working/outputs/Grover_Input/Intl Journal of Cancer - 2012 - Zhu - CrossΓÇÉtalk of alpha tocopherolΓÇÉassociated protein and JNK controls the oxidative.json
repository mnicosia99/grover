However, the\n\nsignal pathways that can augment the proapoptotic function of ROS remain largely unknown. We previously identified a tumor\n\nsuppressor, alpha-tocopherol-associated protein (TAP), yet little is known regarding the role of TAP in the apoptotic signaling\n\nin prostate cancer. Interestingly, we recently found that exposure of prostate cancer cells to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)\n\nresulted in induced apoptosis as well as increased expression of TAP. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated silencing of\n\nendogenous TAP expression conferred effective protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis. Further mechanistic study showed\n\nexposure of prostate cancer cells to H2O2 resulted in increased phosphorylation of both JNK and c-Jun, and TAP siRNA\n\neffectively decreased H2O2-induced JNK and c-Jun phosphorylation. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that JNK\n\nphysically associates with TAP. Furthermore, signaling downstream of JNK to the AP-1 complex and BH-3-only subfamily were\n\nfound to be regulated on changing the TAP expression status. TAP could also promote the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis\n\neffect of docetaxel. In the mice xenograft model, H2O2 treatment induced TAP expression, JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis\n\nof prostate cancer. Recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2)-TAP injection significantly sensitizes this H2O2 proapoptotic\n\neffect. Together, we have identified a novel functional mechanism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in oxidative\n\nstress-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Disrupting the redox balance of cancer cells by this signaling may enable\n\ntherapeutic selectivity and provide benefit to overcome the drug resistance of prostate cancer.\n\nIntroduction\nReactive oxygen species (ROS), which include oxygen ions,\nfree radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), are produced as\n\nnatural by-products during normal cellular metabolism and\nxenobiotic exposure.1,2 ROS function as double-edged swords\nin the cells.

Recently, we\nfound that exposure of prostate cancer cells to H2O2 resulted in\napoptosis as well as increased expression of TAP. TAP is widely\nexpressed, with its highest expression in the organs of liver, brain\nand prostate.10 We had found that it exerts an antiproliferative\neffect via inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt\npathway.11 Neuzil et al.12 recently found that TAP-accelerated ap-\noptosis in mesothelioma cells. Although TAP can bind vitamin E,\nsome studies have suggested that TAP has functions that are not\ndependent of vitamin E binding.11,13 The exact role that TAP plays\nin oxidative stress-induced apoptotic signaling remains unknown.\n\nIn this study, we showed that TAP plays a critical role to\nmodulate oxidative stress-induced apoptotic in prostate can-\ncer cells both in vitro and in vivo.\n\nROS can induce apoptosis via the mitochondrial death\npathways and other transcriptional pathways.14,15 JNK, an im-\nportant member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase fam-\nily, has been shown to mediate apoptosis in response to cellu-\nlar stress.16–19 Activated JNK can phosphorylate c-jun and\nthereby induce the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member death pro-\ntein 5/harakiri upregulation.20,21 Upregulation of Bim and\nPuma contributes to c-Jun/c-fos-mediated cell apoptosis.19,21\n\nIn this study, we found that exposure of prostate cancer cells\nto H2O2 resulted in increased phosphorylation of both JNK\nand c-Jun, and TAP small interfering RNA (siRNA) effectively\ndecreased these effects, indicating that JNK activation was\nrequired for TAP-mediated apoptosis on H2O2 treatment.\n\nDocetaxel has recently been shown to have significant sur-\nvival benefit for hormone refractory prostate cancer. Tradi-\ntionally, the mechanism of this agent is thought to involve\nthe hyperstabilization of microtubules and inhibition of mito-\nsis cytoskeletal restructuring. Recently, metabolic oxidative\nstress has also been suggested to play a role in the antitumor\neffects of docetaxel.18 Treatment of docetaxel could increase\nthe production of hydroperoxides and cause oxidative stress\nin many human cancer cells. In this study, we also demon-\nstrated that TAP was able to promote the oxidative stress-\ninduced apoptosis effect of docetaxel.\n\nIn summary, we have identified a novel functional mecha-\nnism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in ROS/\nH2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. The new\nfunction of TAP promoting ROS or doxetaxel-induced apopto-\nsis could be exploited as a valuable approach for the treatment\nof prostate cancer. Disrupting the redox balance of cancer cells\nby this signaling may enable therapeutic selectivity and provide\nbenefit to overcome the drug resistance of prostate cancer.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nCell culture and reagents\n\nLNCaP and PC-3 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 supple-\nmented with 10% fetal bovine serum plus 1% penicillin/strep-\ntomycin antibiotics and were maintained at 37�C in a\nhumidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\n\n22 H2O2,\nSP600125, docetexel, glutathione (GSH) and N-acetyl-L-cyste-\nine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,\nMO). Donkey polyclonal anti-human TAP, bim, puma and\nGAPDH antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Bio-\ntechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibod-\nies specific for total and phosphorylated JNK and c-jun were\npurchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA).\nRabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for phosphorylated\np-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Fos were\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich.\n\nRecombinant adeno-associated virus 2 preparation\n\nThe coding sequence of TAP-enhanced green fluorescent\nprotein (EGFP) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction\n(PCR) from the pEGFP-N3-TAP plasmid, which was con-\nstructed from pEGFP-N3 (Clontech, Palo Alto) by inserting\nfull-length TAP isolated from the cDNA of benign prostate\nhyperplasia tissue. The primers were: 50-GCCGAATTCAT-\nGAGCGGCAGAGTC-30 (forward) and 50-GCCGCTAGCT-\nTACTTGTACAGCTCGTCCA-30 (reverse). After purification,\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nAlpha-tocopherol associated protein (TAP) is a vitamin E-binding factor downregulated in several cancers. Here, the authors\n\nshow that TAP potently promotes hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)/ROS-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells, both in vitro and\n\nin vivo. Signaling downstream of JNK to the AP-1 complex was found to be involved. The authors speculate that reintroduction\n\nof TAP may be beneficial to overcome drug resistance in prostate cancer.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nZhu et al. 2271\n\nInt. J. Cancer: 132, 2270–2282 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nthe gene fragment was digested with EcoRI and NheI\n(Takara, Tokyo, Japan). The recombinant adeno-associated\nvirus 2 (rAAV2) packaging plasmid pSNAV2.0 was obtained\nby the simultaneous digestion of plasmid pSNAV2.0-LacZa\n(AGTC, Co., Ltd.) with EcoRI and NheI, followed by ligation\nusing T4 DNA ligase (Takara). The resultant plasmid,\npSNAV-TAP-EGFP, was used to transform competent cells,\nand positive colonies were screened by PCR using the pri-\nmers shown above, followed by sequence analysis to identify\nthe correct recombinant clones. 293T cells were transfected\nwith the purified pSNAV-TAP-EGFP plasmid, and viruses\nwere isolated by PEG8000/NaCl precipitation and chloroform\nextraction for purification. The purity was examined using\nsodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis\n(SDS–PAGE), and the titer was determined by dot blot using\na radioactive probe specific for the rAAV2 transgene.\n\nrAAV2 viral infection\n\nSubconfluent LNCaP or PC-3 cells were infected with par-\nticles (2 � 1011 vector genomes) of rAAV2 encoding the\nEGFP-TAP sequence (rAAV2-TAP) or control viral particles.\nThe infection efficiency was determined by the percentage of\ncells expressing the viral-derived EGFP under a fluorescence\nmicroscope.\n\nLuciferase assay\n\nThe AP-1-Luc construct (an artificial reporter containing\nseven AP-1 agonist 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate re-\nsponsive element sites) was purchased from Stratagene (Kirk-\nland, WA). The c-Jun-DN and a-Fos constructs were kind\ngifts from Mingtao Li, Ph.D. (Sun Yat-sen University,\nGuangzhou, China).\n\nLNCaP or PC-3 cells (1 � 105) were plated in each well\nof 24-well dishes with 500 ml of regular growth medium at\nthe day before transfection. The medium was replaced with\nserum-free growth medium on the day of the transfection,\nwhich was performed by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitro-\ngen, Carlsbad, CA) with a mixture containing 500 ng of AP-\n1-Luc plasmid and 1 ng of Renilla luciferase expression vec-\ntor (pRL-TK). After a 4 hr incubation, the transfection mix-\ntures were removed and 500 ml of normal growth medium\nwas added to each well. Then, the cells were incubated for an\nadditional 18 hr. The luciferase activity of each well was\nmeasured using the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega, Madison,\nWI) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nsiRNA transfection\n\nTAP siRNA duplex oligonucleotides were purchased from\nAmbion (Lafayette, CO). The targeted sequences were 50-\nCCAAUUGUCCCAACCAUUUU-30 and 50-CAACGAGGC-\nCAUUGACUUCUU-30. The transfection was done according\nto the product’s instruction. Briefly, PC-3 and LNCaP cells\nwere plated at 4 � 105 per well in six-well plates. On the\nnext day, cells were transfected with TAP siRNA or negative\n\ncontrol (NC) oligonucleotides using SIPORT (Ambion, Aus-\ntin, TX).\n\nRNA extraction, RT-PCR and western blot assay\n\nThe total cellular RNA was extracted from cultured cells\nusing Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). To assess\nmRNA expression, RT-PCR was carried out with the RET-\nROscriptV\n\nR\nkit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The primers for the\n\nTAP gene were: 50-CCAGGCAGAAGGAGGCATTG-30 (for-\nward) and 50-TCGGAGCCAACGCAGGAG-30 (reverse). The\nwestern blot analyses were performed as described in our\nprevious study.11 The xenograft tumors were snap-frozen and\nstored at �80�C before processing. The proteins were\nextracted from cultured cells and xenograft tumors, and equal\namounts of proteins were subjected to SDS–PAGE. The pro-\nteins bound to nitrocellulose membranes were incubated\novernight at 4�C with primary antibodies and then incubated\nwith secondary peroxidase-linked whole antibodies (Amer-\nsham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). The proteins were\ndetected with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL-plus,\nAmersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) followed by\nautoradiography. GAPDH served as the loading control.\n\nImmunoprecipitation and immunoblotting\n\nCell lysates were prepared from mock-infected or rAAV2-\nTAP-infected cells and subsequently incubated with protein\nA/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 hr at 4�C,\ncentrifuged, washed five times with lysis buffer and separated\nby SDS–PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel. The SDS–\nPAGE was followed by immunoblot analyses using anti-TAP\n(1:200) or anti-JNK (1:1,000) antibodies.\n\nAssessment of intracellular ROS\n\nThe levels of ROS induced by H2O2 or docetaxel in LNCaP\nand PC-3 cells were measured using 2,7-dichlorodihydro-\nuorescindiacetate (DCFH-DA) as a fluorescence probe. Cells\nwere washed with PBS twice and incubated with DCFH-DA\n(10 mmol/L) for 30 min at 37�C. Then the cells were washed\nthree times with PBS. The photos of DCF-DA fluorescence\nwere immediately recorded and quantified. The intensity of\nDCF fluorescence was also detected by flow cytometry, with\nexcitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 530 nm.\n\nApoptosis analysis\n\nApoptosis was evaluated by annexin V and 7-AAD binding\nassay using the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD\nBiosciences, San Jose, CA) according to the manufacturer’s\ninstructions. At least 1 � 106 cells in each sample were ana-\nlyzed. Control cells stained with annexin V-PE or 7-AAD\nalone were used as NCs for the flow cytometric analysis.\n\nTumor formation in nude mice and rAAV2-TAP injection\n\nA xenograft tumor model was established as described in our\nprevious study.11,22 Briefly, the flanks of 4-week-old male\nnude mice were injected subcutaneously under anesthesia\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n2272 TAP promotes oxidative apoptosis in prostate cancer\n\nInt.

Tumor growth was\nmonitored regularly, and the volumes were calculated using\nthe formula length � width2 � 0.5. The tumor tissues were\nharvested for further analysis. All of the mice were main-\ntained and handled in accordance with the institutional\nguidelines and a protocol approved by the Sun Yat-sen Uni-\nversity (Guangzhou, China).\n\nImmunohistochemistry analysis\n\nImmunohistochemistry analyses were performed as previ-\nously described.11,22 The isolated mice xenograft tumors were\nfixed in 10% buffered formalin and then dehydrated in a\ngraded series of ethanol. The tissues were embedded in paraf-\nfin and then cut into 5-mm-thick sections. The deparaffinized\nsections were incubated with TAP (1:600), JNK (1:1,000) or\nphospho-JNK (1:1,000) primary antibodies at room tempera-\nture for 1 hr. After washing in PBS, the sections were incu-\nbated with secondary antibody and ABC solution followed by\n3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining (DAKO, Carpinteria,\nCA) and counterstaining with Mayer’s hematoxylin.\n\nTUNEL assay\n\nA terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP\nnick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was used to detect apopto-\nsis of prostate cancer xenografts. The assay was performed\nusing the in situ Cell Death Detection Kit (POD; Roche, In-\ndianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nThe prostate cancer sections were incubated with DAB sub-\nstrate solution followed by counterstaining with hematoxylin\nfor 5 min, dehydration and mounting before observation\nunder a light microscope.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStudent’s t-tests performed by SPSS software were used to\nanalyze the significance of the differences between the treat-\nment and control groups. The data are presented as the\nmeans 6 SE. P values less than 0.05 were considered to be\nstatistically significant.\n\nResults\nTAP is involved in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis\n\nin prostate cancer cells\n\nExposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to H2O2 resulted in dose-\nand time-dependent upregulation of TAP mRNA and protein\nlevels compared with the control. Moreover, the inductions of\nboth TAP mRNA and protein were blocked by NAC and\nGSH, the scavengers of intracellular ROS, confirming that\nTAP was indeed induced by oxidative stimulation (Figs 1a–c).\n\nThe prostate cancer cells were transfected with TAP\nsiRNA or NC and were subjected to western blot and apo-\nptosis analysis. As shown in Figure 1 d1, the upregulation of\nTAP induced by H2O2 was significantly abolished by TAP\nsiRNA compared to the control. This finding verified the effi-\ncacy and specificity of the TAP siRNA.\n\nAs shown in Figures 1 d2 and 1 d3, compared with the\nNC, TAP siRNA conferred the effective protection from\nH2O2-induced apoptosis (6.9 vs. 18.9% in PC-3 cells, p <\n0.05; 9.8 vs. 26.3% in LNCaP cells, p < 0.05). Moreover,\nthere was no significant difference in the levels of apoptosis\namong the three groups in the absence of H2O2 treatment,\nsuggesting that H2O2-mediated oxidative stress is required\nfor TAP-promoted apoptosis. This is consistent with our pre-\nvious finding that TAP alone cannot induce apoptosis.11 To-\ngether, these results indicate that TAP plays a critical role in\nthe apoptosis of prostate cancer cells initiated by oxidative\nstress.\n\nTo further study TAP function, we constructed a recombi-\nnant AAV2 vector encoding the EGFP-TAP sequence\n(rAAV2-TAP). PC-3 and LNCaP cells were infected with vi-\nral particles for 72 hr, and EGFP expression detected by fluo-\nrescence microscopy showed that the rate of infection was\nhigher than 80% (data not shown).\n\nThe PC-3 and LNCaP cells were infected with rAAV2-\nTAP. After 72 hr, the cultures were stimulated with 200 mM\nH2O2 for 2 hr, and then were subjected to quantification of\napoptosis. As shown in Figure 1e, there was no significant\ndifference among the three groups in the absence of H2O2\ntreatment. However, when H2O2 was added, overexpression\nof TAP significantly promoted apoptosis compared with the\nrAAV2-vector control. There was no significant effect caused\nby the rAAV2-TAP infection technique on the viability of\nthe cells (as revealed by infection with the rAAV2-vector\ncontrol, Fig. 1e).\n\nUnder H2O2 stimulation, silence or upregulate, the expres-\nsion of TAP had no significant effect on the ROS levels in\nboth LNCaP and PC-3 cells (Fig. 1f1, f2).\n\nTaken together, our data demonstrate that TAP acceler-\nates apoptosis of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in response to oxida-\ntive stress.\n\nActivation of JNK is required for the TAP-accelerated\n\napoptosis signaling\n\nIt is widely known that JNK is a key mediator of ROS-\ninduced apoptosis in many cell types.18,23 Therefore, we\naimed to investigate whether JNK activation was required in\nthis process. As shown in Figure 2a, in PC-3 and LNCaP\ncells, H2O2 treatment activated JNK in a time-dependent\nmanner; the changes in the levels of c-Jun and phospho-c-\nJun were paralleled to the phosphorylated levels of JNK,\nwhich is consistent with previous studies.24\n\nAs shown in Figure 2b, treatment of H2O2 resulted in an\nincreased level of TAP and phospho-JNK in PC-3 and\nLNCaP cells, while scavenging of intracellular ROS by NAC\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nZhu et al. 2273\n\nInt.

Conversely, overexpression of TAP robustly increased\nphospho-JNK and phospho-c-jun; however, there were no de-\ntectable changes in the absence of H2O2 treatment (Fig. 2d).\n\nSP600125, a specific inhibitor of JNK,25 was also used to\ncharacterize the relationship between TAP and JNK.\nSP600125 effectively inhibited JNK activation, as demon-\nstrated by the significant decrease in phosphorylation levels\nof both JNK and c-jun; however, this inhibitor had no effect\non TAP (data not shown). As shown in Figure 2e, results of\nflow cytometric analysis showed that SP600125 effectively\nreversed the TAP-dependent induction of apoptosis (31.6 vs.\n10.1% in PC-3 cells, p < 0.05; 37.9 vs. 12.4% in LNCaP cells,\np < 0.05).\n\nTAP physically interacts with JNK\n\nThe above results demonstrate that TAP manipulates the\nactivation of JNK and that JNK modulates the TAP proapop-\ntotic effects. To explore the possibility that TAP may regulate\nJNK activation, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were\nperformed.\n\nAs shown in Figure 3a, under normal condition (without\nH2O2 treatment), TAP and JNK had no direct interaction.\nHowever, when the cells were treated with H2O2, there had\nprominent interaction between TAP and JNK (Fig. 3b). These\ndata indicate that under oxidative stress condition, JNK inter-\nacts with TAP in prostate cancer cells.\n\nThe AP-1 complex contributes to TAP-mediated oxidative\n\nstress-induced apoptotic signaling\n\nUnder oxidative stress condition, cellular c-Jun and c-fos usu-\nally form stable homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes\nwhich are important downstream effectors of JNK signaling.16\n\nAP-1 is involved in many different important cellular proc-\nesses, including proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. As\nc-Fos is an important dimerization partner of c-Jun, we exam-\nined whether it was involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis.\n\nAs shown in Figure 4a, western blotting confirmed that c-\nFos expression was rapidly induced by H2O2, the upregula-\ntion of c-Fos induced by H2O2 was significantly abolished by\nTAP siRNA, which is in agreement with previous studies.17\n\nc-Fos induced by H2O2 was also sensitive to treatment with\nPD95059 and UO126, two structurally distinct MEK inhibi-\ntors that block the MEK-ERK1/2 pathway.\n\nNext, we evaluated whether H2O2-dependent induction of\nc-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation and c-Fos expression leads\nto the transactivation of AP-1. We tested the ability of H2O2\nto activate the AP-1-responsive collagenase promoter fused to\na luciferase reporter gene (AP-1-Luc). As in Figure 4c, H2O2\ntreatment increased luciferase activity compared with the\ncontrol. H2O2-induced AP-1-Luc transactivation was sensitive\nto treatment with either SP600125 or UO126. Moreover, the\naddition of c-Jun–DN (a dominant negative mutant that\nlacks the transactivation domain and can compete with en-\ndogenous c-Jun for binding to c-Fos) or addition of the trun-\ncated form of c-Fos (a-Fos) resulted in an significant inhibi-\ntion of the transactivation of the AP-1 promoter. The effect\nof TAP on AP-1 transactivation was also evaluated. As\nshown in Figure 4d, TAP siRNA partially attenuated the ac-\ntivity of the AP-1 promoter. Overall, these findings suggest\nthat both TAP- and JNK-specific activation of c-Jun and c-\nFos expression contribute to AP-1 activation by H2O2.\n\nWe next examined whether c-Jun/c-Fos heterodimeriza-\ntion is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by flow cyto-\nmetric assays. As shown in Figure 4e, overexpression of c-\nJun-DN significantly protected PC-3 and LNCaP cells from\napoptosis. This protection from H2O2-induced apoptosis in\nprostate cancer cells may be attributable to the disruption of\nc-Jun/c-Fos heterodimers. If this is true, the blockage of c-\nFos should confer the similar protection against apoptosis in\nthe cells. Indeed, expression of a-Fos in PC-3 and LNCaP\ncells attenuated the apoptosis in comparison to the vector\ncontrol (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, when TAP was depleted by\nTAP siRNA, this effect was partially attenuated (Fig. 4e). To-\ngether, these findings suggest that TAP contributes to the c-\n\nFigure 3.

The JNK/c-Jun pathway has been shown\nto regulate the release of cytochrome c from the mitochon-\ndria. Bim and Puma are two members of the proapoptotic\nBH3-only subfamily of Bcl-2 proteins.21 Upregulation of Bim\nand Puma contributes to c-Jun/c-fos-mediated apoptosis.19\n\nAs shown in Figure 4f, the expression of Bim and Puma\ncould be induced by H2O2, whereas both c-Jun–DN and\na-Fos prevented H2O2-induced Bim and Puma upregulation.\nWhen TAP was depleted by TAP siRNA, the above effect\nwas partially attenuated, indicating that TAP is involved in\nthe upregulation of members of the AP-1 complex-mediated\nBH3-only subfamily (Bim and Puma) in the signaling of\nH2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells.\n\nTAP enhances the docetaxel-induced apoptosis in prostate\n\ncancer cells\n\nDocetaxel and paclitaxel had been found to kill cancer cells\npartially by inducing intracellular ROS.18 As shown in Fig-\nures 5a and 5b, exposure of LNCaP and PC-3 cells to doce-\ntaxel had elicited significant increase of intracellular ROS\nlevel. The addition of NAC or GSH could reverse the\nincreased ROS levels induced by docetaxel.\n\nThen the effect of TAP on the oxidative stress-induced\napoptosis induced by docetaxel was studied. LNCaP and PC-\n3 cells were infected with the rAAV2-TAP virus or with the\nvector control virus. Seventy-two hours later, the cultures\nwere treated with 0.5 nM docetaxel for 48 hr and then were\nsubjected to quantification of apoptosis. As shown in Figure\n5c, overexpression of TAP significantly promoted apoptosis\ninduced by docetaxel compared with the vector control. The\naddition of NAC following the treatment of docetaxel led to\na reduction of apoptosis induced by docetaxel even when the\nrAAV2-TAP virus was infected.\n\nThese results suggested that TAP could enhance doce-\ntaxel-induced oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in prostate\ncancer cells.\n\nTAP enhances H2O2-mediated suppression of tumor growth\n\nin vivo\n\nHaving demonstrated that TAP was able to sensitize the cul-\ntured prostate cancer cells to apoptosis induced by H2O2 in\nvitro, we next detected the effect of rAAV2-TAP virus in the\nxenografts of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in nude mice. Compared\nwith the control group, H2O2 treatment significantly decreased\nthe tumor size of the xenografts (Fig. 6a). Pretreatment with\nrAAV2-TAP virus further suppressed the tumor growth com-\npared with the control virus. Consistent with the growth\ncurves, the tumor weight was also significantly reduced by\nrAAV2-TAP combined with H2O2 compared with H2O2 treat-\nment alone.\n\nImmunohistochemical analyses revealed that TAP was\nhighly expressed in the rAAV2-TAP group, confirming that\ntreatment with rAAV2-TAP was effective in the nude mice.\nMoreover, TUNEL staining revealed that rate of apoptosis\nwas higher in the mice treated with the combination of\nrAAV2-TAP and H2O2 compared with the treatment of\nH2O2 alone. This is in accordance with the reduced tumor\ngrowth rate, as well as the reduced tumor weight. The immu-\nnohistochemical staining results of p-JNK, JNK and c-JUN in\nthe xenograft sections had confirmed the molecular signaling\nof TAP in the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6b).\nTaken together, these data indicated that TAP sensitizes pros-\ntate cancer xenograft to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we had identified a new signal pathway that\ncould augment the ROS-mediated apoptosis in prostate cancer\ncells. TAP was shown to have proapoptotic function under\nconditions of oxidative stress. JNK may function as a key\ndownstream of TAP and modulate its proapoptotic effects.\n\nThe crystal structure of TAP suggests that it contains an\nNH2-terminal CRAL-TRAL domain with a small lipid\nligand-binding cavity and a COOH-terminal GOLD domain\nthat is involved in protein–protein interactions.10,26 A previ-\nous study showed that TAP/supernatant protein factor binds\nto alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and improves vitamin E\nuptake, thus enhancing vitamin E function.11 A deficiency in\nTAP has been linked to several cancers, including breast and\nprostate cancer.11,23,27 We previously found that the expres-\nsion of TAP is significantly downregulated in prostate cancer,\nwhich is associated with tumor cell proliferation, as well as\nwith an increased risk of cancer recurrence.23,24 Overexpres-\nsion of TAP inhibits prostate cancer growth in the absence of\nvitamin E both in vitro and in vivo through suppression of\nthe PI3K/AKT pathway.11 However, the role of TAP in the\napoptosis signaling remains largely unknown. In our previous\nstudy, we showed that TAP alone did not induce prostate\ncancer cell apoptosis.11 Neuzil et al.12 recently showed that\nTAP accelerates alpha-tocopheryl succinate-induced apoptosis\nin mesothelioma cells. Because alpha-tocopheryl succinate is\nassociated with accumulated intracellular ROS,25 their study\nsuggested a correlation between TAP and oxidative stress-\ninduced apoptosis. Until now, no clear evidence has sup-\nported an association between TAP and apoptosis induced by\noxidative stress. Here, we report for the first time that TAP is\nupregulated during H2O2-induced apoptosis, overexpression\nof TAP sensitizes both LNCaP and PC-3 cells to the apopto-\nsis induced by oxidative stress. This partially explains why\nTAP expression is lower in prostate cancer cells compared\nwith benign prostate cells. The decreased expression of TAP\nmay represent an intrinsic escape mechanism of tumor cells.\nIndeed, the ROS levels are higher in prostate cancer cells\ncompared with benign prostate cells, and high ROS levels are\nconsidered to be an inherent requirement of an aggressive\nphenotype.5\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n2278 TAP promotes oxidative apoptosis in prostate cancer\n\nInt.

J. Cancer: 132, 2270–2282 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nNumerous pieces of evidence indicated that JNK signaling\ncascade is a crucial player during ROS-mediated apopto-\nsis,16,17 despite the contradictory notion that JNK is required\nfor cell survival and proliferation.16,17 In the present study,\nwe found that JNK activation is required for TAP-mediated\napoptosis upon H2O2 treatment. Although H2O2 treatment\nalone is enough to evoke JNK activation, we found that the\nmodulation of TAP expression by TAP siRNA or rAAV2-\nTAP could decrease or further increase JNK activation,\nrespectively, and that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 reverses\nthe proapoptotic effect of TAP, suggesting that JNK functions\nas a downstream target of TAP.\n\nAs a protein kinase, modulation of JNK activity occurs\nmainly through its phosphorylation. Because TAP is not a\nprotein kinase, it is impossible for TAP to regulate JNK via\ndirect phosphorylation. Given the structural characteristics of\nTAP,26 we hypothesize that TAP might interact with JNK\nand protect phospho-JNK from dephosphorylation by phos-\nphatases or facilitate JNK phosphorylation by upstream ki-\nnases. Indeed, the intracellular phosphorylation and dephos-\nphorylation components coexist with apoptotic stimuli, and\ntheir balance decides the phosphorylation level of a protein.\nIn this study, we found TAP physically interacts with JNK\n(Fig.). However, more conclusive evidence is needed to\nexclude the possibility that TAP and JNK operate in two par-\nallel signaling pathways and to support the hypothesis that\nTAP protects JNK from dephosphorylation.\n\nROS are produced by all aerobic cells and act as second\nmessengers in cellular signaling. It is widely accepted that\nROS play vital roles in cell proliferation, apoptosis and necro-\nsis, depending on their concentrations.2,28 Traditionally, over-\nproduction of ROS and aberrant redox balance are consid-\nered to be the underlying causes of the pathogenesis of many\ndiseases, including cancer.5,29,30 Mounting evidences sug-\ngested that compared with their normal counterparts, many\ntypes of cancer cells have increased levels of ROS. In the\nprostate gland, ROS are considered to be oncogenic and are\nrequired for the development and progression of cancer.5\n\nHowever, recent studies have also shown that excessive ROS\nbeyond a particular threshold can induce pathophysiological\nchanges such as apoptosis, cell cycle disruption and necrosis\nin cancer cells, which suggests that elevation of ROS levels\ncould serve as a therapeutic strategy.1,30 Cancer cells adapt to\nhigh levels of ROS by activating ROS-scavenging enzymes,\nredox-sensitive transcription factors, such as NF-jB, Nrf2, c-\nJun and HIF-1, which lead to the increased expression of\n\nantioxidant molecules such as SOD; catalase thioredoxin and\nthe GSH antioxidant system. Abrogation of this adaptive\nredox homeostasis mechanism is an attractive new approach\nto improving therapeutic outcomes. Many chemotherapeutic\nmedicines have a mechanism of killing cancer cells via\nROS.18 Therefore, some studies have proposed ROS-based\ntherapies for cancer treatment.1,30\n\nH2O2 is a common form of ROS that can easily permeate\nthe cellular membranes into the cytoplasm. External applica-\ntion of H2O2 is widely used in wound treatment, but other\nuses are limited because it can cause deleterious effects, such\nas air embolisms and chemical burns of the skin and mucous\nmembranes. In this study, our results showed that local injec-\ntion of H2O2 combined with rAAV2-TAP effectively induced\napoptosis of PC-3 and LNCaP cells and suppressed the\ntumor growth in vivo, without air embolisms or other detect-\nable adverse effects. Following treatment with 200 mM H2O2,\noverexpression of TAP significantly promoted apoptosis com-\npared with the control, therefore, TAP sensitizes prostate\ncancer cells to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis.\n\nAAV is a kind of replication-defective nonenveloped par-\nvovirus that can infect both dividing and nondividing\ncells.31 Because its genome can incorporate into the host\ncells, including human cells and it is currently known to\nhave an acceptable safety profile. AAV is an attractive can-\ndidate for gene therapy.32–35 There are many serotypes of\nAAV. Among them, AAV2 is the most popular one for sci-\nentific research.34,36,37 In this study, the recombined AAV2\nwas shown to be able to deliver TAP into PC-3 and LNCaP\ncells and into the xenograft prostate tumor tissues effec-\ntively. It could also promote the oxidative stress-induced\napoptosis significantly without apparent adverse effects. The\nefficiency and the safety of rAAV2-TAP in inhibiting pros-\ntate cancer growth provide a strong rationale and the exper-\nimental basic for further studies.\n\nIn summary, we have identified a novel functional mecha-\nnism that the cross-talk of TAP-JNK is involved in the ROS/\nH2O2-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. Disrupting\nthe redox balance of cancer cells by this signaling may enable\nthe therapeutic selectivity and provide benefits to overcome\nthe drug resistance of prostate cancer.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThe c-Jun-DN and A-Fos constructs were kind gifts from Dr. Mingtao Li\n(Department of Pharmacology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen\nUniversity, Guangzhou 510080, China).\n\nReferences\n\n1.
