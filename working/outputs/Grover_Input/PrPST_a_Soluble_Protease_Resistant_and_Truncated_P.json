a Soluble, Protease Resistant and Truncated PrP\nForm Features in the Pathogenesis of a Genetic Prion\nDisease\nYael Friedman-Levi., Michal Mizrahi., Kati Frid, Orli Binyamin, Ruth Gabizon*\n\nDepartment of Neurology, The Agnes Ginges Center for Human Neurogenetics, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel\n\nAbstract\n\nWhile the conversion of PrPC into PrPSc in the transmissible form of prion disease requires a preexisting PrPSc seed, in\ngenetic prion disease accumulation of disease related PrP could be associated with biochemical and metabolic\nmodifications resulting from the designated PrP mutation. To investigate this possibility, we looked into the time related\nchanges of PrP proteins in the brains of TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice, a line modeling for heterozygous genetic prion disease\nlinked to the E200K PrP mutation. We found that while oligomeric entities of mutant E199KPrP exist at all ages, aggregates\nof wt PrP in the same brains presented only in advanced disease, indicating a late onset conversion process. We also show\nthat most PK resistant PrP in TgMHu2ME199K mice is soluble and truncated (PrP\n\nST\n), a pathogenic form never before\n\nassociated with prion disease. We next looked into brain samples from E200K patients and found that both PK resistant PrPs,\nPrPST as in TgMHu2ME199K mice, and ‘‘classical’’ PrPSc as in infectious prion diseases, coincide in the patient’s post mortem\nbrains. We hypothesize that aberrant metabolism of mutant PrPs may result in the formation of previously unknown forms\nof the prion protein and that these may be central for the fatal outcome of the genetic prion condition.\n\nCitation: Friedman-Levi Y, Mizrahi M, Frid K, Binyamin O, Gabizon R (2013) PrP\nST\n\n, a Soluble, Protease Resistant and Truncated PrP Form Features in the\nPathogenesis of a Genetic Prion Disease.

Since then, PrP\nSc\n\nwas\n\nestablished as the ‘‘gold standard’’ marker of prion infection and\n\nits presence in scrapie infected sheep, BSE infected cattle and in\n\nhumans suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) was used\n\nto confirm a prion disease diagnosis [2,3], while in its absence such\n\na verdict is mostly ruled out [4,5,6]. However, classical PrP\nSc\n\ncould\n\nnot be detected in brains of patients suffering from some forms of\n\ngenetic prion diseases [5,7,8], which are autosomal dominant\n\ndisorders linked to mutations in the gene encoding the prion\n\nprotein (PrP) [9] [10]. PrP\nSc\n\nis also undetected or present at\n\nmarginal levels in the brains of most transgenic mice modeling for\n\ngenetic prion diseases [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16].\n\nThe most common genetic CJD (gCJD) is the one linked to the\n\nE200K PrP mutation (substituting lysine for glutamate) [17,18].\n\nThis mutation was identified among Jews of Libyan origin as well\n\nas in subjects of other communities around the world [19]. Not\n\nonly is E200K CJD relatively frequent, but is also the gCJD most\n\nsimilar to sporadic CJD in age of onset, clinical and pathological\n\npresentation, as well as in the accumulation of classical PrP\nSc\n\nin\n\nthe brains of the affected subjects [20]. While most E200K CJD\n\npatients are heterozygous for the mutation, disease presentation\n\nwas faster to some degree in a small number of homozygous\n\npatients [21].\n\nTo investigate whether the presence of an E200K mutation is\n\nenough to confer high levels of protease resistance and aggregation\n\nto the nascent mutant prion protein, E200K PrP in cell cultured\n\nmodels was investigated by diverse biochemical methods. It was\n\nfound to be either readily digested by PK or otherwise resistant to\n\nmarginal PK concentrations [22,23]. Interestingly, E200K PrP in\n\nrecombinant form is spontaneously oxidized in its helix 3\n\nmethionine residues, a covalent modification which precedes the\n\nconversion of PrP\nC\n\ninto PrP\nSc\n\n[24]. All this suggests that while\n\nE200K PrP presents intrinsic properties in between those of PrP\nC\n\nand PrP\nSc\n\n, its full conversion into a disease related form may occur\n\nonly in-vivo in an age dependent form, concomitant with the late\n\nonset nature of the disease.\n\nOur knowledge on levels and properties of disease related\n\nmutant PrPs in genetic prion diseases was gathered mostly from\n\npost mortem samples [25]. To investigate the changes in mutant\n\nPrP properties at different time points in a late onset disease setup,\n\nwe looked into the biochemical properties of PrP in brain samples\n\nof TgMHu2ME199K mice. These mice, which model for E200K\n\nCJD, express human- mouse chimeric E199K PrP on a null (for\n\nhomozygous) or a wt PrP (for heterozygous) background. Mice\n\nfrom both lines suffer from similar neurological symptoms from as\n\nearly as 5–6 month of age and deteriorated to a terminal condition\n\nseveral months thereafter. During disease, TgMHu2ME199K\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69583\n\n\n\nmice accumulate a truncated form of PK resistant PrP recogniz-\n\nable by C-terminal PrP antibodies [26]. Like in the brains of\n\nhuman E200K patients [27,28], infectious prions are spontane-\n\nously formed in TgMHu2ME199K mice, mostly in the sick\n\nTgMHu2ME200K/wt mice, and only rarely in the sick TgMHu2-\n\nME199K/ko, suggesting that the presence of a wt allele, while not\n\nrequired for disease presentation, may facilitate the transmission of\n\ninfectivity to wt mice.\n\nWe now show that E199K PrP in TgMHu2ME199K mice\n\npresent in oligomeric forms long before disease presentation,\n\nindicating partial aggregation, as oxidation, is an intrinsic property\n\nof this mutant PrP. Contrarily, PK resistant PrP is detected just\n\nbefore disease presentation and accumulates further with disease\n\naggravation, indicating its formation is an age related effect. Wt\n\nPrP aggregates can be identified in brains of heterozygous Tg mice\n\nonly when disease is well established, indicating the conversion of\n\nwt PrP to a disease like form is an acquired property related to the\n\nstatus of the disease. Surprisingly, results from brain fractionation\n\nexperiments demonstrate that the truncated PK resistant PrP in\n\nthe TgMHu2ME199K mice present in soluble brain fractions, as\n\nwas recently suggested for pathological key proteins in other\n\nneurodegenerative conditions [29,30,31]. Most important, we\n\nfound that both disease related PrP forms, the soluble, truncated\n\nand PK resistant, hereby denominated PrP\nST\n\nas well as the\n\n‘‘classical’’ PrP\nSc\n\n, coincide in the brains of E200K patients. We\n\nhypothesize that the metabolism of mutant PrP may result in the\n\nformation of previously unknown PrP forms, some of which may\n\nbe essential for the fatal outcome of the disease while others may\n\nbe more active in disease transmission.\n\nResults\n\nClinical disease and PrP accumulation in heterozygous\nand homozygous TgMH2ME199K mice\n\nExcept for rare cases related to family intermarriages [21], most\n\ngenetic CJD patients are heterozygous for the mutation, thereby\n\nexpressing both mutant and wt PrP [32]. While we have shown\n\npreviously that TgMHu2ME199K mice on a null or wt\n\nbackground present similar disease properties and kinetics [26],\n\nwe looked again at this observation by calculating the individual\n\ntime points in which each mouse reaches score 2, a clear\n\nobservation point in disease aggravation (significant hind limb/s\n\nweakness). Using this calculation method, we show (fig. 1a) that the\n\nmedian of disease aggravation is indeed very similar for both lines;\n\n5.2 months 60.8 for homozygous mice and 6.061.2 months for\n\nheterozygous mice. Interestingly, there is no statistical significant\n\ndifference between the kinetics of aggravation in both lines of mice\n\n(0.37 by T-test), indicating that a wt PrP allele is not a must for\n\ndisease presentation and progression. Consistent with these results,\n\nfigure 1b shows that the levels and rate of PK resistant PrP\n\naccumulation in the brain homogenates of TgMHu2ME199K/ko\n\nand TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice are very similar, suggesting again\n\nthat wt PrP in genetic patients is not an obligatory part of the\n\npathological process [33]. As published before, PK resistant PrP in\n\nthese mice present as a truncated form recognizable only by C-\n\nterminal aPrP antibodies [24,26], as the pAb RTC used in\nfigure 1b, which cannot separate between the chimeric and wt\n\nallele.\n\nE199K PrP as compared to wt PrP aggregation properties\nAs opposed to the lack of a role for wt PrP in the onset and\n\nprogression of genetic prion disease, this is not the case for disease\n\ntransmission to naı̈ve animals. We have shown previously [24] that\n\nwhile brains from sick TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice readily\n\ntransmitted disease to wt mice, only rare mice succumb to disease\n\nwhen inoculated with samples from asymptomatic heterozygous\n\nbrains or even from sick TgMHu2ME199K/ko brains. This\n\nindicates that some levels of wt PrP in heterozygous TgMHu2-\n\nME199K mice may convert into infectious prions when disease is\n\nwell established.\n\nSince we could not separate between truncated allele specific\n\nPK resistant PrP due to the lack of appropriate antibodies, we\n\nlooked into the aggregation properties of full length wt and mutant\n\nPrP at different disease points. To this effect, we subjected sarkosyl\n\nextracted brain homogenates of TgMHu2ME199K and wt mice\n\nto sucrose gradients that can separate between aggregates of\n\ndifferent sizes and solubilized PrP forms. Fractions from these\n\ngradients were subjected to immunoblotting with a PrP antibodies\nthat can distinguish between wt and chimeric mouse-human\n\nE199K PrP when at full length. Panel a in figure 2 describes the\n\nPrP epitopes of all antibodies used in this manuscript. Indeed, a\nPrP mAb IPC1 recognizes murine PrP but not chimeric MHu2M\n\nforms, while aPrP mAb 3F4 recognizes the human parts of\nchimeric E199K PrP, but not murine PrP as in the wt allele. In\n\npanel b, we show that PrP in wt mice, as recognized by IPC1, is\n\npresent only in the low density fractions of the gradient, as\n\nexpected for PrP\nC\n\n, a membrane protein that is readily solubilized\n\nin detergents. The same results (not shown) were obtained for wt\n\nPrP in mice brains of all ages. Contrarily, PrP in the brains of\n\nTgMHu2ME199K/ko mice (as detected by aPrP mAb 3F4), is\ndispersed between all gradient fractions, indicating it may\n\nintrinsically form oligomers of different sizes. Next, we looked\n\ninto the aggregation properties of both PrPs in TgMHu2-\n\nME199K/wt mice of different ages, before and after disease\n\npresentations. Fig. 2c demonstrates that while E199K PrP presents\n\nthe same oligomerization levels from 1 month old mice through all\n\nages, wt PrP in the heterozygous mice is solubilized at young age,\n\nas is the case for PrP\nC\n\nin wt mice, but acquires aggregation\n\nproperties when clinical disease become apparent at older age, as\n\nis the case for 7 month old TgMHu2ME199K mice. These results\n\nsuggest an ‘‘in cell’’ infection process leading to the conversion of\n\nwt PrP into a disease related form. As stated above, whether some\n\nof this aggregated wt PrP forms are also PK resistant cannot be\n\ndetermined by these tools.\n\nTruncated PK resistant PrP is present in the light fractions\nof TgMHu2ME199K brains gradients\n\nIn the brains of rodents affected with scrapie, PrP\nSc\n\nis present\n\nonly in the most aggregated fractions of a sucrose gradient [34].\n\nTo test whether this is also the case for PrP in TgMHu2ME199K/\n\nwt mice, we digested gradients samples in the presence or absence\n\nof PK and immunoblotted then either with a PrP mAb 6H4 (for\nfull length PrP) or a PrP pAbRTC (total+truncated). Figure 3\nshows that, as described for the TgMHu2ME199K/ko [26], PK\n\nresistant PrP in these mice can only be identified by pAb RTC (a\nC-terminal PrP ) and not by 6H4. However, and contrarily to\n\nbrains of prion infected mice, most PK resistant PrP in the brains\n\nof the TgMHu2ME199K mice, both of wt (fig. 3) or ablated (not\n\nshown) background, could be detected in the light fractions,\n\nrepresenting either a soluble protein or a detergent solubilized\n\nmembrane protein. This is a surprising result not only due to the\n\ndifferent properties of PrP\nc\n\nin the TgMHu2ME199K mice as\n\ncompared to classical PrP\nSc\n\nin transmissible prion disease, but also\n\nin view of the intrinsic aggregation properties of this mutant PrP.\n\nWe speculate that degradation of aberrantly folded mutant PrP\n\nmay result also in soluble truncated products, each of them with\n\ndifferent biochemical properties.\n\nSoluble PK Resistant PrP in Genetic Prion Disease\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69583\n\n\n\nTruncated PrP in human gCJD brain samples\nTo test whether truncated forms of PrP as described for the\n\nTgMHu2ME199K mice also feature in the human relevant\n\ndisease, sucrose gradients as above were loaded with sarkosyl\n\nextracted samples of E200K CJD brains, originating from post\n\nmortem samples. Fractions collected from these gradients were\n\ndigested in the presence or absence of PK and immunoblotted\n\nwith aPrP mAb 6H4 and with aPrP pAb RTC, as done above for\nthe TgMHu2ME199K samples. Figure 4 shows that while a PrP\nmAb 6H4 detects classical forms of PrP\n\nSc\nin the heavy fractions of\n\nthe gradient after proteolysis, pAb RTC also detects soluble\n\ntruncated forms of PrP before and after PK digestion, albeit with\n\nless intensity than the ones observed in the PK treated\n\nTgMHu2ME199K brains. The fact that truncated PK resistant\n\nforms of PrP could be found in the light fraction of both E200K\n\nhuman patients and sick TgMHu2ME199K mice indicates this\n\nform of PrP most probably plays a role in the pathological process\n\nleading to fatal disease in genetic cases, the nature of which is still\n\nunknown. Regretfully, and since we can only look into an ‘‘end\n\npoint’’ situation in the human samples, it is difficult to determine\n\nwhether ‘‘classical PrP\nSc\n\n’’ starts to accumulate in these patients at\n\nan early or late stage in the disease process. Also in the\n\nTgMHu2ME199K mice we are lacking part of the time frame\n\nspectrum since our ethical permit does not allow us to follow up\n\nvery sick mice for long periods of time, but rather we have to\n\nsacrifice them when they cannot reach by themselves to food and\n\nwater.\n\nPrPST: A truncated, PK resistant and soluble disease\nrelated PrP\n\nDisease related PrP forms presenting in light fractions of brain\n\nhomogenate gradients may be membrane proteins solubilized in\n\nsarkosyl or bona fide soluble proteins. To distinguish between\n\nthese possibilities, we subjected samples from E200K CJD patients\n\nand from TgMHu2ME199K/wt mice, as well as brains samples\n\nfrom naı̈ve and scrapie RML infected mice to the following\n\nfractionation protocol (see figure 5a). First, brain homogenates (see\n\nmethods for details), after a 18000 rpm centrifugation were\n\nFigure 1.

To obtain a clear\n\nsupernatant carrying only soluble proteins, this first supernatant\n\nwas subjected twice to ultracentrifugation at 100000 g. The\n\nsupernatant of the last centrifugation was digested in the presence\n\nor absence of PK. In parallel the first pellet was subjected to\n\nosmotic shock before ultracentrifugation (to eliminate traces of\n\nsupernatant material) and subsequently the pellet was solubilized\n\nin the presence of 2% sarkosyl and centrifuged at 100000 g. The\n\npellet and supernatant of this last procedure were digested in the\n\npresence and absence of PK. Finally, the sarkosyl pellet and\n\nsupernatants, as well as the high speed soluble fractions were\n\nimmunoblotted with two C-terminal a PrP antibodies; pAb RTC\nand EP1802Y (EP) , a rabbit a PrP mAb directed against the\nCITQYER ESQAYYQRGS sequence present at the C-terminal\n\npart of human PrP, just before the PrP GPI anchor. All PK\n\ndigestions were performed in the presence of 2% sarkosyl, to\n\nensure the accessibility to the protease in case of protein\n\nmembrane interactions.\n\nResults of these experiments are depicted in Figure 5b&c.\n\nsurprisingly, figure 2b shows that significant levels of PrP are\n\npresent in soluble fractions of all brains, as opposed to the general\n\nnotion that the prion proteins are mostly associated with\n\nmembranes. However, only in the genetic disease related samples,\n\nE200K human brains and TgMHu2ME199K brains, are these\n\nsoluble PrP forms resistant to PK digestion in a truncated form.\n\nInterestingly, some of the PrP\nST\n\nforms are recognized only by\n\nRTC and not by the EP antibody, indicating they may be\n\ntruncated not only in its N-terminal but also in its C-terminal part.\n\nMost important, no PrP\nST\n\nform was found in the soluble brain\n\nfractions of scrapie infected mice, indicating that genetic and\n\ntransmissible prion disease differ in some mechanistic features.\n\nFigure 2.

This was shown by a\nPrP immunohistochemistry in TgMHu2ME199K brains and\n\nTgMHu2ME199K primary fibroblasts [26,35], which show\n\nextensive intra cell immunostaining. In addition, we were unable\n\nto identify PrP\nST\n\nin the CSF of E200K patients (not shown).\n\nHowever, our results do not rule out the possibility that some levels\n\nof PrP\nC\n\nand PrP\nST\n\nare secreted indeed into the intercellular space.\n\nOnly the TgMHu2ME199K mice show PrP\nST\n\nforms in the\n\nsarkosyl soluble fractions. Whether this relates to traces of the\n\ncytosolic form, or otherwise demonstrates that PrP\nST\n\nis formed on\n\ncell membranes and is shaded to the inside or the outside of cells\n\nafter cutting its GPI anchor is unknown [36]. Interestingly, all but\n\nnormal brain samples present PK resistant PrP in the sarkosyl\n\nextracted pellets each of those with a different pattern and at low\n\nlevels at the TgMHu2ME199K mice. We may therefore conclude\n\nthat while the transmissible form of prion disease (RML) shows\n\nonly classical PrP\nSc\n\n, the genetically affected brains also present a\n\nunique soluble form, PrP\nST\n\n, which in the Tg mice constitutes the\n\ngreat majority of disease related PrP. We hypothesize that PrP\nST\n\nis\n\nthe product of aberrant E200K PrP metabolism as related to age\n\nfactors and its accumulation may be an important feature in the\n\npathological mechanism of genetic forms of prion disease.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTaking advantage of our TgMHu2ME199K/wt model of\n\nheterozygous E200K gCJD, we looked into the time related\n\nchanges in the biochemical properties of E199K and wt PrP from\n\nthe asymptomatic early age to full blown disease. We found that\n\nthe disease burden lies fully on mutant PrP, since the addition of a\n\nwt allele did not affect disease time course or levels of PK resistant\n\nPrP accumulation. In addition, we established that some of the\n\nE199K PrP presents intrinsically in oligomeric forms even in the\n\nearly asymptomatic stages, while the accumulation of a soluble\n\ntruncated and PK resistant form (PrP\nST\n\n), most probably cytosolic,\n\ncommences shortly before disease manifestation. Contrarily, wt\n\nPrP in the heterozygous mice maintains PrP\nC\n\nlike properties until\n\nmuch later in the life of the mice and starts to aggregate at 7\n\nmonths of age, when disease is already at an advanced stage.\n\nMost important, we show that brains of human E200K gCJD\n\npatients comprise both classical PrP\nSc\n\nand PrP\nST\n\n, the last one\n\nrecognizable only by C-terminal a PrP antibodies. Since our\nTgMHu2ME199K mice succumb to neurological fatal disease,\n\nand PrP\nST\n\nis by far the major disease related PrP form\n\naccumulated in these animals, we speculate that PrP\nST\n\nmay be\n\nthe key feature of this genetic form of prion disease. Accumulation\n\nof classical PrP\nSc\n\nmay be a late effect induced by the conversion of\n\nwt PrP in heterozygous patients. However, while in one\n\nhomozygous E200K CJD patient, classical PrP\nSc\n\ncould not be\n\ndetected [21], we cannot conclude at this point that the\n\naccumulation of classical PrP\nSc\n\nin genetic patients only appears\n\nwhen wt PrP is expressed. It will be interesting to test whether this\n\nor other forms of PrP\nST\n\nare present in patients carrying other\n\npathogenic PrP mutations as well as in sporadic CJD patients,\n\neach of which may show distinct PrP accumulation properties.\n\nThe generation of PrP\nST\n\nmay result from the aberrant folding\n\nand abnormal metabolism and degradation of E200K PrP. We\n\nhave shown previously that E200K PrP is spontaneously oxidized\n\nin its helix 3 Met residues [24], probably due to an increase in\n\nsolvent exposure of the relevant helix in the presence of K at\n\nposition 200 [37]. Such oxidation may provide the structural\n\nchanges required for the formation of oligomeric and soluble\n\ndisease related forms, such as PrP\nST\n\n. Cytosolic PrP\nST\n\nmay next\n\nactivate the UPR system, resulting in the global reduction in\n\nprotein synthesis and dysregulation of elF2a [38]. In addition, we\n\nFigure 3.

Indeed, it is the levels of soluble Tau\n\nand not of Tau incorporated into neurofibrillary tangles which\n\nreduction led to the cessation of neuron loss and the improvement\n\nof memory functions [41]. Also, the removal of amyloid plaques by\n\nAb immunotherapy failed to improve the clinical status of\nAlzheimer patients [42]. If a similar mechanism exists for prion\n\ndiseases, it is mostly PrP\nST\n\nand less so classical PrP\nSc\n\nwhich may be\n\nthe key neurotoxic entity, at least in gCJD linked to the E200K\n\nPrP mutation.\n\nIn addition to an unknown number of subclinical BSE cases, a\n\nsignificant number of people at risk to develop prion disease are\n\ncarriers of pathogenic PrP mutations. We have shown here that\n\nthe key pathogenic events may differ significantly between\n\ntransmissible and genetic prion diseases. While the first one may\n\nrelate mostly to the process converting PrP\nC\n\nto classical PrP\nSc\n\n,\n\nmutant PrP forms may generate metabolic abnormalities form\n\nearly age, resulting in activation of stress related UPR signals and\n\naccumulation of PrP\nST\n\n, a soluble PK resistant PrP form. This\n\nimplies that treatments for genetic patients and even more so\n\nprevention of disease manifestation for individuals at genetic prion\n\nrisk cannot be evaluated only by disappearance of classical PrP\nSc\n\nfrom cells in culture or even by delay of disease onset in scrapie\n\ninfected rodents, but should rather be tested in appropriate\n\ntransgenic models that mimic for genetic prion diseases.\n\nFigure 5.

Brain human samples were received\n\nfollowing postmortem examinations from the Pathology Depart-\n\nments of several hospitals in the country. Immunoblotting\n\nexperiments on such samples, as the ones described in this\n\nmanuscript, are part of the routine pathological protocol applied\n\non brains from suspected CJD cases. Our laboratory in the\n\nHadassah Department of Neurology is the national referral center\n\nfor CJD diagnosis (genetic and biochemical testing). The testing of\n\nthese samples was approved by both the safety and ethical\n\nauthorities of the Hadassah University Hospital. Since all cases of\n\nCJD and alike negative controls are unable to sign for such tests\n\nlong before their death due to their medical condition, the relatives\n\nof these patients provided informed written consent for PM\n\nstudies. Enabling close relatives to provide such consent is the\n\nstandard policy of the Israeli Ministry of Health.\n\nMice scoring\nTgMHu2ME199K mice from both lines (PrP ablated or wt\n\nbackgrounds) were followed twice a week for the appearance of\n\nspontaneous neurological disease. Mice were scored for disease\n\nseverity and progression according to the scale of clinical signs as\n\npreviously described [26]. Briefly, partial hind limbs weakness = 1,\n\nsignificant hind limb/s weakness or paralysis = 2, full paralysis in\n\none limb = 3, full paralysis in both limbs = 4, death = 5. Mice were\n\nsacrificed according to the ethical requirements of the Hebrew\n\nUniversity Animal Authorities when too sick or paralyzed to reach\n\nfood and water, or after losing 20% body weight.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nBrains were homogenized at 10% (W/V) in 10 mM Tris- HCl,\n\npH 7.4 and 0.3 M sucrose. For Proteinase K digestions, 30 ml of\n10% brain homogenates extracted with 2% sarkosyl on ice were\n\nincubated with 30 to 40 mg/ml Proteinase K for 30 min at 37uC.\nSamples were subsequently subjected to SDS PAGE and\n\nimmunoblotted with diverse anti-PrP antibodies, as described in\n\nFigure 2a.\n\nSucrose gradients of brain homogenates\nSarkosyl extracted brain homogenates were subjected to sucrose\n\ngradients as described [34]. Briefly, 140 to 300 ml of 10% brain\nhomogenates extracted in the presence of 2% Sarkosyl were\n\noverlaid on a sucrose gradient composed of layers of increasing\n\nconcentrations of sucrose (10–60%). Gradients were then centri-\n\nfuged for 1 h at 55000 rpm in a Sorval mini-ultracentrifuge and\n\nsubsequently 9 samples were collected from the top to the bottom.\n\n2/3 volume of each individual sample was then subjected to\n\nProteinase K digestion and immunoblotted with diverse anti PrP\n\nAbs.\n\nBrain Fractionation\nTwo ml of 10% brain homogenates in 10 mM Tris-HCl,\n\npH 7.4/0.3M sucrose from human E200K gCJD patients, 8\n\nmonths old transgenic E199K/wt mouse, 8 months old normal\n\nmice and scrapie RML mice at terminal stages of disease were\n\nsubjected to centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4uC.\nSubsequently, 300 ml of each supernatant was subjected twice to\nultra-centrifugation (45,000 rpm for 1 hour at 4uC) in order to\neliminate traces of membranes from the soluble protein fraction.\n\nProteins in the last supernatant were concentrated by methanol\n\nprecipitation, and then resuspended in STE (saline-tris-EDTA)\n\n(fraction I). The initial pellet containing membrane proteins was\n\nresuspended in DDW and ultra-centrifuged to dilute traces of\n\nsupernatant material, and the pellet resuspended and extracted in\n\n2% sarkosyl before ultra-centrifugation in 45,000 rpm for 1 hour\n\nat 4uC.
