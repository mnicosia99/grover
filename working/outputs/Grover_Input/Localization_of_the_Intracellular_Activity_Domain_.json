VALLANCE,\nAND MENGFEI HO\n\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wright State University\nSchool of Medicine, Dayton, Ohio 45435\n\nReceived 12 May 1998/Returned for modification 29 July 1998/Accepted 19 October 1998\n\nWe have shown that Pasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) directly causes transient activation of Gqa protein\nthat is coupled to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase Cb1 in Xenopus oocytes (B. A. Wilson, X. Zhu,\nM. Ho, and L. Lu, J. Biol. Chem. 272:1268–1275, 1997). We found that antibodies directed against an\nN-terminal peptide of PMT inhibited the toxin-induced response in Xenopus oocytes, but antibodies against a\nC-terminal peptide did not. To test whether the intracellular activity domain of PMT is localized to the N\nterminus, we conducted a deletion mutational analysis of the PMT protein, using the Xenopus oocyte system as\na means of screening for toxin activity. Using PCR and conventional cloning techniques, we cloned from a\ntoxinogenic strain of P. multocida the entire toxA gene, encoding the 1,285-amino-acid PMT protein, and\nexpressed the recombinant toxin as a His-tagged fusion protein in Escherichia coli. We subsequently generated\na series of N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants and expressed the His-tagged PMT fragments in E. coli.\nThese proteins were screened for cytotoxic activity on cultured Vero cells and for intracellular activity in the\nXenopus oocyte system. Only the full-length protein without the His tag exhibited activity on Vero cells. The\nfull-length PMT and N-terminal fragments containing the first 500 residues elicited responses in oocytes, but\nthe C-terminal 780 amino acid fragment did not. Our results confirm that the intracellular activity domain of\nPMT is localized to the N-terminal 500 amino acids of the protein and that the C terminus is required for entry\ninto cells.\n\nPasteurella multocida toxin (PMT) is a major virulence factor\nassociated with progressive atrophic rhinitis in domestic and\nwild animals (1, 12), respiratory disease in cattle and labora-\ntory rabbits (3–6, 8, 14), and dermonecrosis and bacteremia\nresulting from bite wounds or animal exposure in humans (15,\n16, 20, 23, 28, 35, 41). PMT is a 1,285-amino-acid protein (7,\n22, 26, 32) that appears to bind to and enter mammalian cells\nvia receptor-mediated endocytosis (34, 36) and acts intracellu-\nlarly to initiate DNA synthesis and cytoskeletal rearrange-\nments (9, 17, 18, 21, 24, 29, 36). Some of the intracellular\nevents that have been observed upon exposure to PMT in\ncultured fibroblasts and osteoblasts include enhanced hydroly-\nsis of inositolphospholipids to increase intracellular inositol\nphosphates and diacylglycerol (29, 30, 38); mobilization of\nintracellular Ca21 pools (29, 30, 38, 40); decreased ADP-ribo-\nsylation of GRP78/BiP (39); increased protein phosphorylation\n(40); and tyrosine phosphorylation of p125Fak and paxillin, as\nwell as actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion assembly\n(9, 24). Recently, we used voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes to\ndemonstrate direct PMT-mediated stimulation of the b1 iso-\nform of phospholipase C (PLCb1) and the inositol 1,4,5-\ntrisphosphate (IP3) signaling pathway and to identify the im-\nmediate intracellular target of PMT as the free, monomeric a\nsubunit of the Gq protein (43).\n\nDuring our earlier studies, we observed that specific anti-\nbodies against an N-terminal peptide of PMT, anti-toxA28–42,\nwere able to block the PMT-mediated response in Xenopus\noocytes (43). On the other hand, specific antibodies to a C-\n\nterminal peptide of PMT, anti-toxA1239–1253, did not block the\nactivity, strongly implying that the N terminus of PMT is crit-\nical for its intracellular activity. The N-terminal half of the\nrelated cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (CNF1) and CNF2\nfrom pathogenic Escherichia coli show homology to the N\nterminus of PMT (10, 31). Comparisons of the amino acid\nsequence of PMT with those of other bacterial dermonecrotic\ntoxins has been reported elsewhere (10, 27, 31, 42). While\nthere is homology in the C termini of the CNFs and the der-\nmonecrotic toxin from Bordetella bronchiseptica (DNT), the\nC-terminal region of PMT does not have this similarity with\nthose of the CNFs and DNT (10, 27, 31, 42). As has been\nshown for PMT, both DNT and the CNFs induce DNA syn-\nthesis, as well as actin stress fiber formation and focal adhesion\nassembly (19, 25, 31). For the CNFs and DNT, this activity has\nbeen shown to occur through constitutive activation of the\nsmall G protein RhoA by deamidation of Gln-63 (11, 19, 31,\n37). The RhoA deamidase activity was reported to be localized\nto the C terminus of CNF1 (27), and the receptor-binding\nactivity was postulated to be in the N terminus. While all of\nthese toxins have been shown to induce stress fiber formation\nand focal adhesion assembly, the molecular and functional\norganization of this group of toxins remains unclear. It is also\nnot clear how the modification of RhoA by the CNFs and DNT\nand the modification of Gqa by PMT lead to each of the\nobserved intracellular changes.\n\nTo define the functional domain of PMT responsible for\nintracellular activity, we cloned the entire toxA gene from P.\nmultocida and expressed the corresponding recombinant PMT\n(rPMT) as a hexahistidine (His)-tagged fusion protein in E.\ncoli. We confirmed that the full-length rPMT protein is as\nactive as native PMT in both oocyte and cell culture assays. We\nthen constructed a series of N- and C-terminal deletion mu-\n\n* Corresponding author.

To screen for the functional domain of\nPMT responsible for activation of the intracellular Gq-PLCb1-\nIP3 signaling pathway, the recombinant toxin proteins were\nmicroinjected into voltage-clamped Xenopus oocytes to ob-\nserve the toxin-induced Ca21-dependent Cl2 current. Our re-\nsults localize the functional domain of PMT responsible for\nintracellular activity to the N terminus. To determine if this\nfunctional domain alone possessed cytotoxic activity on intact\ncells, we also tested each of the recombinant proteins for\neffects on cultured Vero cells and found that only the full-\nlength rPMT protein is able to cause the morphological effects\ninduced by native PMT.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nMaterials. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against two synthetic peptides, compris-\ning residues 28 to 42 of PMT (NSDFTVKGKSADEIF) and residues 1239 to\n1253 of PMT (PVDDWALEIAQRNRA), were obtained from Bio-Synthesis,\nInc., using multiple antigen peptide conjugation methodology. The anti-peptide\nimmunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies (anti-toxA28–42 and anti-toxA1239–1253) were\npurified by using a protein A-agarose column (PURE-1; Sigma). Goat anti-rabbit\nIgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and tetramethylrhodamine B\nisothiocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated phalloidin were obtained from Sigma. E.\ncoli BL21(DE3) and the plasmid vectors pET-15b, pET-21b, and pET-33b were\nobtained from Novagen. E. coli XL-1 Blue was obtained from Stratagene. TA-\ncloning kits, E. coli TOP10 and competent TOP10F9 One-Shot cells, and plasmid\nvectors pTrcHisC and pCR3-Uni were obtained from Invitrogen. Lipo-\nfectAMINE, the plasmid vector pROEX-1, and tissue culture media, sera, and\nreagents were obtained from Gibco/BRL. The plasmid vector pEGFP-N1 was\nobtained from Clontech. Ni21-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose and Qiaex II\nDNA purification kits were obtained from Qiagen. PCR primers were obtained\nfrom Bio-Synthesis and Gibco/BRL. Restriction enzymes were obtained from\nGibco/BRL or New England Biolabs. Centricon, Ultra-Free, and Centricon\nPlus-20 concentrators were obtained from Amicon/Millipore. Xenopus laevis\nfrogs were obtained from Xenopus I, Dexter, Mich. African green monkey\nkidney (Vero) cells (CCL-81) and murine Swiss 3T3 (CCL-92) and NIH 3T3\n(CRL-1658) fibroblast cells were obtained from the American Type Culture\nCollection. P. multocida subsp. multocida 45/78 (NCTC 12178) was obtained\nfrom the National Collection of Type Cultures and grown at 37°C on Trypticase\nsoy agar supplemented with 5% defibrinated sheep blood (BBL 11043). Native\nPMT was purchased from Sigma as a lyophilized powder with bovine serum\nalbumin and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerol\nprior to use. Native PMT, purified to homogeneity, quantified, and titered by\nVero cell cytotoxicity assays as described elsewhere (8), was a generous gift from\nClarence Chrisp. All other reagents were of the highest quality commercially\navailable.\n\nConstruction of plasmids containing deletion mutants of PMT. All recombi-\nnant proteins were engineered to have either an N- or a C-terminal fusion\npeptide containing a His tag, with all N-terminal fusion peptides also containing\na thrombin proteolytic recognition site (Fig. 1). All cloning was carried out with\n\neither E. coli XL-1 Blue or E. coli TOP10F9 One-Shot cells.\nGenomic DNA from P. multocida (NCTC 12178) was isolated as described\n\nelsewhere (2) and used as a template for PCR. Primers 1 (coding, 59-CGCGG\nCAGCCATATGAAAACAAAACATTTTTTTAAC-39) and 2 (noncoding, 59-T\nATGCGAATTCATCATGCAATCCATTGTTTCAGATC-39) were used to clone\nby PCR the region of the toxA gene, encoding the N-terminal 293 amino acids.\nThe forward primer 1 incorporated an NdeI site (underscored) at the start of the\ngene (bold), and the reverse primer 2 incorporated an EcoRI site (underscored)\nand a stop codon (bold) after the codon for amino acid 293. The resulting PCR\nproduct was digested with NdeI and EcoRI, and the NdeI/EcoRI fragment was\ninserted into the NdeI/EcoRI sites of the expression vector pET-15b, to yield\npET15b-toxAN1, which was sequence confirmed and used to express the\nToxAN1 protein. Plasmid pET15b-toxAN1 was used to generate the beginning\nregion of the toxA gene in all subsequent constructs encoding the N-terminal\nregion of PMT due to the lack of unique and practical restriction sites in the toxA\ngene.\n\nTo clone the remaining portion of the toxA gene, genomic DNA from P.\nmultocida (NCTC 12178) was exhaustively digested with HpaII. A 15-kb HpaII\nfragment, shown by Southern blotting (2) to hybridize to a DNA probe generated\nfrom the NdeI/EcoRI insert from pET15b-toxAN1 (data not shown), was used as\na template to obtain the entire toxA gene by a three-step process using PCR. In\nthe first step, two plasmids containing two overlapping fragments of the toxA\ngene were generated by TA cloning. Primers 1 and 3 (noncoding, 59-AAGACG\nTACCAGACGAATTTTATGT-39) were used to clone the region of the toxA\ngene encoding the N-terminal 521 amino acids into the TA-cloning vector pCR3-\nUni to yield pCR3-Uni(1&3). Primers 4 (coding, 59-GTAGGAGAAGAATTA\nCATTCTATCTCA-39) and 5 (noncoding, 59-GAATTGGGTACCTTATAGTG\nCTCTTGTTAAGCGAGG-39), with a KpnI site (underscored) and a stop codon\n(bold) incorporated into primer 5, were used to clone the region of toxA encod-\ning the C-terminal 793 amino acids into the TA-cloning vector pCR3-Uni to yield\npCR3-Uni(4&5). In the second step, pCR3-Uni(1&3) was digested with StuI and\nXhoI, and the resulting StuI/XhoI fragment was inserted into the StuI/XhoI sites\nof pET15b-toxAN1. Then an NcoI/XhoI toxA gene fragment from the resulting\nplasmid was subcloned into the expression vector pTrcHisC to yield pTHC-\ntoxAN2, which was used to express the ToxAN2 protein. In the third step,\npCR3-Uni(4&5) was digested with XhoI and KpnI, and the resulting XhoI/KpnI\ntoxA gene fragment was inserted into the XhoI/KpnI sites of pTHC-toxAN2 to\nyield pTHC-toxA, which was used to express the full-length rPMT protein.\n\nA BamHI linker was inserted into the StuI site of pET15b-toxAN1, and a\nBamHI/EcoRI vector fragment from pET-15b was inserted into the BamHI/\nEcoRI sites of pET15b-toxAN1, to yield pET15b-toxAN3, which was used to\nexpress the ToxAN3 protein. The NdeI/EcoRI insert from pET15b-toxAN1 was\nfragment exchanged into pET-21b to yield pET21b-toxAN1. A NotI linker was\ninserted into the SnaBI site of pTHC-toxA, and a StuI/NotI insert from pTHC-\ntoxA was subcloned into the StuI/NotI sites of pET21b-toxAN1 to generate\npET21b-toxAN4, which was used to express the ToxAN4 protein. The XhoI/KpnI\ninsert from pCR3-Uni(4&5) was subcloned into the XhoI/KpnI sites of the\nexpression vector pTrcHisC to yield pTHC-toxAC1, which was used to express\nthe ToxAC1 protein. The SpeI/KpnI insert from pCR3-Uni(4&5) was subcloned\ninto the SpeI/KpnI sites of the expression vector pROEX-1 to generate\npROEX1-toxAC2, which was used to express the ToxAC2 protein. With the\npTHC-toxA plasmid serving as a DNA template for PCR, primers 6 (coding,\n59-CGCCGCGCCATGGCAACAAAACATTTTTTTAAC-39) and 7 (noncod-\ning, 59-TGCTGCGGCCGCGCTGAATAATGCAGATTG-39), primers 6 and 8\n(noncoding, 59-GCGGCCGCTATTGCAGATAACTGTG-39), and primers\n6 and 9 (noncoding, 59-GCGGCCGCTTTGTTATCTTTTAAATGCCAT-39),\nwith an NcoI site (underscored) incorporated at the start (bold) of the gene in\nprimer 6 and an NotI site (underscored) incorporated at the end of the gene\nfragment in primers 7, 8, and 9, were used to generate by PCR three toxA-\ncontaining fragments that were ligated into the TA-cloning vector pCR3-Uni to\nyield pCR3-Uni(6&7), pCR3-Uni(6&8), and pCR3-Uni(6&9), respectively.\nNcoI/NotI inserts from each of the three plasmids were then subcloned into the\nexpression vector pET33b to yield pET33b-toxAN5, pET33b-toxAN6, and\npET33b-toxAN7, respectively, which in turn were used to express the corre-\nsponding ToxAN5, ToxAN6, and ToxAN7 proteins.\n\nExpression of recombinant toxin proteins in E. coli. Recombinant proteins\nwere expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) for constructs generated in expression\nvector pET15b, pET21b, pET33b, or pROEX-1 or in E. coli TOP10 for con-\nstructs generated in expression vector pTrcHisC. Seed flasks containing 50 ml of\nLB with the appropriate antibiotic, ampicillin (100 mg/ml) or kanamycin (25\nmg/ml), were inoculated with the desired bacterial colonies and incubated with\nvigorous shaking overnight at 37°C. Fermentation flasks containing 500 ml of LB\nwith ampicillin (100 mg/ml) or kanamycin (25 mg/ml) were inoculated with 8 to\n10 ml of the overnight seed culture and incubated with vigorous shaking at 37°C\nuntil an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 to 0.8 was reached. Expression of the\nrecombinant proteins was induced by addition of isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactopyr-\nanoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM, and growth was continued for\n3 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 3 g for 10 min in a Sorvall\nRC-5C Plus centrifuge. Cell pellets were suspended in lysis buffer (100 ml per\n2.5-liter starting culture volume; 50 mM potassium phosphate [pH 7.5] contain-\ning 100 mM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 5 mg each of pepstatin, leupeptin,\nand aprotinin per ml, 2 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride,\n\nFIG. 1.

The cell\nsuspension was sonicated for four rounds of 1-min pulses at a duty cycle of 0.7\nin a Brau-Sonic-U cell disruptor, with 1-min cooling intervals on ice. The\ncellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 3 g for 90 min, and\nthe supernatants were immediately used as cell extracts for further purifica-\ntion.\n\nPurification of recombinant toxin proteins. The His tag affinity handle allowed\nfor essentially one-step purification of the full-length and deletion mutant toxins\nby nickel chelate affinity chromatography. Cell extracts were passed twice\nthrough a 5-ml/Ni21-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed\ntwice with 50 ml of Ni column buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate [pH 7.5], 100\nmM KCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 5% glycerol, 10 mM imidazole), followed by stepwise\nelution with 50 ml each of Ni column buffer containing 20, 30, 60, 110, 160, and\n500 mM imidazole. Column fractions were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting, and frac-\ntions containing the toxin proteins were pooled and concentrated in Centricon/\nMillipore concentrators to remove the imidazole and to exchange the buffer with\n50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerol. To further desalt the samples,\nthe concentrated solutions were passed through a PD-10 desalting column (Phar-\nmacia).\n\nSDS-PAGE and Western analysis. To analyze dilute protein fractions or frac-\ntions containing high salt concentrations, samples were precipitated with an\nequal volume of cold 20% trichloroacetic acid and microcentrifuged at 15,000 3\ng at 4°C for 20 min, washed twice with cold acetone, and then air dried. Protein\npellets were redissolved in a mixture of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), SDS-PAGE\nsample buffer, and tracking dye. Alternatively, SDS-PAGE sample buffer and\ntracking dye were added directly to protein samples. The protein samples were\nthen separated by SDS-PAGE on 8, 10, 11, or 16% gels. Protein bands were\nvisualized by Coomassie or silver staining and by Western blotting. For Western\nblot analysis, proteins were first transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and\nimmunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to PMT, followed by secondary\ngoat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase. The images\nof gels and Western blots shown in Fig. 2 and 3 were obtained by using a ScanJet\n3C (Hewlett-Packard) with DeskScan II (Hewlett-Packard) image acquisition\nsoftware, and the graphics were produced by using Adobe Photoshop on an\nApple Macintosh G3 computer.\n\nRemoval of the His tag by thrombin treatment. The His tag peptide was\nremoved from recombinant toxin proteins possessing N-terminal His tags\n(rPMT, ToxAN2, and ToxAN3) by thrombin treatment. The His-tagged protein\n(4 to 5 mg) and biotinylated thrombin (5 U; Novagen) in thrombin cleavage\nbuffer (500 ml; 20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.4], 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2) were\nincubated at room temperature for 16 to 20 h. Completion of reaction was\nassessed by SDS-PAGE analysis. To terminate the reaction, streptavidin-agarose\nbeads (20 ml; Novagen) were added and the suspension was incubated for an\nadditional hour with gentle shaking. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation at\n400 3 g for 30 s, and the supernatant was diluted with Ni column buffer (1 to 2\nml) and passed twice through a 2- to 3-ml Ni21-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen)\nto remove the His tag peptide. Samples were desalted on PD-10 columns (Phar-\nmacia) against 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5% glycerol and concen-\ntrated in Centricon concentrators.\n\nQuantitation of recombinant toxin proteins. The concentration of His-tagged\nrPMT was determined by Coomassie Plus protein assay (Pierce), with bovine\nserum albumin as a standard. The concentration of the commercial native PMT\nsample was determined by image quantitation analysis of silver-stained SDS-\npolyacrylamide gels, using His-tagged rPMT as a standard. The concentrations of\nrPMT without the His tag, ToxAN2 without the His tag, ToxAN4, ToxAN5, and\nToxAC1 were determined by image quantitation analysis of the appropriate\nbands on Western blots with either anti-toxA28–42 or anti-toxA1239–1253 as the\nprimary antibody, using His-tagged rPMT as a standard. The concentrations of\nToxAN3 without the His tag, ToxAN6, ToxAN7, and ToxAC2 were determined\nby image quantitation analysis of the appropriate bands on Western blots with\neither anti-toxA28–42 or anti-toxA1239–1253 as the primary antibody, using\nToxAN4 as a standard. Western blots were imaged as described above, and\nimages were quantitated by using NIH Image (National Institutes of Health)\nimage analysis software and Microsoft Office Excel (Microsoft) data analysis\nsoftware.\n\nCell culture assays. Cultured cells were maintained at 37°C and 10% carbon\ndioxide in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco/BRL), pH 7.4,\nsupplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco/BRL) for\nVero cells and NIH 3T3 cells) or 15% heat-inactivated calf serum (Gibco/BRL)\nfor Swiss 3T3 cells, containing penicillin G (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100\nmg/ml) (Gibco/BRL). After trypsinization, cells were plated onto 12-well plates\n(Falcon) at a density of 4 3 104 (Vero cells) or 2 3 104 (Swiss 3T3 cells) per well,\nand incubation was continued with a change of medium after 24 h. Vero cells and\nSwiss 3T3 cells were allowed to reach confluency 5 days after plating, and then\nthe medium was changed to DMEM–1% fetal bovine or calf serum (pH 7.4)\ncontaining antibiotics. Two days after quiescence with low-serum media, the\nmedium was replaced with filter-sterilized, low-serum medium containing 200 ng\nof the native PMT, rPMT, and ToxAN4 proteins per ml, as well as controls\ncontaining the corresponding heat-inactivated proteins and no protein. The cells\nwere visualized after 1, 4, and 6 days of toxin exposure for morphological changes\nby phase-contrast microscopy using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope.\n\nHeat-inactivated controls of the protein samples were prepared by heating the\nsamples at 70°C for 45 min.\n\nTransfection of NIH 3T3 cells with mammalian expression plasmids contain-\ning an N-terminal fragment of PMT or green fluorescent protein (GEP). Cells\nwere cotransfected with a 1:1 ratio of pCR3-Uni(1&3) and pEGFP-N1 or with\npEGFP-N1 alone, using LipofectAMINE reagent (Gibco/BRL) according to the\nmanufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, NIH 3T3 cells were\nplated at a density of 2 3 105 cells/well on six-well plates in antibiotic-free\nmedium. DNA plasmids (1 mg of each) in 100 ml of Opti-MEM (Gibco/BRL) and\n4 ml of LipofectAMINE reagent in 100 ml of Opti-MEM were combined, incu-\nbated at room temperature for 15 min, and then added to each well containing\n800 ml of Opti-MEM. After 3 h of incubation at 37°C, 1 ml of antibiotic-free,\nlow-serum medium was added, and cells were further incubated at 37°C for 24 h\nprior to staining and visualization.\n\nFluorescence staining of transfected NIH 3T3 cells expressing an N-terminal\nfragment of PMT. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline\n(PBS), fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, washed with PBS,\npermeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, washed twice with\nPBS, incubated for 1 h at room temperature with TRITC-conjugated phalloidin\n(2 mM; Sigma) in PBS, washed twice with PBS, and visualized by fluorescence\nmicroscopy using an Olympus IX-70 inverted microscope, equipped with U-\nMWB and U-MWIG fluorescence cubes for observing GFP and TRITC, respec-\ntively. Images were captured by using NIH Image 1.61, and micrographs were\ngenerated by using Adobe Photoshop 4.0.\n\nOocyte preparation. Adult female X. laevis frogs (Xenopus I) were anesthe-\ntized by immersion in a 0.1% tricaine methanesulfonate (Sigma), adjusted to pH\n7.4 with NaHCO3. A small incision was made on one side of the abdomen to\nremove several ovarian lobes. The lobes were gently torn apart and immersed in\na Ca21-free OR-2 solution (100 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM\nHEPES-Tris [pH 7.5]). Oocytes were defolliculated by incubation with collage-\nnase (2 mg/ml; Sigma type 1A) at room temperature (22 to 24°C) for 1 to 2 h. The\noocytes were then washed five times with OR-2 solution and five times with a\nmodified Barth’s solution [88 mM NaCl–1 mM KCl–2.4 mM NaHCO3–0.3 mM\nCa(NO3)2–0.4 mM CaCl2–0.8 mM MgSO4–15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) containing\npenicillin G (100 mg/ml) and streptomycin (100 mg/ml)]. Stage 5–6 oocytes were\nselected and stored at 18°C in modified Barth’s solution.\n\nTwo-microelectrode voltage clamp. Two microelectrodes, made by a vertical\npuller (model PP-83, Narishige) and filled with 3 M KCl to give a resistance of\n1.5 to 2.0 megaohms, were used for voltage clamping. Voltage clamp experiments\nwere performed in a continuously perfused bath (10 ml/min) at room tempera-\nture (22 to 24°C). The bath was connected through an Ag-AgCl-agar-3 M KCl\nbridge to the two-electrode voltage clamp system (TEV-200 voltage clamp;\nDagan). Membrane currents were measured in normal Ringer’s solution (96 mM\nNaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 11.8 mM CaCl2, 5 mM HEPES-NaOH [pH 7.4]).\nData acquisition was performed by using MacLab/8s (ADInstruments) linked to\na Macintosh Quadra 800 computer with Chart and Scope application software\n(ADInstruments). Graphics were obtained by using Cricket Graph III (Comput-\ner Associates).\n\nOocyte microinjections. Microinjections of toxins, toxin fragments, and anti-\nbodies were performed under voltage-clamped conditions at 280-mV holding\npotential, using a pulse-controlled microinjector (Dagan model PMI-200). Tox-\nins and other reagents were prepared in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5%\nglycerol prior to injection. For experiments involving anti-toxA28–42 inhibition of\nToxAN4, protein A-purified antibodies were passed through a PD10 column in\n50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) with 5% glycerol and concentrated such that an equal\nvolume could neutralize the rPMT response in oocytes. This antibody prepara-\ntion was then incubated in a 1:1 ratio with ToxAN4 on ice for 1 h prior to\ninjection.\n\nData analysis and determination of EC50s. In all experiments reported here,\neach group of oocytes was tested for positive responses elicited by rPMT. All\nresults are expressed as the mean 6 standard error of the maximal inward\ncurrent assayed in oocytes from the same donor group. For the titration exper-\niments, the same group of oocytes from a given donor was used for all doses\ntested. The number of oocytes used for data analysis at each dose is given in\nparentheses in Fig. 5. Fifty percent effective concentrations (EC50s) were calcu-\nlated with SigmaPlot (Jandell Scientific) by fitting data points to a logistic func-\ntion f(x) 5 a/{1 1 exp[b*(x 2 c)]}, where a is the maximum response observed,\nb is the slope, and c is the EC50. The EC50 curves shown in Fig. 5 were plotted\nby using Cricket Graph III (Computer Associates).\n\nProtein sequence and structure comparison between PMT and the CNFs and\nDNT. Primary sequence comparison between PMT, CNF1, CNF2, and DNT was\nperformed by using the BestFit sequence analysis program from the Genetics\nComputer Group Wisconsin Package with BLOSUM30 and BLOSUM62 amino\nacid alignment scoring matrices. The secondary structure prediction for PMT\nand CNF1 was performed with the GOR-IV program available at http://absalpha\n.dcrt.nih.gov:8008/gor.html. The area plot shown in Fig. 7 was generated from\nthe GOR-IV analysis results, with an additional smoothing window of 11 amino\nacid residues for the helical probability, 5 amino acid residues for the extended\nstrand probability, and the remainder for the coil probability.\n\n82 WILSON ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nConstruction of N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mu-\ntants of PMT. To define the specific region of PMT responsible\nfor activation of the intracellular Gqa-PLCb1-IP3 signaling\npathway, we cloned the toxA gene, encoding the full-length\nPMT protein, and designed a series of N- and C-terminal\ndeletion mutants (Fig. 1). Expression plasmids containing the\nentire toxA gene or various deletion fragments thereof were\nconstructed by using PCR and conventional cloning tech-\nniques. A plasmid containing the full-length toxA gene, pTHC-\ntoxA, was generated by splicing three overlapping toxA frag-\nments from cloning vectors containing the corresponding PCR\nproducts, pET15b-toxAN1, pCR3-Uni(1&3), and pCR3-Uni\n(4&5). The N- and C-terminal deletion mutants were obtained\nfrom regions of the toxA gene encoding the N- and C-terminal\nportions of the PMT protein. The deletion mutants were de-\nsigned such that all regions of the entire protein would be\nincluded in at least one of the deletion fragments. The\nToxAN4 fragment containing the N-terminal 568 amino acids\nof PMT included the region showing homology with the CNFs.\nSequentially shorter N-terminal fragments, which could be\nused to further define the activity domain, were also designed;\nthese included the N-terminal 505, 450, 400, 300, 293, and 93\namino acids of PMT (ToxAN2, ToxAN5, ToxAN6, ToxAN7,\nToxAN1, and ToxAN3, respectively). The two C-terminal frag-\nments included the C-terminal 780 amino acids of PMT\n(ToxAC1) and the C-terminal 226 amino acids (ToxAC2). The\nvarious toxA deletion fragments were subcloned into E. coli\nexpression vectors which incorporated a His tag affinity handle\nat either the N- or C terminus of the protein, as indicated in\nFig. 1.\n\nExpression, purification, and quantitation of rPMT and\nPMT deletion mutant proteins. We expressed the recombinant\ntoxin proteins under IPTG-inducible promoters in E. coli as\n\nHis-tagged fusion peptides for ease in purification. The His tag\nallowed for essentially one-step purification of the proteins,\nthereby reducing the amount of sample handling and decreas-\ning the likelihood of protein denaturation or inactivation. Dur-\ning the course of our initial studies, we observed that the His\ntag placed at the N terminus of rPMT interfered with the\nactivity of the protein in the Xenopus oocyte assay system, as\nwell as in tissue culture assays (data not shown). Hence, fol-\nlowing Ni21 chelate chromatography, we opted to remove the\nHis tag by thrombin cleavage from all of the N-terminal frag-\nments having His tag at their N-termini, including rPMT,\nToxAN1, ToxAN2, and ToxAN3. The ToxAN1 protein with a\nHis tag at the N terminus was difficult to purify (Fig. 2) and was\nnot stable to subsequent thrombin treatment, and we could not\nobtain quantities adequate to assay for activity. ToxAN7 was\nsimilar in length to ToxAN1. The His tag was placed at the C\ntermini of ToxAN4, ToxAN5, ToxAN6, and ToxAN7. The\nC-terminal His tag was not removed from these recombinant\nproteins. For ToxAC1 and ToxAC2, the N-terminal His tag\nwas placed at the N terminus but was not removed.\n\nThe degree of purification achieved by use of the His tag\naffinity handle varied somewhat among the proteins. Repre-\nsentative Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels and\nWestern blots of each of the toxin samples used in this study\nare shown in Fig. 2. Because of the differences in sample\npurity, we chose to quantitate the protein concentration of\neach toxin sample by Western blot analysis, comparing the\nsample against a standard curve generated from purified His-\ntagged rPMT or ToxAN4 of known concentration.\n\nComparison of rPMT with native PMT. Figure 3 shows a\nsilver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of rPMT before and af-\nter thrombin cleavage in comparison to native PMT from two\ndifferent sources. Anti-toxA28–42 and anti-toxA1239–1253 were\nreactive with recombinant toxin samples in Western blots (Fig.\n2). Native and recombinant toxins gave comparable responses\n\nFIG. 2.

MULTOCIDA TOXIN DELETION MUTATION ANALYSIS 83\n\n\n\nin oocyte experiments (Fig. 4A and B), although the highly\npurified PMT and rPMT samples were at least 20-fold more\nactive than the commercial native PMT sample. However, af-\nter determining the concentrations of the impure native PMT\nsamples by analyzing silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels,\nusing purified rPMT as a standard, we found that the commer-\ncial native PMT was as active as rPMT. When the EC50s were\nadjusted accordingly, the native and recombinant toxins exhib-\nited similar responses in oocytes, with EC50s of 5.2 and 3.6\nfmol/oocyte, respectively (Fig. 5A and B). Anti-toxA28–42, but\nnot anti-toxA1239–1253, specifically inhibited the activities of\nboth native and recombinant toxin samples in oocyte experi-\nments (reference 43 and data not shown). As depicted in Fig.\n6, rPMT caused dramatic morphological effects on confluent,\nquiescent Vero cells, showing focus formation surrounded by\nenlarged cells, as well as proliferative effects on confluent,\nquiescent Swiss 3T3 cells. Native PMT caused similar effects\n(data not shown), although the rPMT sample consistently ap-\npeared to be more potent than the commercial native PMT sam-\nple. The results from these studies are summarized in Table 1.\n\nActivities of N- and C-terminal deletion fragments of PMT.\nThe C-terminal PMT fragments, ToxAC1 and ToxAC2, and\nthe smaller N-terminal fragments, ToxAN3, ToxAN6, and\nToxAN7, exhibited no detectable responses in the oocyte assay\nat concentrations as high as 1 pmol/oocyte. In contrast, ToxAN4,\nconsisting of the N-terminal 568 amino acids, gave reproduc-\nible responses in oocytes (Fig. 4C) with an EC50 of 22 fmol/\noocyte (Fig. 5C), compared to 3.6 fmol/oocyte for the full-\nlength rPMT. ToxAN2, consisting of the N-terminal 505 amino\n\nacids, also showed a reproducible activity (Fig. 4D), with an\nEC50 of 140 fmol/oocyte (Fig. 5D), about 40-fold lower than\nthat for full-length rPMT. ToxAN5, consisting of the N-termi-\nnal 450 amino acids, gave detectable responses in oocytes (Fig.\n4E), but the responses were so weak that it was not possible to\naccurately determine an EC50 for this mutant protein with\ninjection of as much as 3 pmol. Unlike the full-length rPMT,\nnone of the N- or C-terminal deletion mutants exhibited an\neffect on cultured Vero cells (data not shown). The results\nfrom these studies are summarized in Table 1.\n\nTo determine whether the N terminus of PMT could also\ntrigger downstream signaling events in mammalian fibroblasts,\nleading to changes in cellular morphology, a mammalian ex-\npression plasmid containing the N-terminal 521 amino acids of\nPMT under the cytomegalovirus promoter was cotransfected\ninto NIH 3T3 cells along with a reporter plasmid containing\nGFP under the same promoter. In vitro translation assays\nusing pCR3-Uni(1&3) were also performed to ensure that the\nconstruct was indeed capable of expressing truncated toxin\nprotein (data not shown). We found that cells cotransfected\nwith both plasmids underwent significant morphological re-\nsponses compared to control cells transfected with reporter\nplasmid alone. As shown in Fig. 7, control cells expressing only\nthe GFP protein have a characteristic spread-out fibroblast\nmorphology, whereas cells expressing the N-terminal fragment\nof PMT and GFP have a more retracted and spindly appearance,\nwith evidence of more intense TRITC-phalloidin staining.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nEvidence from previous studies suggests that the mode of\naction of PMT involves binding to cell surface receptors and\ninternalization via receptor-mediated endocytosis (34, 36), fol-\n\nFIG. 4. Toxin-induced Ca21-dependent Cl2 currents in Xenopus oocytes.\nShown are representative traces of strong responses elicited in voltage-clamped\noocytes injected with native PMT (2 fmol; A), rPMT (21 fmol; B), ToxAN4 (330\nfmol; C), ToxAN2 (520 fmol; D), and ToxAN5 (1,320 fmol; E). I1 denotes the\nfirst peak current from mobilization of intracellular Ca21; I2 denotes the second\npeak current from Ca21 influx through capacitative Ca21 channels on the plasma\nmembrane.\n\nFIG. 5. EC50 curves for toxin proteins. Shown are curves of the dose depen-\ndence of the toxin-induced response in voltage-clamped oocytes for native PMT\n(A), rPMT (B), ToxAN4 (C), and ToxAN2 (D). The mean 6 standard error of\nthe relative response induced by injection of toxin is shown for each data point,\nwith the total number of oocytes tested for each point given in parentheses. Since\nthe average maximal response observed varied from donor group to donor\ngroup, all data points for each EC50 curve were obtained with the same batch of\noocytes from a single donor. EC50s were determined from the data by using\nSigmaPlot (see Materials and Methods) and are summarized in Table 1.\n\n84 WILSON ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nlowed by activation of various signaling pathways (29, 30, 38–\n40, 43), leading eventually to morphological and proliferative\nevents (9, 17, 18, 21, 24, 29, 36). In our earlier studies, we\ndemonstrated that intact PMT protein could directly activate\nthe Gqa-PLCb1-IP3 signaling pathway in Xenopus oocytes\n\n(43). Using this system, we bypassed the cell-binding and in-\nternalization process by direct microinjection of the toxin,\napparently without the requirement for further intracellular\nprocessing or activation. In the present work, we report the\ncloning, expression, and purification of fully active recombi-\nnant PMT from E. coli. This full-length recombinant protein\nhas an activity in oocytes similar to that of the native toxin\nisolated from P. multocida. We have also shown that rPMT has\nan effect on cultured Vero cells similar to that of the native\ntoxin.\n\nWe have demonstrated that a recombinant deletion mutant\nconsisting of the N-terminal 568 amino acids of PMT could\nelicit a PMT-like response in oocytes, while two mutants con-\nsisting of the C-terminal 780 and 226 amino acids gave no\ndetectable response at higher doses. Weaker responses were\nalso observed with mutants consisting of the N-terminal 505\nand 450 amino acids but not with shorter N-terminal frag-\nments. We thus conclude that the functional domain respon-\nsible for activating the intracellular Gqa-PLCb1-IP3 signaling\npathway in Xenopus oocytes is localized to the N terminus of\nPMT.\n\nThe N-terminal 500 residues of PMT have 24 to 27% ho-\nmology to the N-terminal 500 residues of CNF1 and CNF2 (10,\n31). As can be seen from the area plot shown in Fig. 8, the\npredicted secondary structures of PMT and CNF1 also have\nlimited similarity in this region, particularly in the region with\n\nFIG. 6. Effects of recombinant PMT on confluent, quiescent Swiss 3T3 and Vero cells. Shown are representative phase-contrast micrographs of confluent, quiescent\nSwiss 3T3 (left-hand pairs of panels) and Vero cells (right-hand pairs of panels) treated as described in Materials and Methods without (A to C and G to I) or with\n(D to F and J to L) rPMT (200 ng/well) for 18 h (A, D, G, and J), 96 h (B, E, H, and K), or 144 h (C, F, I, and L).\n\nTABLE 1.

MULTOCIDA TOXIN DELETION MUTATION ANALYSIS 85\n\n\n\n30% homology between residues 200 and 450 of PMT. We\nhave shown that deletion mutations made within this con-\nserved region resulted in loss of intracellular activity. With\nlocalization of the intracellular activity domain to the N-ter-\nminal 500 amino acid residues of PMT, the sequence and\nstructural similarity in the N-terminal region between the two\ntoxins suggests that CNF1 and CNF2 may have an intracellular\nactivity similar to that of PMT. However, there are sufficient\ndifferences between the toxins within this region, as indicated\nin the secondary structure prediction profiles (Fig. 8), for it to\nbe feasible that they have different intracellular activities and\ntarget preferences. CNF1 and CNF2 possess deamidase activ-\nity on RhoA (11, 19, 31, 37). The deamidase activity domain of\nCNF1 has been reported to be located in the C-terminal 300\nresidues (27), which shares about 20% homology with the\nC-terminal 300 residues of DNT but has no discernible se-\nquence similarity with PMT. It is possible that the N-terminal\nregion of CNF1 with homology to the N-terminal region of\n\nPMT possesses an intracellular activity different from the ac-\ntivity associated with the C-terminal 300 residues of CNF1.\n\nIn our previous study (43), we showed that antibodies spe-\ncific for the N terminus of PMT blocked the PMT-induced\nresponse in oocytes, but antibodies against the C terminus did\nnot. The N-terminal toxin fragments ToxAN4 and ToxAN2 are\nable to elicit responses in oocytes similar to those elicited by\nfull-length rPMT. Antibodies to the N terminus of PMT also\nblocked the ToxAN4-induced response in oocytes, yet ToxAN4\nhad no effect on cultured Vero cells. Moreover, none of the\ndeletion mutants exhibited an effect on Vero cells. This is\nconsistent with earlier findings that deletion mutants lacking\nN-terminal (D28-149 and D175-247) or C-terminal (D1130-\n1285) portions of the PMT protein had no toxic activity in\nassays for cytopathicity on embryonic bovine lung (EBL) cells,\ndermonecrosis in guinea pigs, or mouse lethality (33). Previous\nstudies also showed that monoclonal antibodies recognizing an\nepitope in the C-terminal 155 amino acids of PMT blocked the\ncytopathic effect of PMT on EBL cells (13, 33). The C-terminal\nfragments ToxAC1 and ToxAC2 were inactive in the oocyte\nassay and had no effect on cultured Vero cells, thus supporting\nthe notion that only the N terminus of PMT has intracellular\nactivity and the C terminus of PMT is required for toxin entry\ninto cells. Further study is required to determine the precise\nbiochemical activity of PMT that induces the Gqa-PLCb1-IP3\nsignaling pathway and to understand how this PMT-associated\nactivity and the CNF-associated deamidase activity could result\nin the observed changes in cells caused by these toxins.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by grant AI38396 from the National Insti-\ntutes of Health/NIAID (to B.A.W.).\n\nWe thank Xinjun Zhu, Brooke Murphy, Tina Caserta, April\nBuehler, James Burgett, and Jennifer Williams for technical assistance.\nWe especially thank Adrian Corbett for helpful discussions and gen-\nerous assistance in setting up the electrophysiological equipment,\nHangjun Zhan for helpful discussions and assistance in the initial\ncloning stages of this project, and Steven Berberich for assistance with\nin vitro translation assays.
