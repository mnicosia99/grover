JQ1, a chemical compound that inhibits MYC\nexpression is therapeutically effective in preclinical animal models in midline carcinoma, and Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL). Here\nwe show that JQ1 does not inhibit MYC expression to a similar extent in all tumor cells. The BL cells showed a ,90%\ndecrease in MYC transcription upon treatment with JQ1, however, no corresponding reduction was seen in several non-BL\ncells. Molecularly, these differences appear due to requirements of Brd4, the most active version of the Positive\nTranscription Elongation Factor B (P-TEFb) within the Super Elongation Complex (SEC), and transcription factors such as\nGdown1, and MED26 and also other unknown cell specific factors. Our study demonstrates that the regulation of high levels\nof MYC expression in different cancer cells is driven by unique regulatory mechanisms and that such exclusive regulatory\nsignatures in each cancer cells could be employed for targeted therapeutics.\n\nCitation: Fowler T, Ghatak P, Price DH, Conaway R, Conaway J, et al.

The two most\n\ncommon forms of aggressive NHL are diffuse large B cell\n\nlymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL) [1,2,3].\n\nTranslocation of the proto-oncogene MYC into one of the\n\nimmunoglobulin gene loci [IG-MYC translocation; mostly of the\n\nt(8;14)q24;q32 type] resulting in aberrant MYC expression is\n\nregarded as the dominant genetic event in the genesis of BL and\n\nabout 10% of DLBCL [4]. Besides translocation, MYC can\n\nundergo oncogenic deregulation via high-level gene amplification\n\nas well as mutations in cis-regulatory elements in several cancer\n\ntypes (e.g., myeloma, colon carcinoma and neuroblastoma) [5,6].\n\nMoreover, while most BLs have deregulated c-MYC (henceforth\n\nreferred to as MYC) expression as a consequence of an IG-MYC\n\ntranslocation, the majority of non-BLs do not carry IG-MYC\n\ntranslocations, but other genetic abnormalities leading to dereg-\n\nulated MYC expression. Though high expression is restricted to\n\nBLs, MYC target expression varies on a lower level across non-BL\n\nand intermediate lymphomas and constitutes a negative prognostic\n\nmarker in these lymphomas.\n\nMYC dimerizes with MAX to bind its target sequence (E-box)\n\nand regulate gene expression. MYC not only activates transcrip-\n\ntion but also represses target gene expression either via direct\n\nbiding (with Miz-1 transcription factor) or via regulation of micro-\n\nRNAs (miRs) [7]. However, the function of MYC is complicated\n\nas two recent studies show that MYC does not have a specific\n\ntranscriptional signature but serves to amplify the output of\n\nexisting transcriptional programs in a given cell rather than\n\nexecuting its own transcriptional program [8,9].\n\nMYC belongs to a class of genes called Primary Response Genes\n\n(PRGs) many of which harbor paused Pol II at the proximal\n\npromoter area that upon activation can quickly switch to an\n\nelongating Pol II and functional transcription [10]. Signal\n\ndependent stimulation results in enhanced acetylation at histone\n\n3 lysine 14 (H3K14Ac) and either of two H4 lysine pairs, H4K5/\n\n12 or H4K8/16, an event which appears crucial for the binding of\n\nbromodomain (BRD) proteins that recruit transcription factors\n\nnecessary for transcription [11,12]. Recruitment of positive\n\ntranscription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), and possibly the\n\ngeneral initiation cofactor Mediator, plays an important role in\n\nBrd4-regulated transcription of many genes including MYC.\n\nIndeed, after recruitment by Brd4, P-TEFb phosphorylates the\n\nelongation factors DSIF (Spt4 and Spt5), negative elongation\n\nfactor (NELF), and Pol II resulting in release of paused Pol II and\n\nsubsequent elongation of transcription [10,13] and recently\n\nreviewed in [14]. Collectively, these and other results suggest that\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e87003\n\n\n\nelongation of transcription is a critical regulatory point in\n\norchestrating MYC regulation [10].\n\nAs many MYC-driven processes are required for homeostasis\n\nand growth, therapeutic strategies geared towards modulation of\n\nMYC expression rather than outright suppression seem attractive.\n\nThe Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation first described\n\nthienodiazepine analogs that potently inhibit chromatin binding\n\nof bromodomains related to the BET family [15]. Subsequently, a\n\nclosely related small molecule inhibitor, JQ1, has been found to be\n\ntherapeutically effective in pre-clinical animal models [16,17,18].\n\nThese and related small molecules competitively occupy the\n\nacetyl-binding pockets of BET bromodomains, resulting in release\n\nof BET proteins (in particular Brd4) from chromatin [19]. Despite\n\nthese promising demonstrations, JQ1 does not inhibit MYC\n\nexpression to a similar extent in all tumor cells [19]. Thus, it is\n\nimportant to understand why JQ1 is effective in only certain MYC-\n\ndependent cancers, which may ultimately determine clinical\n\nefficacy of this compound in patients.\n\nWe observed that although JQ1 treatment decreased Brd4\n\noccupancy to a similar degree in the cell types tested, the ability of\n\nJQ1 to reduce MYC transcription between cells differed. In JQ1-\n\nsensitive cells, inhibition occurred at the level of nascent\n\ntranscription affecting Pol II, ‘‘paused’’ Pol II-Ser5-P, ‘‘elongat-\n\ning’’ Pol II-Ser2-P, and P-TEFb occupancy. Furthermore, there is\n\na difference in the occupancy of members of the Super Elongation\n\nComplex (SEC), and factors associated with RNA Polymerase II,\n\nat MYC promoter regions in the two cell types. Collectively, our\n\ndata indicate high levels of MYC are maintained in different cancer\n\ncells via distinct mechanisms at the level of transcription\n\nelongation with different compliments of transcription factors\n\nand are therefore subjected to different JQ1 sensitivity.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell Culture\nThe mature mouse B cell lymphoma BAL17 [20], human BL\n\nlines Akata [21], Raji [22], and Ramos [23], and human epithelial\n\nline HeLa-S3 [24] were cultured in RPMI media with HEPES\n\n(Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 U/ml Penicillin, 100 mg/ml\nStreptomycin, 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate, 0.5 mM 2-Mercaptoeth-\n\nanol solution (Invitrogen) and 10% Fetal Calf Sera (Atlanta\n\nBiologicals). RNA based assays used 1–26106 cells and 26107 cells\nwere used for Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP). JQ1,\n\nsolubilized in DMSO, was diluted into media at 1 mM and\nincubated with cells for 2 hours at 37uC. No effects on\ntranscription were observed with DMSO controls (data not\n\nshown). Experiments shown in Figure S1 (File S1) involving\n\nBCR stimulation consisted of a 2 hr pre-treatment with 1 mM JQ1\nfollowed by 30 minutes of exposure to antibody fragments specific\n\nfor either human or mouse BCR (Jackson Immunoresearch).\n\nRNA-Real Time PCR Analysis\nPerformed as previously described [25].

The University of California Santa\n\nCruz Genome Web Browser setting normalized to the highest\n\npeak at the TSS.\n\nResults\n\nDifferential JQ1 Sensitivity\nWe performed dose- and time-dependent testing of Brd4\n\ninhibition with JQ1 and noted the effect on MYC transcription\n\nin a variety of cells including HeLa-S3 cells, whose MYC\n\nexpression was reported [19] to be resistant to JQ1 treatment.\n\nShown in Fig. 1A, tested cell lines express MYC at high levels,\n\ncomparable to levels detected at the peak of primary naı̈ve resting\n\nB cell induction (data not shown). Steady state mRNA levels of\n\nMYC in a non-BL murine B cell lymphoma line (BAL17) that over\n\nexpresses MYC at levels similar to the BL cells and HeLa cells\n\nshowed no significant sensitivity to JQ1 (Fig. 1A). Both HeLa and\n\nBAL17 cells continued this resistance at concentrations up to\n\n5 mM (data not shown), while MYC RNA in BL cells was uniformly\ndecreased by ,90% when treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for a period\nof two hours (Fig. 1A). BL cells are reported to express 2- to 5-fold\n\nmore MYC-specific RNA than B-cell lines without a translocation\n\n[30]. Although Western blotting d indicate the Raji BL line\n\nexpresses more MYC protein, consistent with the mRNA data\n\n(Fig. 1A), JQ1 treatment decreased MYC protein expression in\n\nRaji but not HeLa and BAL17 (data not shown). Together these\n\nresults demonstrated that JQ1 resistance occurred in both non-\n\nlymphoma and lymphoma cell lines representing both murine and\n\nhuman species.\n\nBecause mRNA production may not necessarily correlate with\n\nprimary transcript production [25,31], we tested the effect of JQ1\n\non primary transcription. Analysis of primary transcript, per-\n\nformed with primers against the exon/intron borders of MYC\n\n(schematically represented in Supplemental Fig. 3 and/or listed in\n\nMaterials and Methods), showed that primary transcription\n\nsensitivity to JQ1 was parallel to that of mRNA (Fig. 1B). Thus,\n\nlong, and presumably full-length, primary transcripts were either\n\nresistant (BAL17 or HeLa) or sensitive (Raji) to JQ1. Therefore,\n\nthe difference in JQ1 responses correlated with primary transcrip-\n\ntion and did not occur at the level of post-transcriptional\n\nmodification, such as splicing and mRNA or protein stability.\n\nDivergent transcription is common of many promoters in\n\norganisms and plays an important role in gene regulation [32].\n\nIndeed, antisense transcription from the MYC locus has been\n\nobserved in several cell lines [33]. Because we only measured total\n\nsteady state RNA (Fig. 1A), whether differential JQ1 sensitivity\n\nreflects differences in possible transcription originating from the 39\n\nend was tested. Although antisense transcription in both BAL17\n\nFigure 3. Effects of JQ1 on P-TEFb occupancy. BAL17 and Raji cells were either untreated or treated with 1 mM of JQ1 for 2 hours.

Regardless, like sense transcription, antisense\n\ntranscription originating from the MYC locus in Raji cells was\n\ninhibited by JQ1 (Fig. 1C, right panel). Therefore, although more\n\nantisense transcription was noted in Raji cells, the difference in\n\nJQ1 sensitivity was not likely due to differences in antisense\n\ntranscripts.\n\nJQ1 Leads to Decreased Brd4 Occupancy in Resistant and\nSensitive Cells\n\nWe observed that Brd4 recruitment was reduced by JQ1 in both\n\ncell types–therefore, the difference in JQ1 sensitivity between\n\ndifferent cells was not due to permeability. We also observed that\n\nBrd4 recruitment to the transcription start site (TSS) was roughly\n\n2.5 fold more in Raji (+11) cells compared to BAL17 (+17)\n(Fig. 2A). HeLa exhibited Brd4 recruitment and JQ1 sensitivity\n\nsimilar to BAL17 (data not shown). Moreover, a significant\n\namount of Brd4 occupancy was noted across the body of MYC in\n\nall the cells tested, though there was a higher level of coding region\n\noccupancy in BAL17 cells. Though commonly associated with 59-\n\nend enhancers and promoters, Brd4 has been shown to occupy the\n\ncoding region of PRGs such as c-fos and MYC [26].\n\nPromoter recruitment of Brd4 requires phosphorylation at S484\n\nand S488 and deletion of this region results in decreased CycT and\n\nPol II occupancy and transcription [26]. Consistent with the ChIP\n\nassay, Western blotting showed a higher level of total Brd4 in Raji\n\nnuclear extracts compared to HeLa and BAL17, although Brd4-\n\nS484P/S488P in Raji cells was slightly less compared to BAL17\n\nand HeLa (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the P-BRD4 band in HeLa cells\n\nmigrated faster than either the Raji or BAL17 P-Brd4 band,\n\nperhaps reflecting a slight difference in the extent or site of\n\nphosphorylation. However, the difference in phosphorylated Brd4\n\n(the active form) between different cells might not explain the\n\ndifferences in JQ1 sensitivity.\n\nBrd4 interacts with factors that either recruit Pol II to the site of\n\ntranscription or drive the transcriptional complex from pausing to\n\nFigure 4.

Additionally, a reduction\n\nof functional Brd4 resulting in greatly reduced Pol II occupancy\n\nwas shown to involve a loss of P-TEFb [26]. Although the level\n\nand pattern of P-TEFb occupancy in both untreated JQ1 sensitive\n\nand resistant cell types were similar, JQ1 treatment/Brd4\n\ninhibition decreased P-TEFb occupancy only in Raji cells\n\n(Fig. 3). These results indicated levels of BRD4 dependence for\n\nmaintaining P-TEFb occupancy vary in different cell lines (Fig. 3).\n\nRNA Pol II Recruitment\nWe next determined if the difference in JQ1 selectivity was due\n\nto a difference in general transcription apparatus recruitment,\n\nrepresented by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). While total Pol II was\n\ngreatly decreased across the body of MYC in Raji cells upon JQ1\n\ntreatment, it was not altered in the JQ1 resistant BAL17 line\n\n(Fig. 4A). Both cell types showed Pol II occupancy at the P0\npromoter, which has been shown to correlate with a very high\n\nlevel of transcription [34]. Many actively transcribed genes\n\n(including MYC) exhibit paused Pol II at their proximal promoters\n\n[35]. Consistent with this notion, we observed a high level of\n\npromoter-associated Pol II in both cell types, although two-fold\n\nmore Pol II was noted at the proximal promoter (roughly\n\ncorresponding to the P0 promoter region) in BAL17 (2354)\n\ncompared to Raji (2279). Interestingly, as noted with Brd4 and P-\n\nTEFb (Figs. 3 and 4), total Pol II was reduced at a site immediately\n\ndownstream (+0.6 kb) of the TSS and sharply increased afterward\n(Fig. 4A).\n\nBecause phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain\n\n(CTD) of RNA Pol II is associated with regulation of transcription\n\ninitiation and elongation at many promoters [36,37], we analyzed\n\nthese events in the two cell types in the absence and presence of\n\nJQ1. While RNA Pol II phospho-Ser5 (Pol II S5P) levels in BAL17\n\ncells remained stable after JQ1 treatment, Pol II S5P levels in Raji\n\ncells were sensitive to JQ1 (Fig. 4B). However, surprisingly, Pol II\n\nS5P levels were refractory at P0 and TSS sites (Fig. 4B, right panel)\n\nbut sensitive in the latter half of the gene with a small change\n\nstarting downstream of the MYC P3 promoter (+2244) and\nbecoming increasingly sensitive further down the body of the gene.\n\nWhether the substantial amount of Pol II-Ser5P 39 occupancy\n\nshown here is directly due to 39 Brd4 occupancy or an\n\noverabundance of transcription complexes ‘‘backing up’’ resulting\n\nin reduced elongation and subsequent pausing at the 39 terminus is\n\nunknown.\n\nWhile Ser5 phosphorylation is associated with a competent but\n\npaused Pol II, Ser2 phosphorylation of the Pol II CTD (Pol II S2P)\n\nrepresents elongating Pol II [37]. In the absence of JQ1, Pol II S2P\n\noccupancy in both cell types occurred across the body of the gene\n\nwith peaks at the promoter regions, and the 39 end. Surprisingly,\n\nwhile promoter- and TSS-associated Pol II S2P levels in Raji cells\n\nwere sensitive to JQ1, downstream regions past P3 exhibited no\n\nJQ1 sensitivity until past the 39 UTR (+5472) (Fig. 4C), suggesting\nthat the majority of fully elongating RNA polymerase II in these\n\nJQ1 sensitive cells was refractory to JQ1. We also observed a JQ1-\n\ndependent increase in Pol II-Ser2P in the BAL17 line and while\n\nthis increase was slight at the promoter and TSS regions, it was\n\nvery clear at the 39 terminus.\n\nDifferences in H3K36me3\nOne possible way to delineate between upstream and down-\n\nstream effects on Pol II-Ser2 occupancy is to determine the pattern\n\nof tri-methylation of the histone 3 residue lysine 36, H3K36me3,\n\nwhich is indicative of a recently passing elongating transcription\n\ncomplex [37]. In BAL17 cells, JQ1 treatment enhanced the\n\nH3K36me3 signals across the gene (Fig. 5). But in Raji cells, JQ1\n\ntreatment decreased H3K36me3 from P0 through TSS until the\n\nP3 region. However, beyond P3, the H3K36me3 became\n\nrefractory to JQ1 (Fig. 5) as observed with Pol II S2P (Fig. 4C),\n\nsuggesting that once RNA Pol II was in elongation mode, it was\n\nFigure 5.

Together, our data showed that MYC harbored\n\ntranscription complexes with variable Brd4 dependency in\n\ndifferent cell types and that Brd4 inhibition resulted in a\n\ndifferential response at the level of transition from pausing to\n\nelongation.\n\nAccessory Transcription Elongation Factors\nP-TEFb frequently functions as a subunit of Super Elongation\n\nComplexes (SEC), consisting of P-TEFb and a mixture of one of\n\nthree ELL family members, one of two EAF family members, one\n\nof two AF4 family members (AFF1 and AFF4), and either ENL or\n\nAF9 [29,38]. As the SEC family of Pol II elongation factors are\n\nreported to contain the most catalytically active versions of P-\n\nTEFb active in high-level transcription and to regulate a\n\ncheckpoint stage of transcription associated with elongation\n\n[29,39,40], we looked at SEC recruitment at MYC in different\n\ncell types. AFF4 is reported to serve as a central binding platform\n\nfor elongation factors in many SEC formations and to target MYC\n\nand regulate its expression in cancer cells [39]. The level of AFF4\n\noccupancy in BAL17 cells was low and refractory to JQ1 (Fig. 6A,\n\ntop panel) but increased in the presence of JQ1. In contrast, AFF4\n\nrecruitment in Raji cells was much greater and sensitive to JQ1.\n\nAlthough the AFF4 promoter occupancy in Raji cells, particularly\n\naround 2244 site, was variable in the absence of JQ1, it was\n\nsignificantly decreased in the presence of JQ1. Moreover,\n\nconsistent with the Pol II S2P and H3K36me3 results, JQ1\n\nsensitivity was lost past the P3 promoter region (+2244), once again\nsuggesting that the elongating transcription complex was refrac-\n\ntory to JQ1 (Fig. 6A, bottom panel).\n\nWe subsequently looked at occupancy of another SEC\n\ncomponent, ELL2, which has been reported to play a role in\n\nthe transition from paused Pol II to elongation [40]. We also tested\n\noccupancy of the Mediator component (MED26) as well as\n\nGdown1. Though first linked to initiation, a role for Mediator in\n\nrecruiting Pol II transcription elongation factors and phosphory-\n\nlation of the Pol II CTD regulating Pol II pausing and elongation\n\nhas emerged [41]. The Mediator complex most strongly associated\n\nwith Pol II includes MED26, which has been shown to increase\n\nactivation of transcription in vitro to a greater degree than other\n\nforms of the Mediator complex and play a key role in SEC\n\nrecruitment and MYC transcription [41]. Gdown1 is a Pol II\n\nbinding protein shown to be necessary for a Mediator-dependent\n\nresponse to activation of transcription [42]. More appropriate to\n\nFigure 6.

Given the differences focused\n\naround the P3 region, we focused on the general promoter region\n\n(P0, TSS, and P3) to test the differences between these cell lines. As\n\nobserved for BAL17 cells, HeLa cells exhibited low AFF4\n\nrecruitment at this region in comparison to Raji cells (Fig. 6B).\n\nConsistent with AFF4 recruitment results, increased ELL2\n\noccupancy near P3 was seen in Raji cells compared to HeLa\n\ncells. MED26 occupancy showed a pattern similar to that of other\n\nSEC components with an increase, though more modest, near the\n\nP3 promoter in Raji cells (Fig. 6B). Finally, we observed that\n\nGdown1 followed a pattern similar to that of SEC and Mediator\n\nwith an increase around the P3 promoter in Raji cells (Fig. 6B).\n\nDiscussion\n\nDue to the importance of MYC in the genesis of hematopoietic\n\nmalignancies, intense efforts have been directed for the past two\n\ndecades toward understanding its regulation. Yet, given that MYC\n\noverexpression is caused by a plethora of genetic lesions, a uniform\n\nset of rules governing its transcriptional regulation is still missing.\n\nRecent advances in this area include the discovery of a small\n\nmolecule inhibitor, JQ1 that decreases MYC expression and is\n\ntherapeutically effective in pre-clinical animal models of midline\n\ncarcinoma and in BL cells. However, JQ1 does not inhibit MYC\n\nexpression to a similar extent in all cancer cells, further\n\nunderscoring that MYC transcription is perhaps under different\n\ncontrols in various cancer cell types. Consistent with this notion,\n\nwe discovered that JQ1 inhibits MYC expression in all BL-derived\n\ncells tested but does not inhibit MYC expression in some other\n\ncancer cell lines, as observed earlier (19). Because MYC\n\nderegulation can occur via different modes, we hypothesized that\n\nin distinct lymphoma phenotypes, high-level MYC expression may\n\ncome under the controls of different transcriptional and epigenetic\n\nregulatory mechanisms, which may be sensitive or resistant to\n\nJQ1/Brd4 inhibition. In this study, we explored these mechanisms\n\nto establish MYC transcriptional and epigenetic signatures\n\nassociated with particular cell types with the hope that these\n\nsignatures will better define lymphoma subtypes and provide new\n\ntherapeutic avenues to explore for clinically aggressive B cell\n\nlymphomas.\n\nAlthough BL cells are a heterogeneous lot with differences in the\n\nlength of Ig/MYC translocation that reportedly translate to\n\nvariable levels of MYC overexpression [43], BL cells in our hands\n\n(Fig. 1 and Figure S1, in File S1), and others [19], are uniformly\n\nsusceptible to inhibition of MYC expression via Brd4 inhibition by\n\nJQ1. This inhibition appears to be regardless of whether these are\n\nFigure 7. Proposed Model.

Brd4 is\n\nprimarily associated with 59-end promoters and enhancers\n\n[44,45,46], and while we do see a more prominent level of Brd4\n\nat the TSS in Raji cells (Fig. 2), we also observe Brd4 occupancy\n\nacross the body of the MYC gene in JQ1 resistant cells (Fig. 2). One\n\nfunction of Brd4 is P-TEFb recruitment and P-TEFb occupancy\n\ndoes parallel Brd4-inhibitor sensitive MYC transcription, despite\n\nthe fact that there is little difference in P-TEFb occupancy in\n\nuntreated cells of either resistant or sensitive cells. Therefore, it\n\nappears that in cells resistant to JQ1, a Brd4-independent\n\nmechanism operates to recruit or retain P-TEFb and produce\n\nhigh levels of MYC transcription.\n\nBecause the SEC components AFF4 and ELL2 play a role in\n\nMYC regulation and transcriptional elongation, we hypothesized\n\nthat an increase in these co-factors might relax Brd4 requirements.\n\nSurprisingly, their increased presence actually correlated with\n\nincreased requirements for Brd4 (Fig. 6). The position of increased\n\nSEC components together with MED26 and Gdown1 around the\n\nP3 promoter suggests high transcriptional activity or a regulatory\n\ncheckpoint in this region that is not present in cells that are\n\nresistant to JQ1 (summarized in Figure 7). It has been noted that in\n\nBL cells, due to MYC-IG translocation, the otherwise minor P3\n\npromoter often becomes active and correlates with higher MYC\n\nexpression [43]. Coupled with the recent demonstration that the\n\ntranslocated MYC locus harbors super enhancers that are sensitive\n\nto JQ1 [45], this raises the possibility that the mechanism of\n\ntranscriptional regulation of MYC involving its native/non-\n\ntranslocated enhancer is different (Fig. 7B, Figure S2, in File S1).\n\nRegulation of transcription at the MYC minor promoters,\n\nincluding P3, has been shown to involve the P-TEFb regulator\n\n7SK snRNA, which participates in transformation-dependent\n\nMYC deregulation [47]. 7SK snRNA is a complex of RNA and\n\nproteins such as LARP7 and HEXIM1 that are known to stabilize\n\nP-TEFb in an inactive form [13,14,47]. JQ1 also leads to the\n\nrelease of P-TEFb from the 7SK snRNP and to HIV gene\n\nexpression that involves an increase in AFF4 and ELL2 [48,49].\n\nMoreover, while JQ1 inhibited MYC expression in BL lines tested,\n\nit enhanced BCR stimulated induced transcription of c-fos in these\n\ncells (Figure S1, in File S1). Thus, the effects of Brd4 inhibition by\n\nJQ1 appear more complicated than has been previously antici-\n\npated.\n\nMuch is known about the different MYC promoters and their\n\npossible functions in oncogenesis. BAL17 and HeLa cells may\n\nbehave like GLC4 cells, where MYC is transcribed at a high rate\n\nbut not grossly rearranged [50]. That MYC transcription in GLC4\n\nis reported to initiate mainly from P1 instead of the P2 promoter\n\nand that this promoter shift seems to overcome transcript\n\ntermination at a transcriptional pause site described for Burkitt’s\n\nlymphoma [50]. In the future, it will be interesting to conclusively\n\ndetermine if any difference in cell-specific primary transcription\n\nand MYC promoter usage is driving, or being driven by, the\n\ndifferences in transcriptional elongation regulation we report here.\n\nPoint mutations could also play a role in differential JQ1 sensitivity\n\nthough a search of available UCSC Genome Browser tracks only\n\nfinds one SNP reported in the general vicinity of the P1/P2\n\npromoter (data not shown).\n\nAltered regulation at the elongation stage of transcription has\n\nbeen proposed to contribute to leukemic pathogenesis [29,51].\n\nWhile many PRGs such as MYC have a well-recognized\n\ncheckpoint at +40 to the TSS that is associated with paused\ntranscription [52,53], our data indicate that an additional potential\n\ncheckpoint near the region around P3 may be utilized differently\n\ndepending upon the mode of MYC overexpression. In the near\n\nfuture, we hope to employ different MYC-driven lymphoma\n\nsamples to test whether the transcriptional signatures that we\n\nobserve here correlate with the particular MYC genetic lesion\n\n(translocated versus non-translocated).\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFile S1 File includes Figures S1–S3.
