In the present study, we investigated whether estrogen \nreceptor (ER) β affected the proliferation and migration of the \nhuman breast cancer cell line MCF-7 through regulation of \nmitofusin 2 (mfn2). A previous study reported that mfn2 may \nbe regulated by ER through a non-classical pathway; in this \npathway, the ER modulates the activities of other transcription \nfactors by stabilizing their binding to DNA and/or recruiting \ncoactivators to the complex. However, the previous study, unlike \nthe study presented here, did not directly explore the interac-\ntions between ER and mfn2. Here, RT-PCR and western blot \nanalysis were used to test the expression of mfn2 in MCF-7 cells \nafter exposure to different doses of estradiol (E2). The ability \nof cells to proliferate and migrate was determined by MTT \nassay and a monolayer-wounding protocol, respectively. Finally, \nchanges in MCF-7 cell biology after transfection with ERβ or \nmfn2 expression vectors were investigated, and the role of ERβ \nin mfn2 expression was also explored. Our results showed that \nE2 attenuated mfn2 expression in a dose-dependent manner, \nconcomitant with the activation of proliferation and migration of \nMCF-7 cells. The mfn2 expression vector effectively suppressed \nE2-induced upregulation of PCNA and migration in MCF-7 \ncells. ERβ inhibited the E2-induced mfn2 downregulation that \naccompanied the inhibition of proliferation and migration in \nMCF-7 cells. Briefly, ERβ may inhibit E2-induced proliferation \nand migration of MCF-7 cells through regulation of mfn2.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBoth clinical and epidemiological evidence show that estrogens \nparticipate in the initiation and development of human breast \ncancer (1,2). Understanding the role of both types of estrogen \n\nreceptor (ER) (ERα and ERβ), in the pathogenesis of breast \ncancer is important, because effects of estrogen are mediated \nthrough both of these ERs (3-6). Although the function of ERα \nhas been established and its remains the most important marker \nof response to hormonal therapy in breast cancer, the role of ERβ \nremains elusive with many conflicting studies (7). The two ERs \nact in distinct ways in several estrogen target cells and tissues \n(8,9). There are two major conclusions to be drawn from current \nresearch situation of ERs. First, ERα and ERβ have different \nbiological functions, which are indicated by their distinct expres-\nsion patterns and the different phenotypes reported for the two \nERs in knockout animals, respectively. Second, ERα and ERβ \nhave overlapping yet unique roles in estrogen signaling, as judged \nfrom a number of gene expression profiling studies.\n\nMitofusin 2 (mfn2), also named as hyperplasia suppressor \ngene for its antiproliferative effects, localizes to the mito-\nchondrial outer membrane and plays an essential role \nin mitochondrial fusion, thus regulating mitochondrial \nmorphology and function. Chen et al (10) recently demon-\nstrated that mfn2 profoundly suppresses cell growth and \nproliferation in multiple tumor cell lines and rat vascular \nsmooth muscle cells in vivo and in culture systems via inhibi-\ntion of the Ras-ERK MAPK signaling pathway. Also, there \nis some evidence suggesting a protective effect of mfn2 in \nmammalian cells (11-13).\n\nThere is a growing body of literature suggesting that estrogen \nmay modulate expression of some genes through a non-classical \npathway in which the ER interacts with other transcription \nfactors, a process referred to as transcription factor cross-talk. In \nthis pathway, the ER modulates the activities of other transcrip-\ntion factors, such as activator protein (AP)-1, by stabilizing their \nbinding to DNA and/or recruiting coactivators to the complex. \nDeNardo et al (14) identified sets of estrogen-induced genes, \nincluding mfn2, whose promoters contain potential AP-1 sites \nbut no estrogen-responsive element (ERE) sequences, essential \nfor a classical model of estrogen action; these genes thus depend \non AP-1 for their expression. Further characterization of the \npromoters suggested that the ER regulated these genes through \nthe non-classical pathways mentioned above. However, the \nprevious study, unlike the study presented here, did not directly \nexplore the interaction between ERs and mfn2.\n\nIn the present study, we showed that ERβ inhibits human \nbreast cancer cell proliferation and migration by inducing \n\nEstrogen receptor β inhibits estradiol-induced proliferation and \nmigration of MCF-7 cells through regulation of mitofusin 2\n\nLI MA1,2,  YUEPING LIU3,  CUIZHI GENG2,  XIAOWEI QI1  and  JUN JIANG1\n\n1Breast Disease Center, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing;  \nDepartments of 2Breast Disease Center and 3Pathology, The Fourth Hospital of  \n\nHebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, P.R.

MCF-7, a human breast cancer cell line, \nwas kindly provided by Professor Mei-xiang Sang, Division \nof Scientific Research, the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical \nUniversity, Shijiazhuang, China. Cells were cultured in growth \nmedium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium \n(DMEM) (Gibco-BRL, USA) containing 4.5 g/l glucose, 2 mM \nL-glutamine, 5,000 IU/l penicillin, 5 mg/l streptomycin, 125 U/l \nFungizone, 2.2 g/l sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine \nserum (FBS) pretreated by 5% charcoal-dextran, in a 5% CO2 \nincubator. For experiments carried out in serum-free condi-\ntions, cells were made quiescent by culturing in serum-free \nmedium for 24 h. DMEM with antibiotics and glutamine, was \nsupplemented with 0.5 g/l BSA (1). Cells were randomly divided \ninto six groups and cultured for 48 h with E2 (17β-estradiol, \nat doses of 0 mol/l group, 10-9 mol/l group, 10-8 mol/l group, \n10-7 mol/l group, 10-6 mol/l group and 10-5 mol/l) to determine \nthe dose-dependent effects of E2 on mfn2 and cell behavior. \nCells of each group were cultured for 48 h in DMEM medium \ncontaining 10% FBS plus defferent dose of E2 without phenol-\nsulfonphthalein (2). To specially enhance mfn2 expression and \nexplore its effect on proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells, \ncells were randomly divided into four groups in gene trans-\nfection experiments as follows: normal group (blank control), \nuntransfected E2 group (E2), control vector pEGFP-transfected \nE2 group (E2 plus control vector) and pEGFP-mfn2-transfected \nE2 group (E2 plus mfn2 vector). Cells of the three groups treated \nwith E2 were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS plus 10-6 mol/l \nE2 for 48 h (3). To explore the effect of ERβ on mfn2 expres-\nsion, cells were randomly divided into four groups as follows: \nnormal group (blank control), untransfected E2 group (E2), \ncontrol vector pEGFP-N1 E2 group (E2 plus control vector) and \npEGFP-N1-ESR2 E2 group (E2 plus ERβ vector). Cells of every \ngroup were grown as described in group 2. Each experiment \nwas repeated six times.\n\nExpression vectors and transient transfection. The pEGFP-mfn2 \nand pEGFP-N1-ESR2 vectors and their negative control \nvectors were purchased from Yingrun Biotechnology Co. \nLtd., (Changsha, China). pEGFP-mfn2 and pEGFP-N1-ESR2 \nplasmids carry full-length mfn2 and ERβ genes, respectively. \nTransient transfection of MCF-7 cells was carried out using \nLipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA, USA) \naccording to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, MCF-7 \ncells were cultured in 6-well plates and the medium was changed \nthe following day until 80% confluence was achieved. The cells \nwere transfected with 4.0 µg vector DNA by 10 µl Lipofectamine \n2000 in 2 ml serum-free DMEM medium. At 6 h after transfec-\ntion, the medium was replaced by normal DMEM supplemented \nwith 10% FBS, and cells were cultured for 24 h. Cells were then \ncultured for 48 h in medium containing 10% FBS and E2 to \ndetect proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells (group 2) and \nmfn2 expression (group 3). The efficiency of transfection was \napproximately 70% for all experimental groups.\n\nWestern blot analysis. Protein extracted from MCF-7 cells \nwas separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and then transferred \nonto PVDF membrane (Millipore Corporation, Bedford, MA, \nUSA). The membrane was blocked for 1 h at 37˚C with 5% BSA \nin Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST). \nNext, the membrane was incubated at 4˚C overnight with \nprimary antibodies for mfn2 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, \nSanta Cruz, CA, USA), ERβ (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), \nand β-actin (1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Subsequently, \nthe membrane was rinsed three times with TBST containing \nsecondary antibody (1:5,000), treated with ECL solution (Pierce, \nRockford, IL, USA), and bands detected by exposing the blots \nto X-ray film. For quantitative analysis (i.e., normalized for \nβ-actin), bands were evaluated with IPP 5.0 software. Integrated \noptical density (IOD) of each band was measured, and relative \nIOD calculated as the ratio of the target band IOD compared to \nthe IOD of the β-actin band.\n\nSemi-quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was extracted with \nTRIzol (Invitrogen Co.) according to the manufacturer's \ninstructions. Total RNA (2 µg) was reverse transcribed using \nrandom primers and M-MLV at 42˚C for 1 h and then heated \nto 94˚C for 5 min in a total reaction volume of 20 µl. The \nPCR amplification began with a 5-min denaturation at 95˚C, \nfollowed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95˚C for 45 sec, \nannealing at 55˚C for 45 sec and extension at 72˚C for 60 sec. \nThe final extension was set for 10 min at 72˚C. The products \nwere electrophoresed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the levels of \nmfn2 mRNA were normalized with levels of GAPDH mRNA. \nAll PCR primers are shown in Table I.\n\nImmunofluorescence. MCF-7 cells were planted on cover \nslides in 6-well plates. After fixing with 10% formalin at room \ntemperature for 15 min, pretreating with 0.3% Triton X-100 for \n20 min at 37˚C and blocking with goat serum for 30 min at \n37˚C, cells were incubated with anti-mfn2 (1:200) overnight at \n4˚C. After washing with PBS for three times, the slides was all \nincubated with FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200, \nSanta Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at 37˚C. Then slides were \nviewed after being rinsed with PBS three times.\n\nCell proliferation. Cell proliferation was measured using \nmethyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) shade selection experi-\nments.

As described above, the ER might regu-\nlate mfn2 expression via a non-classical pathway. To observe the \neffect of ERα on mfn2, MCF-7 cells, which primarily express \nERα, were cultured in medium containing E2. The effect of E2 \non mfn2 expression through ERα was measured using immu-\nnoblotting for protein levels and semi-quantitative RT-PCR for \nmRNA levels in MCF-7 cells. E2 inhibited the expression of \nmfn2 in a dose-dependent manner. Mfn2 was expressed at a \nhigher level in cells cultured with 10% FBS. When cells were \npretreated with 10-9 mol/l, 10-8 mol/l, 10-7 mol/l, 10-6 mol/l \nand 10-5 mol/l group E2 for 48 h, protein expression of mfn2 \ndecreased by 2.85, 40.00, 55.43, 74.29 and 57.14%, respectively. \nThus, the lowest expression of mfn2 was seen in the 10-6 mol/l \ngroup. Similar changes were seen when cells were analyzed by \n\nRT-PCR. These findings demonstrated that E2 decreased mfn2 \nexpression in a dose-dependent manner at both the molecular \nand protein levels (Fig. 1).\n\nE2 enhances proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells. \nMCF-7 cells are the best-characterized ER-positive cell line \nin terms of known genes regulated by estrogens that promote \nproliferation. In order to confirm that E2 promotes prolif-\neration, E2-treated MCF-7 cells were examined using an \nMTT assay. Absorbance of the MTT substrate at 490 nm for \neach dosage group is showed in Table II. Significant differ-\nences were seen among experimental groups and the control \ngroup; the maximum effect of E2 on proliferation was seen in \nthe 10-6 mol/l group, where mfn2 was expressed at its lowest \nlevel. These results demonstrated that E2 treatment resulted \nin increased proliferation of MCF-7 cells, and that decreased \nmfn2 might play a positive role in this proliferation.\n\nTo determine if E2 influenced cell motility, we examined \nthe ability of treated cells to migrate in a wound-healing assay. \nIn response to wounding the monolayer, the 10-6 mol/l group \ncells were able to almost completely heal the wound. In contrast, \nthe cells of other groups were unable to do so and exhibited \nan obvious reduction in their rate of migration compared to \nthe 10-6 mol/l group. As compared with the 10-6 mol/l group \ncells, the reduction in the migration rate of cells treated with \nE2 at 10-9 mol/l, 10-8 mol/l, 10-7 mol/l, 10-5 mol/l and 0 mol/l \nwere 64.3, 50.0, 31.4, 24.5 and 85.7%, respectively. These \nresults demonstrated that E2 also enhanced cell motility in a \ndose-dependent manner (Fig. 2).\n\nThe mfn2 expression vector effectively suppressed E2-induced \nupregulation of PCNA and migration in MCF-7 cells. A \nprevious study demonstrated that mfn2 profoundly suppresses \n\nFigure 1. E2 downregulates expression of mfn2 in a dose-dependent manner in MCF-7 cells.

To investigate the \n\ninvolvement of mfn2 in E2-induced cell proliferation and \nmigration, MCF-7 cells were transfected with the expression \nvector pEGFP-mfn2. As shown in Fig. 3A and B, normal \ncultured MCF-7 cells (C) had standard expression levels of \nmfn2 and PCNA. However, both untransfected MCF-7 cells \nstimulated with 10-6 mol/l E2 (E2), and control vector trans-\nfected cells stimulated with 10-6 mol/l E2 (E2+C) showed \nnotably decreased mfn2 expression and enhanced PCNA \nexpression. In comparison with MCF-7 cells transfected with \ncontrol vector, mfn2 levels were increased by 2.11-fold and \nPCNA levels were decreased by about 42.61% in MCF-7 cells \ntransfected with specific mfn2 expression vector (E2+mfn2) \n(P<0.01). Consistent with the western blot analysis results, \nimmunofluorescence also revealed that the mfn2 vector \nreversed E2-induced downregulation of PCNA protein \n(Fig. 3C and D).\n\nCells transfected with the mfn2 vector showed moderate \nresistance to E2 stimulation. In comparison with E2-stimulated \nuntransfected or control vector-transfected cells, mfn2 expres-\nsion vector-transfected cells demonstrated decreased cell \nmigration (Fig. 4). The wound-healing assay indicated that \nMCF-7 cells and control vector-transfected cells stimulated \nby E2 almost completely healed the wound, as compared with \nunstimulated cells. However, this alteration was reversed by \ntransfection with the mfn2 expression vector.\n\nERβ ameliorates E2-induced mfn2 downregulation in MCF-7 \ncells. As stated previously, estrogen's effects are mediated \nthrough two ERs, ERα and ERβ (3-6). We hypothesized that \nERβ might also act upstream of mfn2, because mfn2 is identi-\ncally regulated by E2. To test our hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were \ntransfected with an ERβ expression vector. As seen in Fig. 5, \nMCF-7 cells transfected with the ERβ vector showed high ERβ \nprotein expression after stimulation with E2 for 24 h. However, \nno changes in ERβ protein levels were found in MCF-7 cells \ntransfected with blank control vector or in untransfected MCF-7 \ncells. In comparison with MCF-7 cells transfected with blank \nvector, ERβ protein was increased by about 2.25-fold in MCF-7 \ncells transfected with the ERβ vector (P<0.01). Cells transfected \nwith the ERβ vector showed antagonistic effects on E2 stimula-\ntion; mfn2 protein was upregulated in these cells as compared \nwith blank vector-transfected MCF-7 cells and untransfected \ncells treated with E2. These results indicated that MCF-7 cells \ntransfected with the ERβ vector showed moderate resistance to \nE2 stimulation and subsequent decreased downregulation of \nmfn2 protein (Fig. 5).\n\nAn ERβ expression vector effectively suppressed E2-induced \nenhancement of proliferation and migration in MCF-7 cells. \nThe results above showed that mfn2 negatively regulated \nE2-induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells and \nERβ acted as an upstream signal of mfn2; therefore, we hypoth-\nesized that ERβ could also inhibit proliferation and migration of \nMCF-7 cells. To investigate this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were \ntransfected with the ERβ expression vector (pEGFP-N1-ESR2). \nAn MTT assay was used to examine the proliferation of MCF-7 \ncells.

In fact, the wound-healing assay indicated that MCF-7 \ncells stimulated by E2 and cells transfected with control vector \nexpressed a stronger ability to heal the wound as compared with \nnormal group cells untreated with E2. However, this ability was \nreversed by transfection with the ERβ vector.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIt is acknowledged that ERα and ERβ have distinct roles in \nbreast cancer cells. Although the majority considered that ERα \npromotes proliferation and migration in breast cancer cells \nand the function of ERα had been clearly elucidated, the exact \nroles of ERβ in the pathogenesis of breast cancer are unclear. \nIn fact, the function of ERβ in the pathogenesis and develop-\nment of breast cancer is contradictory. Some studies indicate \nthat ERβ may function as a tumor suppressor and that the loss \nof ERβ may promote breast carcinogenesis (16-18); however, \nthere are other studies suggesting that ERβ may promote cell \nproliferation and breast tumor formation (19,20). Regardless of \nthese contradictions, the majority of studies focus on the clas-\nsical model of estrogen signaling through ERs, ERα and ERβ, \nin which ERs act at ERE-containing promoters. In the classical \nmodel, ligand-activated ER binds specifically to DNA at EREs \nthrough its DNA binding domain and brings coactivators and \ncorepressors to the transcription site via its activator function \n(AF)-1 and AF-2 domains. However, an increasing number of \nstudies show that estrogen also modulates gene expression by \na second mechanism in which the ER interacts with other tran-\nscription factors through a process referred to as transcription \nfactor cross-talk. In this case, the ER modulates the activities \nof other transcription factors such as activator protein (AP)-1, \nor SP-1 by stabilizing their binding to DNA and/or recruiting \ncoactivators to the complex (21,23). DeNardo et al (14) reported \na model of estrogen-ER activation of AP-1 through interac-\ntion with existing coactivator complexes that in turn stabilize \nthe entire complex and/or induce this complex into a higher \nstate of activity. They also identified 6 estrogen-induced/AP-1 \ndependent genes, including mfn2, which might fit this model. \nHowever, their conclusions were only speculative, as they did \nnot provide detailed data or investigated the interaction of ERs \nand mfn2 in vitro. In this study, we investigated the role of \nERβ in estradiol-induced proliferation and migration of human \nbreast cancer cells and studied whether mfn2 participated in \nthis behavior.\n\nFirst, we explored whether E2 (17β-estradiol) affected prolif-\neration and migration of MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer cell \n\nline primarily expressing ERα and thus mimicking the majority \nof ER-positive breast tumors. Similar to some previous studies \nthat revealed that E2 affected biological behavior of human \nbreast cells (24-26), our results showed that both the proliferation \nand migration abilities of MCF-7 were significantly increased \nwhen cultured with increasing doses of E2. Furthermore, regula-\ntion was in a dose-dependent manner, with the maximum effect \nseen in the 10-6 mol/l group. These data suggest that E2 and ERα \nare positive regulators of MCF-7 cells.\n\nWhether mfn2 was involved in the initiation and progres-\nsion of human breast cancer has not been previously reported. \nTo investigate the role of mfn2, we observed the expression of \nmfn2 in MCF-7 cells cultured within defferent doses of E2. \nInterestingly, we found that E2 could decrease mfn2 expression \nin a dose-dependent manner, and that the changes in mfn2 levels \nwere correlated with the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 \ncells. These results indicated that mfn2 might negatively regulate \nestradiol-induced proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells. \nFurthermore, we found that introduction of mfn2 blocked the \nresponse of MCF-7 cells to E2. Thus, mfn2 plays an important \nregulatory role in E2-induced proliferation and migration of \nMCF-7 cells. Considering the reports that mfn2 is one of the \nestrogen-induced/AP-1 dependent genes (14), the above results \nsuggested that mfn2 might negatively regulate E2-induced \nMCF-7 cell proliferation and migration by a non-classical \npathway. Mfn2, a proliferation-inhibiting gene, targets to the \nouter membrane of mitochondria. The mfn2 gene was found \nto play roles in the inhibition of cellular proliferation and the \npromotion of apoptosis (10) and exhibits antitumor activity in a \nwide range of cancer cell lines (27-29), suggesting that mfn2 may \nbe important in the development of human cancers. Again, the \npresent study also provided a potential target for prevention or \ntreatment for breast cancer patients with ERα positive expression.\n\nApproximately 70% of breast tumors express ERβ, and \nmost tumors coexpress both ERα and ERβ (30,31). However, \nwhether ERβ is involved in E2-induced downregulation of \nmfn2 is still unknown. Clearly, additional studies are needed to \nclarify the role of ERβ in breast cancer. In the present study, we \nintroduced ERβ into MCF-7 cells and investigated the effects \nof ERβ on proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells as well \nas its effects on mfn2 expression. Our studies demonstrate that \nERβ changes the phenotype of MCF-7 cells in response to E2. \nIn ERα-expressing MCF-7 cells, E2 causes proliferation and \nmigration, as well as suppression of mfn2. In contrast, when \nERβ is expressed along with ERα, MCF-7 cells are directed to \nantitumor pathways and high levels of mfn2 even in the pres-\nence of estrogens. These results suggest that ERβ can alter the \nresponse of MCF-7 to estrogens and demonstrate that ERβ may \nfunction as a tumor suppressor through the mfn2 pathway. Many \ncell-based studies suggest that ERβ acts as a negative modulator \nof ERα action. When ERα and ERβ are co-transfected into ER \nnegative (ER-) cells, ERβ inhibits ERα transcriptional activity \nand decreases the sensitivity of the cells to E2 (6,32). ERβ also \nlowers both ERα mRNA and protein levels in MCF-7 cells, thus \nindirectly influencing function of ERα (33,34). ERβ overexpres-\nsion in MCF-7 breast cancer cells can not only inhibit ERα \nregulation of a subset of genes involved in DNA replication, \ncell-cycle regulation, and proliferation (35,36), but also \ninhibit cell proliferation in response to E2 (34,36-38), in part \nby increasing expression of antiproliferative genes (p21Cip1 \n\nTable III.

Our results were quite similar to these reports, \nand minor deference lie in downstream factors. There may \nbe diverse mechanisms for the effect of ERβ on the response \nof ERα to E2. Recently, some studies revealed in series that \nthe responses of breast cancer cell lines to 17β-estradiol are \ndependent on the ERα/ERβ ratio (39,40). Most importantly, \nERβ might regulate mfn2 expression directly in a non-clas-\nsical pathway similar to ERα. Therefore, further studies are \nneeded to determine the exact mechanisms of interaction \nbetween ERs, ERα and ERβ, and mfn2, especially to delin-\neate the mechanism of action through experiments such as \nin-depth promoter analysis and CHIP.\n\nReferences\n\n  1.
