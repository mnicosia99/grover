Ovarian cancer cells, not normal cells, are damaged by Mirk/Dyrk1B kinase inhibition. Int J\nCancer. 2013 May 15;132(10):2258–2269 doi: 10.1002/ijc.27917. Epub 2012 Nov 21.\n\nFig.2b: panel: control day 2. Cell cycle distribution is shown by two-parameter flow cytometry, with DNA content in the x-\naxis determined by Hoechst staining and RNA content in the y-axis determined by pyronin-Y staining. A strain of human\ndiploid fibroblasts was placed in serum-free conditions for 2 days and 66% of cells arrested in G0 (arrow) and 20% arrested\nin G21M. The entire 8 panel Fig.2b in the original publication showed these fibroblasts serum-starved for 1,2,3 or 4 days,\nwith parallel cultures also treated with a Mirk-kinase inhibitor. The wrong day 2 control flow cytometry picture was shown in\nthe published study, but the percent of cells in G0 and G21M shown on that panel was correct and is the same as shown in\nthis correction, so the conclusions of Fig.2b are unchanged.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.29555\n\nE\nrr\nat\nu\nm\n\nInt.
