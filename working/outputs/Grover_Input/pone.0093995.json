Craig Kent*\n\nDepartment of Surgery, University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinics, Madison, Wisconsin, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nAtherosclerotic-associated diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States. Despite recent progress,\ninterventional treatments for atherosclerosis can be complicated by restenosis resulting from neo-intimal hyperplasia. We\nhave previously demonstrated that TGF-b and its downstream signaling protein Smad3:1) are up-regulated following\nvascular injury, 2) together drive smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration and 3) enhance the development of\nintimal hyperplasia. In order to determine a mechanism through which TGF-b/Smad3 promote these effects, Affymetrix\ngene expression arrays were performed on primary rat SMCs infected with Smad3 and stimulated with TGF-b or infected\nwith GFP alone. More than 200 genes were differentially expressed (.2.0 fold change, p,0.05) in TGF-b/Smad3 stimulated\nSMCs. We then performed GO term enrichment analysis using the DAVID bioinformatics database and found that TGF-b/\nSmad3 activated the expression of multiple genes related to either development or cell differentiation, several of which\nhave been shown to be associated with multipotent stem or progenitor cells. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed up-\nregulation of several developmental genes including FGF1, NGF, and Wnt11 (by 2.5, 6 and 7 fold, respectively) as well as\nstem/progenitor cell associated genes CD34 and CXCR4 (by 10 and 45 fold, respectively). In addition, up-regulation of these\nfactors at protein levels were also confirmed by Western blotting, or by immunocytochemistry (performed for CXCR4 and\nNGF). Finally, TGF-b/Smad3 down regulated transcription of SMC contractile genes as well as protein production of smooth\nmuscle alpha actin, calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain. These combined results suggest that TGF-b/Smad3\nstimulation drives SMCs to a phenotypically altered state of de-differentiation through the up-regulation of developmental\nrelated genes.\n\nCitation: Shi X, DiRenzo D, Guo L-W, Franco SR, Wang B, et al.

Each year over a million\n\nvascular reconstructions are performed to restore circulation to\n\nischemic organs. Unfortunately, a good number of these\n\neventually fail due to intimal hyperplasia which re-narrows the\n\nvessel lumen. Currently, the only clinical approach to prevent\n\nrestenosis is the drug eluting stent, which is implanted into a vessel\n\nfollowing angioplasty, releasing drugs such as rapamycin or\n\npaclitaxel. Even with the use of these stents, the incidence of\n\nrestenosis remains ,15% in the coronary arteries and higher in\nthe peripheral circulation [1]. Moreover, patients are predisposed\n\nto a risk of thrombosis resulting in sudden death. Therefore, it is\n\nimperative to further delineate the underlying mechanisms of\n\nrestenosis with the goal of devising better strategies for prevention.\n\nIntimal hyperplasia, or injury-triggered growth of the subintimal\n\nlayer of an artery or vein is the primary pathological event leading\n\nto restenosis. Essential to this process is the transformation of\n\nmedial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) from a quiescent and\n\ncontractile state to a synthetic phenotype, active in the production\n\nof extracellular matrix [2]. These ‘‘activated’’ cells quickly multiply\n\nand migrate into the subintimal space forming a highly cellular\n\nneointimal plaque. While attracting enormous interest, the nature\n\nof this SMC phenotypic transformation has remained controver-\n\nsial. A common observation is that injury-stimulated SMCs re-gain\n\nthe ability to proliferate and migrate while losing signature SMC\n\ncharacteristics, i.e. loss of the spindle morphology and a decrease in\n\nSMC markers such as smooth muscle actin (SMA), calponin, and\n\nmyosin heavy chain (MHC). It has been hypothesized by some\n\nthat SMCs, in response to injury, switch to a phenotypically\n\nmodulated state [2]. However, in a recent study, it was\n\nhypothesized that this ‘‘synthetic’’ cell population is derived from\n\nresident stem cells in the media, rather than de-differentiation of\n\nmature medial SMCs [3].\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0093995&domain=pdf\n\n\nTGF-b is known to be a regulator of a great number of cell\ntypes. Following ligand binding, the TGF-b receptor heterodimer\nis activated and phosphorylates the two cognate Smads, Smad2\n\nand Smad3, which then bind to Smad4. The resulting complex\n\ntranslocates to the nucleus and regulates the expression of a\n\nplethora of genes by binding to their promoters [4]. The\n\nregulatory power of Smad3 as a master transcription factor is\n\naugmented or modulated by interactions with some 50 co-\n\ntranscription factors. Aside from these canonical pathways,\n\nTGF-b is also able to regulate gene expression through non-\ncanonical pathways, typically MAPK including ERK, JNK, and\n\np38. Moreover, these noncanonical pathways crosstalk with the\n\ncanonical TGF-b/Smad3 pathway forming a complex TGF-b\nsignaling network. As such, TGF-b function can vary and depends\nupon cell type, the extracellular environment, as well as the\n\nsignaling context [4].\n\nTGF-b has been found to be an inhibitor of proliferation in\nmany cell types including cancer cells. In vascular SMCs we and\n\nseveral other groups have observed in vitro, that TGF-b inhibits cell\nproliferation as well as migration [5,6,7]. This is surprising in that\n\nTGF-b has been found to enhance the formation of intimal\nhyperplasia at the time of arterial injury, which is characterized by\n\nSMC proliferation and migration [8]. Our group has found that\n\nthe anti-proliferative effect of TGF-b is reversed in the presence of\nelevated Smad3 expression, and Smad3 expression is enhanced\n\nfollowing arterial injury. Moreover, adenoviral expression of\n\nSmad3 following arterial injury exacerbates the formation of\n\nintimal hyperplasia [6]. Thus, in a background of elevated Smad3,\n\nthe function of TGF-b in SMCs is paradoxically opposite of the\nanti-proliferative effect generally observed in cell culture. We\n\nreason that when Smad3 protein is increased (in vitro or in vivo), the\n\ncanonical TGF-b/Smad3 pathway may over-ride other TGF-b-\nassociated pathways and dominate the TGF-b signaling network,\nleading to an altered outcome in SMC behavior. We hypothesize\n\nthat TGF-b/Smad3 signaling alters the expression profile of the\nSmad3-responsive genome thus driving SMCs to a distinct, de-\n\ndifferentiated fate.\n\nIn order to investigate the TGF-b/Smad3-directed SMC\ntranscriptome, we performed gene array following TGF-b\nstimulation of primary rat aortic SMCs transduced with an\n\nadenovirus expressing Smad3, mimicking the in vivo condition of\n\nTGF-b and Smad3 elevation following arterial injury. Interest-\ningly, our data reveal, in response to TGF-b/Smad3, up-\nregulation of a large number of genes associated with development\n\nand/or multipotent stem cells or progenitor cells. Our findings\n\nsuggest a novel mechanism whereby elevated TGF-b/Smad3\nreverses the developmental lineage to a de-differentiated state.\n\nThese findings provide novel, important insight into the disparate\n\nfunction of TGF-b in vitro and in vivo as well as the molecular\nmechanisms of intimal hyperplasia.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics Statement\nThe experiments involving animal use were carried out in strict\n\naccordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care\n\nand Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of\n\nHealth. The protocol (Permit Number: M02273) was approved by\n\nthe Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison. All surgery was performed\n\nunder isoflurane anesthesia, and all efforts were made to minimize\n\nsuffering.\n\nReagents\nRecombinant human TGF-b1 was purchased from R&D\n\nSystems (Minneapolis, MN). Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium\n\n(DMEM) and cell culture reagents were from Invitrogen\n\n(Carlsbad, CA). All the other reagents were from Sigma (St. Louis\n\nMO) unless otherwise specified.\n\nSmooth Muscle Cell Culture and Viral Infection\nRat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated\n\nfrom the thoracoabdominal aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats\n\nbased on a protocol described by Clowes et al. [9]. Vascular SMCs\n\nwere used at passages 5 to 6 for all experiments and were\n\nmaintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\n\nsolution (FBS) at 37uC with 5% CO2. For experiments involving\nSmad3 overexpression, vascular SMCs were infected with\n\nadenovirus (36104 particles/cell) expressing Smad3 (or GFP\ncontrol) in DMEM containing 2% FBS for 4 h at 37uC followed\nby recovery in media containing 10% FBS. After overnight\n\nincubation, cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for\n\n24 h. The cells were then treated with recombinant TGF-b (5 ng/\nml) or solvent for desired hours. For microarray analysis, passage\n\n5 SMCs from 3 different animals were infected with AdSmad3 or\n\nAdGFP control followed by treatment with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) or\nsolvent (for GFP control) for 24h. Adenoviral vectors expressing\n\nSmad3 (AdSmad3) and GFP (AdGFP) were constructed as\n\npreviously described [7].\n\nRNA Isolation and Quality Control\nTotal RNA from SMCs treated with AdSmad3 and TGF-b or\n\nAdGFP alone was isolated using the Qiagen RNA/DNA Mini Kit\n\n(Qiagen, Gaithersburg, MD) following the manufacturer’s instruc-\n\ntions. For quality control, 1 mg of total RNA was analyzed by\ncapillary electrophoresis using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip and\n\nthe Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto,\n\nCA). All RNA samples used in this study showed no sign of\n\ndegradation.\n\nMicroarray\nMicroarray was carried out at the University of Wisconsin-\n\nMadison Biotechnology Center (Madison, WI). Whole transcript\n\ntarget labeling was carried out with total RNA using Ambion’s\n\nexpression kit to generate terminal labeled cDNA (Austin, TX).\n\nLabeled cDNA was hybridized to rat Genechip (Rat Gene 1.0 ST\n\nArray) overnight in the AFX HybOven480 (Santa Clara, CA), and\n\nthen post-processed on the Fluidics450 station. Post-hybridization\n\nwashing was performed according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n\nThe microarray slides were scanned on a G7 scanner (Affymetrix,\n\nSanta Clara, CA). Data were extracted using the Affyrmetrix\n\nconsole software. The complete data set is available at Gene\n\nExpression Omnibus (GEO Accession: GSE54624).\n\nBasic Analyses\nThe fold changes of gene expression, P values and heat maps\n\nwere calculated using the ArrayStar software (DNASTAR, Inc.,\n\nMadison, WI). A moderated t-test was performed to identify\n\nputative genes with significant expression changes. Putative genes\n\nthat were up or down regulated more than 2-fold with a P value\n\nless than 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed and\n\nselected for further analysis.\n\nFunctional Analysis of Significantly Affected Genes\nGenes that were up or down regulated more than 2 fold (P,\n\n0.05) after TGF-b/Smad3 treatment compared to GFP control\n\nTGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation Genes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995\n\n\n\nwere submitted to David Bioinformatics Resources 6.7, NIAID/\n\nNIH (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). The overall functions regu-\n\nlated by these TGF-b/Smad3 modulated genes were identified by\nFunctional Annotation Clustering and ranked by enrichment\n\nscores.\n\nReal-time Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR)\nmRNA was isolated using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen,\n\nValencia, CA). Potential contaminating genomic DNA was\n\nremoved by using gDNA Eliminator columns provided in the\n\nkit. The purified mRNA (2 mg) was used for the first-strand cDNA\nsynthesis and quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the\n\n7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,\n\nCA). Each cDNA template was amplified in triplicates using\n\nSYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad,\n\nCA) with gene specific primers.\n\nWestern Blotting Analysis\nCells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl,\n\n1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing\n\nProtease Inhibitor Cocktail I (Millipore,Billerica, MA). Protein\n\nconcentration was determined by Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay kit\n\n(Hercules, CA). Thirty micrograms of proteins from each sample\n\nwere separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocel-\n\nlulose membranes. Protein levels were assessed by immunoblotting\n\nwith the following rabbit antibodies for FGF-1, NGF, Wnt11,\n\nCXCR4, CD34 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA),\n\ncalponin, and myosin heavy chain (Abcam, Cambridge, MA),\n\nmouse antibodies for a-smooth muscle actin and b-actin (Sigma,\nSt. Louis, MO). After incubation with appropriate primary\n\nantibodies and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary\n\nantibodies, the specific protein bands on the membranes were\n\nvisualized by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce,\n\nDavenport, IL).\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nImmunostaining was performed to detect in situ the expression\n\nof CXCR4 and NGF in SMCs, following our published method.\n\nCells were prepared by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS\n\nfor 10 minutes. The cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% triton\n\nx-100 in PBS and blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA/5% donkey serum\n\nfor 1 h. Primary antibody was applied overnight at 4uC, and then\na secondary antibody was incubated with the cells for 1 h at room\n\ntemperature followed by fluorescence microscopy.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistical analysis of the data other than microarray results was\n\nconducted using a one–way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and\n\ndata were presented as mean 6 SEM derived from at least three\n\nindependent experiments, unless otherwise stated. If significant,\n\nthe ANOVA was followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. P\n\nvalue less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nStimulation of Vascular SMCs with TGF-b/Smad3 Drives\nLarge-scale Gene Expression\n\nThe genome-wide changes in mRNA expression that occur in\n\nSMCs in response to enhanced TGF-b/Smad3 signaling are of\ngreat interest and will provide significant insight into the role of\n\nTGF-b in the development of restenosis. To identify which genes\nare influenced, rat primary SMCs were infected with adenoviral\n\nvectors expressing human Smad3 or control GFP. SMC cultures\n\nwere serum-starved for 24 hours and the Smad3 group was\n\nstimulated with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) for 24 hours prior to RNA\nisolation and Affymetrix gene expression array analysis. By\n\ncomparing control (AdGFP) SMCs to cells expressing Smad3\n\nand stimulated by TGF-b our goal was to mimic a comparison\nbetween uninjured artery with low levels of TGF-b and Smad3\nand injured artery with increased expression of both proteins. This\n\ncombined TGF-b/Smad3 stimulation led to the significant (p,\n0.05) (.2.0 fold) changes in the expression levels of 219 genes with\n\n143 genes up-regulated and 76 genes down-regulated (Figure 1A).\n\nAlthough we used p,0.05 as our threshold and a two-fold change\n\nin expression, 289 additional genes were observed that had a\n\nstatistically significant (p,0.05) change in gene expression but the\n\nnumerical change was not greater than 2.0 fold (Figure 1B).\n\nAdditionally, there were 466 genes that exhibited a greater than\n\n2.0 fold change in gene expression but these differences did not\n\nreach statistical significance (Figure 1B). Although the criteria used\n\nto select the 219 genes that are the focus of this analysis were\n\nreasonably stringent, there are clearly additional genes that are\n\naffected by the combination of TGF-b and Smad3. Nevertheless,\nthe findings from this gene expression array demonstrate that\n\ncombined TGF-b/Smad3 signaling leads to changes in expression\nof a large number of genes that are potentially responsible for the\n\naltered cellular state of SMCs following in vivo vascular injury.\n\nDAVID GO-term Analysis of TGF-b/Smad3 Differentially\nRegulated Genes\n\nAdditional studies were then performed to identify the putative\n\nbiological function of these 219 genes. In order to better\n\nunderstand the consequences of TGF-b/Smad3 activation of\nSMCs we utilized the DAVID bioinformatics database (http://\n\ndavid.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/) to determine enriched gene ontology\n\n(GO) terms. The gene ontology project provides a controlled\n\nvocabulary of terms for describing gene product characteristics\n\nand gene product annotation data from the published literature.\n\nThese terms are designed to establish a universal vocabulary for\n\ndescribing the molecular function, biological processes, and\n\ncellular component associated with every gene in the genome.\n\nFor this particular analysis, DAVID identified significantly\n\nenriched biological processes associated with our list of 219\n\ndifferentially expressed genes and clustered these into functional\n\ncategories. The top 20 functional categories, based on enrichment\n\nscore, are displayed in Figure 2 and the entire data set can be\n\nfound in Table S1. Interestingly, the most enriched functional\n\ncategory with an enrichment score of 5.9 is ‘‘Developmental\n\nProcess,’’ suggesting that SMCs stimulated by TGF-b/Smad3 may\nreactivate a developmental pattern of gene expression. Included in\n\nthe top 20 were other functional categories relating to the\n\ndevelopmental processes including ‘‘Regulation of Cell Differen-\n\ntiation,’’ ‘‘Branching Tube Morphogenesis,’’ Respiratory System\n\nDevelopment,’’ ‘‘Limb Development,’’ and ‘‘Immune system\n\nDevelopment’’ (Figure 2). Although categories related to develop-\n\nment of the limb, respiratory, and immune systems seem\n\ncounterintuitive, it is probable that similar genes function in the\n\ndevelopment of multiple organ systems, including the vascular\n\nsystem. In sum, these results reinforce the notion that SMCs, when\n\nexposed to Smad3 and TGF-b, reactivate a pattern of develop-\nmental gene expression.\n\nFollowing vascular injury and as a precursor to intimal\n\nhyperplasia, SMCs migrate, become proliferative and are resistant\n\nto apoptosis. In SMCs activated by Smad3 and TGF-b we\nobserved functional categories of genes that promote all three of\n\nthese processes. Inclusive within the top 20 functional categories\n\nwere ‘‘Regulation of Cell Migration,’’ ‘‘Regulation of Cell\n\nTGF-b/Smad3 Stimulates De-Differentiation Genes\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e93995\n\nhttp://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/\nhttp://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/\n\n\nResponse/Chemotaxis,’’ ‘‘Negative Regulation of Cell Migration’’\n\nand ‘‘Positive Regulation of Cell Migration’’ showing that multiple\n\ngenes affected by TGF-b/Smad3 influence SMC migration. Also,\n‘‘Negative Regulation of Cell Apoptosis’’ and ‘‘Regulation of\n\nApoptosis’’ indicate that TGF-b/Smad3 may have a significant\neffect on SMC apoptosis. Finally, ‘‘Regulation of Cell Growth’’\n\nand ‘‘Leukocyte Proliferation’’ suggest that TGF-b/Smad3\nactivation of SMCs can also influence proliferation. In our\n\nprevious studies we have demonstrated that TGF-b/Smad3\nstimulation is capable of enhancing proliferation and migration\n\nand protecting against apoptosis of vascular SMCs thereby\n\ncontributing to the development of neo-intimal hyperplasia. The\n\nidentification of these enriched categories provides potential\n\nmechanisms for our previous findings.\n\nTaken together, the DAVID GO-term enrichment analysis\n\nreinforces that TGF-b/Smad3 activates genes associated with de-\ndifferentiation/differentiation as well as SMC proliferation,\n\nmigration and apoptosis. The sum of these effects may provide\n\nan explanation why TGF-b/Smad3 have such a potent stimula-\ntory effect on the development of intimal hyperplasia.\n\nCategorization of Developmental Related Genes\nThe ‘‘Developmental Process’’ is the most enriched functional\n\ncategory populated by the 219 differentially expressed genes\n\ninduced by TGF-b/Smad3. We combined the various functional\nclusters and generated a list of 60 genes that are related to\n\ndevelopment/differentiation/or de-differentiation. To better un-\n\nderstand the role of these 60 genes in SMC behavior we conducted\n\nan extensive literature search and classified each into one of three\n\nmajor categories: ‘‘de-differentiation related,’’ ‘‘differentiation\n\nrelated,’’ or ‘‘other developmental related.’’ TGF-b/Smad3\ntreatment of SMCs significantly regulated a cluster of 17 genes\n\nthat have been previously associated with de-differentiation in one\n\nor more cell types (Table 1). We also identified an additional 34\n\ngenes that, in at least one cellular system, have been found to be\n\nassociated with cell differentiation (Table 2). There were an\n\nadditional 9 developmental genes that we could not categorize as\n\nassociated with de-differentiation or differentiation (Table 3).\n\nFor those 17 de-differentiation genes, the degree of de-\n\ndifferentiation might be further subdivided into a hierarchy of\n\nprogenitor cells being the least de-differentiated, followed by\n\nmultipotent cells and then pluripotent cells as the most de-\n\ndifferentiated. A single gene was found to be associated with\n\npluripotency. This gene, telomeric repeat binding factor 1 (Terf1),\n\nis essential for the protection of telomere ends and induction of\n\ninduced pluripotent stem cells from somatic precursors [10]. In\n\ncontrast, we found several genes associated with multipotent\n\nhematopoietic stem cells including the stem cell chemoattractant,\n\nCXCL12 (SDF-1) and its corresponding receptor CXCR4.\n\nInhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2) is also included in the de-\n\ndifferentiation table in that it has been shown to inhibit the\n\ndifferentiation of hematopoietic stem cells into myeloid cells [11].\n\nIn addition, several genes associated with multipotent mesenchy-\n\nmal stem cells were also observed. The secreted factors FGF1 and\n\nHB-EGF have both been shown to play essential roles in\n\nmesenchymal stem cell renewal and inhibition of spontaneous\n\ndifferentiation [12,13,14]. Likewise, Gremlin-1 (Grem1) and\n\nWnt9a expression are responsible for maintaining a population\n\nof mesenchymal stem cells in a pre-osteoblast state [15,16]\n\nwhereas expression of PTH-LH inhibits chondrocyte differentia-\n\ntion from mesenchymal stem cell precursors [17]. We also\n\nidentified 5 genes from the de-differentiation category that are\n\ninvolved in progenitor cell activity. Interestingly, these genes were\n\nshown to inhibit the differentiation of local progenitor cells into\n\ntheir adult counterparts in various tissues including: for skin\n\nkeratinocytes, Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2); for\n\nblood cell progenitors, Sox18; for chondrocyte progenitors,\n\nChordin-like 2 (Chrdl2); and for retinal progenitor cells, Wnt2b\n\n[18,19,20,21].

These genes can modulate the\n\nde-differentiation of SMCs into stem-like cells which regain\n\nplasticity with increased capacity to proliferate and migrate.\n\nValidation of Array Data for TGF-b/Smad3 Gene\nExpression by qRT-PCR\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to corrobo-\n\nrate our microarray findings for TGF-b/Smad3 regulated gene\nexpression. The Affymetrix gene array revealed a number of\n\nintriguing genes regulated by TGF-b/Smad3 and up-regulation of\nseveral that have been previously reported to be associated with\n\nde-differentiation. To confirm the microarray results, SMCs were\n\ninfected with AdGFP or AdSmad3 and then treated with solvent\n\nor TGF-b. The mRNA levels of several highly regulated genes\nassociated with development were evaluated by qRT-PCR\n\n(Figure 3). We initially evaluated three genes due to their well-\n\nestablished roles in the development of a variety of mammalian\n\ntissue including vascular, epithelium, and neuronal tissue. The\n\nresults of qRT-PCR were in agreement with microarray results\n\nwith regard to the expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1),\n\nnerve growth factor (NGF) and wingless-related MMTV integra-\n\ntion site 11 (Wnt11). FGF1 was elevated ,2.5 fold in TGF-b/\nSmad3-stimulated cells compared to GFP control, whereas NGF\n\nand Wnt11 were up-regulated ,6 fold and ,7 fold, respectively\n(Figure 3). Although all these genes were elevated, there were\n\ndifferences in the expression profiles of each. For Wnt11, TGF-b\nalone produced an effect on gene expression that was almost as\n\nsignificant as that found with combined TGF-b/Smad3 stimula-\ntion. In contrast, FGF1 and NGf up-regulation by TGF-b was\nheavily reliant on the presence of elevated levels of Smad3\n\n(Figure 3A). We further confirmed up-regulation of protein\n\nproduction of these 3 factors. Western blotting showed an ,2.5–\n3 fold increase of all 3 proteins either in SMC lysates (Figure 3B)\n\nor cell culture media (Figure 3C), as a result of TGF-b/Smad3\ntreatment. Following the treatment with AdSmad3 alone (no\n\nTGF-b), while only FGF-1 was significantly up-regulated in cell\nlysates, all 3 factors were significantly increased in conditioned\n\nmedia.\n\nIn additional experiments we evaluated expression of CXCR4\n\nand CD34, both stem/progenitor associated genes. The qRT-\n\nPCR data indicate that CXCR4 and CD34 mRNA levels were\n\nincreased by ,10 fold and 45 fold, respectively, after TGF-b/\nSmad3 stimulation (Figure 4A); Western blotting confirmed an\n\nincrease of these two proteins in cell lysates albeit to a lower extent\n\n(,3 fold) (Figure 4B). In order to understand the temporal\nexpression profiles of these two genes, we determined the qRT-\n\nPCR time course. SMCs were infected with AdSmad3 and treated\n\nwith TGF-b (5ng/ml) for the indicated times, AdGFP served as a\ncontrol. TGF-b/Smad3 gradually and consistently increased\nCD34 expression to 30 fold at 12 hours and to a maximum of\n\n50 fold at 48 hours. In contrast, CXCR4 was enhanced and\n\npeaked at 50 fold at 6 hours then gradually fell to 10-fold by 48\n\nhours (Figure 4C). These results further validate the array findings\n\nand confirm that TGF-b/Smad3 activate two additional genes\nassociated with cell development. Interestingly, the time course of\n\neach differs with CXCR4 associated with a peak in expression at 6\n\nhours and CD34 expression gradually increasing over time.\n\nUsing immunocytochemistry we then determined the percent-\n\nage of SMCs that express development/progenitor associated\n\ngenes in response to the combined stimulation of AdSmad3 and\n\nTGF-b. In order to avoid an interference of GFP fluorescence with\n\nFigure 2.

We then immunostained two representative factors,\n\nNGF and CXCR4, in AdGFP and AdSmad3 infected (and TGF-b\ntreated) cells. We found that ,60% of GFP cells were NGf and\nCXCR4 positive cells (Figure 5), indicating a strong association of\n\nup-regulation of these factors with Smad3 expression.\n\nIn sum, through determination of mRNA, protein, and in situ\n\ncellular expression, we have confirmed significant up-regulation of\n\nfive genes, all of which were found by the Affymetrix gene\n\nexpression array to be associated with SMC development.\n\nTGF-b/Smad3 Negatively Regulates SMC Differentiation\nTGF-b is classically considered a stimulant of SMC differen-\n\ntiation [23,24,25,26]. However, the foregoing suggests that in the\n\ncontext of elevated Smad3, TGF-b promotes de-differentiation.\nConsistent with this hypothesis, we propose that TGF-b/Smad3\nmight also inhibit SMC differentiation. To explore this possibility,\n\nusing qRT-PCR we evaluated the effect of TGF-b/Smad3 on\nexpression of smooth muscle actin (SMA), Calponin, and smooth\n\nmuscle myosin heavy chain (SM-MHC), which are three proteins\n\nknown to be associated with SMC differentiation. SMCs were\n\ninfected with AdSmad3 and treated with TGF-b (5 ng/ml) for\n24 h or infected with AdGFP. qRT-PCR revealed that activation\n\nof the TGF-b/Smad3 pathway significantly decreased the\nexpression of the SMC contractile genes, SMA, Calponin, SM-\n\nMHC to approximately 60% of control (Figure 6A); either\n\nAdSmad3 or TGF-b alone did not produce a significant change\n(Figure S2 in File S1). These findings were then confirmed by\n\nWestern blotting, using an identical experimental protocol. Protein\n\nlevels associated with each of these genes fell to approximately\n\n50% of control (Figure 6B, C). Thus, our findings suggest that\n\nTGF-b/Smad3 not only enhance expression of factors that\n\npromote cellular de-differentiation but also inhibit factors that\n\nhave been previously found to be associated with differentiation or\n\npreservation of the SMCs in a quiescent, contractile state.\n\nWhereas TGF-b alone has been strongly associated with SMC\ndifferentiation, the sum of our findings suggest that in the presence\n\nof elevated Smad3, TGF-b transforms into a potent stimulant of\nSMC de-differentiation.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTGF-b is a critically important factor in the development of\nintimal hyperplasia. Its expression is up-regulated in arteries and\n\nveins following vascular reconstruction. Moreover, increasing\n\nTGF-b through viral expression in an animal model of arterial\ninjury exacerbates intimal hyperplasia, whereas inhibiting TGF-b\nsignaling by using antibodies or by expressing a soluble form of the\n\nTGF-b receptor attenuates it [8]. These findings are surprising\nsince, TGF-b, in vitro, is a potent inhibitor of SMC proliferation\nand migration, both necessary contributors to intimal hyperplasia.\n\nOur recent published findings bring some resolution to this\n\nconundrum. It appears that TGF-b in the presence of elevated\nlevels of its canonical signaling protein Smad3, transforms from an\n\ninhibitor of SMC proliferation and migration to a stimulant of\n\nboth processes. We have previously demonstrated that adminis-\n\ntration of TGF-b to cultured SMCs coupled with adenoviral\noverexpression of Smad3, leads to enhanced proliferation,\n\nmigration, and synthesis of extracellular matrix [6,27,28,29].\n\nThese results are mirrored in vivo where overexpression of Smad3\n\nwas found to enhance balloon injury-induced intimal hyperplasia\n\nin rat carotid arteries [6,29]. While transfection with siRNA to\n\nreduce Smad3 levels reversed SMC proliferation stimulated by\n\nAdSmad3 [63], adenoviral expression of Smad7, which blocks\n\nSmad3 signaling, effectively inhibited intimal hyperplasia [6].\n\nDespite the current knowledge that TGF-b/Smad3 play crucial\nroles in stimulating SMC proliferation, migration and intimal\n\nhyperplasia in response to arterial injury, changes in gene\n\nexpression and the mechanism behind this response remain\n\nTable 1.

We performed the Affymetrix gene expression arrays on\n\nSMCs infected with AdSmad3 and stimulated by TGF-b, with the\nassumption that identification of genes regulated by the combina-\n\ntion of TGF-b/Smad3 may provide important insight into how\nthis signaling axis affects intimal hyperplasia. We identified 219\n\ngenes whose expression was substantially altered (.2 fold change,\n\np,0.05). We then applied DAVID bioinformatics tools to analyze\n\nTGF-b/Samd3 regulated gene functions. The most salient finding\nof this analysis was that the most prominently regulated genes were\n\nthose related to development, some of which are associated with\n\nstem or progenitor cells. It is likely that expression of these\n\ndevelopmental and stem cell-related genes is indicative that TGF-\n\nb/Smad3 at minimum produces SMC de-differentiation or at\nmaximum transforms SMCs into stem or progenitor cells following\n\nvascular injury.\n\nIt has been thought for many years that for neointimal\n\nhyperplasia to occur, a transformation of medial SMCs is\n\nnecessary to allow for their migration to and proliferation within\n\nthe subintimal space. Classically, this process has been described as\n\n‘‘phenotypic switching’’ or ‘‘phenotypic modulation’’ whereby\n\nSMCs transition from quiescent and contractile to synthetic cells\n\nfollowing vascular injury [2,30]. As a consequence, SMCs reduce\n\ntheir expression of contractile genes, most notably smooth muscle\n\nalpha-actin, calponin, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain\n\nwhile up-regulating expression of genes that lead to the production\n\nof extracellular matrix [2,30]. A variety of factors released at the\n\ntime of arterial injury, including PDGF-BB, PDGF-DD, oxidized\n\nphospholipids and extracellular matrix proteins, have been\n\nimplicated in the transformation of SMCs from a contractile to\n\na synthetic phenotype [31,32,33,34].

The concept that SMCs express stem cell-\n\nrelated genes following arterial injury is not entirely novel and has\n\nbeen suggested by recent studies. Our group has previously\n\nreported the presence of the stem cell factor, C-kit, in vascular\n\nSMCs derived from human saphenous vein. Moreover, we found\n\na substantial increase in C-kit in hyperplastic plaque that develops\n\nin the rat carotid model of intimal hyperplasia [37]. Ferlosio et al.\n\ndemonstrated an increase in the percentage of medial cells\n\nexpressing the stem cell markers flt-1 and c-kit in large arteries of\n\naged humans and rats versus younger controls [38]. SMCs isolated\n\nfrom aged rats were also more proliferative, migratory and\n\nexpressed less SMC alpha actin compared to younger controls\n\n[38]. These findings reinforce the notion that SMCs up-regulate\n\nstem cell-associated genes in response to injury or chronic stress\n\nsuch as aging.\n\nAdditional evidence that SMCs can activate stem cell gene\n\nexpression following arterial injury is revealed through numerous\n\nstudies of the epigenetic regulator, Klf4. Several publications by\n\nthe Owens group have demonstrated that Klf4 is up-regulated by\n\nPDGF-BB and plays a pivotal role in phenotypic transformations\n\nof SMCs [39,40]. These studies are especially interesting in that\n\nKlf4 is one of the four ‘‘Yamanaka factors’’ that are capable of re-\n\nprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells.\n\nThe role of Klf4 in SMC de-differentiation, however, is still\n\nsomewhat unclear. Other studies have shown that Klf4 has an\n\ninhibitory effect on SMC proliferation [41]. The discrepant role of\n\nKlf4 in SMC differentiation/de-differentiation is discussed in a\n\nrecent review where it is suggested that post-translational\n\nmodifications of this protein might explain its variable function\n\n[42]. Regardless, the stem cell marker Klf4 appears to play an\n\nimportant, but somewhat controversial, role in SMC differentia-\n\ntion, proliferation, and vascular restenosis.\n\nPDGF-BB is by far the most widely studied stimulant of de-\n\ndifferentiation and numerous investigators have dissected the\n\nmolecular mechanisms through which this protein induces\n\nphenotypic switching of SMCs. PDGF-BB has been shown to\n\nactivate the MAPK signaling cascade leading to Elk-1 phosphor-\n\nylation [43]. Myocardin is a master regulator for differentiation\n\nand contractile protein expression in SMCs [46]. Phosphorylated\n\nElk-1 displaces myocardin at the promoter of SMC contractile\n\ngenes and reduces its expression [44]. IL-1b has also been shown\nin numerous studies to push cells towards a de-differentiated state\n\nby inhibiting myocardin. This effect is mediated through NF-kB\n\nand Notch3 [45]. These findings demonstrate that there is\n\nsignificant cross-talk between signaling proteins, suggesting that\n\nSMC phenotypic switching is a highly dynamic process that\n\ninvolves multiple pathways.\n\nThe role of TGF-b in SMC differentiation is controversial and\nappears to depend upon the cell-type and developmental stage. In\n\nvitro, TGF-b has been found to stimulate SMC differentiation as\nevidenced by enhanced contractile protein expression. Chen et al.\n\nshowed that TGF-b signaling promotes contractile protein\nexpression in neural crest (Monc-1) cells which leads to their\n\ndifferentiation into SMCs [24]. Imamura et al. showed that TGF-b\nhas the capacity to induce differentiation of bone marrow derived\n\nprogenitor cells toward a SMC lineage through myocardin.\n\nAlternatively, our data suggest that TGF-b and Smad3 promote\nde-differentiation of adult SMCs, at least partially by reactivating\n\nexpression of genes related to embryonic development and\n\nsuppressing expression of SMC differentiation markers. Thus in\n\nthe presence of elevated Smad3, TGF-b switches from a stimulant\nof differentiation to a promoter of de-differentiation.\n\nIt has been previously discovered that in some cells, TGF-b\npositively regulates stem cell function. For example, TGF-b\nsignaling is necessary for proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells\n\n[47]. Moreover, the TGF-b family has been implicated in the\nmaintenance of embryonic stem cells [48], preventing these cells\n\nfrom differentiating and migrating. Falk et al. reported that TGF-b\nregulates neuronal stem cell proliferation through Wnt signaling\n\n[49]. Coincidentally, we found that TGF-b/Smad3 stimulate Wnt,\nSox, and FGF family gene expression (Table 2). It appears that\n\nelevated Smad3 is crucial for TGF-b regulated de-differentiation.\nPhosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Smad3 have been\n\nobserved in stem cells and both are decreased when stem cells\n\ndifferentiate [50], suggesting that activated TGF-b signaling is\nrequired to maintain de-differentiation. TGF-b regulates embry-\nonic stem cell function by clustering Smad3 with other key\n\nregulators including Nanog and Oct4 [51,52]. Together, Nanog\n\nand Oct4, along with Lin28 and Sox2, can induce differentiated\n\ncells into pluripotent stem cells with full capacity to differentiate\n\ninto any cell type [53].\n\nOur findings demonstrate that reactivation of embryonic\n\ndevelopmental genes by TGF-b/Smad3 in a similar manner,\nleads to SMC plasticity and its consequences including SMC\n\nproliferation. Our qRT-PCR data confirm the microarray results\n\nand support a positive role for TGF-b/Smad3 in regulating\nexpression of stem cell-related genes and SMC de-differentiation.\n\nIt is interesting to note that CXCR4 and CD34, which are stem\n\ncell/progenitor markers, are substantially up-regulated in SMCs\n\nfollowing treatment with TGF-b/Smad3. Furthermore, we found\nthat FGF-1, a potent mitogen for hematopoietic stem cell\n\nexpansion, was significantly up-regulated following TGF-b/\nSmad3 stimulation. In contrast to FGF-1, basic fibroblast growth\n\nfactor (FGF-2) is widely studied in SMCs and is known to enhance\n\nproliferation, migration, and drive intimal hyperplasia. Although\n\nthere is a paucity of research regarding FGF-1 in SMCs, a report\n\nby Takahashi et al. demonstrated that FGF-1 expression was\n\nsufficient to inhibit the differentiation of SMCs from progenitor-\n\nlike cells [54]. CD34 and CXCR4 have also been studied in the\n\nvascular system. CD34 is a well-known marker for hematopoietic\n\nstem cells and is often found in endothelial cells [55]. However,\n\nour finding of CD34 in SMCs is novel. Several reports have shown\n\nthat the SDF-1a/CXCR4 axis is important in the development of\n\nintimal hyperplasia [56]. Nevertheless, the finding of CXCR4 in\n\nSMCs is also relatively novel. In contrast to stem/progenitor\n\nmarkers, SMA, calponin and MHC, signature markers of SMC\n\ndifferentiation, are all down-regulated in SMCs in response to the\n\ntreatment with TGF-b/Smad3. A decrease of these SMC markers\n\nFigure 3. Up-regulation of mRNA and protein levels of FGF-1, NGF and Wnt11 in SMCs by AdSmad3/TGF-b treatment.

While the functions of these two\n\ngenes in SMCs are not currently known, they have been reported\n\nto play a role in differentiation of non-SMC cell types [57,58], not\n\nsupporting the hypothesis that TGF-b/Smad3 promotes de-\ndifferentiation. However, many developmental genes play differing\n\nor even opposite roles depending upon the context or the cell type.\n\nIt may well be that NGF and Wnt11 in SMCs promote de-\n\ndifferentiation. Alternatively, it might be that TGF-b/Smad3\n\ninduce transcription of genes associated with differentiation (NGF\n\nand Wnt11) as well as de-differentiation, but the balance of their\n\ncombined effect favors de-differentiation. It is also interesting to\n\nnote that TGF-b/Smad3 significantly increased (by ,5–10 fold\ncompared to AdGFP control) the expression of osteopontin, nestin,\n\nand collagen type II, which are markers of osteoblasts, neurocrest\n\ncells, and chondrocytes, respectively (Figure S3 in File S1).\n\nMoreover, TGF-b/Smad3-conditioned media were able to up-\nregulate osteopontin and nestin as well (Figure S4 in File S1). Up-\n\nregulation of these genes of different lineages lends additional\n\nevidence to our assessment that TGF-b/Smad3-stimulated cells\n\nFigure 5.

It is reasonable to\n\npostulate that de-differentiated cells have a greater potential than\n\ndifferentiated SMCs to express marker genes of other cell types.\n\nTaken together, the foregoing results prompt us to propose that\n\nenhanced TGF-b/Smad3 signaling confers on SMCs the propen-\nsity to de-differentiate toward an earlier stage in the developmental\n\nlineage, which is consistent with our earlier observations that\n\nTGF-b/Smad3 promotes SMC proliferation and migration and\nintimal hyperplasia.\n\nOur primary hypothesis is that SMCs that contribute to intimal\n\nhyperplasia are initially differentiated but transform into a de-\n\ndifferentiated state in response to factors such as TGF-b/Smad3.\nAlternative hypotheses have been proposed that might explain the\n\npresence of de-differentiated cells in arterial media and subintimal\n\nplaque. One possibility is that these de-differentiated cells\n\ntranslocate from another site. For example, there is substantial\n\nevidence that at least some cells that contribute to the neointima\n\nare myofibroblasts derived from the arterial adventitia [59]. There\n\nare a series of studies showing in the murine model, that neo-\n\nintimal cells are, in part, derived from the bone marrow\n\n[7,60,61,62]. A recent study raised the controversial notion that\n\nde-differentiation of mature SMCs is not the primary driving force\n\nbehind the development of intimal hyperplasia [3]. Rather,\n\nneointima develops from undifferentiated multipotent vascular\n\nstem cells (MVSCs) that naturally reside in the media of the\n\nnormal uninjured artery and then become activated with vascular\n\ninjury [3]. Although this notion is highly contentious, our findings\n\nare not at complete odds with this theory. In studies of animal as\n\nwell as human plaque, we have found that some but far from all\n\ncells, have enhanced expression of Smad3 [63]. Possibly up-\n\nregulation of Smad3 signaling is confined to MVSCs following\n\nvascular injury. Although the classical concept that quiescent\n\nmedial SMCs transform into the cells that comprise subintimal\n\nplaque is still well accepted, the contribution of de-differentiated\n\ncells derived from other sources including the adventitia, bone\n\nmarrow, or an intrinsic population of stem cells within the normal\n\narterial wall requires further exploration.\n\nTGF-b/Smad3 play an important role in the development of\nvascular restenosis following arterial reconstruction. Our findings\n\nsuggest an important role for TGF-b/Smad3 in de-differentiation\nof vascular SMCs placing the TGF-b/Smad3 signaling axis at the\ncenter of a novel pathway that drives a phenotypic switch of\n\nvascular SMCs following arterial injury. We have identified a\n\ngroup of novel TGF-b/Smad3 regulated genes that may be central\nto this process. Blocking de-differentiation is a strategy that might\n\nbe used to prevent the development of intimal hyperplasia. Thus, a\n\nthorough understanding of the de-differentiation factors that are\n\nenhanced or the differentiation factors that are suppressed could\n\nlead to novel therapeutics to prevent restenotic disease. An\n\napproach that includes simultaneous suppression or accentuation\n\nof several of these factors might be particularly strategic. The\n\nidentification of global targets and molecular pathways associated\n\nwith TGF-b/Smad3 pathway will provide a better understanding\nof the multi-faceted roles of TGF-b in complex pathophysiological\nprocesses of restenosis.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nTable S1 The entire data set of microarray.\n\n(XLSX)\n\nFile S1 Supporting Information Figures.
