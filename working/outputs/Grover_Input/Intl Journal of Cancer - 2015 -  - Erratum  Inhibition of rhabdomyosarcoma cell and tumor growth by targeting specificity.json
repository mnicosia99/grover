Epub 2012 Aug 3.\n\nIn Figure 2D the same images were inadvertently provided for the control and IGF 1 TA (0 time) experiments. Both panels\nlook similar since no cell migration is observed at this time. Attached is a revised Figure 2D showing the results for the three\ndifferent “0 time” treatment groups. We regret this mixup and thank the editor and journal staff for pointing out this\nduplication.\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.29551\n\nE\nrr\n\nat\nu\n\nm\n\nInt. J.
