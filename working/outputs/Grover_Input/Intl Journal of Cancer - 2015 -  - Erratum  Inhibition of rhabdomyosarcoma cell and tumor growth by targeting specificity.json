Inhibition of rhabdomyosarcoma cell and tumor growth by targeting specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors. Int J Cancer. 2013 February 15;132(4):795-806 doi: 10.1002/ijc.27730. Epub 2012 Aug 3.  In Figure 2D the same images were inadvertently provided for the control and IGF 1 TA (0 time) experiments. Both panels look similar since no cell migration is observed at this time. Attached is a revised Figure 2D showing the results for the three different “0 time” treatment groups. We regret this mixup and thank the editor and journal staff for pointing out this duplication.  DOI: 10.1002/ijc.29551  E rr  at u  m  Int. J.
