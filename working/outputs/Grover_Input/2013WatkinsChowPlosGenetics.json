Ribosome construction requires\nassembly of approximately 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs) and four different species of rRNA. As RPs co-assemble into\none multi-subunit complex, mutation of the genes that encode RPs might be expected to give rise to phenocopies, in which\nthe same phenotype is associated with loss-of-function of each individual gene. However, a more complex picture is\nemerging in which, in addition to a group of shared phenotypes, diverse RP gene-specific phenotypes are observed. Here\nwe report the first two mouse mutations (Rps7\n\nMtu\nand Rps7\n\nZma\n) of ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7), a gene that has been\n\nimplicated in Diamond-Blackfan anemia. Rps7 disruption results in decreased body size, abnormal skeletal morphology, mid-\nventral white spotting, and eye malformations. These phenotypes are reported in other murine RP mutants and, as\ndemonstrated for some other RP mutations, are ameliorated by Trp53 deficiency. Interestingly, Rps7 mutants have\nadditional overt malformations of the developing central nervous system and deficits in working memory, phenotypes that\nare not reported in murine or human RP gene mutants. Conversely, Rps7 mouse mutants show no anemia or\nhyperpigmentation, phenotypes associated with mutation of human RPS7 and other murine RPs, respectively. We provide\ntwo novel RP mouse models and expand the repertoire of potential phenotypes that should be examined in RP mutants to\nfurther explore the concept of RP gene-specific phenotypes.\n\nCitation: Watkins-Chow DE, Cooke J, Pidsley R, Edwards A, Slotkin R, et al.

Ribosomes\n\nthemselves, which consist of small (40S) and large (60S) subunits,\n\nare assembled from about 80 different ribosomal proteins (RPs)\n\nalong with four species of rRNA synthesized in the nucleolus [1,2].\n\nRPs fall broadly into two categories; the RPL proteins that make\n\nup the large ribosomal subunit, and the RPS proteins that\n\nconstitute the small subunit. Mutations in both RPL and RPS\n\ngenes have been implicated in a set of shared phenotypic\n\ncharacteristics in invertebrates. This is best illustrated by the\n\napproximately 50 Drosophila melanogaster Minute mutants, a collec-\n\ntion of ribosomal gene mutations that are characterized by\n\ndevelopmental delay, short thin bristles, growth retardation,\n\nreduced fertility and recessive lethality [3].\n\nIn vertebrates, a phenotypic overlap among RP mutants occurs\n\nsimilar to that seen in Drosophila Minute mutants, however\n\nadditional phenotypic complexity is emerging, in which mutation\n\nor suppression of RPs results in some phenotypes that depend\n\nupon which gene is mutated. This is highlighted by a recent study\n\nin which 20 different RP genes were targeted using morpholino\n\nantisense oligos in the zebrafish Danio rerio [4]. Whereas some\n\nphenotypes were shared among knockdowns, such as hypoplasia of\n\nthe yolk sac, others were gene-specific. For instance, knockdown of\n\nrps15 resulted in an enlarged 4\nth\n\nventricle of the brain, whereas\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nknockdown of rpl35a caused a sharply bent tail, and targeting of\n\nrps29 produced an enlarged lens [4]. A similar picture of\n\nphenotypic overlap paired with gene-specific phenotypes is\n\nemerging in mice. For example, mutations in Rps19 and Rps20\n\nresult in increased epithelial pigmentation, a ventral belly spot,\n\nsmall body size, and a reduction in red blood cell count [5]. Mice\n\nwith mutations in Rpl24 also have ventral belly spots and body size\n\nreduction, but they present with additional retinal abnormalities\n\nand skeletal defects [6]. Mice harboring the Rpl27a sooty foot allele\n\nshare an epidermal hyperpigmentation phenotype with Rps19 and\n\nRps20 mutants, but display the additional feature of cerebellar\n\nataxia [7]. These distinct features of individual RP mutant\n\nphenotypes suggest that vertebrate RPs may have unique, tissue-\n\nspecific functions and/or tissue-specific expression levels. Indeed,\n\nthe broad spectrum of distinct phenotypes that have been\n\ncharacterized in a relatively small number of mammalian RP\n\nmutants also hints at possible extra-ribosomal functions of RPs.\n\nIn humans, mutations in RPs have been implicated in\n\nhematopoetic disorders, most notably Diamond-Blackfan anemia\n\n(DBA), which has been attributed to mutations in RPS19, RPS26,\n\nRPS24, RPS17, RPS10, RPS7, RPL35a, RPL26, RPL11, and RPL5\n\n[8–14]. While anemia is a shared phenotype among all patients\n\ncarrying these various gene mutations, some specific attributes are\n\nassociated with individual genes. For example, mutations in RPL5\n\nare associated with cleft palate and anomalies of the thumb and\n\nheart, whereas isolated thumb malformations are predominant in\n\npatients carrying mutations in RPL11 [11].\n\nIn this paper, we further examine the role of ribosomes in\n\nmammalian development by investigating Rps7. Through analysis\n\nof two new ENU-induced mouse mutants of Rps7, montu (Mtu)\n\nand zuma (Zma), we show that mutation of Rps7 impairs ribosomal\n\nbiogenesis, resulting in variable lethality and reduced body size\n\naccompanied by abnormal skeletal, melanocyte, eye, and central\n\nnervous system (CNS) development. While many of these\n\nphenotypes have previously been associated with mutation of\n\nmurine RP genes, the findings of overt brain malformations and\n\nbehavioral abnormalities are novel. Similar to mutation of other\n\nRP genes in the mouse, the penetrance of the Rps7-associated\n\nphenotypes is affected by genetic background and the overt\n\nphenotypes are suppressed by TRP53 deficiency. These mutants\n\nprovide the first mouse models of Rps7 disruption and increase our\n\nunderstanding of the phenotypic consequences of mammalian RP\n\nmutations.\n\nResults\n\nIdentification and genetic mapping of montu and zuma\nThe montu (Mtu) mouse was identified in a large-scale ENU\n\nmutagenesis program [15,16] exhibiting dominant inheritance of a\n\nventral belly spot, kinked tail, and reduced body weight (Figure 1A,\n\n1B). Linkage analysis was performed using a cross of the Mtu\n\nfounder (BALB/c OlaHsd background) with C3H/HeH. Analysis\n\nof genotypes of 104 offspring demonstrated linkage to a 74 Mb\n\nregion of proximal chromosome 12 that was further refined to a\n\n3.43 Mb critical region (Figure S1A, S1C). DNA sequencing of\n\nexons and flanking regions of 17 candidate genes using genomic\n\nDNA from four affected animals and controls identified a single\n\nheterozygous sequence variant occurring only in affected mice\n\nwithin exon 6 of Rps7, which encodes a 194 amino acid ribosomal\n\nprotein, RPS7 (or S7e, the eukaryotic specific homolog of the yeast\n\nS7A and S7B). The identified Rps7 variant, c.574T.G\n\n(NM_011300), encodes a Gly substitution of a highly conserved\n\nVal residue (p.V156G; NP_035430) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A).\n\nSubsequent sequence analysis of 91 animals from a C3H/HeH\n\ncongenic Mtu colony showed 100% concordance between the\n\nc.574T.G mutation and the affected phenotypes. Analysis of Mtu\n\nanimals demonstrated variable penetrance on a mixed back-\n\nground, however 100% penetrance of the tail kink, belly spot, and\n\nsmall body size phenotypes when assessed in the C3H/HeH\n\ncongenic colony. We also observed a dominant lethality phenotype\n\nwith incomplete penetrance, 72% viability in F1 BALB/c:C3H\n\nmice (N = 251) and 26% viability in the C3H/HeH congenic\n\ncolony (N = 260).\n\nThe zuma (Zma) mouse was independently identified as part of a\n\nsensitized ENU screen designed to identify mutations that\n\nincreased the severity of neural crest defects observed in Sox10\n\nhaploinsufficient mice (Sox10\nLacZ/+\n\n), a well characterized neural\n\ncrest mutant which presents with a high frequency of small, white\n\nbelly spots [17]. Affected backcross mice (BALB/cJ6C57BL/6J)\nfrom the Zma pedigree exhibited large white belly spots, tail kinks,\n\nand reduced body size. Linkage analysis of twelve affected N1\n\nmice initially detected linkage of Zma to a region of chromosome\n\n12 overlapping where the Mtu mutation was localized (Figure S1B,\n\nS1C). Subsequent sequencing of Rps7 in Zma mice revealed a\n\nheterozygous A to C point mutation in exon 7 of Rps7, predicted\n\nto cause substitution of a conserved amino acid (p.Y177S;\n\nc.637A.C) (Figure 1C, Figure S2A). Genotyping analysis of\n\nZma mice outcrossed to C57BL/6J to establish a congenic colony\n\nshowed that the c.637A.C mutation was observed in 100% of\n\naffected mice. We initially observed incompletely penetrant\n\nphenotypes in N2 heterozygous Zma mice on a mixed BALB/cJ;\n\nC57Bl/6J background, where Zma/+ mice showed 74% viability,\n76% belly spots, and 90% tail kinks (N = 46). However,\n\nheterozygosity for the Zma allele rapidly changed to a completely\n\npenetrant, lethal phenotype during outcrossing onto C57BL/6J,\n\nand no Zma/+ mice were observed at N4. This contrasted with the\nphenotype we observed during establishment of a congenic C3H/\n\nHeJ Zma colony; on this genetic background, the N3 generation\n\nexhibited a low frequency of belly spotting and tail kinks (4% and\n\n0%, respectively; N = 41) yet no lethality, as Zma heterozygotes\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nRibosomes are composed of two subunits that each\nconsist of a large number of proteins, and their function of\ntranslating mRNA into protein is essential for cell viability.\nNaturally occurring or genetically engineered mutations\nwithin an individual ribosomal protein provide a valuable\nresource, since the resulting abnormal phenotypes reveal\nthe function of each ribosomal protein. A number of\nmutations recently identified in mammalian ribosomal\nsubunit genes have confirmed that homozygous loss of\nfunction consistently results in lethality; however, haploin-\nsufficiency causes a variety of tissue-specific phenotypes.\nIn this paper, we describe the first mutant alleles of the\ngene encoding ribosomal protein S7 (Rps7) in mouse. Rps7\nhaploinsufficiency causes decreased size, abnormal skele-\ntal morphology, mid-ventral white spotting, and eye\nmalformations, phenotypes that also occur with haploin-\nsufficiency for other ribosomal subunits. Additionally,\nsignificant apoptosis occurs within the developing central\nnervous system (CNS) along with subtle behavioral\nphenotypes, suggesting RPS7 is required for CNS devel-\nopment. Mutation of human RPS7 has been implicated in\nDiamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA), yet the murine alleles do\nnot present an analogous phenotype. The phenotypes we\nobserve in the Rps7 mouse mutants indicate RPS7 should\nbe considered as a candidate for a broader spectrum of\nhuman diseases.\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nwere observed at the expected frequency through N6. The\n\ncomparably mild phenotype we observed in the congenic C3H/\n\nHeJ Zma colony suggests that the Mtu allele may exert more severe\n\nphenotypic effects than the Zma allele. This hypothesis is\n\nsupported by the observations that Mtu/+ mice presented with\nreduced viability, fully penetrant belly spots, tail kinks, and small\n\nbody size on a predominantly C3H/He genetic background, while\n\nZma/+ mice on a similar background were observed at the\nexpected frequency and were generally indistinguishable in\n\nphenotype from their+/+littermates.\nSequencing of exons 6 and 7 of Rps7 in 9 inbred strains (A/J,\n\nAKR/J, BALB/c, C57BL6/J, C3H/HeJ, CBA, DBA, LP/J, and\n\n101) confirmed that the point mutations detected in Mtu and Zma\n\nare not natural variants. Additionally, we confirmed the presence of\n\nthe mutations in Rps7 transcripts using Mtu/+ and Zma/+ cDNA for\nsequencing and real-time PCR, respectively. We also demonstrated\n\na lack of complementation between the Mtu and Zma Rps7 alleles by\n\nperforming an intercross of heterozygous mice from the two lines.\n\nGenotyping of newborn offspring revealed that no animals carried\n\nboth the Mtu and Zma mutations (N = 27) (Figure S1D). The lack of\n\nviable double heterozygotes was consistent with homozygote\n\nlethality observed in each line, thus showing non-complementation\n\nof the two alleles. Collectively, the similar phenotypes, sequencing\n\ndata, and genetic analyses provide strong evidence that the\n\nmutations identified in Rps7 are responsible for the observed Mtu\n\nand Zma phenotypes, hereafter referred to as Rps7\nMtu\n\nand Rps7\nZma\n\n.\n\nFigure 1. Heterozygous mutation of Rps7 results in visible white spotting, small body size, and tail kinking.

The consequences of the RPS7\nMtu\n\nand RPS7\nZma\n\nmutant proteins were first assessed using the\n\ncomputational analyses PANTHER and SIFT. Results from the\n\nPANTHER coding SNP analysis tool [18] suggested that both\n\nmutations are likely to be deleterious (PANTHER subPSEC score\n\nof 25.00 and 25.06 for RPS7\nMtu\n\nand RPS7\nZma\n\n, respectively).\n\nSimilarly, the Sorting Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT) algorithm\n\n[19] predicted both alleles to affect protein function, however, the\n\nhigh degree of conservation in the 72 database sequences at each\n\nposition resulted in a low confidence level for the prediction (SIFT\n\nprediction score 0.00, median conservation 3.59 for both RPS7\nMtu\n\nand RPS7\nZma\n\n). Collectively, the computational analysis was\n\nconsistent with the Rps7\nMtu\n\nand Rps7\nZma\n\nalleles both having\n\nfunctional consequences.\n\nThe potential effects of p.V156G and p.Y177S on RPS7\n\nsecondary structure (Figure 1D, Figure S2) were also examined.\n\nThere is no three-dimensional protein structure currently available\n\nfor metazoan RPS7, therefore we used the available structures\n\nfrom Tetrahymena thermophila (PDB ID 2XZM) and Saccharomyces\n\ncerevisiae (PDB ID 3U5C), whose RPS7 ortholog sequences share\n\n37% and 55% residue identity with mouse RPS7, respectively\n\n[20,21]. RPS7 structural elements appear to be highly conserved\n\nacross species: the S. cerevisiae and T. thermophila proteins themselves\n\nshare only 34% amino acid identity, yet their solved three-\n\ndimensional structures superimpose well, and are consistent with\n\nsecondary structural predictions of mouse RPS7 generated using\n\nPSSpred (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/PSSpred) and\n\nPROFsec [22] (Figure S2B). Furthermore, the S. cerevisiae and T.\n\nthermophila sequences each contain a Tyr residue homologous to\n\nmouse p.Y177 (Figure S2A), and a Val residue homologous to\n\nmouse p.V156 is present in S. cerevisiae and substituted conserva-\n\ntively with Ile in T. thermophila. The introduction of either p.V156G\n\nor p.Y177S into the mouse sequence did not alter predictions of\n\nthe beta strand and alpha helix at the respective locations of the\n\nsubstitutions (Figure S2B), suggesting that grossly altered second-\n\nary structure may not be responsible for the functional\n\nconsequences of RPS7\nMtu\n\nor RPS7\nZma\n\n.\n\nWe next used biochemical analyses to examine the effects of\n\np.V156G and p.Y177S on stability and subcellular localization of\n\nthe 22 kiloDalton (kDa) protein as well as ribosome assembly and\n\nbiogenesis. Previous studies have shown that nonsense mutations\n\nin RPS19 can result in decreased protein levels, and missense\n\nmutations can alter the capacity of RPS19 to localize to the\n\nnucleolus [23]. C- and N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type,\n\nRPS7\nMtu\n\nand RPS7\nZma\n\nproteins were transiently expressed in\n\nhuman embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells. Western blot analysis\n\nrevealed no differences in protein levels for any of the RPS7\n\nmutant proteins (Figure 2A, Figure S3A). The remaining in vitro\n\nstudies were focused on the potentially more severe RPS7\nMtu\n\nmutant protein. Analysis of the FLAG-tagged proteins revealed no\n\nnotable differences in subcellular localization of the RPS7\nMtu\n\nprotein (Figure 2B). To verify the capacity of RPS7\nMtu\n\nto be\n\nincorporated into the ribosome, cytoplasmic extracts from\n\ntransiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated to\n\nseparate ribosomes and ribosomal subunits (in the pellet) from\n\nfree cytoplasmic proteins (in the supernatant). A similar fraction of\n\nall transfected RPS7 proteins was observed in the ribosomal pellet\n\n(Figure S3B) indicating that the mutation does not alter RPS7\n\nassembly into the ribosome. To confirm this finding, cytoplasmic\n\nextracts from Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ liver were analyzed by ultracentrifugation\nthrough sucrose gradients, and the ratio between the peaks of the\n\nribosomal subunits in the absorbance profile was determined. This\n\nratio can reveal defects in the synthesis of one of the two subunits,\n\nsuch as the net increase of the 60S/40S ratio seen in cultured\n\nhuman cells following depletion of single RPs [24,25]. However,\n\nthe observed 60S/40S ratio in Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ liver was similar to\ncontrol (Figure S3C), indicating that RPS7\n\nMtu\ndoes not drastically\n\nalter assembly of the ribosomal subunits.\n\nWe further assessed whether RPS7\nMtu\n\naffects ribosomal\n\nbiogenesis by analyzing the pre-rRNA maturation pattern.\n\nAlterations are visualized by the accumulation of specific rRNA\n\nprecursors: a defect in large subunit RPs affects cleavage of 28S\n\nprecursors, whereas a defect in small subunit RPs alters that of 18S\n\nprecursors. Northern blot analysis of total RNA from wild-type\n\nand Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ tissue, using a probe for the internal transcribed\nspacer (ITS) 1 of pre-rRNA that anneals to 18S rRNA precursors\n\n[26,27], indicated that 18S rRNA pre-rRNA processing was\n\naltered both in liver and brain from Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ mutant mice\n(Figure 2C). Quantitative measurement of the hybridization\n\nsignals showed a significant accumulation of the 30S precursor\n\nin Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ (indicated by an increased 30S/21S ratio; Figure 2D),\nconfirming altered rRNA precursor processing and demonstrating\n\nthat the RPS7\nMtu\n\nmutation has functional consequences on\n\nribosomal biogenesis.\n\nCharacterization of the Rps7 phenotype\nSkeletal and eye malformation. X-ray examination of\n\nadult Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice showed that vertebral fusion is responsible\nfor the tail kinks (Figure 3A, 3B). Similar results were observed for\n\nRps7\nMtu\n\n/+ adult mice, indicating that in both mutants, defective\nsomitogenesis occurs as a result of RPS7 alterations. Decreased\n\nvertebrae numbers were also observed in both mutants; a\n\nreduction in total vertebrae number in Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ (52–55 versus\n55–57 in wild-type) and in caudal vertebrae number in Rps7\n\nZma/+\n\n(16–19 versus 20–22 in wild-type). The decreased vertebrae\n\nnumbers indicate defective tail bud function associated with\n\ndefects in RPS7. Alcian blue and alizarin red staining of late\n\ngestation Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ embryos (N = 3 for each\ngenotype) revealed further Rps7\n\nZma\n/+-associated skeletal abnor-\n\nmalities, including general disorganization of vertebral processes\n\nand arches in the cervical vertebrae (Figure 3C, 3D). The anterior\n\ntuberculum was appropriately located on C6, however a very\n\nsmall partial rib was observed on C7 (in 2 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos),\nindicating an incompletely penetrant transformation of C7 to T1.\n\nWithin the thoracic region, we observed a shortened first\n\nsternebrae and asymmetric attachment of 8 ribs to the sternum\n\nrather than the usual 7 (in all 3 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos) (Figure 3E,\n3F). Within the lumbar and sacral regions, a severe developmental\n\ndelay was observed, and disorganization of the ossification centers\n\nwas evident with some ossification centers being duplicated\n\n(Figure 3G, 3H). Additionally, we observed a transformation of\n\nL1 to T13 (in all 3 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos) and also asymmetric fusion\nof the transverse processes of the first 5–6 sacral vertebrae (in 2\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos) rather than the 3–4 observed in Rps7+/+\n(Figure 3H). Collectively the skeletal phenotypes observed in Rps7\n\nmutants are consistent with an anterior transformation of the axial\n\nskeleton.\n\nFrequent microphthalmia and uveal coloboma were also\n\nobserved as features of the Rps7 mutant phenotype (Figure 4).\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos showed eye malformations ranging from\nminor delay in optic fissure closure to severe microphthalmia and\n\ninternalization of the entire eye structure. Whole mount micro-\n\nscopic imaging of E12.5 embryos revealed that 100% of Rps7\nZma\n\n/+\nembryos exhibited a unilateral or bilateral delay in closure of the\n\noptic fissure, as compared to Rps7+/+ embryos which all showed\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 4 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nnormal optic fissures (N = 5 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+, N = 7 Rps7+/+)\n(Figure 4A–4C). By E14.5, a time when wild-type embryos have\n\ncomplete fissure, 100% of Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos still displayed optic\nfissure closure defects either unilaterally (N = 2) or bilaterally\n\n(N = 3) (Figure 4D–4F). Additionally, more severe microphthal-\n\nmia and internalization of the eye was observed in 20% of\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos (Figure 4F, 4I; 1 out of 5 at both E12.5 and\nE14.5).\n\nCirculating blood chemistry and erythroid\n\ndifferentiation. Because human RPS7 mutations are associated\n\nwith DBA [11], a disease characterized by red cell aplasia, we\n\nundertook an initial characterization of circulating blood in adult\n\nRps7\nMtu\n\n/+ mice (on a C3H/He background) and Rps7Zma/+ mice\n(on a mixed C57BL/6J; BALB/cJ background). Neither Rps7\n\nmutant allele caused any significant differences from Rps7+/+\nlittermates in total hemoglobin, red blood cell (RBC) counts, white\n\nblood cell (WBC) counts, or hematocrit (Figure 5A, 5B, Table S1).\n\nMean corpuscular volume (MCV) was slightly elevated in Rps7\nMtu\n\n/\n\n+ mice (elevated 1.026 fold over wild-type, p,0.05) (Figure 5A),\nhowever no significant difference in MCV was observed in\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice (Figure 5B). Additional analyses of plasma\nbiochemistry revealed no significant differences between\n\nRps7\nMtu\n\n/+ and Rps7+/+ animals in major electrolytes and\nmetabolic indicators (Na\n\n+\n, K\n\n+\n, Cl\n\n2\n, urea, creatinine, ALP, AST,\n\nALT, total cholesterol, triglycerides, iron, amylase, and free fatty\n\nacids) (Table S2).\n\nTo further assess erythroid development of Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice,\nwhich exhibit perinatal lethality on a C57BL/6J background,\n\nE13.5 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ fetal liver samples were characterized by flow\ncytometry. We simultaneously used monoclonal antibodies against\n\nthe erythroid cell lineage markers CD71, expressed at higher levels\n\nduring early stages of erythroid differentiation, and Ter119,\n\nexpressed at higher levels as erythrocytes mature, to profile 5\n\ncharacteristic populations of erythroid precursors (R1 to R5)\n\n[28,29] (Figure 5C). These cell populations correspond to\n\nincreasingly differentiated developmental stages, with R1 marking\n\nerythroid progenitors and proerythroblasts, R2 marking proeryth-\n\nroblasts and early basophilic erythroblasts, R3 marking all\n\nbasophilic erythroblasts, R4 marking chromatophilic and ortho-\n\nchromatophilic erythroblasts, and R5 marking late orthochroma-\n\ntophilic erythroblasts and reticulocytes. Compared to their Rps7+/\n+ littermates, Rps7Zma/+ E13.5 embryos showed a significant\nincrease in the percentage of R3 cells (p,0.001) suggesting that\n\nerythroid precursors could be blocked in their maturation\n\n(Figure 5D). However, analysis of erythroid cell populations of\n\nE14.5 fetal livers showed that the percentages of cells in the R2–\n\nR5 populations were indistinguishable between Rps7+/+ and\nRps7\n\nZma\n/+ genotypes (Table S3). The presence of the more mature\n\nR4 and R5 cells at E14.5 indicates erythroid differentiation\n\nprogresses, rather than being blocked at R3. Alternatively, the\n\nincrease in R3 cells at E13.5 may result from a general\n\ndevelopmental delay in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos. This was confirmed\nby inspection of gross anatomical features of crown-rump length,\n\nalong with eye, limb, and craniofacial development at E11.5–13.5,\n\nwhich showed that Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryonic development is delayed\nby approximately one day relative to that of Rps7+/+ littermates\n(Figure S4). While we cannot rule out subtle alterations in\n\nerythroid maturation that may cause the differences observed in\n\nthe precursor populations, these analyses collectively suggest that\n\nthese two mutant alleles of Rps7 do not significantly impair red\n\nblood cell production or differentiation.\n\nEarly effect on melanoblast development. To assess the\n\neffects of RPS7 mutation on melanocyte development, we\n\ncharacterized Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mutant embryos from E10.5 to 14.5.\n\nFigure 2.

In these Rps7\n\nZma\n/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) embryos, Dct-positive\n\nmelanoblasts were notably reduced by E10.5 relative to Rps7+/+;\nTg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6A, 6B). At E14.5, a significant\n\nreduction in melanoblast number was still observed in both the\n\nhead and trunk of Rps7\nZma\n\n/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) mice compared to\nRps7+/+; Tg(Dct-LacZ) littermates (Figure 6C–6F). Mutation of\nRps7 did not cause a complete loss of melanoblasts, however, as\n\nDct-positive cells could still be observed at E14.5 in regions where\n\nmelanoblast density is normally highest, particularly around the\n\ndeveloping pinna and eye (Figure 6C, 6D). This severe melano-\n\nblast reduction in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos was independently con-\nfirmed by in situ hybridization with a probe targeting mRNA for\n\nthe melanoblast/melanosome-specific protein Pmel17 (Figure S5).\n\nQualitative observation of Pmel17-expressing melanoblasts showed\n\nthat E12.5 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mutant embryos displayed a marked\nreduction in melanoblasts relative to E12.5 Rps7+/+ littermates.\nThe reduction in melanoblasts is more severe than can be\n\nattributed to the developmental delay observed in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+\nmutants, as E12.5 Rps7\n\nZma\n/+ embryos showed a reduced\n\nmelanoblast number even in comparison to E11.5 Rps7+/+\nembryos (Figure S5). A combination of Rps7 and Sox10\n\nhaploinsufficiency (Rps7\nZma\n\n/+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes)\nfurther reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (Figure S6),\n\nconsistent with the increased spotting observed in rare Rps7\nZma\n\n/\n\n+; Sox10LacZ/+ pups that survived postnatally (Figure S7A, S7B).\nPostnatally, we observed that melanocytes were present in the\n\ntail skin of Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice (Figure S7E, S7F), yet no dark skin\nphenotype occurred in the tails or footpads of adult Rps7\n\nZma\n/+ or\n\nRps7\nMtu\n\n/+mice (Figure S7C–S7F). This indicates that these Rps7\nmutations do not cause epidermal melanocytosis, as was previously\n\nobserved for mutation of Rps19 and Rps20 [5]. Collectively, these\n\ndata show that mutation of Rps7 causes a severe, early reduction in\n\nmelanoblasts that is sufficient to account for the white belly\n\nspotting observed in viable heterozygotes.\n\nEnlarged ventricles, cortical thinning, and deficits in\n\nworking memory. We examined the neuroanatomical features\n\nof the Rps7 mutants, employing histological techniques and\n\nmagnetic resonance microscopy (MRM). Gross observations and\n\nhistological staining revealed marked cortical thinning accompa-\n\nnied by enlarged ventricles in adult Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ (Figure 7A–7B) and\nperinatal Rps7\n\nZma\n/+ mice (Figure 7C, and data not shown). To\n\ninvestigate this phenotype further, we undertook MRM imaging of\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice at E18.5 (N = 3) (Figure 7D–7I). Following\nmanual segmentation of 10 major anatomic structures, the volume\n\nof each brain region was calculated as a percentage of the total\n\nbrain volume (Figure 7J) and 3-dimensional (3D) rendering with\n\nsmoothing was performed to generate 3D representations (Video\n\nS1 and Video S2). This quantitative analysis showed that the\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ CNS phenotypes originate during development and\nconfirmed a significant reduction in cortical (P = 0.0002) and\n\nhippocampal (P = 0.0044) size in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mutants. Although\nlateral ventricle volume was not significantly different between\n\nthese small groups, qualitative observations of ventricle size at\n\ndissection, in MRM images, and in histological sections consis-\n\ntently indicated Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mutants had enlarged ventricles,\nleading us to conclude that enlarged ventricles are a consistent\n\nfeature of the Rps7 phenotype.\n\nWe investigated whether these gross neuroanatomical pheno-\n\ntypes affected the behavior of the Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ mice, assessing\nlocomotor activity, anxiety and working memory. The results\n\nshowed that while Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ mutants exhibited normal locomotor\nactivity and anxiety-related phenotypes, they displayed deficits in\n\nFigure 3.

Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ mutants displayed similar behavior to\nRps7+/+ controls in an open-field test, with no significant\ndifferences in total distance travelled in the open field or time\n\nspent in the center (Figure S8A). Similarly, there were no\n\nsignificant differences between Rps7+/+ controls and Rps7Mtu/\n+littermates when assessed on the elevated plus-maze (Figure S8B–\nS8E), nor did Rps7\n\nMtu\n/+ mutant animals display any ataxia that\n\nwould be indicative of motor dysfunction. We also investigated\n\nwhether Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ mice displayed any defects in working memory\nusing a spontaneous alternation test, which can indicate hippo-\n\ncampal dysfunction [31]. The mouse is placed in the start arm of\n\nan enclosed T-maze (the base of the ‘‘T’’), and allowed to enter a\n\ngoal arm (the two arms of the top of the ‘‘T’’) of its own choice.\n\nUpon repeating this test, the mouse can demonstrate memory of\n\nits previous choice by entering the arm not visited before, a\n\nbehavior called spontaneous alternation. Here we observed a\n\nsignificant difference between Rps7+/+ controls, which exhibited\nan average alternation frequency of 83%, and Rps7\n\nMtu\n/+ mutants,\n\nwhich exhibited an average alternation frequency of only 68%\n\n(N = 9, P = 0.01) (Figure 7K). Collectively, the MRM and\n\nbehavioral data indicate that Rps7 is required for normal\n\ndevelopment of the central nervous system, particularly the\n\ntelencephalon, and that mutations in this gene have the capacity\n\nto affect hippocampal-dependent behavior.\n\nIncreased neuronal apoptosis in Rps7 mutants. Our\n\nhistological studies also revealed that late gestation Rps7\nZma\n\n/+\nembryos exhibited pyknotic nuclei in the white matter tracts of the\n\nspinal cord (Figure S9), consistent with CNS degeneration. As\n\nmutations in other RPs have been associated with increased\n\ncellular apoptosis [32–37], we used immunohistochemistry to\n\ndetect cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) within the CNS. When compared\n\nto normal littermates, Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos showed increased\napoptosis in the cortex and neural tube at both E11.5\n\n(Figure 8A, 8B, 8D, 8E) and E12.5 (data not shown). Although\n\nmitotic, phospho-histone H3-positive (PH3+) cells surrounding the\nlumen of the neural tube appeared slightly disorganized in E11.5\n\nand E12.5 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+embryos (Figure 8G, 8H and data not\nshown), cell counting revealed no significant difference in PH3+\ncell number per section compared to Rps7+/+ littermates\n(Figure 8J). In contrast, CC3 counts confirmed a significant\n\nincrease in apoptosis in the neural tube of E11.5 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+\nembryos compared to Rps7+/+ (N = 3, p,0.001) (Figure 8K).\nConsistent with the location of apoptosis and with a putative role\n\nfor RPS7 in CNS development, in situ hybridization studies on\n\nFigure 4.

Using immunohistochemistry, we observed an\n\nincrease in TRP53 staining in the cortex (E11.5) and neural tube\n\n(E11.5 and E12.5) of Rps7 mutants consistent with increased\n\nTRP53-mediated apoptosis (Figure S11).

In an attempt to restore hetero-\n\nzygote viability by suppressing apoptosis, we crossed the Rps7\nZma\n\nmutation onto a Trp53 mutant background. Trp53 mutations have\n\nbeen used to successfully suppress phenotypes in other RP mutants\n\n[5,35]. Rps7\nZma\n\nmice were originally identified on a mixed genetic\n\nbackground, and heterozygote lethality in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice\nincreased as the mutation was outcrossed onto a C57BL/6J\n\nbackground. Thus we used early generation, mixed background\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice to establish a cross with Trp53 mutant mice on a\nC57Bl/6J background (B6.129S2-Trp53\n\ntm1Tyj/J\n, hereafter\n\nTrp53\nKO\n\n). Within a few generations of outcrossing, no viable\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice were observed after birth, as expected. However,\nRps7\n\nZma\n/+; Trp53 KO/+ double heterozygotes were recovered at\n\nthe expected 50% frequency, suggesting restoration of Rps7\nZma\n\n/+\nviability in the context of Trp53 haploinsufficiency (Table S4).

In most cases Rps7Zma/+;\n\nTrp53\nKO\n\n/+ double heterozygotes were indistinguishable from their\nwild-type littermates after weaning, with the exception of a very\n\nsmall belly spot observed in 47% of Rps7\nZma\n\n/+; Trp53KO/+ mice.\nTrp53 haploinsufficiency also suppressed the phenotypes of gross\n\nembryonic developmental delay (Figure S4), the subtle delay in\n\nerythroid maturation (Table S3), and CNS apoptosis (Figure 8C, 8F,\n\n8K). In summary, the pleiotropic phenotypes observed in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+\nmice all appeared to be suppressed by Trp53 haploinsufficiency.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this paper we present genetic, functional, and phenotypic\n\nevidence that the montu (Mtu) and zuma (Zma) mouse lines isolated\n\nfrom independent ENU screens harbor distinct point mutations in\n\nRps7. These first-reported alleles of Rps7 in mice cause similar\n\nphenotypes including small body size, tail abnormalities, mid-\n\nventral white spotting, eye defects, and an underdeveloped\n\ncerebral cortex.\n\nWe provide functional evidence that the Rps7\nMtu\n\nmutation\n\n(p.V156G) affects ribosome biogenesis. The altered Rps7\nMtu\n\n30S/\n\n21S ratio is consistent with the altered pre-rRNA maturation\n\nreported for a DBA patient harboring an RPS7 donor splice-site\n\nmutation (c.147+1G.A) that results in accumulation of 30S and\n45S precursors [11]. A requirement for RPS7 during rRNA\n\nmaturation is supported by other studies showing a role for human\n\nRPS7 in early stages of 45S rRNA processing [24] or the nuclear\n\nstages of 40S maturation [38]. In yeast, depletion of the two RPS7\n\nparalogs (S7a and S7b) results in a severe growth defect [39,40]\n\nand S7 has been hypothesized to play an early role as a component\n\nof the small subunit processome [41] as well as a later role in\n\nribosome biogenesis during assembly of polysomes [42]. However,\n\nthe mechanism underlying the altered rRNA maturation in these\n\nmurine Rps7 mutants is not clear, as neither the Rps7\nMtu\n\nnor the\n\nRps7\nZma\n\nmutation is predicted to grossly disrupt protein secondary\n\nstructure, and RPS7\nMtu\n\nprotein is correctly localized and\n\nincorporated into ribosomes in cultured cells. Presumably, the\n\nmutant RPS7 proteins could be altered in their interactions with\n\nrRNA, other ribosomal proteins, or non-ribosomal proteins. The\n\npossibility of interaction with non-ribosomal proteins is intriguing\n\ngiven the position of RPS7 at the surface of the ribosome (Figure\n\nS2C, S2D) in close proximity to the binding site for eIF4G [21], a\n\neukaryotic initiation factor important for assembling the pre-\n\ninitiation complex. Interestingly, most other known, viable mouse\n\nRP mutations also occur in eukaryotic-specific RPs located at the\n\nsurface of the ribosome. Additional work is needed to determine\n\nthe precise role RPS7 plays in mammalian ribosome biogenesis\n\nand how the Rps7\nMtu\n\nand Rps7\nZma\n\nmutations disrupt this function.\n\nWhile modeling the pre-rRNA processing defect of an RPS7\n\nDBA patient, these Rps7 mutant mice do not replicate the\n\ncharacteristic DBA phenotype of severe anemia. This lack of an\n\nanemia phenotype is not entirely unexpected, since the analysis of\n\nmany mouse mutants suggests that mice as a species are generally\n\nless sensitive than humans to any gene haploinsufficiency [43,44].\n\nThis is exemplified by the fact that, despite frequent mutation of\n\nFigure 6.

It is possible that further studies of Rps7 alleles on different\n\ngenetic backgrounds or in mice with more severe alleles may\n\nreveal additional red blood cell phenotypes. In the future,\n\ncomparison among mouse DBA models may provide insight into\n\nwhy the murine and human hematological phenotypes do not fully\n\noverlap, and may also reveal why mutation in RPS19 has a\n\nuniquely high frequency in DBA compared to other RPs that\n\ncause the disease.\n\nBoth Rps7 mutants display a variety of skeletal phenotypes that\n\ncollectively suggest that normal ribosome biogenesis is required for\n\nthree distinct stages of somite development, which governs\n\nsubsequent axial skeleton formation. First, the decreased number\n\nof tail vertebrae indicates an insufficient production of somite\n\nprogenitors. Second, the mutant vertebral fusion leading to tail\n\nkinks is indicative of incorrect somite border formation. Third, the\n\nmutants exhibit an array of axial skeleton defects consistent with\n\nFigure 8.

Widespread disturbances of the skeletal system\n\nencompassing each of these three defects are also found in Rpl38\n\n(tail short, Ts) [46,47] and Rpl24 (belly spot and tail, Bst) mutants\n\n[6,48]. Indeed, there are striking similarities in the defects\n\nobserved in Rpl38 and Rps7 mutants, including specific transfor-\n\nmations within the cervical (C7 to T1), thoracic (T8 to T7), lumbar\n\n(L1 to T13) and sacral (fusion of additional transverse processes)\n\nregions. Mutations in Rpl38 and Rpl24 cause additional distur-\n\nbances of the appendicular skeleton not observed in Rps7,\n\nhowever, given the similarities of these mutants to Rps7 it will be\n\ninteresting to see if appendicular skeletal defects are observed with\n\ndifferent Rps7 alleles and/or genetic backgrounds. Interestingly,\n\nsevere skeletal malformations have not been reported for five other\n\nmurine RP mutants (Rps19, Rps20, Rpl22, Rpl27a, Rpl29)\n\n[5,7,8,49,50]. This suggests that either mutation of RP proteins\n\ndo not universally affect skeletal development, or skeletal defects\n\nremain to be identified in these other RP mutants. In the case of\n\nRps7, the severity of skeletal defects was modified by both genetic\n\nbackground and by allele, suggesting that detailed characterization\n\nin existing and additional RP mutants is necessary to further\n\nexplore the role of RP proteins in skeletal development.\n\nWe show that Rps7\nZma\n\n-mediated white spotting results from a\n\nsevere developmental reduction in melanoblasts. A developmental\n\nreduction in melanoblasts has also been reported in Rps19 and\n\nRps20 heterozygous mutants, however, these mutants subsequently\n\ndevelop epidermal melanocytosis [5], a phenotype not seen in\n\neither Rps7 mutant. This difference is unlikely to be due to genetic\n\nbackground, as both Rps7 mutants and Rps19 and Rps20 mutants\n\nwere examined on a predominantly C3H background. Alterna-\n\ntively, the difference could be a more severe developmental\n\nreduction in melanoblast numbers in Rps7 mutants, resulting in\n\nfewer melanoblasts available at later time points to generate\n\nepidermal melanocytosis. Another possibility is that loss of Rps7\n\nmay not have the same effect in keratinocytes as loss of Rps6, Rps19\n\nand Rps20, which are thought to act in keratinocytes to produce\n\nTRP53-mediated dark skin [5]. Our in vitro experiments with Rps7\n\n(Figure 2 and Figure S3) suggest that these mutations are\n\nhypomorphic alleles, so a third possibility is that allele severity,\n\nrather than gene-specific function, could account for pigmentation\n\nphenotype differences among RP mutants.\n\nThe mouse Rps7 mutants display additional developmental\n\ndefects of reduced cortical and hippocampal size. We hypothesize\n\nthat cell death within the developing CNS is sufficient to account\n\nfor the neocortical thinning we observe in both Rps7 mutant lines.\n\nWe also hypothesize that apoptosis within the developing\n\ntelencephalon might account for the deficit in working memory\n\nobserved in Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ heterozygotes. To our knowledge, this is a\nnovel developmental brain abnormality in mouse arising from RP\n\nhaploinsufficiency, differing substantially from the only other\n\nreport of neuronal defects in RP mutant mice, that of cerebellar\n\nabnormalities and ataxia in Rpl27a sooty foot mutants [7].\n\nInterestingly, the neuronal phenotypes in mouse Rps7 mutants\n\ncorrelate with the report of microcephaly as one of 11 congenital\n\ncraniofacial anomalies that can be associated with DBA [51], and\n\nare consistent with RP mutant phenotypes observed in different\n\nmodel organisms. In zebrafish, gene-specific neuronal phenotypes\n\nwere seen in a subset of knocked-down RPs [4] and further studies\n\nof RPL11 revealed brain deformities and reduced neuronal\n\nprogenitor cells along with apoptosis in the affected regions [32].\n\nIn the zebra finch, RPL17 and RPL37 both regulate the sexually\n\ndimorphic formation of the song control regions of the brain\n\nwithin the VZ [52]. Thus, the murine Rps7 mutant phenotypes\n\nadd to a growing body of literature linking individual RPs to\n\nspecific features of neural development and suggesting that other\n\nRP mouse mutants may have previously uncharacterized defects in\n\nbrain development.\n\nImportant questions remain regarding what underlying cellular\n\nmechanisms explain the similarities and differences among RP-\n\nassociated phenotypes. A growing body of literature suggests a\n\ncommon mechanism where alterations in RP expression result in\n\nactivation of TRP53, suggesting ribosomal stress is one of the\n\nmany cellular anomalies detected by TRP53. For example, in their\n\nstudy of RP-mediated dark skin, McGowan and colleagues show\n\nthat TRP53 acts as a sensor of ribosomal integrity, and that\n\nmutations in Rps19 and Rps20 can be phenotypically suppressed by\n\nTrp53 deficiency [5]. Trp53 haploinsufficiency also relieves the\n\nabnormal phenotypes of mice heterozygous for the sooty foot\n\nataxia allele of Rpl27a [7] or the Bst allele of Rpl24 [6]. Similarly,\n\nour results show that loss of Rps7 increases TRP53 levels and that\n\nTrp53 haploinsufficiency suppresses all morphological aspects of\n\nthe Rps7 phenotype. Our in vivo studies are supported by recent\n\nstudies showing that Rps7 depletion in vitro as well as in vivo in\n\nzebrafish induces TRP53 expression [53,54], and collectively\n\nsuggest the mechanism underlying the Rps7 phenotype is TRP53\n\nactivation followed by TRP53-mediated apoptosis.\n\nWhile these data suggest that RP mutant phenotypes may all be\n\nattributed to alterations in RP—TRP53 interactions, the variabil-\n\nity among RP phenotypes suggests more complexity, potentially as\n\na result of RP gene-specific or cell-specific functions [55]. Tissue-\n\nspecific effects of mutations in different RPs have been observed in\n\nzebrafish [4], mouse [5,6] and human [11]. These apparently\n\ntissue-specific phenotypes could simply be due to incomplete\n\nphenotypic characterization, differing severity of hypomorphic\n\nalleles, and/or differing genetic backgrounds. However, if they\n\ntruly reflect tissue-specific RP functions, one explanation could be\n\ndifferences in the relative expression levels of individual RPs, with\n\na consequent differential sensitivity to RP insufficiency that could\n\nvary with tissue type, developmental stage or differentiation state.\n\nIndeed, remarkable heterogeneity in RP mRNA levels has been\n\nobserved in a variety of tissues [56] including specifically during\n\nmouse embryonic development [47] and human neuronal\n\ndifferentiation [57].\n\nA cell type-specific sensitivity to RP insufficiency is strongly\n\nsupported by the observation that keratinocyte-specific Rps6\n\nhemizygosity causes hyperpigmentation while melanocyte-specific\n\nRps6 hemizygosity instead causes hypopigmentation [5]. Similarly,\n\nthe severe melanoblast reduction in Rps7 mutants could suggest a\n\nmelanocyte-specific sensitivity to RPS7 loss. Given that Sox10 and\n\nRps7 pathways interact in melanocytes in vivo (Figure S6, Figure\n\nS7), it will be interesting to determine if a melanocyte-specific\n\ntranscriptional response to RPS7 deficiency is mediated by Sox10,\n\nwhich is expressed in melanocytes but absent in keratinocytes.\n\nTRP53 activation in melanocytes has already been associated with\n\ndownregulation of another white spotting gene, Kit, which is\n\nproposed as a transcriptional target of TRP53 [7,58]. Further\n\nwork is needed in melanocytes and other cell types that display RP\n\ngene-specific phenotypes, to clarify if direct transcriptional\n\nregulation of lineage-specific genes plays a role in tissue-specific\n\nsensitivity to individual RP deficiencies.\n\nAnother explanation of tissue-specific RP phenotypes could be a\n\nfunction for individual RPs in the translation of specific mRNAs.\n\nThis is supported by studies of RPL13 [59] and by a recent study\n\nreporting patterning defects in Rpl38 mutant mouse embryos due to\n\nRPL38 translational regulation of a subset of Hox transcripts [47].\n\nThe tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7 mutants would be\n\nconsistent with a role for RPS7 in facilitating translational\n\nregulation of transcripts critical for development of the affected\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\ntissues. Alternatively, tissue-specific phenotypes observed in Rps7\n\nmutants could be a consequence of a direct interaction between\n\nRPS7 and tissue-specific developmental regulators at the protein\n\nlevel. Interestingly, support for protein-protein interactions between\n\nRPS7 and SOX10 comes from recent evidence that RPS7 interacts\n\ndirectly with SRY, an HMG box protein related to SOX10 [60].\n\nThis mechanism of direct interaction between RPs and tissue-\n\nspecific, non-ribosomal proteins could explain tissue-specific phe-\n\nnotypes in RP mutants, and is supported by a number of studies\n\nreporting extra-ribosomal functions of specific RPs in regulation of\n\nribosome biosynthesis and binding of transcription factor complexes\n\n(reviewed in ref. [55]).\n\nThe relative contributions of these various mechanistic expla-\n\nnations for tissue-specific and gene-specific RP mutant phenotypes\n\nwill be clarified with further detailed comparison of mutants on\n\nconsistent genetic backgrounds and with additional information\n\nfrom tissue-specific conditional alleles. In summary, these novel\n\nalleles of Rps7 add to the growing collection of mammalian\n\nribosomal mutants and provide two new mouse models of a DBA-\n\nassociated gene. Importantly, the unique CNS apoptosis and\n\nbehavioral phenotypes reported here suggest that RPs need to be\n\nconsidered as candidate genes for not only DBA but also a broad\n\nspectrum of neurodevelopmental human diseases.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics statement\nAll procedures performed in the UK were in accordance with\n\nthe UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and those\n\nperformed in the United States were approved by the IACUC in\n\naccordance with NIH guidelines.\n\nMice\nMontu mice were identified in a screen where BALB/c male mice\n\nwere mutagenized using ENU and crossed to C3H/He for\n\nscreening.

After staining, embryos were\n\nrinsed in water and cleared in 1% KOH for 3 hours at room\n\ntemperature and moved to fresh 1% KOH overnight.

The exper-\n\niments were performed on tissues from Rps7+/+ and Rps7Mtu/+\nlittermate mice (2 Rps7+/+ and 2 Rps7Mtu/+ for liver, 3 Rps7+/+\nand 3 Rps7\n\nMtu\n/+ for brain, each in triplicate). Quantitation is\n\nreported as the ratio between 30S and 21S rRNA precursors and\n\nwas significantly different between genotypes in both brain\n\n(p,0.01) and liver (p,0.01) (two-way ANOVA with post hoc t-\n\ntest).\n\nFor ribosome isolation, cytoplasmic extracts from RPS7\n\np.V156G transiently transfected HEK-293 cells were fractionated\n\nthrough ultracentrifugation on a sucrose cushion. After 2 hours of\n\ncentrifugation at 100,000 g, ribosomes and ribosomal subunits\n\nwere recovered in the pellet and free cytoplasmic proteins were\n\nrecovered from the supernatant.\n\nFor sucrose gradients separating polysomes and ribosomal\n\nsubunits, cytoplasmic extracts from Mtu/+ liver were loaded onto a\n10%–30% linear sucrose gradient containing 30 mM Tris-HCl\n\n(pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2. Gradients were\n\ncentrifuged in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 5 hr at 37,000 rpm and\n\nthen the absorbance profile of the gradient was used to evaluate\n\nthe ratio between the peaks of ribosomal subunits (60S and 40S).\n\nIn situ hybridization\nFor whole mount, Pmel17-containing plasmid (Riken cDNA\n\nclone G370069C13; GenBank Acc: BB766987) was digested with\n\nKpn1 and transcribed with T3 polymerase to generate DIG-\n\nlabeled in situ probes. Hybridizations were performed using\n\npublished protocols [61] with the following modifications. After\n\nprobe hybridization, Ribonuclease A digestion was omitted, and\n\nTris-buffered saline was used in place of PBS. BM-purple substrate\n\n(Roche, Molecular Biochemicals) was used in place of 5-bromo-4-\n\nchloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium. Embryos were\n\nphotographed using a Zeiss SteREO Discovery V12 microscope\n\nwith a Zeiss AxioCam camera. Probes to detect Rps7 by in situ\n\nhybridization were amplified by PCR and cloned into the pCRII-\n\nTOPO vector (Invitrogen) using the following primer pairs:\n\nR7_IN_F AAGGAAATCGAAGTTGGTG and R7_IN_ R\n\nAATTAACATCCTTGCCTGTG. Mouse embryos were fixed\n\nin 2–4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 30% (w/v)\n\nsucrose in phosphate buffer before sectioning (10–20 mm) on a\ncryostat. In situ hybridization was carried out as previously\n\ndescribed [62]. Briefly, hybridization of sections with\n35\n\nS-UTP-\n\nlabeled RNA probes was carried out in a 50% (v/v) formamide\n\nsolution at 60uC. Sections were washed in 50% (v/v) formamide,\nan RNAse A treatment was performed for 30 min at 37uC, and\nthen successively stringent SSC solution washes were performed,\n\nwith a final wash at 0.16 SSC at 60uC.\n\nHistology and immunohistochemistry\nFor Nissl staining, adult mice were perfused with 0.9% NaCl\n\nand 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde before the brain was dehydrated\n\nin 30% sucrose, sectioned (40 mm) on a freezing microtome, and\nstained.. For embryonic histology, embryos were fixed in either\n\nBouin’s fixative or 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, washed\n\nextensively in PBS, and dehydrated in 70% ethanol before\n\nsectioning (5–7 mm paraffin) and hematoxylin and eosin (H and E)\nstaining. For immunohistochemistry, embryos were fixed in 4%\n\nparaformaldehyde overnight, washed with PBS, dehydrated in\n\n10% sucrose followed by 20% sucrose, then embedded in Neg-50\n\n(Thermo Scientific) for cryosectioning (14 mm). Antibodies includ-\ned anti-TRP53 (Leica NCL-p53-CM5p, 1:200), anti-CC3 (Cell\n\nSignaling #9661, 1:200), and anti-PH3 (Millipore #06-570,\n1:200) and resulting stains were imaged using a Zeiss Observer.D1\n\nmicroscope. For apoptosis and proliferation experiments, trans-\n\nverse cryo-sections collected at the level of the forelimb from 3\n\nembryos of each genotype, 6 sections per embryo, were counted\n\nfor CC3+ and PH3+ cells. InStat software (GraphPad Software,\nInc.) was used for one-way ANOVA statistical analysis. No\n\nsignificant difference among the three genotypes was observed in\n\nPH3+ cell counts (p = 0.902). CC3 counts were significantly\ndifferent among genotypes (p = 0.0005) and a Tukey-Kramer\n\nmultiple comparison post test was used for pairwise comparison\n\namong all genotypes with the following results: Rps7+/+ versus\nRps7\n\nZma\n/+ (p,0.001), Rps7+/+ versus Rps7Zma/+; Trp53KO/+\n\n(P.0.05, no significant difference), Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ versus Rps7Zma/+;\nTrp53\n\nKO\n/+ (p,0.01).\n\nBehavioral phenotyping\nBehavioral phenotyping was performed on mutant and unaf-\n\nfected sex-matched littermates between 8 and 12 weeks of age.\n\nOpen-field tests were conducted for 5 minutes in a brightly lit,\n\n60 cm diameter, enclosed white arena (field), and monitored by an\n\nautomated tracking system to measure the total distance travelled\n\nand the amount of time spent in the center versus the border of the\n\nfield. The elevated plus maze test was conducted with an elevated\n\nplatform consisting of two enclosed arms and two open arms. An\n\nautomated tracking system was employed to measure the number\n\nof entries into each arm and distance traveled in open and closed\n\narms of the elevated plus maze over 5 minutes. Spontaneous\n\nalternation was performed in an enclosed T-maze built from gray\n\nplastic (arm dimensions 30 cm610 cm630 cm). Each mouse\nunderwent 10 trials with an inter-trial interval of at least\n\n20 minutes. For each trial the mouse was placed in the start\n\narm facing the end wall and allowed to enter a goal arm of its own\n\nchoice. The mouse was confined in the goal arm for 30 seconds\n\nand then put back in the start arm and allowed a free choice of\n\neither arm [31].\n\nMRM imaging\nLate gestation (E18.5) embryos were collected, fixed in 4%\n\nparaformaldehyde overnight, washed extensively in PBS, and\n\nstored in 70% ethanol. Prior to imaging, embryos were rehydrated\n\nin a solution of PBS and 0.5% (v/v) Magnevist (Bayer Healthcare\n\nPharmaceuticals, Wayne, NJ), a contrast agent. MRM was\n\nperformed on specimens using a Bruker 14.1T MR imaging\n\nspectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA) using a multi-echo\n\nRARE technique [63] with TR/TE = 200/6.9 ms, 8-echoes, and\n\n4 signal averages. The resulting 3D images were acquired in\n\n53 min with an acquisition resolution of 50 microns isotropic.\n\nManual segmentation of the whole brain and 10 major anatomical\n\nregions was performed using Amira visualization software (v5.2.2,\n\nVisage Imaging Inc., Andover MA, USA) with guidance from an\n\nRps7 Mouse Mutants\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 14 January 2013 | Volume 9 | Issue 1 | e1003094\n\n\n\nanatomical reference atlas [64]. The volume of these regions was\n\nestimated and 3D rendering with smoothing was performed to\n\ngenerate 3D representations. Student’s t-tests were used to\n\ncompare volumes of each Rps7+/+ and Rps7Zma/+ brain region.\nSignificance was assessed using the Bonferonni method to correct\n\nfor multiple testing, with p,0.005 deemed significant.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Montu and zuma map to mouse Chromosome 12 and\n\ncause a variety of phenotypes.

Green highlight indicates the location of p.V156 and\n\np.Y177, and red font indicates non-identical residues. (B)\n\nAlignments of secondary structure predictions indicate that the\n\nRps7\nMtu\n\nand Rps7\nZma\n\nmouse alleles cause no gross structural\n\nchanges in RPS7 as a result of the encoded amino acid alterations.\n\nThe experimentally determined secondary structures of yeast (S.\n\ncerevisiae) and tetrahymena (T. thermophila) RPS7 orthologs (PDB ID\n\n3U5C and PDB ID 2XZM, respectively) are aligned with\n\nsecondary structure predictions of the S. cerevisiae, T. thermophila,\n\nand mouse RPS7, RPS7\nMtu\n\nand Rps7\nZma\n\nproteins (generated with\n\nboth PSSpred and PROFsec).

After ultracentrifugation, the Optical Density\n\nat 260 nm was measured along the sucrose gradient. Ratio\n\nbetween 60S and 40S peaks in Rps7\nMtu\n\n/+ is similar to control. The\nslight variation in 80S peak relative height is not significant as it is\n\nwithin the variability observed between samples, independent of\n\ngenotype.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S4 Embryonic developmental delay in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice is\nsuppressed by Trp53 deficiency. Chronologically age-matched\n\nlittermate embryos illustrate that Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mice exhibit devel-\nopmental delay at E11.5 and E12.5 relative to Rps7+/+ littermates\n(left 4 panels). This Rps7\n\nZma\n-associated developmental delay is\n\nsuppressed by Trp53 deficiency in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+; Trp53KO/+ (right 4\npanels). Images for each of the 4 genotypes are shown at the same\n\nmagnification within an age (row).\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S5 Pmel17 expression is reduced at E12.5 in Rps7 mutant\n\nembryos. Comparison of Pmel17 in situ hybridizations of E12.5\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos (middle 3 panels) with E12.5 Rps7+/+\nembryos (left 3 panels) showed that Rps7\n\nZma\n/+ embryos exhibit a\n\nsevere reduction in melanoblasts. Furthermore, melanoblast\n\nnumber in E12.5 Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ embryos was reduced below that of\nE11.5 Rps7+/+ embryos (right 3 panels), thus showing that the\nmelanoblast reduction in Rps7\n\nZma\n/+ embryos exceeds the gross\n\ndevelopmental delay observed in Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mutants. This\nreduction is especially evident from comparison of E12.5\n\nRps7\nZma\n\n/+ and E11.5 Rps7+/+ melanoblast populations in the\notic area (arrows), in the trunk posterior to the forelimb (*), and in\n\nthe tail region (arrowheads). Scale bars = 1 mm.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S6 Mutation of Rps7 and Sox10 act synergistically to\n\nreduce melanoblast number. Combined haploinsufficiency for\n\nRps7 and Sox10 (Rps7\nZma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ double heterozygotes)\n\ngreatly reduced melanoblast number at E12.5 (middle 3 panels)\n\nas compared to E12.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+mice (left 3 panels).\nFurthermore, E12.5 Rps7\n\nZma/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice showed a\ngreater reduction in melanoblast number in comparison with\n\nE11.5 Rps7+/+; Sox10LacZ/+ mice, indicating that this reduction\nin melanoblasts exceeded the gross developmental delay observed\n\nin Rps7\nZma\n\n/+ mutants. Reduction is especially evident in\nmelanoblast populations in the otic area (arrow), and in the tail\n\nregion posterior to the hindlimb (arrowhead and posterior).
