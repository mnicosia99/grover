Sorenson,a Karen F. Ross,a,b Mark C. Herzberga,b\n\nDepartment of Diagnostic and Biological Sciences, School of Dentistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USAa; Mucosal and Vaccine Research Center,\nMinneapolis VA Medical Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USAb\n\nTo protect against invading bacteria, oral epithelial cells appear to use two effector antimicrobial peptides (AMPs): calprotectin\n(S100A8-S100A9 heterodimer [S100A8/A9]) in the cytosol and cathelicidin antimicrobial protein (CAMP) in endosomes. We\nsought to learn whether innate immunity might be augmented benignly to increase resistance against invasive bacteria. Epithe-\nlial cells were transiently transfected with mRNA constructs containing either the CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 open reading\nframes, A8-IRES-A9 (fusion sequence), or A8-nIRES-A9 (fusion with native internal ribosome entry site [IRES] sequence).\nCAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 protein levels generally peaked between 16 and 44 h after mRNA transfection, depending on the\nconstruct; CAMP was processed to LL-37 over time. Following transfection with the respective mRNAs, CAMP and S100A8/A9\neach independently increased resistance of epithelial cells to invasion by Listeria and Salmonella for up to 48 h; tandem\nS100A8/A9 constructs were also effective. Cotransfection to express S100A8/A9 and CAMP together augmented resistance, but\nsynergy was not seen. Independent of the new proteins produced, transfection reduced cell viability after 48 h by 20%, with only\n2% attributable to apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that epithelial cell resistance to invasive pathogens can be\naugmented by transient transfection of antimicrobial mRNAs into epithelial cells.\n\nMucosal epithelia provide the first line of defense against theinvasion of microbes. Indeed, epithelial cells offer both a\nphysical barrier and molecular-based antimicrobial resistance in\nthe absence of any assistance from the mucosal immune system.\nUsing a cell-autonomous mechanism to confer resistance to in-\nvading bacteria, epithelial innate immunity is provided by endog-\nenous expression of effector antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), in-\ncluding cathelicidin antimicrobial protein (CAMP) and its active\nproteolytic cleavage product (LL-37), calprotectin (S100A8 com-\nplexed to S100A9 [S100A8/A9]), �-defensins, S100A7, secretory\nleukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI), lipocalin 2 (LCN2), and ly-\nsozyme (1, 2). Most antimicrobial peptides/proteins function pri-\nmarily outside eukaryotic cells, often with proinflammatory and\nother off-target effects. Upon secretion or release from eukaryotic\ncells, the antimicrobial peptides can interact and antagonize mi-\ncroorganisms, usually by membrane intercalation and internal-\nization to localize with subcellular microbial targets. Of these an-\ntimicrobial peptides/proteins, only CAMP (LL-37) (3) and, as we\nhave shown, S100A8/A9 (4–6) are known to function within epi-\nthelial cells to inhibit bacterial invasion.\n\nHuman CAMP is a member of a large family of cationic anti-\nmicrobial peptides, expressed in many species, that have broad-\nspectrum activity against bacteria, fungi, and enveloped viruses\nand also show immunomodulatory effects (7). Following excision\nof the signal peptide, human cathelicidin precursor protein\n(hCAP18), encoded by CAMP, is commonly stored in neutrophil\ngranules. Activation of hCAP18 is controlled by the serine pro-\nteases stratum corneum tryptic enzyme (SCTE; kallikrein 5) and\nstratum corneum chymotryptic protease (SCCE; kallikrein 7) (8).\nAfter processing, the 37-residue active peptide (LL-37) mediates a\nwide range of biological responses, such as direct killing of micro-\norganisms, chemotaxis and chemokine induction, regulation of\ninflammatory responses, and adjuvant, angiogenic, and wound-\nhealing effects (9). LL-37 appears to be directly antimicrobial in\nthe phagolysosomes of neutrophils and macrophages and at sites\n\nof acute inflammation (9), showing broad-spectrum antimicro-\nbial activity against Listeria monocytogenes (10), Salmonella en-\nterica serovar Typhimurium (11), and Streptococcus groups A, B,\nand C (12).\n\nCAMP expression can be induced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin\nD3 (13), pathogens (9), or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (14). De-\ncreased CAMP/LL-37 production accompanies increased inva-\nsion and colonization by pathogens in epithelial cells, which char-\nacterizes diseases such as morbus Kostmann (15) and atopic\ndermatitis (16).\n\nCalprotectin is a heterodimeric complex of calcium-binding\nproteins S100A8 (MRP8 or calgranulin A; 10.8 kDa) and S100A9\n(MRP14 or calgranulin B; 13.2 kDa) (6). S100A8 and S100A9 are\nmembers of the S100 family of proteins (17). S100 family mem-\nbers are characterized by their two EF-hand calcium-binding mo-\ntifs; these proteins are involved in cell growth, cell differentiation,\ncell cycle progression, cell survival, protein phosphorylation, tran-\nscription, cancer development, and inflammatory diseases (18).\nCalprotectin shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against\nCandida albicans and bacteria, including Capnocytophaga sputi-\ngena, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocy-\ntogenes, S. Typhimurium, and Porphyromonas gingivalis (4, 6, 19–\n21). After stable transfection to express the calprotectin complex,\n\nReceived 2 May 2013 Returned for modification 28 June 2013\nAccepted 5 August 2013\n\nPublished ahead of print 12 August 2013\n\nEditor: B.

When expressed in the cell\nin complex with S100A8, S100A9 E36Q and E78Q mutants\nshowed increased bacterial invasion and were predicted to cause\nloss of the calcium-induced positive face in the S100A8/A9 com-\nplex (6). Some intracellular pathogens appear to have strategies to\navoid antibacterial calprotectin. To facilitate intraepithelial sur-\nvival in the cytoplasm, Listeria mobilizes calprotectin to colocalize\nwith cytoplasmic microtubules, appearing to subvert anti-Listeria\nactivity and autonomous cellular immunity (5).\n\nMucosal epithelial cells can therefore protect against and sup-\npress invasive pathogens mainly by using two intracellular anti-\nmicrobial effector systems: CAMP/LL-37, largely in endosomes\n(3, 22), and calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9), in the cytosol (6). We\nhypothesized that S100A8/A9 and CAMP can function to aug-\nment innate intraepithelial resistance to invading bacterial patho-\ngens. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel approach to\ncellular production of neoproteins, using transient delivery of spe-\ncific antimicrobial effector mRNAs (e.g., CAMP and S100A8/\nS100A9). mRNA transfections for therapeutic purposes are of\nconsiderable current interest to replace or augment expression of\nproteins through systemic or ex vivo administration (23). When\nspecifically targeted to the native source of the protein of interest,\nmRNA transfections have the potential to replace, restore, or aug-\nment innate immune effector proteins and the mucosal immune\nbarrier to infection. We now report the delivery of CAMP and\nS100A8/S100A9 mRNAs into human keratinocytes and the func-\ntional changes in resistance to bacterial invasion.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCell culture. Human KB cells (ATCC CCL-17; American Type Culture\nCollection) were cultured in modified Eagle’s medium (MEM; Mediatech\nInc., Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at\n37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\n\nBacteria. L. monocytogenes ATCC 10403S (provided by Daniel Port-\nnoy, University of California, Berkeley, CA) and S. Typhimurium ATCC\n14028 (provided by Carol Wells, University of Minnesota) were grown in\nbrain heart infusion medium (Difco) and on tryptic soy agar (Difco) at\n37°C. Listeria and Salmonella cells were harvested from log phase and\nstationary phase, respectively, at an absorbance at 620 nm of 0.4 to 0.6,\nand used to infect KB cells.\n\nPlasmid construction. The open reading frame (ORF) for EGFP (see\nFig. S2 in the supplemental material) and ORFs containing Kozak se-\nquences for human CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 (all primer pairs are\nlisted in Table S1) were amplified by PCR. The PCR products were cloned\ninto pGEM4Z.2bgUTR.150A (24) (provided by C. H. June and Y. Zhao,\nUniversity of Pennsylvania) via NotI and HindIII sites. To create a single\nmRNA for transcription, the S100A8 ORF containing a Kozak sequence\nwas cloned into the first multiple-cloning site (MCS) of the pIRES vector\n(Clontech, Mountain View, CA) via NheI and XhoI sites; the S100A9\nORF was cloned into the second MCS of the pIRES vector via XbaI and\nNotI sites. Amplified A8-IRES-A9 fragments were also cloned into\npGEM4Z.2bgUTR.150A to generate the plasmid pGEM4Z.A8-IRES-\nA9.2bgUTR.150A.\n\nThe internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the pIRES vector is a par-\ntially disabled sequence (25, 26). To construct the native IRES (nIRES),\npGEM4Z.A8-IRES-A9.2bgUTR.150A was used as a template and ampli-\nfied with primers 5= AAA CGT CTA GGC CCC CCG AAC C 3= and 5= TTT\n\nAAC CTC GAC TAA ACA CAT GTA AAG CAT GTG C 3=. The product\nwas purified and self-ligated to generate plasmid pGEM4Z.A8-IRES/\nmut1-A9.2bgUTR.150A. Primers 5= ACC ATG ACT TGC AAA ATG TCG\nCAG CTG 3= and 5= ATT ATC ATC GTG TTT TTC AAA GGA AAA CCA\nC 3= were used to amplify a fragment from pGEM4Z.S100A8-IRES/mut1-\nS100A9.2bgUTR as the template. The fragments were purified and self-\nligated to generate plasmid pGEM4Z.A8-nIRES-A9.2bgUTR.150A.\n\nIn vitro transcription. Templates were amplified from corresponding\nplasmid constructs and extracted from gels. Purified fragments were\ntreated with 0.5% SDS and 100 �g/ml protease K at 50°C for 30 min and\nthen extracted with phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and\nthen with chloroform. After ethanol precipitation, templates were dis-\nsolved in 10 mM Tris-HCl and stored at �80°C. Using an mMESSAGE\nmMACHINE T7 Ultra kit (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) or a\nScriptCap m7G capping system/ScriptCap 2=-O-methyltransferase kit\n(Cell Script, Madison, WI), mRNAs were synthesized and then purified\nusing a MEGAclear kit (Life Technologies) followed by ethanol precipi-\ntation.\n\nmRNA transfections. At approximately 60 to 90% confluence, cells\nwere transfected with mRNAs by using the TransIT-mRNA kit reagent\n(Mirus Biol LLC, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-\ntions.\n\nqRT-PCR. See the supplemental material for details on quantitative\nreal-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis.\n\nWestern blot analysis. Cells were extracted using mammalian cell-PE\nLBTM buffer (GBiosciences, Maryland Heights, MO). The extracted pro-\nteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose mem-\nbranes, and incubated with one of the following: rabbit anti-�-actin\n(DB070; Delta Biolabs, Gilroy, CA), mouse anti-LL37 (sc-166770; Santa\nCruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-S100A8 (sc-48352; Santa Cruz Biotech-\nnology), rabbit anti-S100A9 (sc-20173; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or\nrabbit anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (anti-PARP) (9542S; Cell Sig-\nnaling). Rabbit primary antibodies were then incubated with horseradish\nperoxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies, whereas\nmouse primary antibodies were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat an-\nti-mouse antibodies (secondary antibodies) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\nImmunoreactions were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico chemilu-\nminescence substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) and exposed to\nAmersham Hyperfilm ECL film (GE Healthcare Biosciences, Piscataway,\nNJ). Protein bands were quantified by Quantity One analysis (Bio-Rad,\nHercules, CA).\n\nImmunofluorescence. See the supplemental material for details on\nimmunofluorescence.\n\nBacterial invasion assay. Bacterial invasion was determined by the\nantibiotic protection assay (6). Briefly, KB cells (1 � 105 to 1.2 � 105 cells)\nwere seeded overnight in 24-well plates. Cells were then incubated with L.\nmonocytogenes ATCC 10403S or S. Typhimurium ATCC 14028 at a mul-\ntiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100:1 or 1:1, respectively. After 2 h of incu-\nbation, the monolayers were washed with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered\nsaline (DPBS) (Sigma) and incubated for 1.5 h in MEM supplemented\nwith 10% FBS containing 100 �g/ml gentamicin (Sigma), and cells were\nlysed by incubation with sterile distilled water for 15 min. Released bac-\nteria were diluted, plated with a spiral plater (Spiral Biotech, Bethesda,\nMD), and incubated overnight at 37°C, and then the number of CFU of\nintracellular bacteria was enumerated on a New Brunswick C-110 colony\ncounter (New Brunswick, NJ).\n\nIn vitro toxicity assay. The toxic effects of mRNA delivery in vitro\nwere analyzed by quantitatively determining cell viability using a 3-(4,5-\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (in\nvitro toxicity assay kit; Sigma, St. Louis, MO). Briefly, MTT solution (5\nmg/ml) was added to each well in an amount equal to 10% of the culture\nmedium volume. Cells were then incubated for 2 h at 37°C, absorbance\nwas measured at a wavelength of 570 nm, and the percentage of viable cells\nwas calculated as the ratio of absorbances of transfected and untransfected\ncells.\n\nZou et al.\n\n3976 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\n o\nn\n Ju\n\nn\ne\n 1\n\n1\n, 2\n\n0\n1\n4\n b\n\ny g\nu\ne\n\nst\nh\nttp\n\n://ia\ni.a\n\nsm\n.o\n\nrg\n/\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\n\nlo\na\nd\ne\nd\n fro\n\nm\n \n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\nAnalysis of apoptosis. To evaluate cell apoptotic status, transfected\ncells were evaluated for PARP cleavage by use of rabbit anti-PARP in\nWestern blots as described above. Cells were also analyzed by flow cytom-\netry using an annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) apoptosis de-\ntection kit (MBL International Corp., Watertown, MA) according to the\nmanufacturer’s recommendations.

An anti-reverse\ncap analogue (ARCA) can cap at an efficacy of up to 80%, whereas\nthe capping enzyme (CE) can increase the capping efficiency to\n100% (25). To optimize the capping strategy, we compared the\nmMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra system (Life Technologies),\nwhich generates ARCA-capped mRNA, with the mScript RNA\nsystem (Cell Script), which uses the 2=-O-methyltransferase CE to\ngenerate a cap 0 or cap 1, depending on the addition of a methyl\ngroup at the 2=-O position of the penultimate (5= end) nucleotide\nof the transcript. CAMP mRNAs were synthesized using the dif-\nferent capping systems and delivered into KB cells, and protein\nexpression was detected by Western blot analysis. Eight, 24, and 48\nh after transfection with ARCA-capped mRNAs, KB cells ex-\npressed more CAMP protein than that after transfection with CE\ncap 1, which was higher than that after transfection with CE cap 0\n(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). ARCA capping was\nthen used for all experiments. To determine whether the lengths of\n3= poly(A) tails increased mRNA stability, we compared mRNAs\nwith 64-A and 150-A 3= extensions. The 150-A mRNAs showed a\nslightly longer half-life (not significant; data not shown). We used\n150-A mRNA for all subsequent experiments. CAMP protein lev-\nels peaked at about 16 h and decreased by about 50% 40 to 48 h\nafter ARCA-capped mRNA delivery (Fig. 1). CAMP was hydro-\nlyzed to LL-37, and levels peaked from 24 to 48 h after mRNA\ntransfection (Fig. 1). LL-37 appeared as the presence of CAMP was\nreduced.\n\nStability of mRNAs capped with ARCA. KB cells were used\nbecause they express CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 mRNAs below\nthe level of detection (data not shown). Therefore, endogenous\nS100A8, S100A9, and CAMP mRNAs expressed in KB cells con-\ntributed little to levels after transfection with ARCA-capped\nmRNAs. To synthesize a fusion mRNA containing S100A8 and\nS100A9, the S100A8 ORF containing a Kozak sequence was cloned\ninto pIRES MCS A, and S100A9 was cloned into MCS B. To elim-\ninate the attenuation of downstream translation with pIRES, na-\ntive IRES (nIRES) was constructed and inserted between the\nS100A8 and S100A9 ORFs. Sequences containing all necessary el-\nements were cloned into pGEM4Z.2bgUTR.150A, and then A8-\nIRES-A9 and A8-nIRES-A9 mRNAs were synthesized. Transfec-\ntion of in vitro-transcribed ARCA-capped CAMP, S100A8,\n\nS100A9, A8-IRES-A9, and A8-nIRES-A9 mRNAs was analyzed us-\ning qRT-PCR (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Four\nhours after each mRNA transfection, we first measured the intra-\ncellular mRNA levels. Sixteen to 20 h following transfection, the\nCAMP mRNA levels were approximately half that at 4 h, indicat-\ning that the half-life in KB cells was between 12 and 16 h (see Fig.\nS2A). In contrast, cotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs\nresulted in mRNA half-lives of between 12 and 16 h and 8 to 12 h,\nrespectively (see Fig. S2B). When the tandem mRNAs were trans-\nfected, the half-life of A8-IRES-A9 was 12 to 16 h, whereas that of\nA8-nIRES-A9 mRNA was between 8 and 12 h (see Fig. S2C and D).\n\nCotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9 increases stability of\neach protein. After delivery into KB cells, ARCA-capped mRNAs\nfor S100A8 (Fig. 2A), S100A9 (Fig. 2B), and calprotectin (1:1\n[mol/mol] S100A8 plus S100A9) (Fig. 2C) were compared for pro-\ntein expression. Expression of S100A8 protein alone was maximal\nat 16 h and decreased by about half at about 28 h (Fig. 2A),\nwhereas expression of S100A9 protein was maximized at 16 h and\ndecreased to half at about 40 to 48 h (Fig. 2B). The stability of each\npeptide appeared to increase after S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs\n(half the amount of each compared to transfections with either\nS100A8 or S100A9 mRNA) were cotransfected. Compared to\nS100A8 protein after transfection with S100A8 mRNA, for exam-\nple (Fig. 2D), S100A8/A9 was more sustained over time after\ncotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs (Fig. 2C). When\nS100A8 mRNA was cotransfected with S100A9 mRNA, S100A8\nprotein expression was maximized at 24 h and decreased by half at\nabout 72 h (Fig. 2C). Under the same conditions, S100A9 protein\nexpression was also maximized at 24 h and decreased to half at\nabout 48 to 72 h (Fig. 2D). Cotransfection of S100A8 and S100A9\nmRNAs led to increased stability of each peptide, suggesting that\nthe formation of spontaneous calprotectin heterodimers pro-\nmotes resistance to degradation.\n\nS100A8/S100A9 protein expression using tandem con-\nstructs.

For A8-nIRES-A9\nmRNA transfection, expression of S100A8 protein was maximal at\n16 h and decreased to half at 24 to 32 h (Fig. 2F and G), whereas\nS100A9 protein expression was maximal at 40 h and decreased to\nhalf at about 40 to 48 h (Fig. 2F and G). As when S100A8 was\ncoexpressed with S100A9 (Fig. 2C), use of the tandem mRNA\nconstructs generally appeared to stabilize the protein subunits\ncompared with just S100A8 mRNA transfection (Fig. 2A).\n\nIntracellular presentation of CAMP and calprotectin. Fol-\nlowing mRNA transfections, CAMP and calprotectin (neopro-\nteins) were also detected in KB cells by use of immunofluorescence\n(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). Endogenous or back-\nground CAMP, S100A8, and S100A9 protein levels were at or\nbelow the limits of detection, and fluorescence above background\nwas not detected with mock transfections (see Fig. S3). Sixteen\nhours after delivery of mRNAs for EGFP, CAMP, or calprotectin\n(S100A8/S100A9), significant fluorescence was detected, suggest-\ning that mRNA delivery increases enhanced green fluorescent\nprotein (EGFP), CAMP, and calprotectin protein expression (see\nFig. S3A to C). Sixteen hours after transfection with A8-IRES-A9\nand A8-nIRES-A9 mRNAs, no significant fluorescence was de-\ntected (see Fig. S3D). Forty hours following mRNA transfection,\nhowever, fluorescence signals for calprotectin were detected (see\nFig. S3E). These results are consistent with the results of Western\nblot analysis (Fig. 1 and 2E and F). The tandem constructs con-\ntained fewer molar equivalents of S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs\nthan those with S100A8 and S100A9 mRNA cotransfection, but\nthey may be as effective.\n\nCAMP or calprotectin mRNA transfection increases resis-\ntance of KB cells to bacterial invasion. We determined whether\nselect antimicrobial proteins produced after mRNA transfections\n\ninto epithelial cells affected resistance to invasion by bacterial\npathogens. We determined the numbers of intracellular CFU of\nListeria and Salmonella that invaded untreated KB cells (vehicle\ncontrol) and cells treated by delivery of S100A8, S100A9, or CAMP\nmRNA (Fig. 3A). We then expressed the data as percentages of\nvehicle control levels at 8 (Fig. 3B), 24 (Fig. 3C), and 48 (Fig. 3D)\nh posttransfection to determine the effect of each mRNA treat-\nment over time. When intracellular antimicrobial proteins/pep-\ntides were present, invading bacteria were significantly reduced at\neach time point. Following transfection with all CAMP and cal-\nprotectin mRNA constructs, epithelial cell resistance to invasion\nsignificantly increased for Listeria and Salmonella at 8 h (Fig. 3A\nand B), 24 h (Fig. 3C), and 48 h (Fig. 3D). Resistance seemed to be\ngreatest 8 h after transfection. The CAMP and S100A8-plus-\nS100A9 mRNA transfection schemes appeared to increase resis-\ntance more effectively than the tandem mRNA constructs did.\n\nEffects of cotransfection with calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9)\nand CAMP mRNAs. To determine whether S100A8/A9 and\nCAMP (LL-37) function cooperatively and additively, S100A8 and\nS100A9 mRNAs (1:1 molar ratio) were cotransfected at different\nmolar ratios with CAMP mRNA. Compared to the vehicle control,\nCAMP and S100A8/A9 in all combinations caused a reduction in\nviable intracellular Listeria (Fig. 4A) and Salmonella (Fig. 4B).\nWhen CAMP and S100A8/S100A9 mRNAs were transfected at a\n1:1 molar ratio (S100A8/S100A9 at 0.5:0.5 relative to CAMP), re-\nsistance to invasion by Listeria (Fig. 4A) and Salmonella (Fig. 4B)\nwas significantly increased compared to that with S100A8/A9 or\nCAMP alone or at great excess (5:1 or 1:5 molar ratio).\n\nThe TransIT-mRNA delivery system reduces cell viability\nwithout triggering apoptosis.

Compared to the untrans-\nfected cells, the pattern of cleaved PARP was similar after delivery\nof the mRNAs (Fig. 5C).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn health, mucosal epithelial cells contain putative commensals\nand endogenous pathogens (29). Since the interiors of mucosal\nepithelial cells are not sterile, mechanisms must exist to control\nthe growth of these bacteria. The best-studied innate immune\neffector molecules, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), include the\ndefensins, CAMP (LL-37), and S100A8/A9. S100A8/A9 is ex-\npressed in the cytoplasm, and LL-37 in the endosomes, in associ-\nation with Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) (6). As we have reported (5,\n6, 30), S100A8/A9 promotes functional innate immunity in the\ncytoplasm of epithelial cells by increasing resistance against invad-\ning bacteria, including Listeria and Salmonella. Functioning in the\ncytoplasm, S100A8/A9 has no signal sequence for export and gen-\nerally appears extracellularly when cells lyse. CAMP contains a\nsignal peptide, but the active LL-37 fragment does not. Hence, we\nfocused on whether S100A8/A9 and LL-37 function cooperatively\nwithin epithelial cells to attenuate the effects of invasive bacteria\n(3, 6).\n\nThe fact that these innate immune effector molecules function\nintracellularly distinguishes S100A8/A9 and LL-37 from the de-\nfensins and other AMPs that are packaged in granules and contain\nsignals for export and secretion. We show for the first time that\nepithelial cell resistance to invasive pathogens in vitro can be aug-\nmented by transient transfections using mRNAs encoding antimi-\ncrobial CAMP and calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9, A8-IRES-A9,\nand A8-nIRES-A9). S100A8/A9 and LL-37 or CAMP function in-\ndependently and additively in controlling intracellular bacteria.\nImportantly, stable presentation of S100A8/A9 and LL-37 neo-\nproteins continued for at least 72 h, with corresponding protec-\ntion against bacterial invasion.\n\nThe experimental approach using transient transfections of\nmRNAs to obtain neoprotein production is somewhat unusual,\nand this report appears to be the first in which epithelial cells are\ntargeted. We recognized that the stability of the neoproteins de-\npended on the stability of the transfected mRNAs. To optimize for\nstability, the mRNA cargo synthesized by in vitro translation was\nmodified through 5= capping with ARCA and by 3= mRNA cap-\nping using poly(A) chains in cis and in trans (31). After transfec-\ntion with ARCA-A100 Luc-mRNA, CD34-derived mouse den-\ndritic cells (JAWSII cells) showed detectable luciferase activity\nwithin 1 h, which maximized at 8 h and declined 20-fold at 30 h\n(31), whereas transfection of primary human mesenchymal stem\ncells with a CXCR4-GFP fusion mRNA resulted in CXCR4 expres-\nsion for up to 72 h and in efficient cell migration (32). To increase\nmRNA stability (33), our constructs included two sequential hu-\nman beta-globin untranslated regions (UTRs). Following trans-\nfection into KB cells, ARCA-capped CAMP, S100A8/S100A9, A8-\nIRES-A9, or A8-nIRES-A9 each showed mRNA half-lives of 8 to 16\nh (see Fig. S2A to D in the supplemental material). Our transfec-\ntions used a commercially available nonliposomal, cationic poly-\nmer-lipid formulation (TransIT-mRNA transfection kit). Clearly,\n\ncertain mRNA modifications improve the stability of the mRNA,\nbut the specific mRNA cargo, the stability of the translated pro-\ntein, and the target cell all affect the kinetics and efficiency of new\nprotein expression.\n\nAfter cotransfection with S100A8 and S100A9 mRNAs,\nS100A8/A9 forms spontaneously, as seen in Fig. S3 in the supple-\nmental material. The stability of the S100A8/A9 heterodimer is\ngreater than that of the individual subunit proteins (34). Use of\ntandem constructs was similarly successful. S100A8/A9 protein\nexpression was detectable after cotransfection with S100A8 and\nS100A9 mRNAs (see Fig. S3C) and with the A8-IRES-A9 and A8-\nnIRES-A9 bicistronic transcripts (see Fig. S3E). The several con-\nstructs for S100A8/S100A9, A8-IRES-A9, and A8-nIRES-A9\nmRNAs did result in different kinetics of translation. Translation\nfrom the MCS B site insert proximal to pIRES (Fig. 2E and G) and\nnIRES (Fig. 2F and G) showed a delay. We speculate that the\nmRNAs in the MCS B site were scanned and that translation was\ninitiated by a low-efficiency, cap-independent IRES mechanism in\nKB cells.\n\nCAMP, LL-37, and calprotectin produced as neoproteins after\nmRNA transfections are expressed inside the cell (see Fig. S3 in the\nsupplemental material). S100A8, S100A9, and LL-37 all lack signal\nsequences, a membrane anchor sequence, and N-linked glyco-\nsylation consensus sequences, so they are unlikely to be secreted\nfrom the cell by a canonical pathway. We checked for release of\nS100A8/A9 and LL-37 from our cells, and the levels were below the\nlimits of detection (data not shown). Being slightly antimicrobial,\nCAMP has a signal peptide and can be secreted from the cell. We\ndid show, however, that innate intraepithelial immunity could be\naugmented through concurrent delivery of mRNAs encoding an-\ntimicrobial proteins, and we did not rigorously exclude the possi-\nbility that the effect is extracellular.\n\nTo perform our experiments, we reconciled differences in op-\ntimal cell confluence needed for the TransIT-mRNA transfection\nreagent (60 to 90%) and the antibiotic protection assay (40 to\n60%) (4, 6). For the antibiotic protection assay, cells were trans-\nfected, split 8 and 32 h later, and then incubated for another 16 h\nto reach the 40 to 60% confluence needed for bacterial invasion.\nAs expected, the apparent antimicrobial activity at 24 and 48 h was\nlower than that at 8 h following mRNA transfection (Fig. 3B to D);\ncell division over time (and subculturing) decreased intracellular\nCAMP and calprotectin protein levels. Nonetheless, the residual\nLL-37 and calprotectin levels up to 48 h after transfection were\nsufficient to provide statistically significant increases in resistance\nto the invading pathogens.\n\nCells in culture undergo apoptosis, but we found no evidence\nthat mRNA delivery of any of the cargo mRNAs or their translated\nneoprotein products, S100A8, S100A9, S100A8/A9, CAMP, and\nLL-37, affected apoptosis or cell viability. Apoptosis in untrans-\nfected and transfected cells was indistinguishable. Our observa-\ntions are consistent with previous reports using many different\ncell types and mRNA packaging systems (35, 36). To minimize the\nloss of cell viability, the delivery system may need to be modified to\nreduce epithelial cytotoxicity. During the last decade, investiga-\ntors have explored the utility of nonviral packaging for mRNA\ndelivery, and systems have been developed for production of\nHBD-2 in a macrophage line (37) and of luciferase mRNA in\nseveral normal and cancer cell lines (38). While alternatives will\nneed to be developed, the modest loss of cell viability resulting\n\nmRNA Delivery Augments Resistance to Bacteria\n\nNovember 2013 Volume 81 Number 11 iai.asm.org 3981\n\n o\nn\n Ju\n\nn\ne\n 1\n\n1\n, 2\n\n0\n1\n4\n b\n\ny g\nu\ne\n\nst\nh\nttp\n\n://ia\ni.a\n\nsm\n.o\n\nrg\n/\n\nD\no\n\nw\nn\n\nlo\na\nd\ne\nd\n fro\n\nm\n \n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\nhttp://iai.asm.org/\n\n\nfrom transfection in our experiments did not affect resistance to\ninvasion (Fig. 3 and 5A).\n\nHow S100A8/A9 and LL-37 function within eukaryotic cells to\nincrease resistance to bacterial invasion is the subject of current\ninvestigations. Both are directly antibacterial (3, 5, 6). S100A9\nE36Q and E78Q mutations in S100A8/A9 result in diminished\nresistance to bacterial invasion (6). S100A8/A9 also interacts with\nNADPH oxidase to activate oxidative killing in epithelial cells\n(HaCaT) (39) and neutrophils (40, 41). LL-37 also appears to\nfunction as an endosomal chaperone for bacteria and bacterial\nDNA (3), also functioning in cooperation with NADPH oxidase to\neffect intracellular killing. Since we now show that LL-37 and\nS100A8/A9 function cooperatively, we must learn how these var-\nious mechanisms are coordinated with the production of antimi-\ncrobial oxygen metabolites to control the microbial colonization\nof epithelia without causing tissue damage.\n\nSince this report shows that mRNA transfections can be used to\naugment innate epithelial immunity, this approach may be the\nbasis for development of therapeutic agents on mucosal or epider-\nmal surfaces. We appreciate that only moderate increases in resis-\ntance to bacterial invasion were noted in our experiments. Yet\nthese moderate effects may be of considerable biological impor-\ntance. For example, when keratinocytes were transfected using a\nlentivirus to overexpress cathelicidin (42), the antimicrobial ef-\nfects (�0.2 log) in vitro were more modest than what we report.\nWhen the anatomy of the squamous mucosa is considered, with\nexpressing cells stacked on expressing cells, the moderate effect\nwithin individual cells is multiplied geometrically into the antimi-\ncrobial protection of the tissue. When cathelicidin was augmented\nin mice, a profound epithelial resistance to group A streptococci\ndeveloped (42).\n\nmRNA delivery has several advantages over DNA gene transfer\ntechniques for the treatment of disease (33), despite persistent\nconcerns that the ease of synthesis and stability of transfected\nmRNA would prove insufficient to yield a useful protein product\n(23). Since mRNA does not integrate into the genome and the\ntransfection remains transient, this transfection approach avoids\nimprecise, mutagenic insertion into the host cells and offers\ngreater pharmaceutical safety (34). mRNA delivery facilitates si-\nmultaneous expression of all epitopes of an antigen, and manip-\nulation and purification are rather simple (33). mRNA transfec-\ntions have been used to express polyepitopes (43), to target\ndendritic cells ex vivo, and as anticancer vaccines in patients (44,\n45). Similarly, mRNA delivery systems are in development for T\ncell-based immunotherapy of certain tumors (46) and to increase\nerythropoiesis (47). With a view toward augmenting innate im-\nmunity, HBD-2 mRNA transfection into monocyte-derived mac-\nrophages was shown to be effective against Mycobacterium tuber-\nculosis, where the AMP and bacterium inexplicably colocalized in\nphagosomes (37). Similarly, insect-derived short proline-rich an-\ntimicrobial peptides (48) linked to a cell-penetrating peptide, pen-\netratin, entered the cytoplasm of two mammalian cell lines with-\nout marked toxicity; intracellular resistance was increased against\nMicrococcus luteus but not against Escherichia coli (48). The insect-\nderived peptides show homology to mammalian heat shock pro-\nteins, but concern about potential cross-reactivity with host pro-\nteins and an autoimmune response may limit their clinical utility.\nAugmentation of intracellular innate immunity using native, en-\ndogenous antimicrobial peptides/proteins, however, could sup-\n\nplement or supplant the use of antibiotics, avoiding the clinical\nchallenge of emergence of antibiotic resistance.\n\nThe present data show proof of principle that an mRNA deliv-\nery system could be an effective surrogate for a gene therapy ap-\nproach to augment innate mucosal epithelial immunity and for\ntreatment or control of mucosal infections. Use of this approach\nfor therapeutic purposes in mucosal infections would be en-\nhanced with an mRNA packaging system that would target epi-\nthelial cells more specifically and increase mRNA stability and\nminimize immune activation, as suggested by Weissman and col-\nleagues (35). Ultimately, the test for mRNA transfection efficiency\nis a new or augmented function and minimal associated cytotox-\nicity or induction of apoptosis. Our data show that CAMP and\ncalprotectin mRNA delivery could significantly increase resistance\nof epithelial cells to invasion by Listeria and Salmonella.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Lori A.
