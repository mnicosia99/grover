One of the important innate\nimmune responses in arthropods is the activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) by a proteolytic cascade finalized by the\nproPO-activating enzyme (ppA), which leads to melanization and the elimination of pathogens. Proteolytic cascades play a\ncrucial role in innate immune reactions because they can be triggered more quickly than immune responses that require\naltered gene expression. Caspases are intracellular proteases involved in tightly regulated limited proteolysis of downstream\nprocesses and are also involved in inflammatory responses to infections for example by activation of interleukin 1ß. Here we\nshow for the first time a link between caspase cleavage of proPO and release of this protein and the biological function of\nthese fragments in response to bacterial infection in crayfish. Different fragments from the cleavage of proPO were studied\nto determine their roles in bacterial clearance and antimicrobial activity. These fragments include proPO-ppA, the N-\nterminal part of proPO cleaved by ppA, and proPO-casp1 and proPO-casp2, the fragments from the N-terminus after\ncleavage by caspase-1. The recombinant proteins corresponding to all three of these peptide fragments exhibited bacterial\nclearance activity in vivo, and proPO-ppA had antimicrobial activity, as evidenced by a drastic decrease in the number of\nEscherichia coli in vitro. The bacteria incubated with the proPO-ppA fragment were agglutinated and their cell morphology\nwas altered. Our findings show an evolutionary conserved role for caspase cleavage in inflammation, and for the first time\nshow a link between caspase induced inflammation and melanization. Further we give a more detailed understanding of\nhow the proPO system is regulated in time and place and a role for the peptide generated by activation of proPO as well as\nfor the peptides resulting from Caspase 1 proteolysis.\n\nCitation: Jearaphunt M, Noonin C, Jiravanichpaisal P, Nakamura S, Tassanakajon A, et al.

Intruding microorganisms are frequently melanized in\n\ninvertebrates, and during this process, low-molecular-weight\n\nphenolic substances are converted into polymeric melanin in a\n\nmulti-step chain of reactions. The initiation steps of this reaction\n\nare catalyzed by the prophenoloxidase activating system (proPO\n\nsystem), and other steps occur spontaneously. The proPO system is\n\na proteolytic enzyme cascade and its primary function is to\n\nrecognize minuscule amounts (picograms per liter) of cell wall\n\nproducts from microorganisms (lipopolysaccharide (LPS), pepti-\n\ndoglycan (PGN) and glucans) and respond to the microorganism\n\nby activation of the system and the subsequent generation of\n\nimmune factors. This cascade requires careful regulation to\n\nachieve spatial and temporal control to avoid dangerous side\n\neffects [1]. A number of regulatory factors are involved in\n\ncontrolling the activation of the proPO system, including\n\nproteinase inhibitors [2] and the melanization-inhibiting protein\n\n(in insects, crayfish and shrimp) [3], [4], [5].\n\nThe importance of melanization (proPO system) in controlling a\n\nnumber of specific host–pathogen encounters has been demon-\n\nstrated over the past few years. One example of this is the\n\nbracovirus protein Egf1.0, which inhibits the prophenoloxidase\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004059&domain=pdf\n\n\n(proPO)-activating proteinase in the insect Manduca sexta [6]. Two\n\nother recent examples are found in the parasitoid wasp Leptopilina\n\nboulardi, which targets the Drosophila phenoloxidase cascade by\n\nproducing a specific serpin inhibitor [7], and in the bacterium\n\nPhotorhabdus luminescens, which secretes a small organic molecule\n\nthat acts as a negative regulator of PO activity [8]. In addition, a\n\npathogenic Aeromonas hydrophila strain becomes highly virulent to\n\ncrayfish when the PO transcript levels are experimentally reduced\n\n[9]. The proPO activation system, or melanization cascade, bears\n\nfunctional resemblance to the complement system, although the\n\nfinal reaction, melanization, is different. Intriguingly, recently we\n\nsucceeded in showing that all of the steps in the proPO-cascade in\n\nTenebrio molitor are shared with the proteinase cascade that leads to\n\nthe activation of the Toll pathway for the production of\n\nantimicrobial peptides [10]. This shared cascade has been\n\nconfirmed in several other insects [11], [12]. In the present study,\n\nwe found that caspases are very important for the rapid\n\ndegradation of proPO, which prevents oxidation in places where\n\nit is not appropriate.\n\nCaspases, or cysteine-aspartic proteases, are a family of the\n\ncysteine proteases that are known for their function in apoptosis\n\n[13]. Some caspases are involved in the inflammatory system via the\n\nregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and these caspases are\n\nnecessary regulators of the unconventional secretion of leaderless\n\nproteins [14], [15]. In humans, caspase-1 is not only required for the\n\nactivation of pro-interleukin (IL)-1b and pro-IL-18, but also\nfunctions as an activator of nuclear factor of the kappa-enhancer\n\nin B-cells (NF-kB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase\n(MAPK) [16]. Interleukin-1b is produced as a cytosolic precursor\nand is dependent on caspase-1 cleavage for its activation and\n\nsecretion [15], [17]. The proPO is also produced as a leaderless\n\nprotein, most likely in the cytosol, and is secreted by an unknown\n\nmechanism. We, therefore, searched the sequence for caspase-1\n\ncleavage sites and found two in the middle of the Cu-binding region.\n\nTherefore, we asked whether caspase-1-like cleavage of proPO is\n\ninvolved in the regulation of PO activity. We also asked whether the\n\ncaspase-cleaved fragments have biological functions and whether\n\nthese fragments are involved in immune functions even in the\n\nabsence of PO activity. We also studied whether the peptide\n\nfragments generated by the cleavage of proPO into active PO by the\n\nprophenoloxidase activating enzyme (ppA), which gives a peptide of\n\napproximately 20 kD, might have some immune function during or\n\nimmediately prior to melanization.\n\nOur studies provide new information about the function of\n\ncaspase-1-like activity in freshwater crayfish, in which it acts as a\n\nnegative regulator of the proPO system. For the first time, we\n\nprovide results showing that the fragments resulting from caspase\n\nor ppA cleavage have important biological functions.\n\nResults\n\nLocalization of proPO and detection of caspase-1-like\nprotein in crayfish\n\nProPO, the inactive form of PO, is present in crayfish\n\nhemocytes, especially in the granular cells (GC). GCs are densely\n\nfilled with granules, as indicated by their name. Upon activation\n\nby different environmental challenges such as microbes, exocytosis\n\nis induced, which causes the release of several proteins from the\n\ngranules of the GCs and the release of proPO into the external\n\nmilieu [18]. Immunostaining of proPO in GCs revealed that\n\nproPO is present in the cytoplasm but not in the granules, and not\n\nall GC cells express proPO (Figures 1A–C). ProPO is cleaved\n\nextracellularly to produce active PO upon activation by ppA.\n\nHowever, the mechanism by which proPO is released is still\n\nunknown. In beet armyworm and Drosophila, prostaglandins and\n\nJNK can stimulate cell lysis and subsequent proPO release [19],\n\n[20]. In mammal, there are many reports showing that inflamma-\n\nsomes and caspase-1 activation are involved in the secretion of\n\nproteins without signal peptides [21], [22]. Thus, we asked\n\nwhether caspase-1 plays a role in proPO release and/or\n\nregulation. To answer this question, the presence of caspase-1 in\n\nthe crayfish was examined. The transcriptome analysis of the\n\nfreshwater crayfish P. leniusculus (unpublished data) revealed the\n\npresence of a translated amino acid sequence that has 36%\n\nidentity to Drosophila caspase interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme\n\n(GenBank: NP524551). Additionally, by using an antibody against\n\nhuman caspase-1, two bands with sizes about 40 and 50 kDa were\n\ndetected from crayfish hemocyte lysate (Figure 1D). These bands\n\nare probably two isoforms of the crayfish procaspase-1 like\n\nproteins. In comparison, in human six different isoforms of\n\ncaspase-1 have been found. The 50 kDa procaspase-1 like protein\n\nwas also detected in crayfish plasma and the level of this protein in\n\nplasma was decreased 1 h after an injection of E. coli or A.\n\nhydrophila compared to the control (0.15 M NaCl) (Figure 1E).\n\nNotably, when the 50 kDa band decreased, a 20 kDa band\n\nappeared in the plasma (Figure 1E). The 20 kDa band is similar in\n\nsize to the p20 subunit of mammalian caspase-1, which is the\n\nactive subunit of this protein. The active caspase-1 could only be\n\ndetected in the supernatant and not in human keratinocyte lysates\n\n[15]. This is probably because it is rapidly degraded or released to\n\nthe outside of cells and is therefore not present in cell lysates.\n\nAnother explanation may be that active caspase-1 has a very short\n\nhalf-life, and therefore, its concentration under physiological\n\nconditions is very low [22], [23]. Caspase-1 activity was also\n\nfound to be slightly increased in plasma at 1 h after injection with\n\nE.coli but no statistically significant difference could be observed\n\n(Figure 1F) and this activity could be decreased by incubation of\n\nthe caspase-1 inhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK.\n\nCaspase-1 cleavage site of crayfish proPO\nOur results suggest that caspase-1-like activity is present in\n\ncrayfish and that this activity can be activated during infection. As\n\nmentioned above, the activation of caspase-1 in vertebrates is\n\ninvolved in the secretion of several proteins, such as IL-1 b, but to\ndate, no such mechanism has been identified in invertebrates,\n\nalthough the secretion of leaderless proteins such as proPO [18]\n\nand Pl-b-thymosins [24] has been observed. Therefore, the amino\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nMelanization is an important reaction in most multicellular\norganisms, both animals and plants. The initiation steps of\nthis reaction in invertebrates are catalyzed by the\nprophenoloxidase (proPO) activating system a proteolytic\nenzyme cascade, which primary function is to recognize\ncell wall products from microorganisms and respond by\nactivation of the system and generation of immune\neffector molecules. This cascade requires careful regulation\nto achieve spatial and temporal control to avoid danger-\nous side effects. We here show that a Caspase1-like\nenzyme can inactivate proPO when ppA is not activating\nthe proPO to avoid deleterious effects and further we\nshow for the first time that the N-terminal peptide from\nppA cleavage of proPO (activation of proPO) has an\nimportant biological function as also the Caspase1 cleaved\nfragments. Our results also show that Caspase 1-induced\ninflammatory response is evolutionarily conserved and is\nlinked to melanization.\n\nCaspase-1-Like Regulation of the proPO-System\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059\n\n\n\nacid sequence of proPO was analyzed to determine whether there\n\nis a potential caspase-1 cleavage site in the proPO sequence. Two\n\ncaspase-1 cleavage sites were found, after amino acids 363 and\n\n389, which would give rise to two N-terminal proPO fragments\n\nwith predicted sizes of approximately 42 kDa (proPO-casp1) and\n\n45 kDa (proPO-casp2), respectively (Figure 2A). These two\n\ncleavage sites are located downstream of the cleavage site for\n\nppA and would give rise to a small N-terminal fragment (20 kDa\n\nof proPO-ppA) and a C-terminal active PO [25]. Therefore,\n\ncleavage as the result of caspase-1-like activity has the potential to\n\nreduce the PO activity and act as a negative regulator of the\n\nproPO system.\n\nThe presence of proPO-caspase fragments in the plasma\nand plasma PO activity after bacterial infection in vivo\n\nTo investigate whether any proPO-caspase fragment (proPO-\n\ncasp) is released from hemocytes, plasma proteins from bacteria-\n\ninfected crayfish were subjected to western blotting. The results in\n\nFigure 2B show that two caspase-cleaved proPO fragments were\n\npresent in the plasma after bacterial infection and that the levels of\n\nFigure 1.

In addition, the active subunit of caspase,\np20, was detected in plasma (E).

Moreover, the level of proPO-casp1 was higher\n\nthan that of proPO-casp2 at all time points. This result suggests\n\nthat proPO-casp2 may be degraded faster than proPO-casp1 in\n\nvivo. When non-virulent E. coli was injected, the released proPO\n\nwas rapidly cleaved by a caspase, and high levels of the fragments\n\nwere detected at 1 and 3 hours post injection. In contrast, the\n\ninjection of a virulent A. hydrophila strain resulted in slower caspase\n\ncleavage, and a high level was reached after 3 hours (Figure 2B).\n\nInterestingly, when the levels of the C-terminal fragments of\n\nproPO in the samples were analyzed, neither active PO, nor\n\nproPO-casps could be detected, and only inactive proPO was\n\nfound in the plasma. This result suggests that the C-terminal\n\nfragments of proPO produced by caspase-1-like cleavage, as well\n\nas ppA cleavage, are degraded rapidly.\n\nBecause cleavage by caspase-1 may reduce PO activity, the\n\nenzyme activity in the plasma was measured after bacterial\n\ninfection (Figure 2C). The PO activity decreased after E. coli\n\ninfection, but there was no significant difference, and interestingly,\n\nthe plasma PO activity was significantly higher at 1 h after A.\n\nhydrophila infection, at time at which the plasma proPO-casp levels\n\nwere low, and the enzyme activity markedly decreased by 3 h,\n\nwhen the levels of these fragments were higher. Notably, all\n\nanimals died 4–6 hours after A. hydrophila infection.\n\nCa2+-dependence of proPO-casps release in vitro\nCa\n\n2+\nhas been reported to induce exocytosis in crayfish\n\nhemocytes [18] and regulates inflammasome activation and thus\n\ncaspase-1 activation [17], [26]. Therefore, we investigated the\n\neffect of Ca\n2+\n\non proPO-casp release in in vitro experiments with\n\nisolated GCs. As shown in Figure 3A, the release of proPO and\n\nboth proPO-casp fragments was Ca\n2+\n\nand time dependent. When\n\nthe antibody against the C-terminus of proPO was used, proPO\n\nbut not active PO or proPO-casps could be detected. Again, this\n\nresult suggests that the C-terminal fragments of proPO are rapidly\n\ndegraded.\n\nTo confirm that the proPO-casp fragments are the result of a\n\ncaspase-1-like cleavage, the effect of the caspase-1 inhibitors Z-\n\nYVAD-FMK or Ac-WEHD-FMK on the release of proPO-casp\n\nfragments was examined. The results presented in Figure 3B\n\nclearly show that the production of proPO-casps was markedly\n\ndecreased in the presence of Z-YVAD (Figure 3B) or Z-WEHD-\n\nFMK (Figure S1). The amount of released proPO into the\n\nmedium was also decreased in the presence of Z-YVAD-FMK,\n\nand a higher level of proPO in granular cell lysate was observed\n\nwhen the cells were incubated with caspase-1 inhibitors (Figure\n\nS1).\n\nFurthermore, dsRNA caspase-1 treatment of granular hemo-\n\ncytes caused a complete reduction of the caspase-1 like transcript\n\n(Figure 3C), but no obvious reduction in protein level could be\n\nobserved (data not shown). However, when the cells were treated\n\nwith Ca\n2+\n\nfor 3 h to induce release of caspase-1 at 65 h of dsRNA\n\ntreatment, the caspase-1 knockdown cells fail to produce new\n\nprocaspase-1 like protein after another 24 h culture in L-15\n\n(Figure 3D). The lower level of caspase-1 like protein resulted in a\n\nreduction of the levels of proPO-casp fragments both in cell lysate\n\nand medium. No change in total proPO protein could be observed\n\nafter the RNAi treatment of granular cells (Figure 3D).\n\nRecombinant protein expression and purification\nBecause putative caspase-1 cleavage products were clearly\n\ndetected outside GCs in vitro and in vivo, we decided to determine if\n\nthese fragments possess biological functions. The N-terminal parts\n\nof proPO produced by cleavage at the putative caspase-1 cleavage\n\nsite between Asp363 and Ala364 (proPO-casp1), and the fragment\n\nproduced by cleavage between Asp389 and Asn390 (proPO-casp2)\n\nwere produced as recombinant proteins with estimated sizes of 43\n\nand 47 kDa, respectively. In addition, the N-terminal peptide\n\nfragment of proPO generated by cleavage by ppA between Arg176\n\nand Thr177 [25] was produced (proPO-ppA).\n\nTo determine whether any of the proPO fragments are involved\n\nin the immune system, the bacterial clearance activities of these\n\nproteins were assessed. The fragments were mixed with bacteria\n\nand then injected into crayfish. Bacterial number in hemolymph\n\nwas examined at 40 min and 3 h post injection. After 40 min, the\n\nE. coli titer was already significantly decreased in the proPO-ppA,\n\nproPO-casp1, and GFP treatment groups, whereas the injection of\n\nFigure 2.

Because GFP also caused reduction of bacterial number\n\nat this time point, this might be a general protein effect. However, at\n\n3 h post injection, the numbers of E. coli in the proPO-ppA, proPO-\n\ncasp1, and proPO-casp2 injection groups were significantly lower\n\nthan that in the non-protein injection groups and the GFP group\n\n(Figure 4B).The antimicrobial activities of all three fragments were\n\nthen tested in vitro to determine if the bacterial clearance was caused\n\nby the proteins themselves or if other components were involved in\n\nthe clearance process. The titer of E. coli decreased significantly after\n\nproPO-ppA treatment compared with the non-protein treatment,\n\nwhereas the other fragments had no significant effect and did not\n\nexhibit any antibacterial activity (Figure 5A). When the treated\n\nbacteria were observed under the microscope, very strong\n\nagglutination was detected after treatment with the proPO-ppA\n\npeptide, whereas no signs of agglutination occurred with the proPO-\n\ncasp fragments or GFP (Figure 5B). The minimal agglutinating\n\nconcentration for proPO-ppA was the lowest for E. coli and\n\nStaphylococcus aureus, and the proPO-ppA fragment appeared to have\n\nthe ability to agglutinate all of the tested bacterial species (Table 1).\n\nWhen the bacteria were observed by SEM after 15 and 40 min of\n\nincubation, we could see that proPO-ppA disrupted the E. coli cell\n\nmorphology, causing the cell walls to shrink. After 15 min of\n\nincubation, the E. coli treated with proPO-ppA started to show signs\n\nof cell wall disruption, and a longitudinal line was observed\n\n(Figure 5C), in contrast to the GFP-treated bacteria (Figure 5D).\n\nAfter 40 min of incubation, the E. coli treated with proPO-ppA\n\nclearly formed clumps (Figure 5F), and the cells were flat (Figures 5H\n\nand 5I).\n\nThen, a bacteria viability assay was performed to determine if\n\nthe strong agglutination killed the bacteria. Fluorescence micros-\n\ncopy clearly revealed that the proPO-ppA fragment greatly\n\ndecreased the cell viability compared with the control treatments\n\nas measured by the red staining of dead bacteria (Figure 6). A few\n\nagglutinated bacteria were stained with only SYTO9 and\n\nappeared green in the merged picture (live cells).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe proPO system is an important innate immune response and\n\nis composed of a cascade of proteinases that terminates with the\n\nactivation of the proenzyme proPO. After proteolytic cleavage,\n\nproPO becomes an active redox enzyme, PO, which forms\n\nmelanin and other antimicrobial products in the non-catalytic\n\npathway from quinone to melanin [1], [27], [28]. Because the\n\nproduct of PO is highly toxic, it is necessary to keep the proPO\n\nsystem under strict control to avoid deleterious effects of an\n\nactivated proPO system, principally the redox enzyme PO. Several\n\nfactors that can control this system have been described, including\n\na multitude of proteinase inhibitors [1], [28], [29]. Moreover, if\n\nPO is generated, the melanization inhibition protein (MIPs) can\n\ninhibit melanin formation [4], [5]. Another way to protect against\n\nthe inappropriate activation of proPO is to keep this proenzyme\n\nand its activation cascade in separate subcellular compartments.\n\nThus, all arthropod proPOs are produced as leaderless proteins\n\nand are presumably located in the cytoplasm, whereas the\n\nactivation system (proPO-AS) is located in secretory granules in\n\ncrustaceans. This arrangement is similar to that of IL-1b, which is\nformed as a precursor in the cytoplasm and is then released to the\n\noutside of the cell during or after activation. Because caspase-1\n\ncleavage is necessary for this activation and release steps and\n\nbecause such cleavage has been shown to be of importance for the\n\nsecretion of several leaderless proteins [5], we looked for caspase-1\n\ncleavage sites in proPO. We identified a new important regulator\n\nof the proPO system, caspase-1-like activity, which can efficiently\n\ncleave proPO at two cleavage sites and make the enzyme\n\ncatalytically inactive. Moreover, we found that the N-terminal\n\nproducts of this cleavage have effects on bacterial clearance. There\n\nare no previous reports of inflammasomes in invertebrates, and\n\nNOD-like receptors (NLRs), which are part of the vertebrate\n\ncaspase-1-activating inflammasome complex, have not been found\n\nin invertebrate genomes except that of the sea urchin [17].\n\nHowever, both vertebrates and invertebrates express several\n\npattern recognition receptors, and there might be other still\n\nundiscovered inflammasome sensor molecules responsible for the\n\nactivation of invertebrate caspase-1-like activity. Recently, the\n\nstructure of a Drosophila apoptosome composed of the Apaf-1-like\n\nprotein Dark was reported. After binding to Dark, the initiator\n\ncaspase Dronc cleaves the caspase DrICE and initiates an intrinsic\n\ncell death pathway [30]. The NLR-inflammasome and different\n\napoptosomes are all examples of the oligomerization of CARD\n\ndomain proteins involved in caspase activation, and their roles in\n\ncell death and immune responses are only beginning to be\n\nFigure 3.

The\nrelease of proPO-casps was Ca\n\n2+\nand time dependent (A) and was\n\ninhibited when the cells were preincubated for 30 min with the\ncaspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK prior to Ca\n\n2+\naddition (B).

Our discovery may add the proPO system to the list of\n\nimmune responses balanced by such caspase regulation.\n\nThe activation of proPO by ppA occurs via proteolytic cleavage\n\nnear the N-terminal, and a peptide of approximately 20 kDa is\n\nreleased during this process. Once activated, the PO activity must\n\nbe strictly localized to where melanization is needed. In analogy\n\nwith the complement system in vertebrates, we asked whether the\n\ncleaved activation peptide also has biological activities, as C3-\n\ncleaved peptides do.\n\nTo study whether this peptide (proPO-ppA) and the fragments\n\nresulting from caspase cleavage are involved in bacterial clearance,\n\nwe injected E. coli together with these different fragments\n\nseparately into crayfish and measured the number of bacteria in\n\nthe hemolymph after the injection. Interestingly, all three peptides\n\nhad the ability to decrease the bacterial number in the hemolymph\n\ncompared to the injection of a control protein. To further\n\ninvestigate the mechanisms of action of these three peptides, we\n\nincubated each peptide directly with E. coli to identify any putative\n\nFigure 4. Bacterial clearance.

The observation of antibacterial\n\nactivity in vitro suggests that the observed antimicrobial activity\n\nwas a result of this peptide itself, whereas the proPO-casp1 and\n\nproPO-casp2 seem to require other components in crayfish to\n\npromote bacterial clearance. After incubation with the proPO-\n\nppA fragment, both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria\n\nwere found to be heavily agglutinated. Moreover, live/dead\n\nstaining of proPO-ppA-incubated E. coli revealed that the\n\nagglutinated bacteria contained a high percentage of dead cells.\n\nThe generation of a highly antibacterial peptide after cleavage is\n\nsimilar to the case of hemocyanin, for which proteolytic cleavage\n\nin the crayfish plasma produces astacidin 1 [31]. These findings\n\ncorrespond to the antimicrobial function of human eosinophil\n\ncationic protein (ECP). Incubation with ECP can cause bacterial\n\nagglutination and decreased viability. One further example is the\n\nC-terminal region of human extracellular superoxide dismutase\n\n(SOD), which also exhibits antimicrobial activity against Gram-\n\nnegative and Gram-positive bacteria [32], [33].\n\nThe SEM study showed that the antibacterial effect of proPO-\n\nppA seemed to be on the bacterial cell wall. The cell wall appeared\n\nto shrink in the presence of proPO-ppA and then the E. coli cells\n\nwere flattened. This antimicrobial activity is similar to the activity\n\nof funnel web spider venom on Shigella sp. [34].\n\nWe present new findings that may explain how the proPO\n\nsystem is regulated and how its activity is localized (Figure 7). After\n\nppA cleavage, the small N-terminal proPO-ppA peptide causes the\n\nagglutination of bacteria at the site of infection, and PO activity\n\nthen may localize melanization to these bacterial aggregates. We\n\nalso provide evidence that the release of proPO, a leaderless\n\nprotein, from cells may involve caspase-1-like activity, similar to\n\nthat regulating IL-1brelease. Furthermore, caspase-1-like cleavage\nof proPO inactivates the enzyme and generates two N-terminal\n\nfragments with bacterial clearing activity. These findings show that\n\nproPO is a multifunctional protein, with a phenoloxidase in the C-\n\nterminal region and an agglutinating and antimicrobial peptide in\n\nthe N-terminal region, as well as N-terminal proPO-casps peptides\n\nwith distinct biological activities.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAnimals\nFreshwater crayfish (P. leniusculus) was purchased and reared in a\n\nclosed system at 10uC. Only healthy animals were used for the\nexperiments.\n\nAntibodies\nThe antibody against human procaspase-1 and p20 subunit was\n\npurchased from Invitrogen. The antibody against kazal protease\n\ninhibitor (KPI) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (sc-46652).\n\nThe ECL peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (species-\n\nspecific whole Ab) was purchased from GE Healthcare.

The separated cells were resuspended in 0.15 M NaCl,\n\nseeded on coverslips, fixed and treated as described previously\n\n[35]. The immunostaining was performed using an antibody\n\nagainst the N-terminus of proPO (5 ng/ml, 1:160) and a FITC-\nconjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:300). In addition, an antibody\n\nagainst a crayfish kazal protease inhibitor (KPI) was also used to\n\ncounter stain hemocyte granules. The slides were mounted with\n\nVECTASHIELD mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector\n\nLaboratories). The stained cells were then observed under a\n\nfluorescence microscope.\n\nHemocyte lysate and protein sample preparation\nThe hemolymph was centrifuged at 10006g for 5 min at 4uC,\n\nand the hemocyte pellet was collected and washed two times with\n\nPBS. Then, hemocytes were lysed in PBS containing 2% Triton\n\nX-100 [15] and 16 protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete, Mini,\nEDTA-free, Roche). The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,0006 g\nfor 15 min at 4uC, and the supernatant was collected. The protein\nconcentration was determined, and 20 mg of protein was mixed\nwith Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 2% SDS, 10%\n\n(v/v) glycerol, 0.1 M DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue, pH 6.8).\n\nDetection of caspase-1-like protein in crayfish\nThe presence of caspase-1-like protein was first examined in\n\ncrayfish hemocyte lysate (20 mg protein) by western blotting using\nan antibody against human caspase-1. The hemocyte lysate was\n\nprepared as described above. In addition, the amount of the\n\ncaspase-1-like protein in crayfish plasma was also determined in\n\nFigure 7. Hypothetical model of caspase-1 regulation of the proPO-AS. The proPO-AS is known to be localized to granules of the hemocytes\nand released by exocytosis after activation by microbial polysaccharides, while the final component proPO lacks a signal peptide and is located to the\ncytoplasm. In this paper we show that a caspase-1 like enzyme is involved in a Ca2+ -dependent release of proPO from the hemocytes and if proPO is\nnot cleaved by the ppA then Caspase1-like enzyme will cleave proPO into two fragments that exhibit bacterial clearance activity and at the same time\ninactivate the melanin producing enzyme PO. Moreover we show that the peptide that is produced upon activation of proPO to PO by ppA possess\nhigh antibacterial and agglutinating activity. In summary this figure shows a putative mechanism for how the ProPO-system is localized to specific\nsites and is rapidly inactivated to prevent the spread of this dangerous enzyme.

To perform this experiment, crayfish (N = 3 for each group)\n\nwere injected with 0.15 M NaCl, non-virulent E. coli or highly\n\nvirulent A. hydrophila B1 [38], and hemolymph was collected at 1 h\n\nafter injection. Hemocytes were removed from the hemolymph by\n\ncentrifugation at 10006 g for 5 min at 4uC. Then, 200 mg of\nplasma protein was loaded onto 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels and\n\nsubjected to western blotting as previously described [35]. The\n\npresence of caspase was detected using a rabbit anti-caspase\n\nantibody (1:3000) and ECL peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit\n\nIgG (GE Healthcare) (1:7500). The detection of actin was also\n\nperformed as a loading control using a goat anti-actin antibody\n\n(1:5000) and an anti-goat secondary antibody (1:5000).\n\nCaspase-1 activity assay\nTo determine caspase-1 activity, Ac-YVAD-pNA (Santa Cruz),\n\na synthetic peptide and substrate for caspase-1, was used.\n\nHemolymph was collected at 1 h after injection of 0.15 M NaCl,\n\nE. coli or A. hydrophila B1. Cell-free plasma samples were prepared\n\nas described above. Then 50 ml of plasma was mixed with 200 nM\nof Ac-YVAN-pNA in the presence or absence of the caspase-1\n\ninhibitor, Z-YVAD-FMK (50 mM). The mixtures were incubated\nat 37uC for 1.5 h, and the absorbance was determined at 405 nM.\nThe plasma without substrate was used as a negative control for\n\neach sample. The caspase-1 activity was reported as OD405/g\n\nplasma protein.\n\nCaspase-1 cleavage site prediction\nTo determine if there are any potential caspase-1 cleavage sites\n\nin P. leniusculus proPO, the amino acid sequence of proPO\n\n(GenBank: CAA58471) was analyzed using the bioinformatics tool\n\nPeptideCutter (http://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/).\n\nPO activity assay and detection of proPO-casp fragments\nin crayfish plasma\n\nE. coli and A. hydrophila B1 were used to induce PO activity in\n\nvivo. Bacteria (1–36107 CFU/100 ml) suspended in 0.15 M NaCl\nwere injected into the crayfish (N = 5). The hemolymph was then\n\ncollected before and 1 and 3 h after injection and centrifuged at\n\n10006 g for 5 min to remove the hemocytes. Then, 30 ml of the\ncell-free plasma was used in a PO activity assay. The plasma was\n\nincubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT) with 20 ml of\n3 mg/ml L-DOPA and 50 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nThe PO activity was determined by monitoring the absorbance at\n\n490 nm, and a reaction mixture without substrate served as the\n\nbaseline.\n\nCell-free plasma (250 ml) was centrifuged at 110,0006g at 4uC\nfor 1.5 h to remove hemocyanin and 180 ml of the supernatant\nwas subjected to acetone precipitation. Then, 1.6 mg of protein\nfrom each sample was loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel, and the\n\nproPO-casps were detected by western blotting as described above\n\nusing antibodies against the N-terminus or C-terminus of proPO.\n\nDetection of proPO-casp release in vitro\nBecause proPO is highly expressed in GCs, separated GCs were\n\nused in these experiments. The GCs were resuspended in 0.15 M\n\nNaCl and seeded into 96-well plates. After attachment for 10 min,\n\nthe cells were incubated at RT in 10 mM HEPES-0.2 M NaCl\n\nbuffer (pH 6.8) containing different concentrations of CaCl2 (0, 1,\n\nor 10 mM). Then, 50 ml of buffer was collected from each well\nafter 30 and 60 min and subjected to TCA precipitation. The\n\nprotein pellets were dissolved in the same volume of Laemmli\n\nsample buffer and analyzed by western blotting using antibodies\n\nagainst the N-terminus (1:3000) or C-terminus (1:3000) of proPO\n\nas described above.\n\nTo investigate the effect of the caspase-1 inhibitors, Z-YVAD-\n\nFMK (Tocris Bioscience) and Ac-WEHD-FMK (Santa Cruz) on\n\nproPO-casp release, GCs were incubated with 75 ml of HEPES-\nNaCl containing the inhibitor (0, 1, 10, or 50 mM) for 30 min\nbefore the addition of 75 ml of HEPES-NaCl containing 2 mM\nCaCl2. Then, the buffer was collected at 30 and 60 min, and the\n\nsamples were prepared and analyzed as described above.\n\nKnockdown of Caspase-1-like protein in vitro\nTo knockdown crayfish caspase-1, double-stranded RNA\n\n(dsRNA) was synthesized with MEGAScript Kit (Ambion) and\n\nthe template was amplified using the following primers (T7\n\npromoter sequence is in italic); for dsCaspase-1 59-TAATACGACT-\n\nCACTATAGGGACCTGTGGACCGACCTAGTGC-39 and 59-\n\nTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGGTCGGGCCTTTAGTTGGAC-\n\nACC-39, dsGFP: 59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGACGTA-\n\nAACGGCCACAAGT-39 and 59-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-\n\nGTTCTTGTACAGCTCGTCCATGC-39. The purified dsRNAs\n\n(1 mg/well) were then added to granular cells and maintained in\n25% L-15 medium in 0.15 M NaCl at 16uC for 65 h (50% of\nmedium was changed once at 48 h). The cells were then treated\n\nwith 10 mM Ca\n2+\n\nfor 3 h to induce caspase-1 release. Next the\n\ncells were washed with 25% L-15 medium four times and then\n\nmaintained in the medium for another 24 h to allow the cells to\n\nproduce new caspase-1. Later, the cells were treated with 10 mM\n\nCa\n2+\n\nagain, and same volume of medium was collected from each\n\nwell at 60 min after incubation. In addition the granular cell\n\nlysate was also prepared from the 60-min Ca\n2+\n\ntreated cells. The\n\nsamples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and the proPO-casp\n\nfragments and caspase-1 like protein were detected by western\n\nblotting.\n\nCloning and recombinant protein expression\nProPO-ppA was amplified from P. leniusculus hemocyte cDNA\n\nusing the following primers: proPO32EcoRI-F, (59 TTTTT-\n\nTGAATTCCAGGTGACCCAGAAGTTGCTGAGGA 39) and\n\nproPOppA-R, (59 CGCCTCGAGCTACCTGTTCACTTCAA-\n\nCCTGCATGCTT 39). The PCR product was visualized by\n\nagarose gel electrophoresis, extracted from the gel and purified\n\nbefore being ligated into the pET32a expression vector between\n\nthe EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The protein was expressed in\n\nE. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. After the IPTG induction, the\n\nproteins, which were expressed in inclusion bodies, were refolded\n\nand purified with Ni-affinity chromatography.\n\nFurther, proPO-casp1 and proPO-casp2 were amplified using\n\nproPO-F (59 CATGCCATGGGCCATCATCATCATCATCA-\n\nTCAGGTGACCCAGAAGTTGCTGAGGA 39) and proPO-\n\ncasp-R1 (59 CGCCTCGAGCTAATCTGCCTCAAACGCGT-\n\nCTCCTAAG 39) for proPO-casp1 and proPOcasp-R2 (59\n\nCGCCTCGAGCTAGTCGTGACAGAATGCCAGCAGCACA\n\n39) for proPO-casp2. Both PCR products were ligated into the\n\npET28b expression vector between the NcoI and XhoI restriction\n\nsites and expressed in the E. coli expression system as described\n\nabove. Bacterial cells were disrupted by sonication, and the\n\nrecombinant proteins were purified with Ni-affinity chromatogra-\n\nphy and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 4uC.\n\nIn vivo bacterial clearance\nBacterial and protein injections were performed as follows.\n\nBriefly, wild-type E. coli were harvested at the mid-log phase,\n\nwashed six times with 150 mM NaCl at 12006g for 5 min and\n\nCaspase-1-Like Regulation of the proPO-System\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 9 April 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 4 | e1004059\n\nhttp://web.expasy.org/peptide_cutter/\n\n\nresuspended in 150 mM NaCl at 16109 CFU/ml. Bacterial\nsuspensions (100 ml) were mixed with 20 mg of recombinant\nprotein or 20 mM Tris-HCl and injected into the crayfish at the\n\nbase of a walking leg. At 40 min and 3 h after injection,\n\nhemolymph was collected, serially diluted with 150 mM NaCl\n\nand plated on LB agar. The plates were incubated at 37uC\novernight. The number of bacterial colonies was counted, and the\n\nnumber of CFU per ml was calculated for each treatment.\n\nIn vitro bacterial clearance\nTo investigate whether the bacterial clearance activity was a\n\ndirect effect of the protein fragments, we performed an in vitro\n\nbacterial clearance assay as follows. E. coli were prepared as\n\ndescribed above, and 100 ml of resuspended E. coli was mixed with\n20 mg of recombinant protein. Then, the volume was adjusted to\n1 ml with 150 mM NaCl. The mixtures were incubated for 1 hour\n\nat room temperature with mild agitation, serially diluted and\n\nplated onto LB agar to calculate the CFU per ml. The plates were\n\nobserved under a microscope.\n\nAgglutination assay\nThe minimum protein concentration for bacterial agglutination\n\nwas tested as previously described [39]. The bacteria used in the\n\nexperiment were Staphylococcus aureus Cowan, Micrococcus luteus M\n\nIII, E. coli D21, A. hydrophila B1, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa OT97.\n\nOvernight cultures of bacteria were collected and washed three\n\ntimes in 150 mM NaCl. Each bacterial species was resuspended,\n\nand the optical density was adjusted to 2. The recombinant\n\nproteins were twofold serially diluted, and 50 ml of each dilution\nwas mixed with 50 ml of bacterial suspension and incubated at\nroom temperature for 1 hour.\n\nBacteria viability assay\nE. coli and protein mixtures were prepared as described for the\n\nin vitro bacterial clearance assay. After 5 min of incubation,\n\nSYTO9 (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 50 nM,\n\nand propidium iodide (PI) was added to a final concentration of\n\n1 mg/ml. Then, the samples were visualized with a fluorescence\nmicroscope.\n\nSEM analysis\nE. coli at O.D. 0.5 (100 ml) was incubated with 20 mg of the\n\nproPO-ppA peptide for 40 min at room temperature with mild\n\nagitation.
