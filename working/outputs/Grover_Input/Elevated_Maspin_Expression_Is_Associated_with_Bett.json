Michigan, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nTumor suppressor maspin is a differentially regulated gene in the progression of many types of cancer. While the biological\nfunction of maspin in blocking tumor invasion and metastasis is consistent with the loss of maspin expression at the late\nstage of tumor progression, the differential expression and the biological significance of maspin in early stage of tumor\nprogression appear to be complex and remain to be elucidated. In the current study, we examined the expression of maspin\nin 84 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases (stages I–III) and 55 non-tumor adjacent esophageal tissue\nspecimens by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. The correlation of maspin with clinicopathological parameters was\nanalyzed. Compared to normal esophageal squamous tissue where 80% (47/55) of the cases expressed maspin at a low to\nmoderate level, all ESCC specimens (100% (84/84)) were positive for maspin expression at a moderate to high level. ESCC\nwith low or moderate maspin expression had significantly shorter postoperative survival rates compared to those that had\nhigh maspin expression (p,0.001). Since the correlation of maspin with ESCC histology and the correlation of maspin with\nESCC prognosis seem to be at odds, we further investigated the biological function of maspin in ESCC using the established\nESCC cell lines. The expression of maspin in five human esophageal squamous cancer cell lines (T12, E450, KYSE150, EC109,\nand KYSE510) was examined by the Western blot. ESCC cell line KYSE510 that did not express maspin and was stably\ntransfected by maspin cDNA or an empty vector. The resulting transfected cells were characterized in vitro. Maspin\nexpression significantly inhibited cell proliferation, motility and matrigel invasion. Taken together, our data suggest that the\ntransient up-regulation of maspin in the early development of ESCC may be a defense mechanism against further transition\ntowards more malignant phenotypes, ultimately slowing down ESCC tumor progression.\n\nCitation: Wang Y, Sheng S, Zhang J, Dzinic S, Li S, et al.

The two main subtypes of\n\nesophageal carcinoma are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell\n\ncarcinoma (ESCC), while the most commonly diagnosed esoph-\n\nageal cancer in China and other Asian countries is ESCC [3,4].\n\nDespite the rapid advancement in combined chemotherapy and\n\nradiation therapy for ESCC, the average 5-year overall survival\n\nhas remained steady at 10–20% [2,5,6]. Unfortunately, the\n\nprediction of clinical prognosis of patients with ESCC based on\n\nconventional pathological variables, such as the tumor size, tumor\n\ngrade, and the tumor stage is highly empirical [7–9]. Specific\n\nbiomarkers that are mechanistically involved in the progression of\n\nESCC may significantly improve the accuracy of the prediction of\n\npatients’ survival. To this end, it is important to note that many of\n\nthe molecular markers that are associated with specific patholog-\n\nical grades (diagnosis) have failed to serve as prognostic markers. It\n\nis well appreciated that tumor progression is a continuum of\n\ndynamic molecular and cellular changes. The link of a molecular\n\nprofile with a phenotype may not reflect whether the former is\n\ndriver or a passenger of the latter, and may not predict whether\n\nthis association is consequential for further tumor progression.\n\nSome molecular changes may be suppressive steps that may\n\neventually give way to the predominant oncogenic changes. The\n\ncapacity of tumor cells to turn on tumor suppressive mechanisms,\n\neven though transitory, may translate into delayed tumor\n\nprogression, and prolonged patients’ survival.\n\nMaspin is an epithelial-specific tumor suppressor that is\n\ndifferentially regulated during tumor progression. It is a member\n\nof the serine protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily [10] but with\n\nfunctions that are deviant from those of classical serine protease-\n\ninhibiting serpins. Accumulated evidence suggests that maspin\n\nmay play a key role in the maintenance of epithelial homeostasis\n\nby blocking serine protease-like enzymes such as the zymogen\n\nform of urokinase-type plasminogen activator [11,12] and histone\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581\n\n\n\ndeacetylase 1 [13]. Consistent with its anti-invasion and anti-\n\nmetastasis properties, maspin expression is found to be down\n\nregulated in the progression of many types of cancer at the step of\n\ntumor invasion and metastasis.\n\nAs a tumor suppressor, maspin is not immediately down-\n\nregulated in the early development of cancer. In fact, accumulated\n\nevidence demonstrates a transient up-regulation of maspin in non-\n\ninvasive cancer of breast [14,15], ovary [16], and pancreas\n\n[17,18]. In adenocarcinomas, this up-regulation of maspin is also\n\nassociated with its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.\n\nIn squamous cell carcinomas, however, maspin is always\n\ndistributed to both nucleus and cytoplasm. The biological\n\nsignificance of these distinct differential patterns is a subject of\n\ncurrent investigation. Based on our earlier studies, the transloca-\n\ntion of maspin from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in early stage\n\nadenocarcinoma correlates with significantly better survival of\n\nlung cancer [19]. On the other hand, elevated maspin expression\n\nin early stage squamous cell carcinoma both, nuclear and\n\ncytosolic, correlates with significantly better survival of oral\n\nsquamous cell carcinoma [20]. These data suggest that the\n\nprognosis of cancer subtypes may be distinctly stratified based on\n\nmaspin differential expression.\n\nIn this paper, we report the first clinical evidence that maspin\n\nwas significantly elevated in a subpopulation of stage I-III ESCC\n\nspecimens. The level of maspin expression correlated with better\n\noverall survival of ESCC patients. We further investigated the\n\nbiological function of maspin using established ESCC cell lines\n\nand showed an inhibitory effect of maspin on cell proliferation,\n\nmotility, and invasion. These data suggest that ESCC with an\n\nability to up-regulate maspin may be protected against further\n\nmalignant progression.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nTissue Specimens\nThis research involves 84 archived formalin-fixed and paraffin-\n\nembedded human stage I–III esophageal squamous cell carcinoma\n\n(ESCC) tissue specimens, from patients who were eligible for and\n\nunderwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007 at the\n\nDepartment of Surgery, Beijing Cancer Hospital (China). In\n\naddition, tumor-adjacent normal tissue specimens were collected\n\nfrom 55 of these patients. Prior to the tissue collection, the clinical\n\nprotocol was approved by the ethics review board of Peking\n\nUniversity Health Sciences Center. Informed written consents\n\nwere obtained from the patients. The consents were saved as\n\nscanned PDF files, and saved in patients’ records. The samples\n\nwere de-identified to the research group. The 84 patients included\n\n64 men and 20 women with a median age of 58 years (ranging\n\nfrom 43 to 73 years).\n\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) Staining\nTissue sections on slides of 5 mm thickness were subjected to\n\nhematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, and IHC staining of\n\nmaspin as described previously [16]. Monoclonal antibody against\n\nmaspin (clone G167–70; Pharmingen/BD Bioscience, San Diego,\n\nCA) was diluted 100-fold. The horse-reddish peroxidase (HRP)\n\nconjugated secondary antibody (Dako Cytomation, Cambridge-\n\nshire, UK) was detected by chromogenic reaction of HRP. For\n\nnegative controls, the primary antibody was omitted. The tissue\n\nsections were examined and scored independently by the two\n\npathologists who had no prior knowledge of the study aim or\n\ndesign. Maspin expression was semi-quantitatively evaluated by\n\nthe percentage of maspin positive cells and the intensity of maspin\n\nstaining on the scale of 0–3. The percentage of positive cells was\n\ncategorically scored as following: 0 points (maspin positive in 0–\n\n5% of cells); 2 points (maspin positive in 6–50% of cells); 3 points\n\n(maspin positive in .50% of cells). The staining intensity was\n\ncategorically scored as follows: 1 point: negative or weak staining;\n\n2 points: moderate staining; 3 points: strong staining. The overall\n\nmaspin expression (OMS) was calculated as the sum of the\n\npercentage category points and the intensity category points in\n\neach case. Tumors were categorized into four groups: negative:\n\n#5% of cells stained, regardless of intensity; weak expression\n\n(OMS: 0–2 points); moderate expression (OMS: 3–4 points); and\n\nstrong expression (OMS: 5–6 points). Maspin sub-cellular pattern\n\nof nuclear staining and cytoplasmic staining were assessed semi-\n\nquantitatively on the basis of the percentage of positive cells, as\n\ndescribed previously [21]. Maspin nuclear immunoreactivity was\n\ndefined as stronger nuclear staining than cytoplasmic staining in at\n\nleast 10% of tumor cells. Maspin cytoplasmic immunoreactivity\n\nwas defined as stronger cytoplasmic staining than nuclear staining\n\nin at least 10% of tumor cells.\n\nCell Lines and Cell Culture\nFive human ESCC cell lines (KYSE-510, KYSE-150, T12,\n\nE450 and EC-109) were purchased from Institute of Basic Medical\n\nSciences Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences’ cell culture center\n\n(Beijing, China). The cells were maintained at 37uC and 5% CO2\nin RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO, US) supplemented with 10%\n\nheat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-\n\nstreptomycin.\n\nWestern Blotting\nCells were lysed with 16 RIPA buffer (Beyotime Institute of\n\nBiotechnology, Nantong, China) containing 25 mg/mL leupeptin\n(Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 10 mg/mL aprotinin\n(Sigma Chemical Co.). Cells were removed from the dishes by cell\n\nscraping. The samples were then subjected to three cycles of\n\nfreeze-thaw and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 20 min. The\n\nprotein concentration of the samples was determined using a\n\nbicinchoninic acid Protein Assay Reagent kit, and whole cell\n\nlysates were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a\n\npolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The membrane was\n\nblocked in 5% skim milk for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) and\n\nthen probed with primary antibodies against maspin (1:500\n\ndiluted) and a-actin (from SIGMA, 1:10,000 diluted), respectively.\nThe HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody was used at\n\n1:2,500 dilutions. The bound secondary antibody was detected by\n\nchemiluminescence reaction (Millipore, Bedford, USA) and\n\nvisualized by radiography.\n\nStable Transfection\nSequence-verified maspin cDNA cloned into a vector for\n\nexpression in mammalian cells [22] was used to transfect\n\napproximately 60% confluent KYSE-510 using the Lipofectami-\n\nne\nTM\n\n2000 kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The empty vector DNA\n\nwas used in parallel transfection as a negative control. For clonal\n\nselection, 24 hrs after transfection, G418 was added to the culture\n\nmedium at the concentration of 400 mg/mL. The cells were\nmaintained in G418-containing medium for the next 4 weeks until\n\nindividual clones were selected. The selected clones were\n\nsubsequently maintained in the medium containing 200 mg/mL\nof G418.\n\nCell Proliferation Assay\nTo determine the effect of maspin on cell proliferation, cells\n\nwith and without maspin were seeded into 96-well plate at a\n\nMaspin and ESCC Prognosis\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581\n\n\n\ndensity of 46103/well/200 mL in the maintenance medium.\nViable cells were quantified at 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours (h) after\n\nthe seeding by the chromogenic 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-\n\ndiphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay according to the\n\nmanufacturer’s instruction (Sigma, St. Louis, US). Each assay\n\nwas performed in triplicates and repeated 3 times.\n\nColony Formation Assay\nCells seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 400 cells/well/\n\nmedium volume, were allowed to grow for 10 days to form\n\ncolonies. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and treated with\n\nGiemsa for 10 min, and then photographed with a digital camera\n\n(OLYMPUS, SP350). The number of colonies and the number of\n\ncells in each colony was counted under the microscopy. The\n\ncolonies which had more than 100 cells were defined as big\n\ncolonies.\n\nWound-healing Assay\nThe cells were added to six-well plates, allowed to form\n\nconfluent monolayers and were serum starved overnight. An\n\nartificial wound was created in the cell monolayer with a sterile\n\nplastic 200 mL micropipette tip to generate one homogeneous\nwound in each well. After wounding, the culture medium was\n\nremoved, and cells were washed at least twice to eliminate\n\ndetached cells. Wound closure was photographed at 0, 6, 12, and\n\n24 h after wounding. Images of cells from the same field were\n\nacquired at the indicated time points, using an inverted\n\nmicroscope equipped with a digital camera. The number of cells\n\nin each colony was counted under microscope. Each measurement\n\nwas performed in triplicate.\n\nMatrigel Invasion Assay\nInvasion assay was performed using 8 mm PET pore size\n\nmembrane coated with Matrigel (24-well, BD Biosciences, Bed-\n\nford, MA). Cells were seeded at 26105 cells per 500 mL of growth\nmedium on the Matrigel-coated membrane. The bottom wells\n\nwere filled with the maintenance culture medium, and the\n\nchambers were incubated at 37uC in a humidified 5% CO2. After\n24 h, the Matrigel and non-invading cells in the upper chamber\n\nwere removed by scraping. The cells on the bottom side of the\n\nmembrane (invading cells) were stained with 1% crystal violet and\n\ncounted under the microscope. Each experiment was performed in\n\ntriplicate.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nClinicopathological factors were analyzed separately using the\n\nchi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate\n\nthe patient survival and the log-rank test was used to determine the\n\nstatistical significance. The associations between discrete variables\n\nwere assessed using the chi-square test. All data were expressed as\n\nthe mean 6 standard deviation. A p-value of less than 0.05 was\n\nconsidered to be statistically significant. Statistical calculations\n\nwere performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences\n\nsoftware version 11.0 (SPSS11.0).\n\nResults\n\nDifferential Maspin Expression in Human ESCC and\nNormal Adjacent Tissues\n\nTo investigate whether the level or subcellular localization of\n\nmaspin helps predict the survival of ESCC patients, ESCC tissues\n\nwere collected from 84 stage I-III patients who were eligible for\n\nand underwent surgical resection between 2003 and 2007. These\n\npatients were followed up for at least 5 years. IHC was performed\n\nto examine the expression of maspin in these tumor specimens, as\n\nwell as 55 tumor-adjacent normal tissues, and the level of maspin\n\nexpression was semi-quantified using the method described in the\n\nMaterials and Methods section. Representative results are shown\n\nin Figure 1. As summarized in Table 1, among 55 cases of\nnormal esophageal tissues, the positive immunoreactivity was\n\nassociated with 85% of cases (47/55). The 8 patients had no\n\nmaspin immunoreactivity, 37 cases had weak maspin staining, and\n\n10 cases were associated with strong maspin staining. In contrast,\n\nall 84 ESCC specimens showed positive maspin staining. 33 tumor\n\nspecimens were associated with weak maspin staining, whereas 51\n\ncases had strong maspin staining. Overall, as compared to the\n\ncorresponding normal esophageal tissues, ESCC tissues exhibited\n\nstronger maspin IHC signals and a higher percentage of maspin-\n\nstrong cells (p,0.001).\n\nBased on the overall maspin expression, all the tumor specimens\n\ncan be divided by the total level of maspin expression (low/\n\nmoderate vs. strong), the level of nuclear maspin (weak/moderate\n\nvs. strong), and the level of cytoplasmic maspin (weak/moderate\n\nvs. strong). The stratification of these different groups with\n\nclinicopatholoigcal variables was evaluated. As summarized in\n\nTable 2, there was no significant difference between the groups\nwith respect to sex, age, pathologic grade and tumor stage. In\n\naddition, we also analyzed the association between subcellular\n\nlocalization of maspin and clinicopathological variables. Even\n\nthough not statistically significant, we observed the following\n\ntrends: poorly differentiated tumors were associated with weaker\n\nnuclear maspin staining and stronger cytoplasmic maspin staining.\n\nIn addition, the lymph node metastasis was associated with a\n\nhigher level of cytoplasmic maspin staining as compared to lymph\n\nnode negative patients.\n\nMaspin Expression Correlates with Better Overall\nPostoperative Survival\n\nOur cohort of ESCC patients were followed up for at least 5\n\nyears, as of March 2012, with a median survival of 36.5 months. In\n\norder to test if maspin expression is associated with increased or\n\ndecreased patient survival, patients were classified into two groups,\n\nthose with strong maspin expression (51 cases, OMS 5–6) or those\n\nwith weak and moderate maspin expression (33 cases, OMS 2–4).\n\nThe corresponding median survival time for these two groups were\n\n45611.1 months and 1962.9 months, respectively, demonstrating\n\nthat stronger maspin expression is associated with significantly\n\nincreased patient survival and favorable prognosis. (Figure 2A,\nlog-rank, p = 0.009). Since previous reports in breast [23] and lung\n\ncancer [19] for example, suggest that nuclear maspin is associated\n\nwith better overall patient survival, we also investigated whether\n\nmaspin subcellular localization correlated with the overall survival.\n\nFor this purpose, the patients were classified into two correspond-\n\ning groups: predominantly nuclear expression or predominantly\n\ncytoplasmic expression patients. Although the p value did not\n\nreach a significant difference, stronger expression of maspin in the\n\nnucleus was still associated with a more favorable patient prognosis\n\n(4469.5 months vs. 2164.5 months; p = 0.051) (Figures 2B and\n2C). In general, maspin expression level correlated with less tumor\nlocal invasion. We also observed a trend for the negative\n\ncorrelation between maspin expression and lymph node metastasis\n\n(Table 2). In addition, reduced nuclear maspin and increased\ncytoplasmic maspin were associated with lymph node metastasis.\n\nAlthough these data did not reach statistical significance, in part\n\nlimited by the number of patients, they are consistent with the\n\nnotion that the mortality of these ESCC patients result primarily\n\nfrom metastasis.\n\nMaspin and ESCC Prognosis\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 May 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 5 | e63581\n\n\n\nMaspin Expressed in ESCC Cell Lines is Tumor\nSuppressive\n\nEstablished ESCC cell lines offer a valuable experimental model\n\nto study the progression and underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nSimilar to the observation with early stage ESCC specimens, the\n\nlevel of maspin was not significantly altered in ESCC cell lines that\n\nare only weakly or moderately aggressive (T12, E450, KYSE150,\n\nand EC109) [24], as judged by Western blotting (Figure 3A).\nHowever, ESCC cell line KYSE510 that was significantly more\n\ninvasive and grew at a faster rate had lost maspin expression\n\n(Figure 3B).\n\nTo investigate the functional significance of maspin in ESCC,\n\nwe took the advantage of KYSE510 cell line that did not express\n\nmaspin and stably transfected the cells with maspin-encoding\n\npCMV-Tag2-maspin vector or an empty vector pCMV-Tag2.\n\nThe maspin expression in the resulting maspin transfected cells\n\n(M-KYSE510) and the mock transfected control (V-KYSE510) are\n\nshown in Figure 4A. As shown in Figure 4B, maspin expression\ncorrelated with decreased cell proliferation as judged by the MTT\n\nassay. Earlier, it was reported that maspin regulated cell\n\nattachment and detachment [13,25]. To determine whether the\n\neffect of maspin expression on tumor growth was a result of altered\n\ncolonization, cells were suspended and seeded at a low density in\n\ncell culture dish. The number of the single cell-derived colonies\n\nand number of cells per colony were evaluated under the\n\nmicroscope. Maspin expression did not significantly alter the\n\ncolony forming ability, for the colony numbers for M-KYSE510,\n\nV-KYSE510 and the parental cells were not significantly different\n\n(data not shown). However, as shown in Figure 4C, the size of M-\n\nKYSE510 colonies was significantly smaller compared to those\n\nderived fromV-KYSE510 cell line. Consistently, the number of\n\ncells per colony was significantly lower than those for V-KYSE510\n\nand parental cells. The number of colonies of M-KYSE510 with\n\nmore than 100 cells was approximately a half of those of V-\n\nKYSE510 or parental KYSE510cells (p,0.01, Figure 4D).\n\nTo further investigate whether the presence of maspin in ESCC\n\nis a gain or loss of other functions in tumor progression, we\n\nexamined the effect of maspin expression on tumor cell motility\n\nand invasion. As shown by the in vitro wound healing assay\n\n(Figure 5A), The M-KYSE-510 displayed a significantly attenu-\nated rate of wound healing as compared to V-KYSE-510 or\n\nparental KYSE-510 cells. Moreover, as compared to V-KYSE-\n\n510 or parental KYSE-510 cells, M-KYSE-510 exhibited a\n\nsignificantly lower capacity to migrate through the Matrigel-\n\ncoated transwell membrane in the in vitro invasion assay (p,0.01,\n\nFigures 5B and 5C).\n\nAlthough the level of maspin correlated with the overall\n\nsurvival, the biological function and underlying molecular\n\nmechanisms of maspin may not be as simple. The effects of\n\nmaspin may further depend on tumor microenvironments. In\n\naddition to reducing the proliferative activity and invasive\n\npotential, maspin may also prevent tumor angiogenesis through\n\nepigenetic regulation [26–30].\n\nEarlier we have shown that maspin may directly inhibit cell\n\nsurface-associated uPA to block tumor cell detachment\n\n[12,26,31,32]. Data from the Hendrix Laboratory [33] and our\n\nlaboratory [29] further suggest that maspin may down-regulate the\n\nexpression of uPA. To test whether the effect of maspin on the\n\nFigure 1.

Considering\n\nthe differences between squamous cell carcinoma and adenocar-\n\ncinoma, the underlying mechanism for the inhibitory effects of\n\nmaspin on ESCC invasion may not be identical to that in\n\ncarcinoma cells of breast and prostate origin. To date, there is no\n\nclinical consensus about uPA as a prognostic marker for ESCC.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe challenge for clinicians and oncologists in terms of patient\n\npersonalized medicine and plan for treatment is that early stage\n\ntumors with similar histopathological features may subsequently\n\ndisplay dramatically different outcome. In this paper, we described\n\nthe first evidence that tumor suppressor maspin expression in early\n\nstage ESCC positively correlated with overall postoperative\n\nsurvival of patients. In light of our in vitro data that maspin\n\ninhibits tumor growth and blocks tumor invasion, several\n\nimportant observations with human specimens suggest a unique\n\nvalue of maspin as a molecular prognostic marker of ESCC.\n\nOverall, our data support a hypothetical model (Figure 6) that\nhelps explain the correlation between maspin up-regulation and\n\nbetter overall survival of patients with ESCC. Based on this model,\n\nmaspin is expressed in early stage ESCC to retain the epithelial\n\nhomeostasis. In the absence of oncogenic changes, a basal level of\n\nmaspin expression is maintained in normal or benign squamous\n\nepithelial cells to counter incidental stress and transformation\n\ninsults. Upon the transformation and other oncogenic changes, the\n\nbasal level of maspin expression may not be sufficient to counter-\n\nbalance the biological effects of oncogenes. Those epithelial cells\n\nthat are still capable of up-regulating maspin expression will\n\nremain better differentiated with low potential to invade and\n\nmetastasize. The balance will shift towards more malignant\n\nphenotypes in those cells that are not capable of up-regulating\n\nmaspin or would eventually lose maspin expression. In contrast to\n\nmolecular markers whose differential expression patterns com-\n\npletely coincide with histopathological features, early stage ESCC\n\ncells expressing maspin at different levels may be histologically\n\nTable 2.

The usefulness of maspin differential expression may not\n\nbe to confirm pathological diagnosis. Rather, maspin may be\n\nuniquely useful as an independent marker to predict the course of\n\nthe disease progression.\n\nMaspin is an epithelial-specific protein. We did not detect\n\nspecific maspin antigen by immunohistochemistry in stromal\n\ncomponents in human ESCC specimens. Clinical studies to\n\ncorrelate maspin and tumor progression have been mostly\n\nconducted with adenocarcinoma, which is thought to be of\n\nglandular epithelial origin. Together with our current study, there\n\nare only two reports on how maspin expression correlates with the\n\nprogression of squamous cell carcinoma, which derives from\n\nstratified squamous epithelial cells. The reported data with oral\n\nsquamous cell carcinoma [20,34] share the following important\n\nsimilarities with our current study with ESCC: (i) both studies were\n\nconducted with surgically resected early stage tumor specimens; (ii)\n\nin both cases, maspin protein was detected in almost all tumor\n\ncells, and was overexpressed in some tumor cells; (iii) maspin\n\nprotein was detected in both the nucleus and cytoplasm; and (iv)\n\nthe overall maspin expression levels correlated with better survival\n\nof the patients. In comparison, a distinct maspin differential\n\nexpression patter is observed in adenocarcinoma. Studies with\n\ntissue specimens from breast [35,36], prostate [37], and lung [19]\n\nadenocarcinoma showed that maspin is predominantly a nuclear\n\nprotein in benign epithelial cells. Pre-neoplastic lesions and early\n\nstage carcinomas are commonly associated with elevated level of\n\nmaspin, which is localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm [19,35].\n\nIn invasive and metastatic carcinoma maspin expression is down-\n\nregulated or lost [38–40]. To our knowledge, maspin is the only\n\nmolecular marker that displays distinct differential expression\n\npatterns in the progression of different subtypes of carcinoma.\n\nFigure 3.

Thus, tumor suppressor genes that are mecha-\n\nnistically involved in tumor progression may be more insightful\n\nmolecular markers for diagnosis or prediction of prognosis. A\n\nparadigm based on the studies of classic tumor suppressor genes\n\nwhose loss or mutation at the genetic level contributes to\n\ncarcinogenesis and tumor progression would predict that tumor\n\nsuppressors would be down-regulated as long as the oncogenesis is\n\ninitiated [42]. Therefore, the tumor suppressive functions of\n\nmaspin may seem to be at odds with the observation that maspin is\n\nactually transiently up-regulated in some cells that have already\n\nacquired the histopathologic features of tumor cells. To this end, it\n\nis important to point out that maspin is primarily regulated at the\n\nlevel of expression and trafficking. Although maspin is not as\n\nfrequently mutated as some other well-known tumor suppressor\n\ngenes such as p53 [43], a specific Ser\n176RPro polymorphism has\n\nbeen identified [44] which seems to be frequent in gastric cancer\n\nand had reduced tumor suppressive potency as compared to the\n\nwild type maspin.\n\nIn vitro data from this study are in line with the consensus that\n\nmaspin exerts multifaceted anti-tumor effects, inhibiting tumor\n\ngrowth, motility, invasion, and sensitizing tumor cells to drug-\n\ninduced apoptosis. Maspin may be a nuclear, cytoplasmic, cell\n\nmembrane-associated, as well as secreted molecule. The multifac-\n\neted biological activities of maspin may be coordinated by its\n\nmolecular partnerships and subcellular localization [45–47]. To\n\nthis end, the Sheng laboratory was the first to report that (i)\n\nsecreted endogenous maspin binds and inhibits single-chain tissue\n\ntype plasminogen activator (sc-tPA, a zymogen) that is bound to\n\nfibrin or fibrinogen [48], (ii) extracellular maspin specifically binds\n\nand inhibits pro-urokinase type plasminogen activator (pro-uPA, a\n\nzymogen) that is associated with cell surface-anchored uPA\n\nreceptor (uPAR) [32] and (iii) intracellular maspin specifically\n\ninteracts and inhibits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) [13]. While\n\nthe specific molecular mode of action of cytoplasmic maspin is\n\nunder investigation in our lab, and earlier report suggested that\n\ncytoplasmic maspin regulates the Rho/Rac signaling network and\n\nblock tumor cell motility [49]. It is likely that endogenous targets of\n\nmaspin may be molecular targets for cancer therapy.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: YW SS JZ SL FF NW QZ YY.\n\nPerformed the experiments: YW JZ SL FF NW QZ YY.
