We hypothesised that the multidrug resistance protein\nMdtM, a recently characterised homologue of MdfA and a member of the major facilitator superfamily, also\nfunctions in alkaline pH homeostasis.\n\nResults: Assays that compared the growth of an E. coli ΔmdtM deletion mutant transformed with a plasmid\nencoding wild-type MdtM or the dysfunctional MdtM D22A mutant at different external alkaline pH values (ranging\nfrom pH 8.5 to 10) revealed a potential contribution by MdtM to alkaline pH tolerance, but only when millimolar\nconcentrations of sodium or potassium was present in the growth medium. Fluorescence-based activity assays\nusing inverted vesicles generated from transformants of antiporter-deficient (ΔnhaA, ΔnhaB, ΔchaA) E. coli TO114\ncells defined MdtM as a low-affinity antiporter that catalysed electrogenic exchange of Na+, K+, Rb+ or Li+ for H+.\nThe K+/H+ antiport reaction had a pH optimum at 9.0, whereas the Na+/H+ exchange activity was optimum at pH\n9.25. Measurement of internal cellular pH confirmed MdtM as contributing to maintenance of a stable cytoplasmic\npH, acid relative to the external pH, under conditions of alkaline stress.\n\nConclusions: Taken together, the results support a role for MdtM in alkaline pH tolerance. MdtM can therefore be\nadded to the currently limited list of antiporters known to function in pH homeostasis in the model organism E. coli.\nBackground\nThe capacity to survive at pH values outside their normal\ngrowth range is a prominent feature of many pathogenic\nbacteria [1]. For example, during their life cycles the\nneutralophilic enterobacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio\ncholerae can be released into alkaline marine and estuarine\nenvironments where they can remain viable and sustain a\nthreat to public health for periods of up to weeks [2,3].\nSuch alkalitolerance requires neutralophilic bacteria to\nmaintain a stable cytoplasmic pH, in the narrow range of\npH 7.4 to 7.8, that is acidic relative to that of the external\nenvironment [4]; to achieve this they employ diverse strat-\negies, all specifically designed to contribute to the mainten-\nance of cytoplasmic proton concentration. These include\n* Correspondence: c.law@qub.ac.uk\nInstitute for Global Food Security, School of Biological Sciences, Medical\nBiology Centre, Queen’s University Belfast, 97 Lisburn Road, Belfast BT9 7BL,\nUK\n\n© 2013 Holdsworth and Law; licensee BioMed\nCreative Commons Attribution License (http:/\ndistribution, and reproduction in any medium\nalterations of cell membrane structure and composition to\nretain protons, remodelling of metabolic patterns to in-\ncrease acid production, and upregulation of expression and\nactivity of transporters that harvest protons [5].

In E. coli alkaline pH homeo-\nstasis is realised by the combined and partially overlapping\nfunctions of at least three such transporters: the paradigm\nNa+/H+ antiporter NhaA [8]; MdfA, a well-characterised\nNa+/(K+)/H+ antiporter that was first identified as a\nmultidrug-resistance transporter [9] belonging to the ubi-\nquitous, large and diverse major facilitator superfamily\n(MFS)[10,11]; and the K+/(Na+)(Ca2+) /H+ antiporter ChaA\n[12]. NhaA is dominant in the alkaline pH range of up to\npH 9, and it confers alkalitolerance to cells only in the\npresence of externally added Na+ [13]. Furthermore, nhaA\ndeletion mutants can only grow at alkaline pH in the ab-\nsence of external Na+ ions [14]. MdfA overexpressed from\na multicopy plasmid extends the alkalitolerance of E. coli\ncells up to pH 10 when Na+ or K+ is added to the external\ngrowth medium, and MdfA can take over from NhaA\nwhen the latter is deleted or dysfunctional [9]. Finally,\nChaA is active at pH values above 8.0 in the presence of\nexternal K+ and it supports alkaline pH homeostasis by\ncoupling the efflux of intracellular K+ to the uptake of pro-\ntons [12]. The role of MdfA in alkaline pH homeostasis is\nof particular interest considering its contribution to\nmultidrug resistance in E. coli [15]. Like MdfA, other\nmultidrug transporters of the MFS are polyspecific with re-\nspect to substrate recognition profile, and they can efflux a\nremarkably diverse range of substrates from bacterial cells\n[16]. Interest in these proteins is further compounded by\nthe recent shift in perception that they function not merely\nas part of a defensive response to drugs, but as vital com-\nponents of other fundamental physiological processes in\nbacteria [17-20]; despite this, a function independent of\nmultidrug efflux has been described for very few of them\n[9,21-23]. Working from this perspective, we hypothesised\nthat multidrug efflux proteins other than MdfA could play\na role in pH homeostasis in E. coli. One candidate is the\n12-transmembrane spanning segment drug/H+ antiporter\nMdtM, a recently characterised member of the MFS that\ncontributes to intrinsic resistance of E. coli to a broad\nspectrum of antimicrobials including ethidium bromide\n(EtBr), chloramphenicol, and several quaternary ammo-\nnium compounds [24,25].\nHere we show through a combination of cell growth\n\nstudies, transport assays using whole cells and inverted ves-\nicles, and measurements of intracellular pH, that MdtM is\nrequired for adaptation of E. coli to alkaline environments\nand that the observed alkalitolerance is due to a monova-\nlent metal cation/H+ antiport activity of MdtM that func-\ntions to maintain a cytoplasm that is acidic relative to the\noutside of the cell; this activity is only apparent at distinct\nalkaline pH values of between pH 9 and pH 10, and in the\npresence of Na+ or K+ ions in the growth medium. As\nsuch, MdtM represents a novel and functionally versatile\nE. coli Na+(K+)/H+ antiporter that functions in alkaline pH\nhomeostasis within a defined basic pH range.\nResults\nE. coli cells devoid of MdtM are sensitive to alkaline pH\nTo investigate a physiological role for MdtM in basic pH\ntolerance we characterised the growth of wild-type and\nΔmdtM single-deletion mutant E. coli BW25113 cells\nunder various alkaline pH conditions in both solid and\nliquid media (Figure 1). On LB-agar plates, both strains\nexhibited similar growth at pH values of 8.5 to 9.25\n(Figure 1A). However, as the pH of the media increased\nbeyond pH 9.25, the growth of ΔmdtM cells was inhibited\ncompared to wild-type cells and only the latter exhibited\ncolony formation at pH 9.5 and pH 9.75. No colonies\nformed at pH 10. The growth assays in liquid media cor-\nroborated the results of the solid media assays and\nhighlighted the deleterious effect of the chromosomal\nmdtM deletion on alkalitolerance under the experimental\nconditions employed (Figure 1B). At pH 8.5, the wild-type\ncells grew slightly better than those of the single-deletion\nmutant. However, as the pH of the medium was increased\nthe effect of the mdtM deletion became more pronounced;\nat pH 9.0 and pH 9.25 the wild-type cells grew relatively\nwell whereas the growth of the deletion mutant was\nsuppressed, and even at pH 9.5 and 9.75 the wild-type cells\nstill grew, albeit to a low density. Strikingly, at the latter pH\nvalues, growth of the deletion mutant was completely\narrested. Neither strain grew at pH 10. Together, these data\nsuggest a role for MdtM in conferral of alkalitolerance to\nE. coli cells within a narrow pH window framed by pH 9\nand pH 10.\nE. coli cells expressing MdtM from multicopy plasmid\ndisplay an alkalitolerant phenotype\nTo further test the role of MdtM in alkalitolerance, we\nassayed growth of ΔmdtM cells expressing MdtM from a\nmulticopy plasmid under control of the non-native araBAD\npromoter under basic pH conditions in solid and liquid\nmedia. The energetic costs of overexpressing the trans-\nporter resulted in differences in the growth characteristics\ndisplayed by cells harbouring plasmidic MdtM compared\nto those harbouring plain vector alone (data not shown).\nTo account for this, ΔmdtM cells that overproduced dys-\nfunctional MdtM from the pD22A plasmid were used as a\ncontrol [24]. As shown in Figure 2A, on solid medium at\npH 8.5, cells that overexpressed the dysfunctional trans-\nporter grew as well as those that overproduced wild-type\nMdtM. However, as the pH of the medium became more\nalkaline, growth of cells that synthesised the D22A mutant\nwas progressively inhibited until, at pH 9.5 and 9.75, only\nthe cells that overproduced functional MdtM were capable\nof colony formation. Both strains failed to grow on solid\nmedium buffered to pH 10. Again, the results of the assays\nperformed on solid medium were corroborated by assays\nperformed in liquid medium (Figure 2B).

Liquid medium buffered to pH\n10 did not support growth of either strain.\nTo provide further confirmation of the contribution of\n\noverproduced MdtM to an alkalitolerant phenotype, and\nto nullify any contribution by chromosomally-encoded\nMdfA in the previously described experiments, a set of\ngrowth assays that used the ΔmdfA BW25113 strain\ncomplemented with pMdtM and the pD22A mutant were\nperformed in liquid medium buffered to pH values of be-\ntween 8.5 and 9.5 (see Additional file 1). As observed in\nthe assays that utilised ΔmdtM cells transformed with\npMdtM and pD22A, there was no difference in the growth\ncharacteristics of ΔmdfA transformants cultured at pH 8.5\n(see Additional file 1; top left panel). However, as the pH\nof the growth medium was made more alkaline the ΔmdfA\npD22A transformants again became increasingly inhibited\nuntil, at pH 9.5, their growth was essentially halted (see\nAdditional file 1; bottom right panel). In contrast, ΔmdfA\ncells that overproduced plasmidic, wild-type MdtM grew at\nall the alkaline pH values tested, thus underlining the ability\nof overexpressed MdtM to compensate for loss of MdfA\nand thereby support an alkalitolerant phenotype of E. coli.\nFinally, to ensure that the observed differences in the\n\ncell growth assays were not due simply to differences in\nthe expression levels of the wild-type and D22A mutant\ntransporter, Western blot analysis of dodecyl-β-D-\nmaltopyranoside (DDM) detergent-solubilized cytoplasmic\nmembranes from each strain grown at different pH values\n\n\n\nO\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.3\npH 9.5\n\npH 9.0\n\n0\n\nTime (h)\n0 5 1510\n\nO\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n\n0.8\n\nA\n\nB\n\npH\n\n-3 -4 -5-3 -4 -5\n\nmdtM/pD22A\nmdtM/pMdtM\n\nO\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n\nTime (h)\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\npH 9.25\n\n0 5 1510\n\npH 9.75\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\nO\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n\nTime (h)\n0 5 1510\n\nTime (h)\n0 5 1510\n\nO\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\npH 8.5\n2.0\n\nTime (h)\n0 5 1510\n\n0 5 1510\n\npH 10.0\n0.1\n\n0\n\nTime (h)\n\nO\nD\n\n6\n0\n\n0\n\n9.0 9.25 9.5 9.75 10.08.5\n\nLog dilution:\n\nC\n\n-3 -4 -5 -3 -4 -5 -3 -4 -5 -3 -4 -5\n\nmdtM/pD22A\n\nmdtM/pMdtM\n\npH 8.5 pH 9.0 pH 9.25\n\nFigure 2 E. coli ΔmdtM cells complemented with wild-type mdtM can grow at alkaline pH.

Notably, at alkaline\npH, cells grown in the presence of the higher concentra-\ntions of K+ (Figure 3B) achieved higher optical density than\nthose grown in the presence of the corresponding con-\ncentrations of Na+ (Figure 3A).

As expected, the addition of 100\nmM NaCl to control cells harbouring pD22A had no no-\nticeable effect on the shape or magnitude of the trace (data\nnot shown). In contrast, addition of Na+ cations to UTL2\ncells transformed with pMdtM clearly inhibited EtBr efflux\n(Figure 5, traces B, C and D). Moreover, this inhibition was\ntitratable; addition of increasing concentrations of Na+\n\nresulted in an increasing inhibition of EtBr efflux. Addition\nof choline chloride had no measurable effect on EtBr efflux\n(data not shown), thereby establishing that the inhibition of\nEtBr efflux by NaCl was due solely to Na+ ions. Together,\nthe results of the whole cell transport assays suggest that\nEtBr and Na+ utilise the same binding site and/or transloca-\ntion pathway in MdtM. Indeed, in the closely related MdtM\nhomolog MdfA, the multidrug and Na+ cation transloca-\ntion pathways overlap [9].\n\nMdtM catalyses K+/H+ and Na+/H+ exchange activities\nThe growth assay and whole cell EtBr efflux data implied\nthat MdtM-catalysed K+/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport activ-\nities underpinned alkalitolerance.

EtBr efflux was monitored continuously by\nmeasuring fluorescence emission at 600 nm upon excitation at 545\nnm. UTL2 cells that expressed the MdtM D22A mutant in the\nabsence of added NaCl were used as a control (E). Cells loaded with\nEtBr were energised by addition of glucose (as indicated by the first\narrow) and efflux of EtBr was monitored for 800 s.

This was expected because the TO114 cells from\nwhich the inverted vesicles were generated are devoid of\nthe major antiporters NhaA, NhaB and ChaA that function\nprimarily in monovalent metal cation/H+ exchange at alka-\nline pH [12,26]. However, at pH 8.5 the controls exhibited\nsome degree of exchange activity; this activity was more\npronounced upon addition of K+ ions and resulted\nin ~30% dequenching of the initial lactate-induced fluores-\ncence quench (Figure 6B, top panel). It is conceivable that\nthis dequenching was due to the activity of other,\nchromosomally-encoded antiporters that operate in the\nsame pH range and that have a greater affinity for K+ than\nNa+ ions. In all control experiments, addition of 100 μM\nCCCP at the time indicated resulted in dissipation of the\nΔpH, as revealed by an instantaneous dequenching of the\nfluorescence signal. This confirmed that the inverted vesi-\ncles had maintained integrity over the lifetime of the assay.\nIn contrast to the controls, addition of Na+ or K+ to\n\ninverted vesicles containing recombinant wild-type MdtM\nresulted in a rapid and significant dequenching of the\nlactate-induced, acridine orange steady state fluorescence\nat all the alkaline pH values tested (Figure 6; black traces),\nthus indicating that MdtM was responsible for catalysing\nboth Na+/H+ and K+/H+ exchange reactions. The magni-\ntude of the dequenching at each pH value, however, varied\ndepending upon the pH and the metal cation added; in\nthe case of added Na+ the most pronounced dequenching\nwas observed at pH 9.25 (Figure 6A; black traces) whereas\nthe maximal K+-induced dequenching occurred at pH 9.0\n(Figure 6B; black traces).

From no detect-\nable activity at pH 6.5, the activity of MdtM in the presence\nof 100 mM Na+ or K+ increased to ~20% dequenching at\nthe pH range of 7.0 to 8.0 (Figure 7A). Between pH 8.0 and\n\n\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 9 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\n9.75, the pH profiles for both exchange activities were es-\nsentially bell-shaped, with the activity optimum for MdtM-\ncatalysed K+/H+ antiport at pH 9.0 and that of Na+/H+\n\nantiport at pH 9.25. The activity of MdtM at each pH\noptimum was similar, attaining a mean corrected fluores-\ncence dequenching of ~ 80%.\n\nApparent affinity of MdtM for transported Na+ and K+ is\nlow\nTo permit a crude assessment of the affinity of MdtM for\nthe transported metal cations, a series of dose–response\nexperiments, covering substrate ranges of 5 mM - 125 mM\nNa+ and K+ (Figures 7B & C), were performed on inverted\nvesicles at the pH optimum of each substrate using the ac-\nridine orange fluorescence quenching /dequenching assay\nas described in the Methods section. Although it was not\npossible to access actual Km values using these assays, they\ndid permit the concentrations of Na+ and K+ required for\nthe half-maximal response to be estimated and the results\nimplied that MdtM has low apparent affinity for monova-\nlent metal cations, with [Na+]1/2 of 38±6 mM (Figure 7B)\nand [K+]1/2 of 32±7 mM (Figure 7C).\n\nMdtM also catalyses Rb+/H+ and Li+/H+ antiport but not\nCa2+/H+ exchange\nBacterial Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiporters that function in\nalkaline pH homeostasis can often also transport cations of\nother metals such as rubidium, lithium and calcium\n[12,27-29]. Therefore, the capacity of inverted vesicles of\nTO114 cells transformed with pMdtM to support the ex-\nchange of Rb+, Li+ and Ca2+ for protons was examined at\npH 9.0 using the acridine orange fluorescence quenching/\ndequenching assay. Not unexpectedly, the addition of 40\nmM Rb2SO4 to the inverted vesicles containing wild-type\nMdtM resulted in ~35% dequenching of the lactate-\ninduced fluorescence quench, indicating that MdtM was\ncapable of catalysing the exchange of the potassium\nanalogue Rb+ for protons (Figure 8A; black trace). A simi-\nlar magnitude of dequenching was observed when 40 mM\nLi2SO4 was added to inverted vesicles (Figure 8B; black\ntrace), confirming that Li+/H+ exchange is also catalysed by\nMdtM. In contrast, the addition of 40 mM CaSO4 to\ninverted vesicles did not elicit a dequenching of the respir-\nation induced fluorescence quenching (Figure 8C; black\ntrace), demonstrating that Ca2+ is not a substrate for\nMdtM under the conditions tested; this assay also con-\nfirmed that the activity observed upon addition of the\nsulphate salts of Rb+ and Li+ to the inverted vesicles was\nnot due to any MdtM-mediated exchange of sulphate an-\nions for protons. Additionally, magnesium sulphate or cho-\nline chloride at final concentrations of 40 mM also failed\nto dequench the fluorescence (data not shown). Control\nassays conducted with inverted vesicles that contained the\ndysfunctional MdtM D22A mutant did not exhibit any\nfluorescence dequenching in response to the addition of\nany of the cations tested (Figure 8; grey traces), thereby\nproviding further robust evidence that the dequenching\nobserved upon the addition of Rb+ and Li+ to vesicles gen-\nerated from TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM was\ndue to a process mediated by the functionally expressed re-\ncombinant transporter.\n\nMdtM-catalysed K+/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport is electrogenic\nGenerally, cation/proton antiporters involved in alkaline\npH homeostasis are required to mediate an electrogenic\nantiport that is energized by the transmembrane electrical\npotential, Δψ [5]. Therefore, to probe whether MdtM catal-\nyses electrogenic antiport, inverted vesicles were generated\nfrom TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM and assayed\nfor electrogenicity in a chloride-free and potassium-free\nbuffer using the Δψ–sensitive fluorophore Oxonol V.\nInverted vesicles produced from TO114 cells transformed\nwith pD22A were used as a negative control. In all the as-\nsays, energization of the vesicles by lactate resulted in a\nrapid quench of Oxonol V fluorescence indicating the gen-\neration of respiratory Δψ (Figure 9). To ensure the suitabil-\nity of the experimental conditions for detection of\nelectrogenic antiport, a positive control (Figure 9F) was\nperformed using inverted vesicles produced from E. coli\nBW25113 cells that contained a full complement of elec-\ntrogenic antiporters. This control experiment was\nperformed at pH 8.5 to specifically enable detection of\nNhaA-catalysed, electrogenic Na+/H+ exchange [30].\nAddition of Na+ to these vesicles caused a rapid partial\ndequenching of the Oxonol V fluorescence, indicating\nelectrogenic antiport. Addition of the protonophore CCCP\nat the time indicated resulted in dissipation of the respira-\ntory Δψ.\nAddition of Na+ (Figure 9A) or K+ (Figure 9C) to\n\ninverted vesicles produced from TO114 cells that\noverexpressed wild-type recombinant MdtM resulted in a\npartial depolarization of Δψ, whereas addition of the same\nmetal cations to negative control vesicles containing dys-\nfunctional MdtM resulted in no detectable depolarization\n(Figures 9B and 9D). In each case, addition of the\nprotonophore CCCP at the times indicated resulted in dis-\nsipation of Δψ. In another control experiment, addition of\nthe ionophore nigericin to TO114/pMdtM vesicles pre-\nincubated in the presence of 50 mM K+ gluconate resulted\nin a small increase in the magnitude of Δψ due to conver-\nsion of ΔpH to Δψ by the electroneutral K+/H+ exchange\nactivity of nigericin (Figure 9E). Addition of valinomycin\nto the same vesicles at the time indicated completely dissi-\npated Δψ.\nTogether, these qualitative data clearly indicate that\n\nMdtM-catalysed Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiport at alkaline\npH is electrogenic, with > 1 H+ exchanged per Na+ or K+;\nquantitative determination of the stoichiometry of antiport\n\n\n\nFigure 7 (See legend on next page.)\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 10 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\n\n\n\n(See figure on previous page.)\nFigure 7 The pH profile and apparent affinity of MdtM for Na+ and K+.

Therefore, to dem-\nonstrate directly a role for MdtM in this process, in vivo\nmeasurements of the intracellular pH of E. coli BW25113\nΔmdtM transformed with pMdtM or pD22A at different\nexternal alkaline pH values between pH 7.5 and pH 9.5\nwere performed in the presence of NaCl using fluorescence\nmeasurements of the free acid of the pH-sensitive probe\n2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein ace-\ntoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM). Calibration of our system\nresulted in a reasonably linear correlation between intracel-\nlular pH and the 490 nm/440 nm fluorescence ratio over a\nrange of pH values from 7.5 to 9.5 (Figure 10A) thereby\nmaking internal cellular pH measurements over this range\namenable. The intracellular pH of cells that overexpressed\nwild-type MdtM from a multicopy plasmid remained rela-\ntively constant (at between pH 7.5 and 8.0) over the range\nof external alkaline pH values tested (Figure 10B; filled\nsymbols). In contrast, cells expressing the dysfunctional\nD22A mutant of the transporter were unable to maintain\na stable cytoplasmic pH, acidic relative to the outside; as\nthe external pH increased there was a concomitant\nalkalinisation of the cell cytoplasm (Figure 10B; empty\nsymbols). These results uphold our contention that MdtM\ncontributes to alkaline pH homeostasis in E. coli.\nDiscussion\nThe chief strategy employed by E. coli to maintain a\nstable cytoplasmic pH under conditions of alkaline chal-\nlenge is that of proton uptake mediated by cytoplasmic\nmembrane cation/H+ antiporters [1]. Until now, only\nfour of this type of antiporter were identified unambigu-\nously to function in alkaline pH homeostasis in E. coli;\nNhaA [32], NhaB [27], MdfA [9] and ChaA [12], and\neach has different value to the cell depending on the ex-\nternal environmental conditions [1,5,6]. The data\npresented here define another integral membrane pro-\ntein, MdtM, a promiscuous multidrug resistance protein\nbelonging to the MFS of secondary active transporters\n[24], as contributing to alkalitolerance in E. coli. MdtM\ncomes into play at a distinct pH range of between 9 and\n10 and provides E. coli with a sensitive mechanism by\nwhich to accommodate proton capture under conditions\nof alkaline stress.\nAnalysis of the growth phenotype of the E. coli ΔmdtM\n\ndeletion mutant revealed a potential physiological role for\nMdtM in pH homeostasis (Figures 1 and 2). Under the ex-\nperimental conditions employed, MdtM was required for\nthe growth of E. coli in rich medium at alkaline pH values\nof >9.0 and <10.0, but only when tens of millimolar con-\ncentrations of sodium or potassium ions were present in\nthe growth medium (Figure 3). Similar monovalent metal\ncation-dependent, alkalitolerance functions have been de-\nscribed for the Bacillus subtilis tetracycline efflux protein\nTetL [33] and the E. coli multidrug transporter MdfA [9].\nMdfA – the best-characterised multidrug transporter of\nthe MFS [34] - is a close homologue of MdtM (41% se-\nquence identity and 62% similarity)[35] that is reported to\nplay a major role in conferral of alkalitolerance in E. coli at\npH >9.0, and when potassium is the main monovalent\nmetal cation; conditions under which the major Na+/H+\n\nantiporter NhaA does not operate [9].\nThe conditions of external pH and cation composition\n\nunder which MdtM operates are very similar to, and ap-\nparently overlap to an extent with those favoured by MdfA.\nDespite this apparent overlap in functionality, studies by\nLewinson et al. [9] that investigated the effect of chromo-\nsomal deletion of mdfA on growth of the E. coli UT5600\nstrain showed that cells devoid of MdfA could not grow at\nalkaline pH values > 9.0. This seemingly indicates that\nchromosomal mdtM cannot substitute formdfA to support\ngrowth at alkaline pH. Concomitantly, in our growth ex-\nperiments (Figures 1 and 2), the chromosomal mdfA gene\nwas ostensibly incapable of supporting growth of the\nBW25113 ΔmdtM strain at the alkaline pH values tested.\nThese observations raise the question as to why mdfA and\nmdtM did not compensate for one another at alkaline pH.\nThis can be rationalised if one considers the multidrug ef-\nflux capabilities of these particular transporters; under the\nexperimental conditions employed by our study the\nBW25113 ΔmdtM strain was grown in the presence of the\nantibiotic kanamycin, a known substrate of MdfA [15], and\nat the concentration (~60 μM) of kanamycin used for se-\nlection of the ΔmdtM strain the copies of chromosomally-\n\n\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 12 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\nencoded MdfA may be saturated by the antibiotic and in-\ncapable of mediating the low-affinity Na+(K+)/H+ exchange\nnecessary for the protein to contribute to pH homeostasis.\nIndeed, in a previous study that also used E. coli strains\nthat required kanamycin for selection [9], this may be why\nMdfA was required to be overproduced from a multicopy\nplasmid to demonstrate its role in pH homeostasis at alka-\nline pH values >9.0. If MdtM also recognises kanamycin\nas a substrate, this could account for why copies of\nchromosomally-encoded MdtM were unable to compen-\nsate for the deletion of mdfA in the cell growth assays\ndescribed in [9]. Alternatively, the apparent lack of substi-\ntution by the transporters could be explained simply by\ndifferences between the bacterial strains used, and/or the\nexperimental conditions employed by each study. If the\nlatter is true, it suggests that each transporter is beneficial\nto the cell under subtly different environmental condi-\ntions. Whatever the explanation, our results remain con-\nsistent with a role for MdtM in alkaline pH homeostasis\nin E. coli.\nIn our growth experiments, the requirement for sodium\n\nor potassium ions for MdtM-mediated alkalitolerance sug-\ngests a mechanistic role for Na+ and K+ ions in MdtM ac-\ntivity and this was confirmed by fluorescence-based activity\nassays performed at alkaline pH values (Figure 6). These\nassays showed that MdtM catalysed a Na+(K+)/H+ antiport\nthat, in vivo, probably enables the exchange of internal\nmonovalent metal cations for extracellular protons to\nmaintain a stable internal pH, acid relative to outside, dur-\ning exposure to alkaline environments. This conclusion\nwas supported by our experiments that used BCECF fluor-\nometry to measure cytoplasmic pH under different exter-\nnal alkaline pH conditions (Figure 10).\nThe ability of MdtM to exchange either Na+ or K+ cat-\n\nions for protons endows E. coli with the flexibility to re-\nspond effectively to changes in chemical composition of\nthe environment at alkaline pH. When sodium is avail-\nable, the Na+/H+ antiport activity of MdtM can permit\ngrowth. Under sodium-poor conditions, or when other\nNa+/H+ antiporters are disrupted, regulation of cytoplas-\nmic pH by K+/H+ antiport activity of MdtM can contrib-\nute to alkaline pH homeostasis. Although the\ncontribution of K+ concentration to pH homeostasis in\nE. coli is still unclear [6,36], the K+/H+ antiport activity\nof MdtM may offer a mechanism for regulating cytoplas-\nmic pH by utilising the outwardly-directed K+ gradient\nto drive proton capture during growth at alkaline pH\n[5,37]. Provided the rate of MdtM is slower than that of\nthe systems that generate the PMF, and of the uptake\nsystems that bring K+ into the cell, MdtM will not act as\nan uncoupler to dissipate the PMF. Furthermore, in al-\nkaline environments, the same K+/H+ antiport activity of\nMdtM has the potential to protect E. coli from the toxic\neffects of high intracellular concentrations of K+ and,\ntherefore, to function also in K+ homeostasis. Just such a\nfunction was identified previously for the E. coli ChaA\nantiporter [12]. Additionally, and in contrast to MdfA,\nMdtM is capable of transporting lithium ions at alkaline\npH (Figure 8B) and it may function physiologically in al-\nkaline pH homeostasis when Li+ is present. This high-\nlights further the subtle differences in function that exist\nbetween the closely-related MdfA and MdtM trans-\nporters, and that lessons learned from one cannot simply\nbe imposed upon the other.\nAs control of internal pH is, by definition, control of\n\ncytoplasmic proton concentration, the requirements of\nbacterial pH homeostasis dictate the relative magnitudes\nof the transmembrane proton gradient (ΔpH) and trans-\nmembrane electrical potential (Δψ), the two individual\ncomponents that constitute the PMF. Under alkaline pH\nstress conditions, maintenance of a stable intracellular\npH requires that a net cytoplasmic accumulation of pro-\ntons must occur; therefore, the ΔpH of neutralophiles\nlike E. coli is reversed from the usual orientation of alka-\nline inside [5] and cannot apparently be used to drive\nproton uptake into the cell. This is a particular problem\nwhen Na+/H+ antiporters are used for alkaline pH\nhomeostasis because, due to the cytotoxicity of Na+ [5]\nit is excluded from the cell and, unlike K+, cannot pro-\nvide an outwardly-directed driving force to support an\nelectroneutral exchange. To overcome this, antiporters\nsuch as E. coli NhaA [31] and B. subtilis TetL [38], util-\nise Δψ to catalyse electrogenic Na+/H+ exchange and\ndrive net accumulation of H+ to acidify the cytoplasm at\nalkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Intriguingly, the\nMdtM homologue MdfA can catalyse both electrogenic\nand electroneutral transport of drug substrates [39];\nhowever, the component of the PMF that MdfA utilises\nto drive Na+/H+ or K+/H+ antiport at alkaline pH has\nnot been reported, although it too is likely to be the Δψ.\nThe results of our fluorescence experiments using the\nΔψ–sensitive probe Oxonol V revealed that MdtM can\nutilise Δψ as the driving force at alkaline pH to catalyse\nan electrogenic Na+(K+)/H+ antiport, i.e., an exchange\nstoichiometry of >1 H+ per monovalent metal cation\n(Figure 9).\nFurther evidence to support a physiological role for\n\nMdtM in alkaline pH homeostasis was gleaned from esti-\nmation of the concentrations of Na+ and K+ required to\nelicit the half-maximal fluorescence dequench of acridine\norange in inverted vesicles (Figure 7). Other transporters\nthat function in bacterial pH homeostasis, such as E. coli\nNhaB [40], ChaA [12] and MdfA [9], and a sodium-specific\nNa+/H+ antiporter from Vibrio parahaemolyticus [41], all\npossess affinity for their respective metal ion substrate(s)\nin the general millimolar range.

Exchange was determined by the fluorescence\ndequenching of acridine orange in inverted vesicles derived from\nantiporter-deficient E. coli TO114 cells that overexpressed\nrecombinant wild-type MdtM (black traces) or the dysfunctional\nMdtM D22A mutant (grey traces). A ΔpH across the vesicle\nmembrane was established by addition of lactate as indicated and\nonce the fluorescence quench of acridine orange achieved a steady\nstate, 40 mM Rb2SO4 (A), 40 mM Li2SO4 (B) or 40 mM CaSO4 (C) was\nadded to the vesicles. Addition of 100 μM CCCP abolished the ΔpH.\nThe fluorescence intensity of each measurement is represented as a\npercentage of the initial acridine orange fluorescence signal prior to\naddition of lactate. The fluorescence measurements were conducted\nat pH 9.0 and the traces shown are representative of experiments\nperformed in triplicate on at least two separate preparations of\ninverted vesicles.\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 13 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\nsuggest MdtM also possesses relatively low affinity for its\ncognate metal cations and are therefore consistent with a\ncontributory role for the Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiporter\nactivities of MdtM in alkaline pH homeostasis.\nIn order to function effectively in pH homeostasis,\n\nantiporters must be equipped with sensors of the external\nand/or cytoplasmic pH that can transduce the changes in\npH into changes in transporter activity [5]. The pH profile\nof MdtM activity (Figure 7A) suggests that, like other\nantiporters involved in pH homeostasis, it too is capable of\nsensing and responding to changes in ionic composition,\nand provides additional support for our contention that\nthe different antiport functions performed by MdtM are\ndictated by subtle changes in pH and the type of cation\npresent in the external environment. In our experiments,\nbecause MdtM expression from a multicopy plasmid was\nplaced under control of a non-native arabinose-inducible\npromoter, this suggests an ability to sense pH at the protein\nlevel. This could be achieved simply by changes in the\nprotonation state(s) of amino acid side chains in the pro-\ntein. Topology prediction studies [24] of MdtM indicated\nseveral ionisable residues, located on the periplasmic and\ncytoplasmic surfaces of the protein as well as in the puta-\ntive translocation pore, that could conceivably play a role\nin pH sensing.\nUse of the MdtM D22A mutant as a control in transport\n\nassays with inverted vesicles precluded the necessity to re-\nconstitute the transporter into proteoliposomes to study its\nrole in pH homeostasis. The observation that the D22A\nmutant was dysfunctional in all our assays also sheds more\nlight on the mechanistic role of D22 in MdtM function.\nPrevious work showed that even though the mutant protein\ncould bind either cationic or neutral antimicrobial sub-\nstrates, it could not translocate them across the membrane\n[24,25]. It was postulated therefore that the negatively\ncharged side chain of D22 probably functions in proton\nrecognition and may form part of a proton relay network in\nMdtM [24]. Several other acidic residues (D30, D244, D277\nand E280) are embedded in putative membrane-spanning\n\n\n\nA B\n\nC\n\nE F\n\nD\n\nFigure 9 The electrogenicity of MdtM-catalysed Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiport. The electrogenicity of MdtM-catalysed Na+/H+ and K+/H+\n\nantiport at alkaline pH was probed by Oxonol V fluorometry of inverted vesicles generated from E. coli TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM\n(A, C & E) or, as a negative control, pD22A (B & D). Inverted vesicles isolated from BW25113 cells were used as a positive control (F). Respiration-\ndependent formation of Δψ was initiated by addition of lactate at the time indicated. Once steady-state Δψ was achieved, antiport was initiated\nby addition of 100 mM Na+ gluconate (A & B) or 100 mM K+ gluconate (C & D) as indicated. Vesicles were depolarised by addition of CCCP or\nvalinomycin in the presence of K+ as indicated. Fluorescence measurements on TO114 inverted vesicles were conducted at either pH 9.0 (for\ndetection of K+/H+ antiport; panels C & D) or pH 9.25 (for detection of Na+/H+ antiport; panels A & B), whereas positive control measurements\nusing vesicles derived from BW25113 cells were done at pH 8.5 to ensure detection of the activity of the electrogenic antiporter, NhaA (panel F).\nThe Oxonol V fluorescence is presented as a percentage of the initial fluorescence prior to establishment of the steady-state Δψ. The traces\nshown are representative of experiments performed in triplicate on two separate preparations of inverted vesicles.\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 14 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\nregions of MdtM [24], and these too could potentially con-\ntribute to formation of the proton relay. Disruption of this\nnetwork of negatively-charged residues could be sufficient\nto abrogate the cation/H+ antiport activity of the trans-\nporter.

[43] proposed that\nthe carboxylic groups of the MdfA E26 (the residue hom-\nologous to MdtM D22) and D34 residues are important\nfor proton transport and/or antiport coupling. It is con-\nceivable therefore that MdtM could employ a mechanistic\nstrategy in which H+ binding to D22 is a prerequisite for (i)\nthe transport of Na+ or K+ to support its role in alkaline\npH homeostasis; and (ii) the transport of drug substrates to\nsupport its role in multidrug resistance. A linkage between\nalkalitolerance and multidrug efflux functions has been\nnoted before for MdfA and TetL [9,44], and the results of\nour whole cell EtBr efflux assays (Figure 5) suggest the\nsame linkage exists in MdtM.\n\nConclusions\nThe work presented here underlines the astonishing versa-\ntility of multidrug resistance proteins of the MFS and pro-\nvides additional evidence that the multidrug efflux activity\nof these transporters is probably a co-opted adaptation of\ntheir original physiological function(s), thereby offering an\nexplanation as to why these proteins persist in bacterial ge-\nnomes in the absence of a selective pressure from drugs.\nClose homologues of MdtM are present in many patho-\ngenic bacterial species [24] and we contend that, in all\nlikelihood, those homologues also play a role in pH\nhomeostasis via a monovalent metal cation/H+ antiport\nmechanism. Furthermore, we postulate that yet other MFS\nmultidrug transporters contribute to pH homeostasis in\nE. coli and that an approach similar to the one employed\nhere may be used to unmask them.\n\nMethods\nAll growth media, antibiotics and chemicals were pur-\nchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK) unless\nstated otherwise.\n\nBacterial strains and plasmids\nE. coli BW25113 [45] and its ΔmdtM and ΔmdfA dele-\ntion mutants [46] were obtained from the Keio collection\n(National BioResource Project, Japan) and used for growth\nassays. The ΔmdtM and ΔmdfA deletion mutants were\nused as the background strains for testing alkalitolerance\nof cells expressing wild-type mdtM (pMdtM) or dysfunc-\ntional MdtM D22A (pD22A) mutant from pBAD/Myc-His\nA vector (Invitrogen). Construction of these plasmids was\ndescribed before [24]. The outer membrane permeability\nmutant E. coli UTL2 [47] was used for whole cell EtBr\nefflux assays. E. coli TO114 [26], a strain deficient in the\nNa+/H+ antiporters NhaA and NhaB, and the K+/H+\n\nantiporter ChaA, was complemented with pMdtM or\npD22A and used for production of inverted vesicles for\nuse in transport assays.\n\nBacterial growth assays on solid medium\nCultures from single bacterial colonies were grown at\n37°C to an OD600 of 1.0 in liquid Luria Bertani (LB)\nmedium alone (for wild-type E. coli BW25113), or LB\nmedia supplemented with either 30 μg/ml kanamycin\n(for selection of the chromosomal mdtM-deletion strain),\nor 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin\n(Carbenicillin Direct, UK) (for the ΔmdtM BW25113 strain\nharboring pMdtM or pD22A). Aliquots (4 μl) from a 10-3\n\nto 10-5 logarithmic dilution series of each culture were spot-\nted onto plates layered with LB-agar (1% w/v tryptone,\n0.5% w/v yeast extract, 1% w/v NaCl and 1.5% w/v agar).\nFor assays performed with pMdtM and pD22A\ntransformants the LB-agar was supplemented with the\nappropriate antibiotics and L-arabinose was added to a final\nconcentration of 0.002% (w/v) to induce expression of\nthe recombinant protein. For all the plate assays, pH\nof the medium was buffered by 70 mM 1,3-bis[tris\n(hydroxymethyl)-methylamino] propane (BTP) and pH was\nadjusted by HCl. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37°C\nprior to imaging.\n\nBacterial growth assays in liquid medium\nA swab of colonies from overnight LB agar plates was used\nto inoculate 2 ml of LB broth containing the appropriate\n\n\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 16 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\nantibiotic(s) and, where appropriate, 0.002% (w/v) L-\narabinose, and grown for 2 h with shaking at 37°C. Cul-\ntures were then diluted to an OD600 of 0.02 into 50 ml of\nfresh LB medium containing the appropriate antibiotic(s)\nand L-arabinose (0.002% w/v). Media were buffered by 70\nmM BTP and pH was adjusted with HCl. Cells were then\ngrown aerobically at 37°C with shaking and the OD600\nmeasured every hour for 15 hours.\nAssays designed to test the effects of Na+ or K+ ions at\n\nalkaline pH on the growth of BW25113 ΔmdtM cells\ntransformed with pMdtM were performed in salt-free LB\nmedium (1% w/v tryptone, 0.5% w/v yeast extract) buffered\nto the indicated pH with 70 mM BTP. It should be noted\nthat although this medium is described as salt-free, residual\namounts of Na+ and K+ ions are likely to be present\n[12,26]. Cells from the 2 ml cultures that were grown for 2\nh were subsequently washed three times in the salt-free\nmedium prior to being diluted into 50 ml of fresh salt-free\nmedium containing 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 100 μg/ml\ncarbenicillin, and 0.002% (w/v) L-arabinose. The media\ncontained either no additional NaCl or KCl, or were\nsupplemented with 20 mM, 40 mM or 86 mM NaCl or\nKCl. Cells were grown at 37°C with shaking and the OD600\nmeasured every hour for 15 hours.\nSodium gluconate or potassium gluconate replaced NaCl\n\nor KCl, respectively, for assays designed to test for Cl- ion\ndependence of alkalitolerance. Choline chloride or sucrose\nreplaced the chloride salts of sodium and potassium to test\nfor any potential osmoregulatory role for MdtM at alkaline\npH. The assays were performed as described above in salt-\nfree medium buffered to pH 9.5 with 70 mM BTP. For all\nassays performed in liquid medium, the pH of the cultures\nwas measured every 5 h using a sterile glass electrode to\nmonitor for acidification.\nWhole cell EtBr efflux assays\nThese assays were performed on outer membrane perme-\nability mutant E. coli UTL2 cells transformed with pMdtM\nas described previously [24], except that 20, 50 and 100\nmM NaCl was added to the loading buffer and the reac-\ntion mixture to examine the effect of Na+ ions on MdtM-\nmediated EtBr efflux activity. To ensure that Cl- anions\nwere not responsible for inhibition of EtBr efflux, 100 mM\ncholine chloride replaced NaCl in the loading buffer and\nthe reaction mixture. As a negative control, the EtBr efflux\nactivity of UTL2 cells transformed with pD22A was\nmeasured.\nMeasurement of transmembrane ΔpH\nAssays of K+/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport were based on those\ndescribed in [48] and were conducted by measuring the\nfluorescence quenching /dequenching of the pH-sensitive\nindicator acridine orange upon addition of the test\ncations to energized inverted membrane vesicles gener-\nated from antiporter-deficient E. coli TO114 cells that\noverproduced recombinant wild-type MdtM. Control\nexperiments were performed on inverted vesicles gener-\nated from TO114 cells that overproduced dysfunctional\nMdtM from pD22A.\nCells were grown and inverted vesicles were generated\n\nusing the protocols described in [25]. The total membrane\nprotein concentration of the vesicles was determined using\nthe bicinchoninic acid assay (Thermo Scientific Pierce,\nRockford, IL) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nTransport measurements were performed at the indicated\npH values (ranging between pH 6.5 to 9.75) at 25°C using a\nFluoromax-4 fluorometer (Horiba UK Ltd, Middlesex, UK).\nInverted vesicles were excited at 492 nm and the fluores-\ncence emission recorded at 525 nm. The excitation and\nemission slit widths were set to 1.5 nm and 2.5 nm, respect-\nively. Inverted membrane vesicles were added to reaction\nbuffer (10 mM BTP adjusted to the indicated pH with HCl,\n5 mM MgSO4 and 1 μM acridine orange) in a quartz cu-\nvette to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml membrane pro-\ntein in a total volume of 1.5 ml. For each assay, the inverted\nvesicle mixture was allowed to equilibrate for ~300 s prior\nto recording of the fluorescence signal. To initiate\nrespiration-dependent generation of ΔpH (acid inside), a\nfinal concentration of 2 mM Tris-D-L-lactate, made up in\nreaction buffer at the desired pH, was added to the reaction\nmixture at the time indicated. Once a stable ΔpH was\nestablished, and the fluorescence quench of acridine orange\nreached steady state (usually after ~200 s), sodium gluco-\nnate or potassium gluconate at a final concentration of 100\nmM was added to assess the ability of external K+ and Na+\n\nto act as substrates for antiport with internal H+. Gluconate\nrather than chloride salts of the metal cations were used to\navoid any potential interference with the assay by Cl- ions\n[49]. The fluorescence dequenching upon addition of Na+\n\nor K+ (due to dissipation of the established ΔpH as a\nresult of MdtM-mediated metal cation/H+ antiport activity)\nwas monitored for an additional 60 s prior to the addition\nof 100 μM of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide 3-\nchlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) to completely dissipate\nthe ΔpH and abolish transport. All experiments were\nperformed in triplicate on at least two separate preparations\nof inverted vesicles.\nThe results of the transport assays were used to\n\nconstruct a pH profile of transport activity as described in\n[42]. Briefly, MdtM-mediated Na+/H+ and K+/H+ antiport\nactivity at every pH value tested was calculated as the per-\ncent dequenching of the acridine orange fluorescence rela-\ntive to the initial respiration-dependent quench. The\ncalculated activities were corrected for nonspecific back-\nground activity by subtraction of the dequenching mea-\nsured in the comparative controls.\n\n\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 17 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\nAssessment of the apparent affinity of MdtM for Na+ and\nK+ cations\nThe affinity of MdtM for transported Na+ and K+ ions was\nestimated by measuring the concentration of each ion that\nwas required to elicit the half-maximal, steady-state\npercent dequenching of acridine orange fluorescence in\ninverted vesicles derived from TO114 cells transformed\nwith pMdtM. The fluorescence dequench response was\ninitiated by addition of varying concentrations (from 5\nmM to 125 mM) of cation to the inverted vesicles as de-\nscribed before [42,50-52]. Fluorescence-based assays of\nthe Na+/H+ and K+/H+ activity of MdtM in E. coli TO114\ninverted vesicles were conducted over a range of concen-\ntrations of added Na+ gluconate or K+ gluconate. The as-\nsays were performed at 25°C at the previously determined\npH optimum for each antiport reaction (pH 9.25 and pH\n9.0 for Na+/H+ and K+/H+, respectively); the activity ob-\nserved in inverted vesicles from the pD22A control\ntransformant was subtracted from the recombinant wild-\ntype MdtM activity at each substrate concentration to ob-\ntain the values shown. The [Na+]1/2 and [K\n\n+]1/2 values\nwere determined from nonlinear regression analysis of the\ndata using SigmaPlot 10 (Systat, Richmond, CA).\n\nMeasurement of transmembrane Δψ\nThe Δψ-sensitive fluorophore Oxonol V [bis-(3-phenyl-5-\noxoisoxazol-4-yl)pentamethine oxonol] (Cambridge Bio-\nscience Ltd, Cambridge, UK) was used to determine if the\nMdtM-mediated antiport observed in the previous experi-\nments was electrogenic. Inverted vesicles were produced\nfrom TO114 cells transformed with pMdtM or pD22A as\ndescribed previously [25], except that the vesicle resuspen-\nsion buffer was made Cl--free by substitution of the 140\nmM choline chloride component with 280 mM sorbitol\n[42] and by using H2SO4 rather than HCl to adjust buffer\npH. Inverted vesicles produced from E. coli BW25113 cells\nthat retained the full complement of electrogenic Na+/H+\n\nantiporters provided a positive control. Vesicles (500 μg/ml\nmembrane protein) were added to assay buffer (10 mM\nBTP, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 μM Oxonol V) that had its pH ad-\njusted to 9.0 (for detection of electrogenic K+/H+ antiport)\nor 9.25 (for detection of electrogenic Na+/H+ antiport).\nThe pH of the assay buffer used for positive control\nBW25113 vesicles was adjusted to 8.5 to ensure detection\nof electrogenic NhaA-catalysed Na+/H+ antiport activity\n[30]. All vesicles were incubated on ice for 200 s prior to\naddition of 2 mM Tris-D-L-lactate to initiate respiration-\ndependent generation of Δψ, and the resultant quenching\nof Oxonol V fluorescence was monitored at 25°C using a\nFluoromax-4 fluorometer with an excitation wavelength of\n599 nm and emission wavelength of 634 nm. Excitation\nand emission slit widths were set to 10 nm and 20 nm, re-\nspectively. Electrogenic antiport activity was estimated on\nthe basis of its ability to dissipate the established Δψ\n(recorded as a dequenching of the fluorescence signal) in\nresponse to addition of 100 mM Na+ gluconate or K+\n\ngluconate to vesicles at the times indicated. Addition of\n100 μM CCCP was used to abolish both Δψ and ΔpH com-\nponents of the PMF. As a further control, 1 μM of the\nionophore nigericin (which at low concentrations select-\nively consumes ΔpH in the presence of K+ via\nelectroneutral K+/H+ exchange)[5] was added to vesicles of\nTO114 cells transformed with pMdtM. These vesicles were\nincubated in assay buffer that contained 50 mM K+ gluco-\nnate, and valinomycin (5 μM) was added to selectively\nabolish Δψ.\n\nMeasurement of cytoplasmic pH\nThe intracellular pH of E. coli whole-cell suspensions at\nvarious external alkaline pH values was determined\nby ratiometric fluorescence measurements of the\nacetoxymethyl ester derivative of the membrane-permeant,\npH-sensitive fluorescent probe, 2,7-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-\ncarboxyfluorescein (BCECF-AM; Life Technologies Ltd,\nPaisley, UK) [53]. Intracellular pH was correlated to fluor-\nescence signal by recording the fluorescence emission\nintensity of BCECF at 530 nm upon excitation at 490 nm\n(the BCECF pH-dependent excitation wavelength) and at\n440 nm (the BCECF pH-independent excitation wave-\nlength). Calculation of the ratio intensities at the two\nexcitation wavelengths permitted intracellular pH mea-\nsurements that were independent of intensity losses due\nto changes in the absorption profile of the probe and/or\nphotobleaching.\nCalibration of the system was performed on suspensions\n\nof E. coli ΔmdtM BW25113 cells. Cultures from single bac-\nterial colonies were grown aerobically at 30°C to an OD600\nof 3.0 in LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamy-\ncin. Cultures were then diluted 125-fold into 100 ml of\nfresh LB medium containing antibiotic and grown aerobic-\nally at 37°C to an OD600 of 1.0. Six 10 ml aliquots of cells\nwere pelleted by centrifugation (3000 × g) at 4°C and\nwashed twice in assay buffer (140 mM NaCl, 10 mM\nHEPES and 1 mM MgCl2) that had pH adjusted with KOH\nto 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.25 or 9.5. To load the cells with fluor-\nescent probe, the washed cells were pelleted and then\nresuspended to OD600 of 2.0 in assay buffer that contained\n2.5 μM BCECF-AM. To equalize internal and external pH,\n10 μM of the protonophore CCCP was added to the buffer\nand the cells were incubated in the dark at 37°C for 1 h.\nBCECF-AM-loaded cells were collected by centrifugation\nand stored on ice until use. For each pH value investigated,\n200 μl of loaded cells were added to 1.3 ml of assay buffer\nthat contained 10 μM CCCP. After incubation at 30°C for\n60 s, the fluorescence intensity of the mixture at 530 nm\nupon excitation at 490 nm and 440 nm was recorded under\ncontinuous stirring using a Fluoromax-4 fluorometer with\nexcitation and emission slit widths set to 1.0 nm and\n\n\n\nHoldsworth and Law BMC Microbiology 2013, 13:113 Page 18 of 19\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/13/113\n10 nm, respectively. Experiments were performed in tripli-\ncate for each pH value investigated and used to construct a\ncalibration plot that correlated the 490 nm/440 nm fluores-\ncence emission ratio to pH.\nTo determine if MdtM functioned in maintenance of a\n\nstable intracellular pH under conditions of alkaline\nstress, fluorescence measurements were performed on\npMdtM and pD22A transformants of E. coli ΔmdtM\nBW25113 cells at six different external alkaline pH\nvalues using the method described above except that\ncarbenicillin (100 μg/ml) and L–arabinose (0.002% w/v)\nwas added to the growth medium, CCCP was omitted\nfrom the assay buffer, and D-glucose (1 mM) was added\nto the assay buffer to energise the cells 60 s prior to re-\ncording the fluorescence.\n\nWestern blot analysis of recombinant MdtM\nEstimation of expression levels of recombinant wild-type\nand D22A mutant MdtM by transformed ΔmdtM\nBW25113 cells grown at different alkaline pH values was\nperformed as described in [25].\n\nAdditional file\n\nAdditional file 1: PDF file showing that E. coli ΔmdfA cells\ncomplemented with plasmidic wild-type mdtM can grow at alkaline\npH.

are sensitive to alkaline pH\n\tE. coli cells expressing MdtM from multicopy plasmid display an alkalitolerant phenotype\n\tNa+ or K+ cations are required for MdtM-mediated alkaline pH tolerance\n\tMdtM catalyses K+/H+ and Na+/H+ exchange activities\n\tpH profiles of MdtM-catalysed K+/H+ and Na+/H+ exchange activities\n\tApparent affinity of MdtM for transported Na+ and K+ is low\n\tMdtM also catalyses Rb+/H+ and Li+/H+ antiport but not Ca2+/H+ exchange\n\tMdtM-catalysed K+/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport is electrogenic\n\tIn alkaline environments, MdtM functions to maintain a cytoplasmic pH that is acidic relative to external pH\n\n\tDiscussion\n\tConclusions\n\tMethods\n\tBacterial strains and plasmids\n\tBacterial growth assays on solid medium\n\tBacterial growth assays
