The VgrG protein, a\ncore component and effector of T6SS, has been demonstrated to perform diverse functions. The N-terminal domain of\nVgrG protein is a homologue of tail fiber protein gp27 of phage T4, which performs a receptor binding function and deter-\nmines the host specificity. Based on sequence analysis, we found that two putative T6SS loci exist in the genome of the\navian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strain TW-XM. To assess the contribution of these two T6SSs to TW-XM pathogene-\nsis, the crucial clpV clusters of these two T6SS loci and their vgrG genes were deleted to generate a series of mutants. Conse-\nquently, T6SS1-associated mutants presented diminished adherence to and invasion of several host cell lines cultured in vitro,\ndecreased pathogenicity in duck and mouse infection models in vivo, and decreased biofilm formation and bacterial competitive\nadvantage. In contrast, T6SS2-associated mutants presented a significant decrease only in the adherence to and invasion of\nmouse brain microvascular endothelial cell (BMEC) line bEnd.3 and brain tissue of the duck infection model. These results sug-\ngested that T6SS1 was involved in the proliferation of APEC in systemic infection, whereas VgrG-T6SS2 was responsible only for\ncerebral infection. Further study demonstrated that VgrG-T6SS2 was able to bind to the surface of bEnd.3 cells, whereas it did\nnot bind to DF-1 (chicken embryo fibroblast) cells, which further proved the interaction of VgrG-T6SS2 with the surface of\nBMECs.\n\nExtraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) is a groupof strains that have been implicated in manifold infections in\nhumans and animals, including urinary tract infections, newborn\nmeningitis, abdominal sepsis, and septicemia (1). Avian patho-\ngenic Escherichia coli (APEC), an important ExPEC subgroup,\ncauses respiratory or systemic infections and large financial losses\nin the poultry industry worldwide (2). APEC shares important\nvirulence traits with uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), neonatal men-\ningitis Escherichia coli (NMEC), and septicemia-associated E. coli\n(SEPEC), representing a potential zoonotic risk (3–5). Recently, it\nhas been confirmed that some closely related clones of APEC and\nNMEC were able to cause extraintestinal infections in both\nchicken and rat models of human neonatal meningitis, suggesting\nthat there is no host specificity for these clonal types of isolates\n(6, 7).\n\nToday, one important but overlooked bacterial virulence trait\nis the delivery of proteins and toxins to host cells through special-\nized secretion systems (8–10). The type VI secretion system\n(T6SS) has been described for several bacterial species (8, 11, 12),\nincluding APEC (13, 14), and represents a new paradigm of pro-\ntein secretion (11). de Pace et al. (14) found that the mutants of\nT6SS core genes (clpV and hcp) of APEC strain SEPT362 displayed\ndecreased adherence and actin rearrangement on epithelial cells.\nA similar result was revealed by research on the Hcp mutant of the\nneonatal meningitis E. coli (NMEC) strain RS218 (15). However,\nthe means by which T6SSs contribute to virulence remain un-\nknown, and the mechanisms warrant further investigation.\n\nThe minimal machinery necessary for the functionality of\nT6SSs has been revealed, and it is assembled by at least 13 core\nproteins called “core components” (10, 16). Two T6SS-associated\neffectors, hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) and valine-gly-\ncine repeat G (VgrG), function as exported chaperones of effectors\n(12, 17) and have similar structures of the (gp27)3-(gp5)3 spike\ncomplex (18, 19). The tail fiber protein can bind to the receptor of\n\nsensitive bacteria specifically, which confers on bacteriophage a\nhigh degree of host specificity, and this mechanism may also be\napplied to the host cell recognition of the gp27 domain of VgrG\n(20, 21). Some VgrG proteins have different C-terminal exten-\nsions, including certain domains with different activities. For ex-\nample, VgrG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa carries a zinc-metal-\nloprotease domain, while VgrG1 from Vibrio cholerae contains\nrepeats in structural toxin A (RtxA) (22).\n\nIn this study, the results indicated that the two functional\nT6SSs are encoded in the genome of meningitis-causing APEC K1\nstrain TW-XM. T6SS1 is required for interaction with eukaryotic\nas well as prokaryotic host cells and not only is involved in the\npathogenesis of APEC systemic infection but also contributes to\nbiofilm formation and bacterial competition. However, T6SS2 is\nresponsible only for cerebral infection. The comprehensive anal-\nysis revealed that T6SS1 and T6SS2 of APEC may function in\ndifferent pathogenic pathways.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains and growth conditions.

All strains (Table 1) were grown\naerobically in LB medium or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium\n(DMEM) (Invitrogen) at 37°C. When necessary, antibiotics were added at\nthe following concentrations: 100 �g/ml ampicillin, 30 �g/ml chloram-\nphenicol, and 50 �g/ml kanamycin (Km).\n\nAnimals. Seven-day-old ducks, 5-week-old male ICR mice, and New\nZealand White rabbits were purchased from the Comparative Medicine\nCenter of Yangzhou University and housed in filter-top cages with free\naccess to food and water under a 12-hour/12-hour light/dark cycle in\naccordance with the guidelines of Beijing Laboratory Animal Welfare and\nEthics. All animal experiments were approved by the Department of Sci-\nence and Technology of Jiangsu Province. The license number was SYXK\n(SU) 2010-0005.\n\nPurification of recombinant protein and preparation of polyclonal\nantibody. A total of four genes were cloned in frame into the pET28a\nvector; the protein expression and purification were carried out as de-\nscribed previously (23). The supernatant of lysate was purified by a His-\nTrap FF column (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) ac-\ncording to the manufacturer’s instructions. The New Zealand White\nrabbits were used for producing polyclonal antibody (anti-Hcp-T6SS1,\nanti-Hcp [XmtA]-T6SS2, anti-VgrG-T6SS1, and anti-VgrG-T6SS2). The\n\npurified fusion proteins emulsified with adjuvant ISA 206 (Seppic,\nFrance) were injected into the back of the rabbits once every 2 weeks.\n\nConstruction of isogenic mutants and complementation of mu-\ntants. Disruptions of the vgrG genes, clpV genes, tle4 gene, and tli4 gene in\nthe chromosome of strain TW-XM were achieved by using � red mu-\ntagenesis (24). For complementation of �VgrG-T6SS1, �VgrG-T6SS2,\nand �Tle4, the coding sequences of genes plus their putative promoter\nregions were amplified from the TW-XM genome and independently\ncloned into pUC19 (25) using BamHI and HindIII restriction sites. All\nprimers used in this study are listed in Table S1 in the supplemental ma-\nterial.\n\nIsolation of bacterial secretory proteins and eukaryotic cytoplasmic\nproteins of host cells. Bacteria (106 CFU) were added to wells of a\n24-well tissue culture plate containing a monolayer (105 cells) of\nbEnd.3 or DF-1 cells (from Shanghai Fuxiang Biotechnology Co., Ltd.)\nin 0.5 ml of serum-free medium. Plates were incubated for 4 h at 37°C\nin a 5% CO2 atmosphere to allow full interaction between bacteria and\ncells. The monolayers were washed twice with phosphate-buffered sa-\nline (PBS), and the culture medium and washing PBS collected by the\nabove steps were passed through 0.22-�m filters to remove bacterial\ncell contamination. Then, the secretory proteins were concentrated by\n\nTABLE 1 Summary of bacterial strains and plasmids\n\nStrain or plasmid Characteristic or functiona\nSource or\nreference\n\nE. coli strains\nTW-XM Virulent strain of APEC isolated from brain of a duck that died from septicemia; Strr Collected in\n\nour lab\n�VgrG-T6SS1 Deletion mutant of vgrG-T6SS1 with TW-XM background This study\nK�VgrG-T6SS1 �VgrG-T6SS1 containing kanamycin resistance This study\n�VgrG-T6SS2 Deletion mutant of vgrG-T6SS2 with TW-XM background This study\n�VgrG-T6SS1–2 Deletion mutant of vgrG-T6SS1 and vgrG-T6SS2 with TW-XM background This study\nC�VgrG-T6SS1 APEC_XM �VgrG-T6SS1 with the vector pUC19-vgrG-T6SS1C, Ampr This study\nC�VgrG-T6SS2 APEC_XM �VgrG-T6SS2 with the vector pUC19-vgrG-T6SS1C, Ampr This study\nP�VgrG-T6SS1 APEC_XM �VgrG-T6SS1 with the vector pUC19, Ampr This study\nP�VgrG-T6SS2 APEC_XM �VgrG-T6SS2 with the vector pUC19, Ampr This study\n�T6SS1 Deletion mutant of clpV-T6SS1 with TW-XM background This study\nK�T6SS1 �T6SS1 containing kanamycin resistance This study\n�T6SS2 Deletion mutant of clpV-T6SS2 with TW-XM background This study\n�Tle4 Deletion mutant of tle4 with TW-XM background This study\n�Tle4Tli4 Deletion mutant of tle4 tli4 with TW-XM background This study\nK�Tle4 �Tle4 containing kanamycin resistance This study\nP�Tle4 APEC_XM �Tle4 with the vector pUC19, Ampr This study\nC�Tle4 APEC_XM �Tle4 with the vector pUC19-tle4–T6SS1C, Ampr This study\nMG1655 Strain induced by nalidixic acid resistance This study\nDH5� Cloning host for maintaining the recombinant plasmids Invitrogen\nBL21 Host for expressing the recombinant proteins Invitrogen\n\nPlasmids\npET28a(�) Expression vector, Kanr Invitrogen\npET28a-hcp-T6SS1 pET28a inserted in frame with the hcp-T6SS1 gene for expressing Hcp-T6SS1 This study\npET28a-hcp-T6SS2 pET28a inserted in frame with the hcp-T6SS2 gene for expressing Hcp-T6SS2 This study\npET28a-vgrG-T6SS1 pET28a inserted in frame with the vgrG-T6SS1 gene for expressing VgrG-T6SS1 This study\npET28a-vgrG-T6SS2 pET28a inserted in frame with the vgrG-T6SS2 gene for expressing VgrG-T6SS2 This study\npMD 19-T vector TA cloning vector TaKaRa\npUC19 E. coli shuttle vector; Ampr TaKaRa\npUC19-vgrG-T6SS1C pUC19 containing the promoter followed by the full-length vgrG-T6SS1 ORF This study\npUC19-vgrG-T6SS2C pUC19 containing the promoter followed by the full-length vgrG-T6SS2 ORF This study\npUC19-tle4-T6SS1C pUC19 containing the promoter followed by the full-length tle4 ORF This study\npKD46 � red recombinase expression plasmid 24\npKD4 pANTS� derivative containing FRT-flanked kanamycin resistance 24\npCP20 TS replication and thermal induction of FLP synthesis 24\n\na ORF, open reading frame; FRT, FLP recombination target; TS, temperature sensitive.\n\nMa et al.\n\n3868 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nusing 10,000-molecular-weight-cutoff spin columns (Millipore). The\nquality of secretory proteins was verified by the absence of the cytosolic\nmarker cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) (15). The mono-\nlayers were washed three times with PBS again, digested with trypsin,\nand disrupted by sterile deionized water to release cytoplasmic pro-\ntein. The above fluids were also passed through 0.22-�m filters to\nremove the remnant of bacteria and cellular debris, and the resultant\nconcentration of cytoplasmic proteins was similar to that from the\nabove extraction. The quality of cytoplasmic proteins was verified by\nthe presence of the eukaryotic cytosolic marker �-actin protein (26).\nThe concentrations of the wild-type strain and mutant proteins were\nassessed using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein quantification kit\n(Pierce Protein Biology of Thermo Scientific). Fifty micrograms of\nprotein was loaded into each lane for SDS-PAGE, followed by Western\nblot analysis. The Western affinity blotting assay was carried out as\ndescribed previously (27), and all assays were repeated at least twice.\n\nBiofilm formation assay and SEM. The biofilm assay (1% crystal vi-\nolet method) was performed as previously described (28, 29) in 96-well\nplates, and the A595 was recorded. Wells with sterile broth medium served\nas controls. All biofilm assays were run in triplicate. Scanning optical\nmicroscopy of biofilm stained by crystal violet was performed as previ-\nously described (30). The microtiter plate was air dried at 37°C for 30 min,\nand the bacterial biofilms were observed under \t40 magnification. Scan-\nning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed as previously described\n(29). The biofilms on coverslips were washed three times with PBS and\nfixed by using 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Observations were performed at 5 kV\nwith a scanning electron microscope (model S800; Hitachi, Tokyo, Ja-\npan).\n\nBacterial competition experiments. For bacterial competition exper-\niments, both strains were mixed at a 1:1 ratio (donor to recipient) in\ntriplicate after the cultures were normalized to an optical density at 600\nnm (OD600) of 0.5 (31). This mixture was then spotted on a nitrocellulose\nmembrane on a 1.5% (wt/vol) agar LB plate. Competition mixtures were\nincubated for 5 h at 37°C. Bacterial spots were harvested, and the CFU per\nmilliliter of the surviving donor and recipient were determined by plating\n10-fold serial dilutions on selective medium plates. Wild-type TW-XM\nand �Tle4Tli4 were selected on LB plates with streptomycin (50 �g/ml);\nMG1655 was selected by nalidixic acid (100 �g/ml); �T6SS1 (Kanr),\n�VgrG-T6SS1 (Kanr), and �Tle4 (Kanr) were selected on kanamycin (50-\n�g/ml) plates; C�VgrG-T6SS1, C�Tle4, P�VgrG-T6SS1, and P�Tle4\nwere selected on ampicillin (100-�g/ml) plates.\n\nAssessment of pathogenicity by LD50 and survival curve. The viru-\nlence of each strain was evaluated in duck and mouse models by 50%\nlethal dose (LD50) as described previously (25). Eight infection groups\nwere intramuscularly injected in the pelma with 10-fold serially diluted\nsuspensions containing 103 to 107 CFU of bacteria in sterile PBS. The\nblank control group was injected with sterile PBS. The ducks were ob-\nserved for 7 days until survival rates were steady. The LD50 of each strain\nwas also tested with a mouse model. LD50 results were calculated by using\nthe Reed-Muench method. Furthermore, 107 CFU/ml of each strain was\ninjected into the pelma muscles of ducks (16 ducks per strain) to obtain\nthe survival curve. The groups were observed throughout a 7-day period,\nand survival condition was recorded every 12 h.\n\nProliferation capacity of APEC in animal infection model. Each\ngroup consisted of 15 ducks, and the dose of intramuscular injection in\nthe pelma was 5 \t 106 CFU/duck (\n10\t LD50). At 24 h postinfection, the\ndiseased ducks were selected for euthanization and dissection. Bacteria\nwere isolated from the blood, spleens, lungs, and brain homogenates by\nplating 10-fold serial dilutions on MacConkey agar. The number of bac-\nteria colonizing the organs of the ducks during systemic infection was\nobtained.\n\nAdherence and invasion assays in bEnd.3 and DF-1 cells. According\nto the results of analyzing bacterial proliferation capacity in vivo, we used\nchicken embryo fibroblast cells (DF-1) as the model of system infection,\nwhile mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) (bEnd.3)\n\nwere used as the model of meningitis. E. coli invasion assays were per-\nformed as described previously (32, 33). Bacteria were added to monolay-\ners at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 bacteria/cells. The invasion\nfrequency was calculated by dividing the number of invaded bacteria by\nthe CFU of the original inoculum. Results were presented as the relative\ninvasion frequency compared with the invasion frequency of wild-type\nTW-XM, which was arbitrarily set at 100%. The assay was performed in\nsextuplicate. Adherence assays were performed similarly to the invasion\nassay, except that the gentamicin treatment step was omitted.\n\nqRT-PCR. The bacteria were grown to the logarithmic phase, and\nRNA was isolated by using the E.Z.N.A. bacterial RNA isolation kit\n(Omega, Beijing, China). Contaminating DNA was removed from the\nsamples with RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), and cDNA\nsynthesis was performed by using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit\n(TaKaRa, Dalian, China). Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-\nPCR (qRT-PCR) was performed to determine the transcription levels of\nthe virulence factors using SYBR premix Ex Taq (TaKaRa, Dalian, China)\nand gene-specific primers (see Table S2 in the supplemental material),\nand the data were normalized to the housekeeping gene dnaE transcript\n(25). The relative fold change was calculated by using the threshold cycle\n(��CT) method (34).\n\nAssessment of VgrG protein binding to target cells. To analyze the\ncell binding competence of VgrG proteins, both indirect enzyme-linked\nimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot analysis were carried out\nusing antibody against His-VgrG proteins. DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells (4 \t 104\n\ncells per well in a 96-well microplate [BD Biosciences]) were incubated\nwith 12 �g/ml endotoxin-free His-VgrG proteins for 12 h at 37°C. The\nmonolayers were then washed three times with PBS and blocked with 10%\nskim milk at 37°C for 1 h or used to extract protein samples for Western\nblot analysis. VgrG-ELISA was performed as reported previously (35),\nand blots were probed with a mouse anti-His antibody (1:2,000; Beyo-\ntime). A Western affinity blotting assay was carried out as described pre-\nviously (27). Samples were transferred electrophoretically onto polyvi-\nnylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes, and the detection of bound\nimmunoglobulin was achieved using mouse anti-His antibody and horse-\nradish peroxidase– goat anti-mouse serum.\n\nStatistical analysis. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0\n(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The difference between mean values among\ngroups was first evaluated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and\nthen by pairwise comparison of the mean values between the two groups,\nfollowed by Tukey’s Student rank test. The comparisons between two\ngroups of abnormal distribution were evaluated by the nonparametric\nMann-Whitney U test, and the duck survival data were analyzed by the\nKaplan-Meier estimator method. Differences with a P value of �0.05 were\nconsidered significant, and a P value of �0.01 was considered greatly\nsignificant.\n\nRESULTS\nTwo T6SS gene clusters exist in the genome of meningitis-caus-\ning APEC K1 strain TW-XM. The orthologous T6SS clusters\nwidely exist in the genomes of various E. coli pathotypes and are\ndivided into three types based on the homology and structural\nanalysis of core gene clusters (see Table S3 and Fig. S1 in the\nsupplemental material) (36). Here, genome sequence analysis\nshowed that two gene clusters (GenBank accession numbers\nKF678349 and KF678350) encoding putative T6SSs exist in the\ngenome of APEC K1 strain TW-XM, named the T6SS1 and T6SS2\nclusters (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic analyses of VgrG proteins sug-\ngested that the T6SS2 clusters encoded in E. coli genomes could be\ndivided into the intestinal pathogenic group and the extraintesti-\nnal pathogenic group (see Fig. S1A). Therefore, we speculated that\nthese two T6SS2 groups may perform different functions in intes-\ntinal pathogenic and extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC),\n\nT6SSs and Pathogenic Pathways\n\nSeptember 2014 Volume 82 Number 9 iai.asm.org 3869\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=KF678349\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore?term=KF678350\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nrespectively. Furthermore, the Hcp (XmtA), VgrG, and PAAR\nproteins of T6SS2 in ExPEC are significantly different from those\nof intestinal pathogenic E. coli (see Fig. S1B), which also suggests\nthat T6SS2 may perform specific functions in ExPEC. The infor-\nmation above provides us an opportunity to research the func-\ntional mechanisms of T6SS1 and T6SS2.\n\nIdentification of functional T6SS1 and T6SS2. The quality in-\nspection of protein samples was performed by Western blotting\nwith Crp or �-actin antibodies (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental\nmaterial). The purified proteins of VgrG and Hcp were used as\npositive controls (see Fig. S3). As shown in Fig. 2A, incubation\nwith anti-VgrG-T6SS1 led to the detection of protein bands of the\nexpected size for VgrG-T6SS1 in the total lysate of the wild-type\nand complementation strains but not in that of mutant strain\n�VgrG-T6SS1. Surprisingly, VgrG-T6SS2 proteins were detected\nonly in the lysates of complementation strains, not in �VgrG-\nT6SS2 and TW-XM (Fig. 2B). This phenomenon might be due to\nthe activation of some T6SS requiring bacterial endocytosis by\nhost cells (22, 37).\n\nHcp family proteins can be secreted via a T6SS-dependent\npathway (38–40) and were found not only in culture supernatants\nbut also in the cytosol and membrane of human epithelial cells\n(26). The Hcps could also be detected in the culture supernatants\n(incubation with host cells) by immunoblotting using anti-Hcp\nserum (Fig. 2C and D) in this study, which suggested that T6SS\nmachinery had been assembled successfully. As shown in Fig. 2C,\nHcp-T6SS1 was detected in all samples of TW-XM and culture\nsupernatants of �VgrG-T6SS1 but was not found in the cytoplasm\nof DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells infected by �VgrG-T6SS1. A similar\nresult was obtained in studies of the Hcp-T6SS2 protein (Fig. 2D).\nThese results indicated that the inactivation of VgrG proteins did\nnot destroy the secretion tube of T6SS but led to a defect in export\nof effectors into host cells. These results above indicated that the\nT6SS1 and T6SS2 loci in the TW-XM strain encode two functional\nT6SSs.\n\nT6SS1 contributes to biofilm formation. To examine whether\nthe T6SS was involved in biofilm formation or not, wild-type and\nmutant strains were tested for their ability to form biofilms on\npolystyrene surfaces as previously described (41, 42). The\ngrowth rates of T6SS-associated mutants were similar to those\nof the wild-type strain (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental mate-\nrial). The biofilm formation ability of T6SS1-associated mu-\ntants in LB medium supplemented with fibrinogen was signif-\nicantly decreased (�45%) compared with that of the wild-type\n\nstrain TW-XM (P � 0.01) (Fig. 3; see also Fig. S5). Although\nthe biofilm formation ability did not reach the level of that of\nthe wild-type strain, it was restored in the C�VgrG-T6SS1\nstrain (Fig. 3A). Since most virulence factors contributing to\nbiofilm formation could induce intercellular autoaggregation\n(42), it could be inferred that the inactivation of T6SS1 reduced\nautoaggregation of APEC strain TW-XM. However, T6SS2 did\nnot affect the biofilm formation.\n\nT6SS1 is involved in bacterial competitions. The analysis by\nRussell et al. (43) suggested that the type VI lipase effector 4 (Tle4)\nfamily proteins might have antibacterial activity, like any other\nphospholipases encoded in T6SS loci. The Tle4 proteins are united\nby a broad sporadic distribution pattern within Gram-negative\nbacteria (Fig. 4A). The T6SS1 cluster of APEC also encodes a Tle4\nfamily protein and its immunity protein Tli4 (Fig. 4B); the amino\nacid identity between XmoI and Tle4 (YP_542179, E. coli UTI89)\nwas �90%. To explore the role of Tle4 and T6SS1 in interbacterial\ninteractions more thoroughly, we measured their influence on\ncompetition outcomes between APEC and a model T6SS1 target,\nE. coli MG1655. Our results showed that both Tle4 and T6SS1\nsignificantly contributed to the fitness of APEC in interpathotype\ncompetition under T6SS-conducive conditions (Fig. 4C). These\nfindings show that Tle4 is a potent antibacterial effector delivered\nby T6SS1. Using cocultured antibiotic derivatives of this strain,\nwe found that recipient strains lacking Tle4 and its putative\nimmunity determinant exhibited significantly decreased fitness\nin competition with donor strains possessing Tle4 and func-\ntional T6SS1 and that expression of Tli4 in the recipient strain\nwas necessary (Fig. 4D).\n\nT6SS1 and T6SS2 play an important role in pathogenicity of\nAPEC in vivo. The virulence of the wild-type, mutant, and\ncomplementation strains was evaluated in the duck and mouse\nmodels. The virulence of T6SS1-associated mutants was signif-\nicantly lower than that of the wild-type strain, and the comple-\nmentation strain restored the virulence to the level of the\nwild-type strain. The LD50 values of the mutant strains �VgrG-\nT6SS1 and �T6SS1, wild-type strain, and complementation\nstrain were 1.56 \t 106, 2.38 \t 106, 2.05 \t 105, and 3.19 \t 105\n\nCFU/duck (see Table S4 in the supplemental material), respec-\ntively. A similar trend was observed for T6SS2-associated mu-\ntants, although the difference did not reach significance,\nwhereas the survival time was significantly longer (Fig. 5A).\nWithin 48 h, no duck infected with the wild-type strain sur-\nvived, and only 37.5% of ducks remained alive in the C�VgrG-\n\nFIG 1 Schematic diagram of the genetic organization of TW-XM T6SS gene clusters.

As shown in Fig. 5B, the amount of bacteria in all of the\nfour studied organs was significantly reduced in duck incubated\nwith the T6SS1-associated mutants, compared with wild-type\nstrain (P � 0.05). As for the strain T6SS2-associated mutants, no\nsignificant differences (P � 0.05) were presented statistically;\nthose two mutants did not affect the bacterial accumulation in\nblood, lungs, and spleens (Fig. 5B); the differences were not sta-\ntistically significant (P � 0.05). Only in the brain were the bacteria\nsignificantly reduced with the T6SS1-associated mutants com-\npared with TW-XM (P � 0.05). These results suggested that\nT6SS1 was involved in the process of systemic infection by APEC\nstrain TW-XM, whereas T6SS2 was linked only with cerebral in-\nfection.\n\nThe T6SSs contribute to APEC’s adherence to and invasion\nof DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells. The capacities for adherence to and\ninvasion of host cells were compared among the wild type, mu-\ntants, and complementation strains under the same conditions.\nThe T6SS1-associated mutants were defective in binding to and\ninvasion of DF-1 (P � 0.01) and bEnd.3 (P � 0.05) cells (Fig. 6).\nIn contrast, the adherence and invasion abilities of T6SS2-associ-\nated mutants were not affected in DF-1 and showed a significant\nreduction only in bEnd.3 (P � 0.01) (Fig. 6). These results indi-\ncated that T6SS1 is involved in APEC adherence to and invasion of\na broad range of host cells. However, T6SS2 bound to and invaded\nonly bEnd.3, which supported the hypothesis that T6SS2 plays an\nimportant role in the bacterial interaction with the blood-brain\nbarrier.\n\nInactivation of T6SSs downregulated the expression of viru-\nlence genes in APEC. Several microbial determinants, such as\nOmpA, Ibe proteins, tsh, and type 1 fimbriae (fimC), contributed\nto the invasion phenotype (25, 44, 45). Thus, the expression pro-\nfiling of virulence genes associated with invasion and adherence\n\nFIG 2 Expression levels of VgrGs and Hcps in different strains were studied by immunoblotting.

As shown in Fig. 7, the expression\nlevels of the virulence factors fimC, tsh, and luxS were significantly\ndecreased in T6SS1-associated mutants (P � 0.05). The expres-\nsion levels of the virulence genes were restored in the complemen-\ntation strain C�VgrG-T6SS1. In contrast, only ibeA of T6SS2-\nassociated mutants showed a significant decrease in gene\nexpression levels compared with those in TW-XM (P � 0.05), and\nits level was restored in the complementation strain.\n\nVgrG-T6SS2 protein specifically binds to BMECs (bEnd.3).\nTo analyze the binding competence of the VgrG-T6SS1 and VgrG-\nT6SS2 proteins for DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells, an indirect ELISA and a\nWestern blotting assay were performed. These two VgrG proteins\nshowed a positive reaction with bEnd.3 cells, whereas only VgrG-\nT6SS1 showed a strong binding with DF-1 cells (Fig. 8). The con-\nsistent results of ELISA (Fig. 8A) and Western blotting (Fig. 8B)\nindicated that the putative receptor of VgrG-T6SS2 may exist only\non the BMEC surface, whereas the receptor of VgrG-T6SS1 may\nbe widely distributed on the surfaces of various cell species.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nType VI secretion systems are bacterial nanoinjection machines\nthat transport macromolecules into neighboring prokaryotic or\neukaryotic cells. The toxic effector molecules serve to outcompete\nother bacterial species (31, 46) or to alter host cells during patho-\ngenesis (47–49). Many bacterial genomes encode more than one\nT6SS, and it is currently unclear whether they are functionally\nredundant or are both required for a specific niche (10, 50, 51).\nHere, we report the existence of two T6SS pathogenicity islands in\nAPEC and demonstrate their functions. Especially, T6SS2 can be\nsignificantly divided into the intestinal pathogenic group and the\nextraintestinal pathogenic group. The special functions of T6SS2\nin these two different groups still remain unknown.\n\nThe core genes and cluster structures of T6SS1 and T6SS2 in\nAPEC have been described in our previous research (36). The\nfunctions of these T6SSs are shown by the secretion of the hall-\nmark hemolysin-coregulated protein (Hcp) and valine-glycine re-\npeat G (VgrG), whereas specific features of T6SS1 and T6SS2 are\nnot the same.

The deletion of VgrGs led to the absence\nof Hcps in the cytosol and the membrane of DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells\ninfected by bacteria. These results indicated that VgrG family pro-\nteins play a key role in puncturing the host cell membrane and\nexporting Hcps into the cytoplasm. However, no evidence indi-\ncated that Hcp-T6SS2 was transported into DF-1 cells. Our data\nhad identified that VgrG-T6SS2 expression could be activated by\nDF-1 cells. However, the surface of DF-1 cells might not be bound\nby VgrG-T6SS2, a finding which seemed to suggest the key role of\nVgrGs in host cell recognition and explained why Hcp-T6SS2 was\nnot transported into DF-1 cells.\n\nThere are some VgrG variants that harbor C-terminal effector\ndomains, such as the RtxA actin cross-linking domain of V. chol-\nerae VgrG1 and the actin-ADP-ribosylating domain of Aeromonas\nhydrophila VgrG1 (52). In comparison to the better-studied ho-\n\nmologues, the C termini of VgrGs in APEC strain TW-XM are\nmuch smaller, and there is no bioinformatic indication that they\ncould harbor active domains. Here, we found that these two\nVgrGs were not involved in apoptosis and cytoskeleton rearrange-\nments of DF-1 and bEnd.3 (see Fig. S6 in the supplemental mate-\nrial), which indicated that they do not have functions similar to\nthose of other known VgrG homologues. Currently, we are trying\nto understand the nature of this interaction and its biological\nfunctions.\n\nIn enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), the T6SS (sciZ) mutant\ncauses a reduction in biofilm formation compared with the wild-\ntype strain (38). In this study, T6SS1 also functioned in regulation\nof biofilm formation. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that inacti-\nvation of T6SS1 leads to decreased luxS expression. The luxS gene\nplays a vital role in biofilm formation, motility, and quorum sens-\ning (53), which could be a major reason for the decreased biofilm\nformation in T6SS1-associated mutants.

The LD50s of T6SS1-associated mutants were\nincreased compared with those of the wild-type strain in duck and\nmouse models. The survival time of the animal models infected with\nT6SS2-associated mutants was significantly longer than those for the\nwild-type or complementation strains. The inactivation of VgrG-\n\nT6SS1 and T6SS1 led to a decrease of fimC, tsh, and luxS expression,\nwhich might be responsible for the phenomenon of the mutant\nstrains reducing invasion capacity (3). Previous research has shown\nthat the inactivation of T6SS (Hcp) could result in reduced type 1\nfimbria expression and decreased pathogenicity in APEC (14). In\naddition, the inactivation of VgrG-T6SS2 and T6SS2 leads only to\ndecreased expression of ibeA, which plays a vital role in penetrating\nthe blood-brain barrier. Reduced expression of adherence-associated\ngene ibeA mutants could be an important reason for the decreased\nproliferation capacity in the brain.\n\nFIG 5 In vivo infection study.

Thus, it could be concluded that T6SS2 is involved in\nAPEC invasion of BMECs, whereas it does not contribute to sys-\ntemic infection. These results are also consistent with those from\nqRT-PCR analysis.\n\nHowever, VgrG-T6SS1 and T6SS1 displayed no specific selec-\ntivity to target cells and were involved in the invasion of a variety\nof organs. The invasion capacity of T6SS1-associated mutants was\nsignificantly decreased in both DF-1 and bEnd.3 cells. The dele-\ntion of vgrG-T6SS1 and the T6SS1 core cluster resulted in signifi-\ncantly reduced numbers of bacteria reisolated from all four tissues\ncompared with those of the wild-type strain. Although the de-\ncrease of viable bacteria in blood circulation and systemic organs\nmay lead to a lower risk of brain infection, the significantly weaker\ncapacity for adherence to and invasion of bEnd.3 cells could also\njustify the effect of T6SS1 on cerebral proliferation.\n\nHowever, the correlation of inactivation of T6SS1 with cere-\nbral proliferation could not be confirmed by these results, because\nthe decrease of viable bacteria in blood circulation and systemic\norgans may also lead to a lower risk of brain infection.\n\nThe functional difference of T6SS1 and T6SS2 in APEC adds\nsomething new to the growing repertoire of T6SS regulation\n\nmechanisms and phenotypes. In this study, we found that the\nbinding competences of VgrG-T6SS1 and VgrG-T6SS2 for DF-1\nand bEnd.3 cells are significantly different. VgrG-T6SS2 can spe-\ncifically recognize and bind to the surface of BMECs, whereas it\ndoes not bind DF-1 cells. In contrast, the receptors of VgrG-T6SS1\nwere nonspecific or ubiquitous in most cell lines, including DF-1\nand bEnd.3 cells, and even HeLa cells in a previous study (14, 55).\nThe similarity between the gp27 domain of VgrG protein and the\ntail fiber protein of bacteriophage has been shown previously (10,\n18). The tail fiber protein of a tailed phage has the receptor binding\nfunction and decides the host specificity of the phage (21, 56). The\nexperimental results above suggested that T6SSs have significant\nhost specificity and share a similar mechanism with bacterio-\nphage. Similar results have been analyzed in our previous studies\n(36); the absence of four important �-sheets in the gp27 domain\nof VgrG-T6SS1 caused a more positive electrostatic potential,\nwhich would confer a lower degree of host specificity and allow\nVgrG to bind multiple different host cell species.\n\nIn summary, two distinguishable and functional T6SSs, multi-\npurpose T6SS1 and conservative T6SS2 (Fig. 9), were reported in\nthis study in APEC K1 isolates. Moreover, the pivotal role of VgrG\nproteins in recognition/binding-sensitive cells was specifically\nshown for the first time, which revealed that T6SS1 and T6SS2 of\nAPEC function in different pathogenic pathways.

We propose a potential model to illustrate the roles of these two T6SSs in\nvivo. T6SS1 has functional diversity (e.g., biofilm formation, type I fimbriae, and competition proliferation) and aims at a wide range of host cells. These directly\nor indirectly affect its pathogenicity. In contrast, T6SS2 plays a key role only in APEC K1 interaction with BMECs. CP, bacterial cytoplasm; IM, bacterial inner\nmembrane; PP, bacterial periplasm; OM, bacterial outer membrane; ECM, extracellular milieu; PM, host cell plasma membrane.\n\nT6SSs and Pathogenic Pathways\n\nSeptember 2014 Volume 82 Number 9 iai.asm.org 3877\n\nD\now\n\nnl\noa\n\nde\nd \n\nfr\nom\n\n h\ntt\n\nps\n:/\n\n/j\nou\n\nrn\nal\n\ns.\nas\n\nm\n.o\n\nrg\n/j\n\nou\nrn\n\nal\n/i\n\nai\n o\n\nn \n18\n\n M\nar\n\nch\n 2\n\n02\n2 \n\nby\n 1\n\n91\n.9\n\n6.\n10\n\n6.\n19\n\n6.\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2005.12.001\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2005.12.001\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.024869-0\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.70.7.3344-3354.2002\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.70.7.3344-3354.2002\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1286-4579(00)01277-6\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1286-4579(00)01277-6\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1128/IAI.00347-10\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2008.01.006\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2008.01.006\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mib.2008.11.010\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1038/embor.2008.131\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1099/mic.0.2008/016840-0\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nTP, Deshazer D. 2011.
