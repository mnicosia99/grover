MTT assays indicated no significant difference between the amount of cells with (LS+) and without (LS−) laser\ntreatment (𝑃 > 0.05). However, immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis results indicated a significant increase in the\nneural stem-cell marker, nestin, following exposure to low-level laser irradiation (𝑃 < 0.05). Furthermore, stem cell implantation\nwas applied to treat rats suffering from stroke. At 28 days posttreatment, the motor functions of the rats treated using i-ADSCs\n(LS+) did not differ greatly from those in the sham group and HE-stained brain tissue samples exhibited near-complete recovery\nwith nearly no brain tissue damage. However, the motor functions of the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS−) remained somewhat\ndysfunctional and tissue displayed necrotic scarring and voids. The western blot analysis also revealed significant expression of\noligo-2 in the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS+) as well as in the sham group (𝑃 < 0.05). The results demonstrated that low-level\nlaser irradiation exerts a positive effect on the differentiation of i-ADSCs and can be employed to treat rats suffering from ischemic\nstroke to regain motor functions.\n\n1. Introduction\nStroke has become a common disease and has been shown to\nbe associated with the consumption of high amounts of oil\nand salt. These dietary habits cause blood vessels to narrow\nand become prone to occlusion, which can lead to stroke.\nStrokes can be broadly classified into 2 categories: ischemic\nand hemorrhagic strokes. Differing treatment methods are\nused according to stroke type and lesion location. Therefore,\nat stroke onset, computed tomography ormagnetic resonance\nimaging is often used for diagnosis to provide physicians with\na basis of treatment [1]. The treatment methods used for the\n2 types of stroke are different. (1) Ischemic stroke is caused\nby thrombosis or blood clots in the brain vessels, which\n\nprevent blood flow into the brain tissues. Anticoagulants or\nantiplatelet medications must be administered to patients\nas soon as possible. (2) Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by\nthe rupture or hemorrhaging of brain vessels caused by\nperipheral brain trauma (subarachnoid hemorrhage). The\nmajority of cases of hemorrhagic stroke are caused by\nbrain trauma (e.g., car and workplace accidents). Treating\nthese patients often requires neurosurgical interventions [2].\nIschemic strokes constitute the majority of stroke cases.\nWhen patients suffer from ischemic stroke, the brain tissues\nnecrotize gradually because of the lack of nutrients if anti-\ncoagulants or antiplatelet medications are not administered\nwithin 3 h of the stroke. After necrosis occurs, necrotic brain\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\ntissue cannot regenerate or recover its functions even if\nblood-vessel reperfusion occurs [3]. In recent years, stem cell\ntreatment has become an innovative therapy for brain tissues\nthat cannot regenerate.\n\nBody fat extraction (e.g., abdomen, thigh, or buttock fat)\nhas been used for body shaping procedures in the past, and\nthe extracted fat was discarded as medical waste. Presently,\nmedical experts have confirmed that adipose tissues contain\nlarge amounts of mesenchymal stem cells that exhibit in vitro\nproliferation and multiple differentiation ability, character-\nistics that facilitate the repair and regeneration of damaged\ntissues or organs [4]. In addition, adipose-derived stem cells\n(ADSCs) possess several characteristics: (1) they can be easily\nharvested in abundant quantities without invasiveness, (2)\nthey can proliferate in in vitro cultures, and (3) they can be\napplied to awide range of body tissue types because these cells\nmigrate to lesion sites automatically to repair damage. Studies\nhave shown that ADSCs can differentiate into many different\ncell types, such as adipose, bone, cartilage, smooth muscle,\ncardiac muscle, endothelial, blood, liver, and even neuronal\ncells [5]. Because of these characteristics, ADSCs will likely\nbe one of the major sources of autologous stem cells in the\nfuture.\n\nThe effectiveness of laser therapy on biological bodies\nhas been confirmed, and laser therapy has been successfully\napplied in new technological applications such as micro-\nsurgery. Lasers can be classified as high or lowpower, depend-\ning on the energy levels used.High-power lasers involve using\nhigh energy levels to provoke blood coagulation, stop bleed-\ning, cut tissues, and even damage cells, whereas low-level\nlasers involve using electromagnetic or photochemical pro-\ncesses to achieve therapeutic effects [6]. A low-level laser is\ndefined as a laser with extremely low power and energy too\nlow to destroy themolecular bonding capacity (e.g., hydrogen\nbonds and van der Waals forces) of tissues. Therefore,\nlow-level lasers do not cause molecular structural change,\nprotein denaturation, or cell death. Irradiation from low-level\nlasers on tissue does not cause an obvious temperature inc-\nrease at the treatment site (less than 0.1 to 0.5∘C); thus, any\nphysiological responses of the tissues are produced by the\nstimulation of the laser itself, and this mechanism is des-\ncribed by the theory of laser biostimulation [7]. In addition,\nby using an appropriate energy level, low-level lasers are pri-\nmarily used to stimulate biological cells to induce or\nstrengthen physiological responses for facilitating local blood\ncirculation, regulating cell functions, promoting immunolog-\nical functions, and facilitating cell metabolism and prolifer-\nation. Using lasers to generate these physiological changes\nenables treatment goals such as anti-inflammation and\nwound-healing promotion to be met [8, 9]. Many studies\nhave shown that low-level laser irradiation exerts beneficial\nbiological effects on bone, neuronal, and skin healing [10–\n12]. However, the type, wavelength, power, and energy level\nof lasers used in previous studies have varied, and various\neffects have been observed in different cells when differing\nlevels of laser energy were applied. Previous studies have\nshown that using a low-level laser with an 820–830 nmwave-\nlength can reduce neural damage, facilitate neuronal healing,\nand accelerate neural recovery after an osteotomy [13, 14].\n\nUsing a low-level laser with a 660 nm wavelength has been\ndemonstrated to exert healing effects on musculoskeletal\ninjuries and inflammation [15]. In addition, many studies\nhave indicated that a low-level laser with a 660 nm wave-\nlength can effectively promote neural regeneration and accel-\nerate the reinnervation of muscle fibers to promote the reco-\nvery of motor functions [16–18]. Recent evidence has sug-\ngested that protein aggregates such as 𝛽-amyloid- (A𝛽) asso-\nciated neurotoxicity and dendrite atrophy might be a con-\nsequence of brain-derived neurotrophic-factor (BDNF) defi-\nciency. Meng et al. observed that the upregulation of BDNF\ncaused by using low-level laser therapy (LLLT) to activate the\nextracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/cAMP response\nelement-binding protein (CREB) pathway can ameliorate\nA𝛽-induced neuron loss and dendritic atrophy, thus identi-\nfying a novel pathway through which LLLT protects against\nA𝛽-induced neurotoxicity [19].\n\nCurrently, most low-level laser therapies in practical\nclinical applications emphasize treatment courses covering\nan extensive tissue area in a relatively short period. Multi-\nchannel-laser hair treatment, which is currently available\nfor the physical treatment of alopecia, is one such example.\nTherefore, we used a large-area LLLT that differs from the\nirradiation methods previously reported in the literature\n(such as single-spot low-energy laser exposure or the scan-\nning method) to increase the local area of exposure [18]. In\nthis study, stem cells were extracted from adipose tissues, and\nneural-stem-cell- (NSC-) differentiating agents were used\nto culture these ADSCs to transform them into induced\nadipose-derived stem cells (i-ADSCs), which were used as\nexperimental cells. First, we investigated the effects of large-\narea irradiation from a low-level laser on the proliferation\nand differentiation of i-ADSCs into neuronal cells. We then\ninvestigated whether i-ADSCs treated with laser irradiation\nand injected via an intravenous route could integrate and\nsurvive in various locations in rat brains. We investigated if\nthis treatment could improve the neurological dysfunctions\ncaused by ischemic brain damage in rats and if rats could\nproduce BDNF, using this treatment. Studies using intra-\nvenous injection to transplant i-ADSC for the treatment of\nischemic stroke with protocols similar to that used in the\ncurrent study are rare. In this study, we further combined\nthe biostimulation theory from large-area LLLT with trans-\nplantation of i-ADSCs to induce neural differentiation to\ninvestigate the effectiveness of ischemic stroke treatment. In\na previous study [20], we established a transient ischemia-\nreperfusion stroke rodent model by using right-sided middle\ncerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to simulate acute clinical\ninsults. The effectiveness of the treatment was assessed by\ncomparing HE-staining and western blot analysis, as well as\nthe evaluation of motor skill indices by using the rotarod\nand grip-strength tests. Our protocol has the potential to be\ndeveloped for application in the clinical treatment of patients\nwith ischemic stroke.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Isolation and Culture of ADSCs. A flowchart illustrating\nthe experimental design of the study is shown in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nu-ADSCs\n\nInduced by NSCs \n\nMedia supplementation\n\nMCAO model\n\nLaser irradiation Cell transplantation\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\ni-ADSCs (LS−)\n\ni-ADSCs (LS\ni-ADSCs\n\n+)\n\nFigure 1: A flowchart illustrating the experimental design. Detailed\nprocedures are described in Section 2.\n\nEight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used\nfor isolating rat ADSCs. The ADSCs were harvested from\nthe rats’ subcutaneous anterior abdominal wall. Inguinal fat\npads were excised, washed sequentially in serial dilutions\nof betadine, and finely minced as tissues in phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS). The tissues were digested with 0.3% of\nType I collagenase (Sigma) at 37∘C for 60min. The digested\ntissue/cell suspension was filtered through a 100-mesh filter\nto remove the debris, and the filtrate was centrifuged at\n1000 rpm for 10min. The cellular pellet was resuspended\nusing DMEM/F12 (10% FBS, 1% P/S) and then cultured for\n24 h at 37∘C in 5% CO\n\n2\n. Unattached cells and debris were\n\nthen removed and the adherent cellswere cultured using fresh\nmedium. The cells were cultured to 80% confluency before\nbeing released with 0.05% trypsin and then subcultured.\n\n2.2. ADSC Neuronal Predifferentiation. In this study, i-\nADSCs obtained from culturing ADSCs by adding NSC-dif-\nferentiating agents were used as experimental cells. ADSCs\nwithin 3–5 passages were detached and induced using NSC\nmedia supplementation. ADSCs were resuspended in a\nserum-free DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with an N2\nsupplement (Sigma), 20 ng/mL of epidermal growth factor\n(Gibco, NY, USA), and fibroblast growth factor (Gibco, NY,\nUSA).\n\n2.3. Setup of a Low-Level Laser Application Method. The\nprobe of the laser irradiation device was fixed vertically on\na clean, open experimental bench. The distance between the\nprobe and the cell culture dish was 30 cm. Laser irradiation\nwas applied in a 25∘C environment by using an AlGaInP-\ndiode laser (Konftec Co., Taipei, Taiwan) with a wavelength\nof 660 nm at an output power of 50mW and frequency of\n50Hz. In the control group, the cells that did not receive\nlaser irradiation treatment, i-ADSCs (LS−) (𝑛 = 10), were\ncompared with the experimental cells, i-ADSCs (LS+) (𝑛 =\n10), which were subjected to a laser irradiation treatment of\n10min. The cells in the i-ADSCs (LS−) group were cultured\nfor 7 days, whereas the cells in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nwere treated using low-level lasers on the following day for\n10min and then cultured for 6 days. The cells receiving\nlaser irradiation were collected at various times for analysis\naccording to the purposes of the experimental protocols.\nAfter the completion of the cultures, an optical microscope\nwas used for observing cell morphology.\n\n2.4. MTT Assay. The principle of the MTT (3-[4,5-dime-\nthylthiazol-2-y1]-2,4-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay is\n\nthat the mitochondria of living cells can transform the yellow\nchemical substance MTT tetrazolium into the purple non-\nwater-soluble substance MTT formazan through the effect of\nsuccinate dehydrogenase. DMSO can be used to dissolve the\npurple-colored products. No such response occurs in dead\ncells. An optical absorbance of 570 nm was measured using\nan enzyme immunoassay analyzer. Ahigher absorbance value\nindicates a larger amount of cells. In this study, ADSCs\nneuronal predifferentiation was first distributed in a 96-\nwell plate with approximately 10000 cells per well. The cells\nin the i-ADSCs (LS−) group were then cultured in a 37∘C\nenvironment and a 5% CO\n\n2\nenvironment for 5 days and 7\n\ndays, respectively. The cells in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group were\ncultured in a 37∘C environment and a 5% CO\n\n2\nenvironment\n\nfor 4 days and 6 days, respectively. After the completion of\nthe cultures, the medium was removed by several rinses with\nPBS. An MTT solution of 100 𝜇L was added to each well\nof a 96-well plate in the dark (1mL of MTT reagent was\nadded to 9mL of phenol-red-free, serum-free medium) and\nincubated in a 37∘C, 5% CO\n\n2\nenvironment for 2 h. The MTT\n\nsolution was then removed and the cells were dissolved using\nDMSO.An optical absorbance of 570 nmwasmeasured using\nan enzyme immunoassay analyzer to compare the values\nbetween the different groups.\n\n2.5. Immunocytochemistry of i-ADSCs. After 7 days in cul-\nture, the subcultured neurospheres were washed using 0.1M\nPBS 3 times and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h.\nFollowing the fixation, the cells were permeated with 0.1%\nof Triton X-100 for 10min and then blocked with 5% nonfat\nmilk for 30min. The phenotypic expression of these neuro-\nspheres was examined by implementing immunocytochemi-\ncal staining accompanied by antibodies against glial fibrillary\nacidic proteins (GFAPs) for astrocytes, mouse monoclonal\nantinestins for NSCs, and doublecortin (DCX), which has\nrecently been used as a marker for neurogenesis. Briefly, the\nfixed cells were washed 3 times in cold PBS. After wash-\ning with PBS, the aforementioned primary antibodies were\nadded and the slides were maintained at room temperature\novernight. In the following day, the primary antibodies were\nremoved by washing 3 times with PBS and the secondary\nantibodies were added before incubating the cells for 1 h.\nAfter washing off the secondary antibodies, the cells were\nincubated with tertiary antibodies tagged with peroxidase-\nantiperoxidase for 1 h. The tertiary antibodies were washed\noff using PBS. The cells were incubated with DAPI (Sigma,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA) diluted with the cell culture medium\nfor 10min. Finally, the cells were mounted with 90% glycerol\nand examined using fluorescentmicroscopy (Olympus IX-71,\nInc., Trenton, NJ, USA).\n\n2.6. Animals and Induction of theMCAOModel. In a previous\nstudy [20], we established a transient ischemia-reperfusion\nstroke rodentmodel, using right-sidedmiddle cerebral artery\nocclusion (MCAO) to simulate acute clinical insults. All of\nthe experimental procedures were approved by the Institu-\ntional Animal Care and Use Committee of Taichung Veteran\nGeneral Hospital, Taiwan. Thirty-two adult male SD rats\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nwere randomly allocated to 3 groups: the i-ADSCs (LS−)\ntherapy group (𝑛 = 12), the i-ADSCs (LS+) therapy group\n(𝑛 = 12), and a sham group (𝑛 = 8). The rats in all 3\ngroups were euthanized on the 28th day after MCAO was\nperformed. For MCAO procedures, anesthesia was induced\nusing 4% isoflurane (Baxter, USA) and maintained using 2%\nisoflurane. A midline cervical incision was made to isolate\nthe right bilateral common carotid artery. A 25mm-long\n3-0 nylon surgical thread was then inserted into the right\ncarotid bifurcation. In this study, 2 rounds were used to\nprovide a more complete blockage of blood flow in the artery.\nWhen the blunted distal end met resistance, the proximal\nend of the thread was tightened at the carotid bifurcation.\nThe right common, internal, and external carotid arteries\nwere carefully separated from the adjacent vagal nerve, and\nthe distal portions of the external and common carotid\narteries were ligated. A small incision was subsequently\nmade at the proximal portion of the external carotid artery,\nand a 3-0 nylon monofilament suture was gently inserted\n(approximately 18mm) into the internal carotid artery. After\n60min of MCAO, the nylon surgical thread was removed\nto allow complete reperfusion of the ischemic area. During\nischemia, rectal temperature was monitored and maintained\nat approximately 37∘Cby using a heating pad and an overhead\nlamp. The anesthetized rats intravenously received i-ADSCs\nat a concentration of 2 × 107mL−1 via their femoral veins.\nThe rats in the sham group underwent the same surgical\nprocedures except that the right-sided middle cerebral artery\nwas not occluded.\n\n2.7. Rotarod Test. An accelerating rotarod test was performed\nfor each rat before and on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th\nday after cerebral ischemia-reperfusion was induced. Before\nthe ischemia-reperfusion experiment was conducted, the\nanimals were subjected to 3 training sessions per day for 3\ndays on the accelerating rotarod to obtain stable duration\non the rotarod spindle. The diameter of the rotarod spindle\nwas 7 cm. The surface of the rotarod spindle was made\nof knurled Perspex to provide an adequate grip, which\nprevented animals from slipping off the spindle. The speed\nof the spindle was increased from 4 to 40 rpm over a period\nof 5min and the duration that the animal stayed on the\ndevice was recorded. The rats that were capable of staying on\nthe rotarod longer than 150 s after 3 training sessions were\nselected for the experiments. On the testing days, the animals\nwere tested twice, and the longest durations on the rotarod\nwere recorded.\n\n2.8. Grip Strength Test. Each rat was supported in a horizon-\ntal position approximately parallel to a grip bar (Model DPS-\n5R: range 0–5 kgf, Japan).The researcher set the rat’s forepaws\non the grip bar and pulled the animal horizontally away from\nthe bar by the base of its tail until the rat released its grip.The\npulling motion was smooth and continuous. The researcher\nsupported the rat by the abdomenwhen the gripwas released.\nThe reading on the strain gauge remained constant at the\npoint of maximal value, which was recorded as the measure\nof forepaw grip strength. The researcher supported the rat\n\nbody by both the chest and the base of the tail at an angle\nof −45∘ down the tail. The rat was facing away from the grip\nbar. The rat was encouraged to grasp the bar by moving its\nhind paw to the bar. When the rat grasped the bar with both\nhind paws, establishing a “full” grip, the upper body of the rat\nwas lowered so that the rat was in a nearly horizontal position.\nThe rat was pulled horizontally by the base of the tail until it\nreleased its grip and was supported as previously described.\nThe reading on the strain gauge remained constant at the\npoint ofmaximal value (force wasmeasured in grams), which\nwas recorded as the measurement of forepaw grip strength.\nThree values were obtained in succession, and the median\nvalue was used as the daily score. The data were expressed as\nthe percentage of the baseline (preischemic) value.\n\n2.9. Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining of the Cerebellum. The SD\nrats were anesthetized using 10% chloral hydrate (4𝜇L/kg),\nadministered intraperitoneally, and were euthanized on the\n28th day after the MCAO operation and sham treatment.\nFor each rat, the left cerebellum was rapidly removed and\npostfixed in formalin for 24 h. The postfixed tissues were\nembedded in paraffin wax and 6-𝜇m-thick serial coronal\nsections were obtained andmounted on poly-L-lysine-coated\nglass slices. To assess the histological changes in the MCAO\nand sham groups, the paraffin-embedded left cerebellum sec-\ntions were stained using hematoxylin-eosin (HE), according\nto standard protocol before the assay was performed.\n\n2.10. Western Blot Analysis. Proteins were extracted from\nthe rat brains by using a cold lysis buffer (10mM of tetra\nsodium pyrophosphate, 20mM of Hepes, 1% Triton X-\n100, 100mM NaCl, 2 𝜇g/mL of aprotinin, 2 𝜇g/mL of leu-\npeptin, and 100 𝜇g/mL of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride).\nThe protein concentrations from tissue extracts or ADSC-\nconditioned medium were determined using the Bradford\nprotein assay. Equal amounts of protein were placed in a\n2× sample buffer (0.125M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% glycerol,\n0.2mg/mL of bromophenol blue dye, 2% SDS, and 10% 𝛽-\nmercaptoethanol) and electrophoresed through 10% SDS-\npolyacrylamide gel.The proteins were then transferred onto a\nnitrocellulose membrane by using electroblotting.The mem-\nbranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in a Tris-\nbuffered saline with Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk.\nThe primary antibodies (1 : 1000) with appropriate dilutions\nwere incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST and 5%\nnonfat milk. The blots were then washed and incubated with\na peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1 : 2000) for 1 h\nin TBST. The chemiluminescent substrate for the secondary\nantibody was developed using the ECL detection system\n(Amersham, UK).The blots were exposed to film for 3–5min\nand then developed.\n\n2.11. Statistical Analysis. Thedata were expressed as themean\nvalue± standard error of themean.The statistical significance\nof the differences between the groups was determined using\na one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s test. An\nalpha level of less than 0.05 (𝑃 < 0.05) was considered sta-\ntistically significant.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 5\n\n(a) (b) (c)\n\nFigure 2: The morphology of inductions of adipose-derived stem cell (i-ADSC) differentiation into neuronal cells after low-level laser\nirradiation.

Effects of the Low-Level Laser on Cell Morphology. The\nADSCs were passaged 3–5 times after the initial plating of\nthe primary culture. Rat ADSCs appeared to be a monolayer\nof large and flat cells (Figure 2(a)). Many cells in the i-\nADSCs (LS−) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups induced a neuronal\nphenotype and exhibited, among one another, bipolar and\nmultipolar elongations of neuronally induced cell-forming\nnetworks. The results show that the stem cells in both i-\nADSCs (LS−) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups developed tentacles,\nindicating that ADSCs were facilitating the induction of dif-\nferentiation into neuronal cells. Comparative optical micro-\ngraphs revealed that some attached cells exhibited a spread-\nout shape with a spindle-like and fibroblastic phenotype in\nthe i-ADSCs (LS−) group (Figure 2(b)). However, most of\ni-ADSCs-expressing neurites extended radially, connecting\nlike bridges with those from adjacent cells in the i-ADSCs\n(LS+) group (Figure 2(c)).\n\n3.2. Effects of the Low-Level Laser on Cell Proliferation and\nDifferentiation. In this study,MTT assays were performed on\nDay 5 and Day 7 to evaluate the effects of large-area low-level\nlaser irradiation on the facilitation of cell proliferation. After\nanalyzing the optical absorbance values, the results showed\nthat, on Day 5, cell activity was slightly higher in the i-ADSCs\n(LS+) group compared with that in the i-ADSCs (LS−) group.\nHowever, the difference was not statistically significant (𝑃 >\n0.05). On Day 7, the cell amounts in both the i-ADSCs (LS+)\nand i-ADSCs (LS−) groups were larger than the amounts on\nDay 5. However, the cell proliferation rates were similar on\nDay 5 without major differences (𝑃 > 0.05) (Figure 3).\n\nIn this study, immunofluorescent staining and western\nblots were used to evaluate the effects of large-area low-\nlevel laser irradiation on the facilitation of cell differentiation.\nImmunofluorescent staining was performed for the NSC\nmarker, nestin, glial cell marker, GFAP antibody, and neu-\nronal precursor-cell-marker protein, DCX. After the staining\nwas completed, fluorescent microscopy was used to observe\nthe amount of fluorescence expression of each antibody.\nThe results showed that the fluorescence expression of\n\nDay 5 Day 7\n0.00\n\n0.04\n\n0.08\n\n0.12\n\n0.16\n\n0.20\n\n0.24\n\n0.28\n\nDays\n\nO\npt\n\nic\nal\n\n d\nen\n\nsi\nty\n\n (O\n.D\n\n.)\n\ni-ADSCs (LS−)\ni-ADSCs (LS+)\n\nFigure 3: The cell activity of inductions of adipose-derived stem\ncell (i-ADSC) differentiation into neuronal cells in both the i-ADSCs\n(LS−) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups on Days 5 and 7 after culture.\n\nthe nestin was higher in the cells in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nthan that in the cells in the i-ADSCs (LS−) group. These\nresults indicated that ADSC differentiation into neuronal\ncells was facilitated after large-area low-level laser irradiation\n(Figure 4(a)). For GFAP, no difference was observed in the\namount of fluorescence expression of GFAP between the\ni-ADSCs (LS−) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups (Figure 4(b)).\nFurthermore, for DCX, no difference was observed between\nthe 2 groups because the cells in both groups still exhibited\nstem cell morphology (Figure 4(c)).\n\nWestern blot is used to quantify the expression of mar-\nker proteins. Therefore, western blot analysis was used to\ncompare the amount of nestin expression between the i-\nADSCs (LS−) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups in this study. The\nresults showed that cells in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group exhi-\nbited a substantially higher nestin expression compared\n\n\n\n6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nNestin/DAPINestin/DAPI\n\n(a)\n\nGFAP/DAPI GFAP/DAPI\n\n(b)\n\nDCX/DAPI DCX/DAPI\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 4: The immunofluorescent staining for (a) nestin; (b) GFAP; and (c) DCX of inductions of adipose-derived stem cell (i-ADSC)\ndifferentiation into neuronal cells in both the i-ADSCs (LS−) (left) and i-ADSCs (LS+) (right) groups.

Regarding the results of GFAP and DCX, no diffe-\nrence was observed in the fluorescence expressions of the i-\nADSCs (LS−) and i-ADSCs (LS+) groups. Therefore, western\nblot analyses were not shown for GFAP and DCX.This result\nis consistent with the findings obtained using immunofluo-\nrescent staining.\n\n3.3. Evaluation of Behavior Recovery after Stroke in the\nAnimals. In this study, treadmill and forepaw-grip tests\nwere used to evaluate motor function recovery after stem-\ncell transplantation treatment in rats with ischemic stroke.\nThe treadmill test was performed on Day 7 after stem-cell\ntransplantation was performed on the rats with stroke. The\nrats from either the i-ADSCs (LS+) group or the i-ADSCs\n\n(LS−) group were unable to run as quickly as the rats in the\nsham group. From Day 14, the rats in the i-ADSCs (LS+)\ngroup gradually recovered the ability to run.

Oligoden-\ndrocytes substantially decrease after brain cells are damaged,\nleading to myelin collapse and the loss of neural-signal con-\nduction. Therefore, a western blot was used to analyze the\namount of expression of the oligodendrocyte cell protein,\noligo-2, to confirm the repair of brain tissues after stem-cell\ntransplantation was performed in rats with stroke.The results\nshowed that the amount of oligo-2 protein response in the\nbrain tissues of the i-ADSCs (LS+) group was as high as that\nin the sham group. By contrast, the oligo-2 protein response\nin the i-ADSCs (LS−) group was substantially lower (𝑃 <\n0.05). These results indicated that stem-cell transplantation\ntreatments can repair brain tissues damaged by ischemia\n(Figure 9).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nStem cells possess the ability to proliferate, regenerate, differ-\nentiate, and secrete cytokines. Previous studies have proven\nthat stem-cell therapy substantially improves the damage\ncaused by stroke. Stem cells are derived from various sites.\nMost previous studies have used bone marrow mesenchymal\nstem cells; however, we used adipose stem cells in the present\nstudy, which are easily accessible, and abundant and exhibit\nhigh differentiation and proliferation activity. Moreover,\nadipose stem cells do not trigger strong immune reactions\n(resulting in low exclusion) and rarely form teratomas. In\n\nthe literature, it has been demonstrated that adipose stemcells\nare essential adult stem cells that differentiate into various\nmesoderm tissues similarly to bone marrow mesenchymal\nstem cells [21–23]. Furthermore, adipose stem cells are more\neasily accessible than mesenchymal stem cells; therefore,\nadipose stem cells can be used as a substitute for bonemarrow\nmesenchymal stem cells for repairing damaged tissues in the\nfuture. Adipose stem cells are generally more practical than\nbonemarrowmesenchymal stem cells for use in research [23–\n26].\n\nIn this study, we used large-area low-level laser irradiation\nto induce ADSCs to differentiate into neuronal cells. The\nMTT assay analysis showed that the cell activity of the i-\nADSCs increased on Days 5 and 7 of culture after large-area\nlow-level laser irradiation [27, 28]. However, although cell\nactivity increased on both Days 5 and 7, the activity was also\nincreased for the group that did not receive laser irradiation\ntreatment. No significant difference was observed between\nthe groups with or without laser treatment (𝑃 > 0.05). Pre-\nvious studies have shown that, depending on irradiation para-\nmeters, various types of cell respond differently to laser irra-\ndiation [29]. Although the mechanism underlying this phe-\nnomenon remains obscure, several hypotheses have been\nproposed to explain the mechanism of laser action [30]. We\nspeculate that the lack of significant effects might be attri-\nbutable to the short duration of low-level laser irradiation,\nwhich might not provide sufficient energy to the ADSCs for\nthem to facilitate proliferation. Alternatively, using low-level\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9\n\n32\n\n43\n\n34\n\nOligo-2\n\nGAPDH\n\nS LS+ LS−\n(kDa)\n\nS: sham group\nLS+: i-ADSCs (LS+)\nLS−: i-ADSCs (LS−)\n\n(a)\n\nSham\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nR\nel\n\nat\niv\n\ne \nin\n\nte\nns\n\nity\n (%\n\n)\n\nGroups\ni-ADSCs (LS−) i-ADSCs (LS+)\n\n∗\n\n∗\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 9: The observation of brain tissue repair in rats with\nischemic stroke treated with i-ADSCs (LS−) and i-ADSCs (LS+)\ntransplantation.

Therefore, future studies should investigate the\nappropriate duration of low-level laser irradiation and deter-\nmine how much energy is required to accelerate cell prolifer-\nation [31, 32].\n\nTo understand if using large-area low-level lasers exerted\na positive effect on cell differentiation, we used immunofluo-\nrescent staining andwestern blot analysis to evaluate whether\nthese lasers were capable of accelerating the induction of cell\ndifferentiation [33]. The immunofluorescent staining results\nshowed that the nestin level in the group with i-ADSCs\ntreated using large-area low-level laser irradiation increased\nsubstantially compared with that of the group that did not\nreceive laser treatment. This result indicated that large-area\nlow-level laser can accelerate the differentiation of ADSCs\ninto neuronal cells [34, 35]. LLLT has been demonstrated to\nregulate neuronal function both in vitro and in vivo. Previous\nstudies have reported that laser treatments accelerated nerve\ncell sprouting and cell migration, which begin within 24 h\nof seeding. During the first week of cultivation, irradiated\ncultures contain a high number of neurons exhibiting large\n\nperikaria and branched neuronal fibers, which interconnect\nto form networks [36]. The possible mechanism of LLLT at\nthe cellular level has been attributed to the acceleration of\nelectron transfer reactions, resulting in the increase of reac-\ntive oxygen species and Ca2+ as versatile second messengers\n[37]. Previous studies have shown that applying LLLT could\ninfluence cellular processes by altering DNA synthesis and\nprotein expression [38], biomodulating cytoskeletal organi-\nzation [39], and stimulating cellular proliferation [38]. Such\nproperties suggest that LLLT, or interventions with similar\nneurobiological effects, can be used to treat neurodegen-\neration, a phenomenon that underlies debilitating clinical\nconditions.\n\nHowever, no obvious differences were observed for GFAP\nand DCX in the test results. This can be explained by the\ndifferentiation agent used in this study, which exerts its effects\nprimarily by inducing ADSCs to differentiate into NSCs.\nTherefore, although the ADSCswere treated using a low-level\nlaser, they still did not differentiate into neural glia cells. The\nDCX protein can only be discovered after neurons have been\nformed from NSCs, which demonstrates that DCX is a late-\nstage protein that cannot be expressed when cells still exhibit\nthe morphology of NSCs. Therefore, the amount of DCX\nexpression is not affected by low-level laser exposure. Wes-\ntern blot analysis was used to determine the amount of\nnestin expression after i-ADSCs were exposed to large-area\nlow-level laser irradiation and culture for 7 days. The res-\nults showed that the amount of nestin was higher with laser\ntreatment. This is similar to the findings from the immu-\nnofluorescent-staining method, indicating that laser irradia-\ntion can accelerate the differentiation ofADSCs into neuronal\ncells. These results indicated that ADSCs can be induced to\ndifferentiate into neuronal cells after treatment by large-area\nlaser irradiation for 10min. Future studies should establish\nthe precise duration of large-area LLLT required to achieve\nimproved results.\n\nIn this study, treadmill and forepaws grip tests were used\nto evaluate motor function recovery after stem cell tran-\nsplantation treatments in rats with stroke. The treadmill test\nresults showed that the running function was weaker for the\nrats in the sham group onDay 7 after treatment.We speculate\nthat this might have been because the brain-tissue lesion area\nfrom ischemia was too large; therefore, the transplanted stem\ncells did not have sufficient time to noticeably repair brain\ntissue. Therefore, the motor functions of the rats remained\nimpaired on Day 7. When tested on Day 14, recoveries in\nmotor functions were observed in both the i-ADSCs (LS−)\nand i-ADSCs (LS+) groups, with superior recovery in the i-\nADSCs (LS+) group, indicating that the damaged brain tissue\nwas repaired. On Day 21, the recovery of the rats’ running\nfunction was more satisfactory in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nthan in the i-ADSCs (LS−) group, indicating that the brain\ntissue repair capability was superior to that in the i-ADSCs\n(LS+) group.When tested onDay 28, the running function of\nthe rats in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group was close to that of the\nrats in the sham group. However, the motor function of the i-\nADSCs (LS−) group remained impaired, indicating that hind-\npaw motor function recovery was accelerated after i-ADSCs\n(LS+) treatment.\n\n\n\n10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nThe grip test results were similar to the treadmill test\nresults. On Day 7 after stem-cell transplantation treatment\nof the rats with stroke, grip strength was low for both the\ni-ADSCs (LS+) group and i-ADSCs (LS−) groups because\nthe damaged brain tissues were just about to be repaired;\ntherefore, the forepaws of the rats remained weak. When\ntested on Day 14, no major improvement was observed in\nthe grip strength of the rats in the i-ADSCs (LS−) group. By\ncontrast, the grip strength improved considerably in the i-\nADSCs (LS+) group, indicating that the brain tissue repair\ncapability was more satisfactory in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nthan in the i-ADSCs (LS−) group. OnDays 21 and 28, the tests\nshowed that grip strength recovery was more satisfactory in\nthe i-ADSCs (LS+) group than in the i-ADSCs (LS−) group.\nOn Day 28, the grip strength in the i-ADSCs (LS+) group\nrecovered to a level close to that of the sham group, indicating\nthat, after i-ADSCs (LS+) treatment, the damaged brain\ntissues of the rats with stroke were repaired quickly, enabling\nthe recovery of forepaw-grip strength. Based on these results,\nwe concluded that damaged brain tissues can be repaired\nfaster and motor function can be recovered efficiently in rats\nwith stroke after i-ADSCs (LS+) treatment.\n\nThe i-ADSCs could differentiate into neuronal cells after\ntransplantation into the brain. As a result, they moved and\nrepaired damaged cerebral tissue selectively and improved\ncerebral functions by enhancing angiogenesis, renewal of\nneurons, and proliferation of nerve cells [40, 41]. In this study,\nwe used the HE-immunostaining method and western blot\nanalysis to evaluate brain tissue repair on Day 28 after stem\ncell transplantation treatment was performed in rats with\nstroke. The results of immunostaining were observed using a\nmicroscope. The structures were magnified 200 times, which\nshowed that the brain tissue in the stroke lesionwas dense and\nsimilar to that of normal brain tissue in the i-ADSCs (LS+)\ngroup. By contrast, numerous cavities were observed in the\nischemic lesions of the brain tissues of the rats in the i-ADSCs\n(LS−) group. These results indicated that necrotizing brain\ntissue after ischemia was quickly repaired when i-ADSCs\n(LS+) was used to treat the rats with stroke.We speculate that\nusing i-ADSCs (LS+) treatment can accelerate the induction\nof ADSCs to differentiate into neuronal cells. Therefore,\nalthough the same number of stem cells was transplanted\nfor treatment, a greater number of NSCs were observed\nin the i-ADSCs (LS+) group than in the i-ADSCs (LS−)\ngroup. Furthermore, because NSCs can protect damaged\nbrain tissues from continuous deterioration, they can also\nhelp brain tissues to repair. Therefore, transplanting a greater\namount of NSCs would likely assist in repairing brain tissues\nmore effectively.\n\nRegarding the results of the western blot analysis, the\noligo-2 amounts after stem-cell transplantation treatment\nwere analyzed. Because oligodendrocytes form myelin in the\ncentral nervous system, myelin levels collapse when oligo-\ndendrocytes die. Nerve conduction is delayed or interrupted\nafter the death of oligodendrocytes, leading to limb disabil-\nities. Therefore, the evaluation of oligo-2 could be a crucial\nreference in assessing the degree of brain tissue recovery\nafter stem-cell transplantation treatments in rats with stroke.\nIn this study, using western blot analysis showed that the\n\namount of expression of oligo-2 in brain tissues treated with\ni-ADSCs (LS+) was similar to that in normal brain tissues.\nBy contrast, brain tissues treated with i-ADSCs (LS−) exhi-\nbited a lower oligo-2 expression, indicating that using i-\nADSCs (LS+) treatment in rats with stroke can repair myelin\nin the central nervous system, leading to the recovery of\nneural-signal conduction and motor function. Based on\nthese experimental results, we concluded that using i-ADSCs\n(LS+) treatment in rats with stroke cannot only accelerate\nthe repair of damaged brain tissues for the partial recovery\nof motor functions, but also enable the central nervous\nsystem to recover the velocity of neural-signal conduction.\nThese results confirm that the transplantation of i-ADSCs\n(LS+) can accelerate repairs in rats with ischemic stroke\nbecause i-ADSCs (LS+) can more efficiently differentiate into\nNSCs.\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nIn this study, we used i-ADSCs treated with large-area low-\nlevel laser irradiation to evaluate the effects of a low-level laser\non cell proliferation and differentiation. The results showed\nthat although a low-level laser cannot facilitate cell prolifera-\ntion, it can accelerate the induction of ADSCs differentiating\ninto NSCs. In this study, we successfully created large-area\ncell and tissue damage in rat brains by using an embolic stroke\nanimal model. Stem-cell transplantation with either i-ADSCs\n(LS+) or i-ADSCs (LS−) was performed to evaluate the degree\nof repair after stroke in the animals. Because large-area low-\nlevel laser irradiation can accelerate the differentiation of\nADSCs into NSCs, and NSCs can protect damaged brain tiss-\nues to prevent continuous deterioration from damage and\nto help with repair, the motor function recovery was thus\nsuperior in the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS+) compared\nwith that in the rats treated using i-ADSCs (LS−). From the\nbrain tissue slices from each group of rats, we discovered that\ni-ADSCs (LS+) treatment more effectively repaired necrotiz-\ning brain tissues after ischemia in rat brains. Furthermore,\nthe western blot analysis also showed that the amount of\noligo-2 increased in i-ADSCs (LS+)-treated rats with stroke,\nconfirming the repair ofmyelin in cerebral neurons to further\nassist in the recovery of neural-signal conduction in the\ncentral nervous system.\n\nTherefore, in the present study we demonstrated that\nusing large-area low-level lasers exerts positive effects on\ninducing ADSCs differentiation, and it effectively treated\nischemic stroke in rats, regarding motor function recovery.\nIn future studies, the effects of large-area low-level laser irra-\ndiation time and the appropriate dosage for the proliferation\nand differentiation of ADSCs should be evaluated. If the\noptimal irradiation time and dosage for ADSC proliferation\nand differentiation can be discovered in animal experiments\nsimilar to those in this study, we believe that superior\nexperimental results can be obtained. Furthermore, if primate\nor canine experimental animals can be used to conduct\nthe experimental protocols described herein, the concerns\nassociated with individual animal differences and errors\nassociated with motor function assessments can be mini-\nmized to obtain more reliable experimental data. Therefore,\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 11\n\nthe findings of this study contribute to the development of\ncell therapy, which can benefit patients with stroke.\n\nConflict of Interests\n\nThere is no conflict of interests.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by grants from the Taichung Vete-\nrans General Hospital and Central Taiwan University of Scie-\nnce and Technology (Grant.
