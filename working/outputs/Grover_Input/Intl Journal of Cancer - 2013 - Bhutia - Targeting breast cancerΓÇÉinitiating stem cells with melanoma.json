In our study, we elucidated the role of MDA-7/IL-24 in inhibiting growth of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells.\n\nAd.mda-7 infection decreased proliferation of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells without affecting normal breast stem cells.\n\nAd.mda-7 induced apoptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress in breast cancer-initiating/stem cells similar to unsorted breast\n\ncancer cells and inhibited the self-renewal property of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells by suppressing Wnt/b-catenin signal-\n\ning. Prevention of inhibition of Wnt signaling by LiCl increased cell survival upon Ad.mda-7 treatment, suggesting that Wnt\n\nsignaling inhibition might play a key role in MDA-7/IL-24-mediated death of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells. In a nude\n\nmouse subcutaneous xenograft model, Ad.mda-7 injection profoundly inhibited growth of tumors generated from breast can-\n\ncer-initiating/stem cells and also exerted a potent “bystander” activity inhibiting growth of distant uninjected tumors. Further\n\nstudies revealed that tumor growth inhibition by Ad.mda-7 was associated with a decrease in proliferation and angiogenesis,\n\ntwo intrinsic features of MDA-7/IL-24, and a reduction in vivo in the percentage of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells. Our\n\nfindings demonstrate that MDA-7/IL-24 is not only nontoxic to normal cells and normal stem cells but also can kill both\n\nunsorted cancer cells and enriched populations of cancer-initiating/stem cells, providing further documentation that MDA-7/\n\nIL-24 might be a safe and effective way to eradicate cancers and also potentially establish disease-free survival.\n\nBreast cancer continues to be a leading cause of cancer-\nrelated deaths in women worldwide despite significant advan-\nces in screening techniques that lead to early disease detec-\ntion. This disease evades most conventional therapies\nfrequently leading to relapse although the primary lesion is\neradicated.1 Over the last years, evidence has accumulated\n\nsupporting the notion that tumors are organized in a hierar-\nchy of heterogeneous cell populations with different biologi-\ncal properties and that the ability to sustain tumor formation\nand growth exclusively resides in a small proportion of tumor\ncells, termed cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells.2,3 In\nbreast cancer, a population of CD242/low/CD441 cells has\nbeen isolated that is highly enriched for cancer-initiating/\nstem cells. This population is 1,000 times more tumorigenic\nthan cell populations that are depleted of CD242/low/CD441\n\ncells, and injection of as few as 200 cells leads to tumor for-\nmation in Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice.4\n\nBreast cancer-initiating/stem cells can be established from\npatients’ surgical specimens or breast cancer cell lines and\nencompass undifferentiated cells capable of self-renewal,\nextensive proliferation as clonal nonadherent spherical clus-\nters and differentiation along different mammary epithelial\nlineages.4–6\n\nTumor-initiating/stem cells have the important feature of\nself-renewal, which is an intrinsic property of stem cells.7\n\nWnt/b-catenin signaling is one of the key pathways that pro-\nmote self-renewal of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells.5 Acti-\nvation of Wnt target genes is mediated by b-catenin, which\ntranslocates into the nucleus and binds to the transcription\n\nKey words: MDA-7/IL-24, apoptosis, Wnt signaling, cancer-initiat-\n\ning/stem cells, breast cancer\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online\n\nversion of this article\n\nConflicts of interest: Nothing to report\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.28289\n\nHistory: Received 14 Mar 2013; Accepted 26 Apr 2013; Online 30\n\nMay 2013\n\nCorrespondence to: Dr. Paul B.

GSK3b promotes the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation\nof b-catenin by phosphorylating three specific amino acids,\nSer33/Ser37/Thr41, on b-catenin.8,9 Similarly, Akt (protein\nkinase B) is a central regulator in the Wnt and PI3K signal-\ning pathways.10 Apoptosis resistance, a characteristic feature\nof cancer cells, has been demonstrated prominently in\ncancer-initiating/stem cells.11 Breast cancer-initiating/stem\ncells display high levels of expression of apoptotic regulating\nproteins including Bcl-2, NF-jB and Akt.2,3,11 A comparative\ngene expression profile study illustrated that a side popula-\ntion of cells isolated from MCF-7 when compared to the\nnon-side population of MCF-7 cells displayed alterations in\nseveral different pathways documenting deregulation of a\nnumber of apoptotic genes including BCL-2, BCL-xL, IAPs,\nPI3K and FADD.12 Consequently, the effective targeting of\nbreast cancer-initiating/stem cells with novel antitumor\nagents has the potential to significantly improve outcome for\nwomen with both early and advanced stages of breast cancer.\n\nUsing subtraction hybridization combined with induction\nof cancer cell terminal differentiation, our laboratory cloned\nmelanoma differentiation-associated gene-7/interleukin-24, a\nnovel member of the IL-10-related cytokine gene family.13\n\nSubsequent experiments document that mda-7/IL-24 has\nnearly ubiquitous antitumor properties in vitro and in\nvivo,14–21 which culminated in a successful entry into the\nclinic where safety and clinical efficacy when administered by\nadenovirus (Ad.mda-7; INGN 241) were shown in a phase 1\nclinical trial in patients with advanced cancers.18 Forced\nmda-7/IL-24 expression in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo\ninhibits angiogenesis22; stimulates an antitumor immune\nresponse23; sensitizes cancer cells to radiation-, chemother-\napy- and antibody-induced killing14,16,24,25 and elicits potent\n“antitumor bystander activity.”26,27 After forced expression of\nmda-7/IL-24 by an adenovirus, the MDA-7/IL-24 protein\ninteracts with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone\nprotein BiP/GRP78 and initiates a cascade of “unfolded\nprotein response” (UPR) events in tumor cells that culminate\nin apoptosis.28 We have shown that mda-7/IL-24 selectively\ninduces apoptosis in human breast cancer cells and inhibits\ntumor growth in nude mice.29 Moreover, chemotherapeutic\nagent- and antibody-mediated killing is enhanced in the\n\npresence of mda-7/IL-24 providing a synergistic effect\nthereby expanding treatment options for breast cancer\npatients.30–32 We have also found that a conditionally replica-\ntion competent adenovirus expressing mda-7/IL-24, a cancer\nterminator virus (CTV), displays dual cancer-specific activity\nresulting in eradication of both primary and distant breast\ncarcinomas in nude mice.33 It has been reported that\nAd.mda-7 downregulates both the PI3K and the Wnt/b-cate-\nnin signaling pathways in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer\ncells and remedies aberrant signaling in tumor cells, resulting\nin restoration of apoptosis induction.34,35\n\nIn our study, we investigated the role of mda-7/IL-24 on\nbreast cancer-initiating/stem cells. Our findings show that\nAd.mda-7 is able to inhibit the growth of different breast\ncancer-initiating/stem cells via induction of ER stress and\napoptosis without exerting any deleterious effect in normal\nstem cells. We also document that Ad.mda-7 inhibits self-\nrenewal of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells by inhibiting the\nWnt signaling pathway and Ad.mda-7 effectively inhibits in\nvivo growth of tumors originating from breast cancer-initiat-\ning/stem cells. Accordingly, Ad.mda-7 might provide an\neffective means of safely eradicating both unsorted cancer\ncells and cancer-initiating/stem cells, thereby establishing an\nenduring therapeutic response in patients with breast cancer.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nCell culture\n\nMCF-7, MDA-MB-231, T47D human breast carcinoma cell\nlines and MCF-10A, a normal breast cell line, were obtained\nfrom the American Type Culture Collection and were\ncultured as recommended. Human mammary epithelial cells\n(HMEpC) were obtained from Promocell Promocell, Boston,\nMA, USA and cultured as recommended. Cells were infected\nwith 100 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell of Ad.mda-7 or\nAd.vec and analyzed as described.28 Cell viability by MTT\nassay was performed as described.29,33\n\nFlow cytometry and sorting\n\nBreast cancer cells were detached with trypsin, washed once\nin Fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) buffer (phos-\nphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1–2% bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA) and 5 mM EDTA), stained with anti-CD24-\nFITC and anti-CD44-PE using 10 ll of antibody per 106 cells\nand incubated at 4�C for 15 min. After incubation, cells were\nwashed once with FACS buffer, suspended in FACS buffer at\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nCancer stem cells, or tumor-initiating cells, are the small population of cells within a tumor that promote the growth and\n\nspread of the tumor. These self-renewing cells produce high levels of proteins that thwart apoptosis, such as Bcl-2, NF-jB,\n\nand Akt. In this paper, the authors investigated a protein, MDA-7/IL-24, which has been shown to slow tumor growth and\n\ninduce apoptosis. They found that it specifically targets the cancer stem cells and stops them from self-renewing, which may\n\nhelp prevent recurrence of the disease.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\nBhutia et al. 2727\n\nInt.

Live\ncells were gated on the basis of forward and side scatters,\nand single cells were gated on the basis of forward scatter\nand pulse width. Gates were determined by analysis of\nunstained cells and isotype-specific stains.4\n\nMammosphere cultures and inhibition assays\n\nThe sorted breast cancer cells were plated and cultured in\nultra-low attachment plates (Corning Life Sciences, Corning,\nNY) in a serum-free mammary epithelial growth medium\nsupplemented with B27 (Life Technologies, NY), 20 ng/ml\nEGF (Epidermal growth factor) and 20 ng/ml bFGF (basic\nfibroblast growth factor) (BD Biosciences) as described.5,6 To\nquantify the effect of Ad.mda-7 on mammospheres, different\nconcentrations of Ad.mda-7 (pfu) were used to infect primary\nmammosphere cultures, whereas the second passage cultures\nwere grown in the absence of Ad.mda-7. After 7 days of cul-\nture, the number of mammospheres was counted under a\nmicroscope.36\n\nAnnexin V and propidium iodide staining\n\nThe breast cancer-initiating/stem cells were seeded in six-well\nplates (2 3 105 per well) and were infected with Ad.mda-7\nor Ad.vec for 48 hr and processed and evaluated for Annexin\nV binding as described.33\n\nWestern blotting analysis\n\nPreparation of whole-cell lysates and Western blotting for\nMDA-7/IL-24 (1:100, mouse monoclonal, GenHunter Corp.,\nNashville, TN), BiP/GRP78 (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal, Santa\nCruz, Dallas, TX), GRP94 (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal, Santa\nCruz), GADD133 (1:1,000, rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz),\nPARP, Bcl2, Bcl-xL, phospho-Akt, phospho-b-catenin, phos-\npho-GSK3b, phospho-eIF2a, Akt, b-catenin and GSK3b\n(1:1,000, rabbit monoclonal, Cell Signaling, Boston, MA) pro-\ntein levels were as described.28\n\nCaspase assays\n\nThe breast cancer-initiating/stem cells were seeded in 96-well\n(10,000 cells per well) ultralow attachment plates and were\ninfected with Ad.mda-7 or Ad.vec for 48 hr. After treatment\ncaspase 3/7 activities were measured using CellPlayerTM 96-\nwell kinetic Caspase 3/7 reagent kits following the manufac-\nturer’s protocol (Essen Bioscience Corp. Ann Arbor, MI).\n\nReporter assays\n\nBreast cancer-initiating/stem cells were suspended in 24-well\nultralow attachment plates and were transduced with lentivi-\nruses expressing TCF/LEF Reporter (TCF/LEF-Luc) at an\noptimized multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 48 hr in a\nfinal volume of 1.0 ml serum-free medium. The cells were\ninfected with Ad.mda-7 for 12 hr and cell lysates were pre-\npared and assayed for luciferase activity using Luciferase\n\nAssay System (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions.36\n\nHuman breast cancer xenografts in athymic nude mice and\n\nimmunohistochemistry\n\nT47D-initiating/stem cells (1 3 104) were injected s.c. in 100\nll of PBS in both flanks of female athymic nude mice\n(NCRnu/nu; 4-week old; �20 g of body weight) and xenograft\nstudies were done as described previously.29 Formalin-fixed\nand paraffin-embedded specimens were sectioned, 3- to 4-lm\nthick, and immunohistochemistry was done as described\npreviously.25\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nData are represented as the mean 6 standard error of mean\nand analyzed for statistical significance using one-way analy-\nsis of variance followed by Newman–Keuls test as a post hoc\ntest. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.\n\nResults\nAd.mda-7 infection results in expression of MDA-7/IL-24 in\n\nbreast cancer-initiating/stem cells\n\nTo determine if Ad.mda-7 is effective in selectively inhibiting\ngrowth and inducing apoptosis in breast cancer-initiating/\nstem cells versus normal stem cells and to define potential\ntherapeutic applications, we sorted initiating/stem cells\n(CD242/low/CD441), which were �1–5% of the total\nunsorted population, from different breast cancer cells,\nincluding MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and T47D, as well as MCF-\n10A37 and HMEpC normal breast epithelial cells, and cul-\ntured them in serum-free media. Initially, we confirmed the\nexpression of MDA-7/IL-24 in different cell types 48 hr after\nAd.mda-7 infection. Ad.mda-7 infection resulted in a dose-\ndependent expression of MDA-7/IL-24 protein in all types of\ninitiating/stem cells, irrespective of their cancer or normal\norigin (Fig. 1 and Supporting Information Fig. S1A).\n\nAd.mda-7 inhibits proliferation and induces ER stress and\n\napoptosis in breast cancer-initiating/stem cells\n\nWe demonstrated previously that infection of unsorted pop-\nulations of breast cancer cells with Ad.mda-7 inhibits their\nproliferation and induces apoptosis.29-33 To investigate the\neffect of Ad.mda-7 on breast cancer-initiating/stem cells, we\nsorted cancer stem cells and non-stem cell populations from\nMCF-7 cells by flow cytometry using CD24 and CD44 as\nmarkers (Fig. 2a). Both CD24- and CD44-negative non-\nstem cells, CD24-positive cells, CD44-positive cells and both\nCD24- and CD44-positive cells were infected with Ad.mda-\n7 at different doses. Ad.mda-7 effectively reduced cell viabil-\nity in all of these cell populations in a dose-dependent man-\nner as measured by standard MTT assays (Fig. 2b). The\nfinding that Ad.mda-7 inhibited growth of non-stem cell\npopulations and stem cell populations to a similar extent\nindicates that mda-7/IL-24 might be an effective cancer\ntherapeutic for chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer cells,\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\n2728 MDA-7/IL-24 inhibits breast cancer-initiating/stem cells\n\nInt.

Annexin V\nstaining performed 48 hr post-Ad.mda-7 infection demon-\nstrated a strong dose-dependent induction of apoptosis in\ncancer-initiating/stem cells, but not in normal stem cells\n(Fig. 2d). Dose-dependent apoptosis induction by Ad.mda-7\nwas further confirmed after Ad.mda-7 infection by increased\ncleavage of PARP and caspases, downregulation of the anti-\napoptotic protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of the proapop-\ntotic protein Bax in cancer-initiating/stem cells sorted from\nMCF-7 and T47D cells (Fig. 2e and Supporting Information\nFig. S2A). Moreover, Western blotting and caspase assays\nby CellPlayer assay showed that both caspase 3 and 7 were\nactivated in T47D-sorted cells and only caspase 7 was acti-\nvated in MCF-7-sorted cells as these cells are deficient in\ncaspase 3 (Figs. 2e and 2f).\n\nWe next analyzed the modulation of mda-7/IL-24 down-\nstream genes and signaling pathways that contribute to its\ntumor-suppressing properties in the context of breast cancer-\ninitiating/stem cells. MDA-7/IL-24 induces an ER stress\nresponse (UPR)28; therefore, we determined the expression\nlevels of ER stress markers. The levels of BiP/GRP78, GRP94\n\nand GADD153, and activation of p-eIF2a were significantly\nhigher upon infection with Ad.mda-7 when compared to\ncontrol and Ad.vec-infected breast cancer-initiating/stem cells\n(Fig. 3a). In addition, ER stress response element (ERSE)\nreporter assays confirmed that Ad.mda-7 increased ER stress\nin a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3b). These findings further\nconfirm that Ad.mda-7 also maintains its bona fide down-\nstream effects in breast cancer-initiating/stem cells.\n\nAd.mda-7 inhibits mammosphere formation and Wnt\n\nsignaling in breast cancer stem cells\n\nBreast cancer-initiating/stem cells are enriched in nonadher-\nent spherical clusters of cells, termed mammospheres, and\nthese cells are capable of yielding secondary spheres and dif-\nferentiating along multiple lineages.5,6 To evaluate whether\nAd.mda-7 could suppress the formation of mammospheres\nin vitro, we infected breast cancer-initiating/stem cells,\nobtained from MCF-7 and T47D cells, with Ad.mda-7 for\n48 hr and then cultured these cells in nonadherent condi-\ntions to determine mammosphere formation in the absence\nof Ad.mda-7. Compared to control and Ad.vec infection,\nAd.mda-7 inhibited in a dose-dependent manner not only\nthe number of mammospheres (Fig. 4a) but also the size of\nthe spheres (Fig. 4b), indicating a reduced self-renewal\ncapacity of these initiating/stem cells. It should be noted\nthat Ad.mda-7 inhibited mammosphere formation in both\nMCF-7 and T47D cancer-initiating/stem cells even at 10\n\nFigure 1. Ad.mda-7 infection results in expression of MDA-7/IL-24 in breast cancer-initiating/stem cells. MCF-7-, T47D-, MDA-MB-231- and\nMCF-10A-derived initiating/stem cells were sorted from their respective cell lines by flow cytometry and infected with either Ad.mda-7 (50\n\nor 100 pfu) or Ad.vec (100 pfu) for 48 hr and total proteins were isolated. The expressions of MDA-7/IL-24 and actin (as a loading control)\n\nproteins were analyzed by Western blotting.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nT\nh\ner\nap\ny\n\nBhutia et al. 2729\n\nInt. J.

Ad.mda-7 infection induces apoptosis in breast cancer-initiating/stem cells. (a) MCF-7 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for\nCD44 and CD24 expression. The gates shown were used for sorting of cells with the indicated phenotypes. (b) The sorted populations,\n\nbased on surface markers, were infected with Ad.mda-7 (10, 50 and 100 pfu/cell) or Ad.vec (100 pfu/cell) and after 48 hr cell proliferation\n\nwas measured by MTT assay. (c and d) Cancer-initiating/stem cells from MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231 and MCF-10A were infected with\n\nAd.mda-7 (50 or 100 pfu/cell) or Ad.vec (100 pfu/cell) and after 48 hr cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay (c) and Annexin V\n\nstaining assay using flow cytometry (d) measured apoptosis. MCF-7- and T47D-initiating cells were infected with Ad.mda-7 (50 or 100 pfu/\n\ncell) or Ad.vec (100 pfu/cell) and cell lysates were prepared after 48 hr.

J. Cancer: 133, 2726–2736 (2013) VC 2013 UICC\n\n\n\ncells by analyzing the levels of protein expression in this\nsignaling pathway. Ad.mda-7 transduction of MCF-7- and\nT47D-derived breast cancer-initiating/stem cells resulted in\na significant dose-dependent downregulation of p-b-catenin\nand p-GSK3b (Fig. 4c and Supporting Information Figs.\nS2B and S2C). Ad.mda-7 also decreased the expression of\np-AKT, without affecting total Akt expression (Fig. 4c and\nSupporting Information Fig. S2D), which regulates initiat-\ning/stem cell self-renewal downstream of Wnt signaling.10\n\nTransduction with Ad.vec did not alter Wnt or PI3K path-\nway proteins, thereby confirming the specificity of the\nMDA-7/IL-24 effect. To confirm that downregulation of b-\ncatenin protein level decreases its transcriptional activity,\nwe used a TCF/LEF TOP-luc lentiviral reporter system.\nInfection with Ad.mda-7 resulted in significant downregu-\nlation of b-catenin/LEF-dependent luciferase activity in\nMCF-7- and T47D-derived cancer-initiating/stem cells, fur-\nther confirming the role of MDA-7/IL-24 in the inhibition\nof the Wnt signaling pathway (Fig. 4d). LiCl inactivates\nGSK3b through Ser9 phosphorylation, which in turn\nreduces the phosphorylation of b-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/\nThr41 and its degradation.38 Ad.mda-7-mediated inhibition\nof b-catenin phosphorylation was reversed upon treatment\nof breast cancer-initiating/stem cells with LiCl as indicated\nby the lack of change in p-b-catenin levels upon Ad.mda-7\ninfection when performed in the presence of LiCl when\ncompared to infection with only Ad.mda-7 (Fig. 4e). More\nimportantly, pretreatment of breast cancer-initiating/stem\ncells with LiCl significantly prevented cell death induced by\nAd.mda-7 as demonstrated by MTT assays (Fig. 4f). Taken\ntogether, these data suggest that downregulation of the\nWnt/b-catenin self-renewal pathway might contribute to\nthe inhibitory effects of MDA-7/IL-24 on breast cancer-ini-\ntiating/stem cells.\n\nAd.mda-7 eradicates primary and inhibits distant tumors\n\ngenerated by breast cancer-initiating/stem cells in nude\n\nmice\n\nTo determine whether the in vitro growth inhibitory activity\nof Ad.mda-7 in breast cancer-initiating/stem cell translated\ninto the in vivo state, T47D-initiating/stem cells (1 3 104)\nwere subcutaneously injected into the left and right flanks of\nathymic nude mice. After palpable tumors of �100 mm3\ndeveloped on both flanks, in �30–40 days, the animals\nreceived seven intratumoral injections over a 4-week period\nwith 1 3 108 pfu of Ad.vec or Ad.mda-7 in tumors on the\nleft flank. The tumors on the right flank were not injected\nwith virus. T47D-initiating/stem cells formed large, aggressive\nand actively proliferating tumors in control-untreated and in\nAd.vec-injected animals. In contrast, the Ad.mda-7-treated\ngroup showed profound growth inhibition of the left flank-\ninjected tumors, which was evident by 2 weeks after initiating\nthe therapeutic treatment protocol (Figs. 5a and 5b). Further-\nmore, a significant inhibition of growth of the right-sided\nuninjected tumors was also observed upon treatment with\nAd.mda-7 in the left flank tumor, highlighting the potent\n“bystander” antitumor effect of MDA-7/IL-24 (Figs. 5a and\n5b). These results were anticipated, because direct injection\nof the right-side tumor with a nonreplicating adenovirus\nexpressing mda-7/IL-24 (Ad.mda-7) results in high levels of\nMDA-7/IL-24 protein in the injected tumor, whereas secre-\ntion of this cytokine “bystander effect” will generate less\nMDA-7/IL-24 in the circulation and in the distant tumor and\nthe inhibitory effect will therefore be less profound. These\nfindings provide definitive evidence for therapeutic efficacy of\nAd.mda-7 in breast cancer-initiating cells in vivo.\n\nWe next determined the efficacy of Ad.mda-7 in in vivo\ntransgene delivery by staining for MDA-7/IL-24 protein, CD-\n31 (which monitors angiogenesis and microvessel formation)\n\nFigure 3.

Tumors were\nharvested from the animals after three injections and tumor\nsections were interrogated by immunohistochemistry. Strong\nMDA-7/IL-24 staining was observed in left-sided tumors\nonly upon Ad.mda-7 treatment (Fig. 6a and Supporting\nInformation Fig. 3S). No significant MDA-7/IL-24 staining\nwas observed in right-sided untreated tumors after three\nAd.mda-7 injections of the left tumor, possibly reflecting the\nneed for more injections to produce sufficient quantities of\nMDA-7/IL-24 in the circulation to induce expression in the\nuntreated tumor. However, compared to Ad.vec treatment,\nAd.mda-7 treatment resulted in a significant reduction in\nstaining for CD-31 and Ki-67 in both left- and right-sided\n\ntumors (Fig. 6a and Supporting Information Fig. 3S). Analy-\nsis of cells isolated from in vivo tumor tissue by flow cytome-\ntry indicated that Ad.mda-7 administration decreased breast\ncancer-initiating/stem cells when compared to control\nunsorted tumor cells (Fig. 6b). These results may indicate\nthat angiogenesis and cell proliferation in untreated tumors\nare sensitive to lower levels of circulating MDA-7/IL-24,\nwhich would need to be confirmed by further experiments.\nIn total, these findings indicate that in breast cancer-initiat-\ning/stem cells Ad.mda-7 can efficiently generate MDA-7/IL-\n24 protein that exerts a potent “bystander” effect in distant\ntumors by inhibiting cell proliferation and angiogenesis (Figs.\n5 and 6).\n\nFigure 4.

J. Cancer: 133, 2726–2736 (2013) VC 2013 UICC\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIt is hypothesized that a small proportion of cancer-initiating/\nstem cells found within a tumor may be the prime movers of\ncancer regrowth after therapy, thereby having profound clinical\nimplications for cancer therapeutics and prevention.2,39 Cancer-\ninitiating/stem cells display resistance to conventional therapies\nand are associated with cancer relapse/recurrence after ther-\napy.40,41 Moreover, the lack of efficacy of current therapies in\nadvanced and metastatic disease requires novel approaches that\ncan specifically or selectively target cancer-initiating/stem cell\npopulations. In these contexts, therapies that are directed against\nboth differentiated cancer cells and cancer-initiating/stem cells\nmight provide advantages to treat cancer. We and others have\nestablished that mda-7/IL-24 has significant potential as an anti-\ncancer therapeutic because of its multiplicity of antitumor prop-\nerties, its nontoxic effects to normal cells and tissues and its\nsafety and efficacy as observed in clinical trials.14,16–21 Accord-\ningly, based on the profound antitumor activity of MDA-7/IL-\n24 and to examine its potential effects in cancer-initiating/stem\ncells, we used both in vitro and in vivo systems to determine\nwhether Ad.mda-7 is biologically active against purified popula-\ntions of breast cancer-initiating/stem cells.\n\nSeveral techniques have been developed to isolate and\ncharacterize breast cancer-initiating/stem cells in vitro. We\nsorted CD441/CD242/low cells as breast cancer-initiating/\nstem cells and observed that Ad.mda-7 effectively and equally\ninhibited proliferation of the initiating/stem as well as the\nnon-stem breast cancer cell populations. In fact, the cancer-\ninitiating/stem cells did not demonstrate any resistance\ntoward MDA-7/IL-24 as has been observed for chemothera-\npeutic reagents and radiation.42,43 It is noteworthy that the\ndoses of Ad.mda-7 (pfu) used in our study are comparable to\nthose previously shown to induce cell death in unselected\ntumor cell populations.28,29 Moreover, Ad.mda-7 also selec-\ntively inhibited cancer-initiating/stem cells, while exerting\nminimal toxicity to normal stem cells derived from immortal\nMCF-10A and primary HMEpC cells. These observations are\nconsistent with previous reports demonstrating that MDA-7/\nIL-24 preferentially targets transformed versus normal\ncells.29,33 We now demonstrate that MDA-7/IL-24 induces\napoptosis and ER stress in breast cancer-initiating/stem cells\nmaking this therapeutic cytokine an attractive and beneficial\noption for targeting cancer-initiating/stem cells.44 Similar to\nepithelial tumor cells14,28 and leukemia cells,45 Ad.mda-7\n\nFigure 5. Ad.mda-7 eradicates primary tumors and inhibits distant tumors generated by breast cancer-initiating/stem cells in nude mice.\nTumor xenografts from T47D-initiating/stem cells were established in athymic nude mice in the left and right flanks and only tumors on the\n\nleft side were injected with PBS (control) or with the indicated Ad for 3 weeks (total of seven injections).

These findings indicate\nthat the same genetic/epigenetic changes that elicit tumor cell\nsensitivity to mda-7/IL-24 are maintained in the entire tumor\npopulation (both breast cancer non-stem and stem cells),\nwhich is important for developing effective therapies for\nbreast cancer.\n\nThe Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is implicated in a\nwide range of developmental processes including mainte-\nnance of stem cell compartments in adult tissue.8 As a novel\ntarget for cancer stem cell therapy, previous studies showed\nthat anti-Wnt-2 monoclonal antibody induced apoptosis in\nmalignant melanoma cells and inhibited tumor growth.46\n\nSeveral phytochemicals, such as selenium, EGCG (Epigallo-\ncatechin gallate) and vitamin D, have recently been shown\n\nto inhibit Wnt signaling in cancers and could potentially be\nexcellent candidates for targeting cancer-initiating/stem\ncells.47 MDA7/IL-24 delivered by adipose-derived stromal/\nmesenchymal stem cells48 has potent proapoptotic activity\ntoward different cancer cell lines and reduced tumor growth\nin the TRAMP-C2-Ras (TC2Ras) prostate cancer model.48\n\nMDA-7/IL-24 expressed in neural stem cells in combination\nwith neural stem cells expressing TRAIL display potent anti-\ntumor activity against glioblastoma multiforme brain\ntumors.49 Here, we show that MDA-7/IL-24 downregulates\nthe Wnt/b-catenin self-renewal pathway in breast cancer-\ninitiating/stem cells, through activation of GSK3b and Akt\ninhibition resulting in a decrease of b-catenin phosphoryla-\ntion (Ser33/Ser37/Thr41) and proteasome degradation. Simi-\nlar findings were also observed in lung and breast cancer\ncells further confirming that Ad.mda-7 might provide an\neffective means of eradicating both cancer non-stem and\n\nFigure 6.

This find-\ning is consistent with our previous observations showing\nthat secreted MDA-7/IL-24 from injected tumors can inhibit\nthe growth of distant tumors by suppressing proliferation\nand angiogenesis.14,33 In recent years, breast cancer-initiat-\ning/stem cells have been confirmed as integral components\nof cancer recurrence after chemotherapy. The mechanisms\ninvolved in chemoresistance are multifaceted and can be\ndue to overexpression of ABC transporters, detoxification\n\nenzymes (aldehyde dehydrogenase), low cell turnover rates\nand/or the ability to activate a DNA checkpoint\nresponse.12,43 Our observations suggest a means of overrid-\ning the significant therapeutic roadblock of chemoresistance\nassociated with cancer stem cells and current conventional\ntherapies and provide further validation of the potential use\nof MDA-7/IL-24 as an innovative therapy for enhanced and\nlong-term cure rates in breast cancer.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe present studies were supported in part by National Institutes of Health\ngrants R01 CA097381 and P01 CA104177 (P.B.F.); NCI Cancer Center Sup-\nport Grant to VCU Massey Cancer Center (P.B.F., D.S., X.Y.W.); and VCU\nMCC (P.B.F.).
