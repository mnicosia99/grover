Carson2, N. Gudkovs3 and B. Nowak1\n\n1 National Centre for Marine Conservation & Resource Sustainability, University of Tasmania, Tasmania, Australia\n\n2 Fish Health Unit, Tasmanian Aquaculture and Fisheries Institute, Department of Primary Industries and Water, Tasmania, Australia\n\n3 Australian Animal Health Laboratory, CSIRO Livestock Industries, Geelong Victoria, Australia\n\nIntroduction\n\nTenacibaculum maritimum (formerly Flexibacter mariti-\n\nmus) (Suzuki et al. 2001) has been identified as the causa-\n\ntive agent of salmonid cutaneous erosion disease\n\n(SCED) ⁄ marine flexibacteriosis in Tasmania (Schmidtke\net al. 1991). The main clinical sign is the presence of\n\nerosive lesions that form on external surfaces. These\n\nlesions are characterised by destruction of the epithelial\n\ncells and connective tissue, which leaves the musculature\n\nexposed. Bacteria isolated from the leading edges of the\n\nlesions are slender, Gram-negative rods. The genus Tenac-\n\nibaculum belongs to the family Flavobacteriaceae, phylum\n\nBacteriodetes and T. maritimum is an exclusively marine\n\nspecies (Bernardet et al.1996; Suzuki et al. 2001; Ludwig\n\net al. 2008).\n\nWakabayashi et al. (1986) first described T. maritimum\n\nas a fish pathogen after isolating it from red sea bream\n\n(Pagrus major) and black sea bream (Acanthopagrus\n\nschegeli) in Japan. Other susceptible fish species include:\n\nflounder (Paralichthys olivaceous) (Baxa et al. 1986) and\n\nyellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata) (Baxa et al. 1988a) in\n\nJapan; Dover sole (Solea solea) (Bernardet et al. 1990) in\n\nScotland; sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) (Bernardet et al.\n\n1994) in France and turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) in\n\nSpain (Alsina and Blanch 1993).\n\nIn Tasmania, Australia, T. maritimum has been isolated\n\nfrom Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), rainbow trout\n\n(Oncorhynchus mykiss) and striped trumpeter (Latris\n\nlineata) (Handlinger et al. 1997). The only severe out-\n\nbreak of the disease occurred during the summer of\n\n1988 ⁄ 89. Farms up to 30 km apart recorded simultaneous\n\nKeywords\n\nextracellular products, hydrophobicity,\n\nLipopolysaccharide profiles, Tenacibaculum\n\nmaritimum, vaccine development, whole cell\n\nprotein profiles.\n\nCorrespondence\n\nRebecca van Gelderen, National Centre for\n\nMarine Conservation & Resource\n\nSustainability, University of Tasmania,\n\nTasmania, Australia.\n\nE-mail: rvangeld@utas.edu.au\n\n2010 ⁄ 0598: received 12 April 2010, revised\n31 May 2010 and accepted 3 June 2010\n\ndoi:10.1111/j.1365-2672.2010.04795.x\n\nAbstract\n\nAims: Tenacibaculum maritimum is a well known fish pathogen worldwide,\n\naffecting many fish species including Atlantic salmon in Tasmania, Australia.\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterise and understand the similarities and\n\ndifferences between the isolates in order to select isolates for later pathogenicity\n\nand vaccination trials.\n\nMethods and Results: Several physical characterisation tests were carried out:\n\nwhole cell protein profiles, lipopolysaccharide profiles (LPS), extracellular prod-\n\nuct profiles (ECP), indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and\n\nhydrophobicity. The Tasmanian strains of T. maritimum appear relatively\n\nhomogeneous physically, but antigenically different. All isolates were hydropho-\n\nbic and produce a variety of ECP profiles. There were two isolates that stand\n\nout in all assays (89/4747 and 01/0356-7) and showed great variation from the\n\nother isolates. All isolates have been confirmed as T. maritimum.\n\nConclusions: Based on the tests carried out three isolates were chosen for\n\nin vivo trials: 89/4747, 89/4762, 00/3280.\n\nSignificance and Impact of the Study: This is the first study to characterise\n\nT. maritimum isolates from Tasmanian waters. The opportunity to develop\n\nvaccines for the Tasmanian salmonid aquaculture industry is enhanced by a\n\ngreater understanding of the physical characteristics of pathogens.\n\nJournal of Applied Microbiology ISSN 1364-5072\n\n1668 Journal of Applied Microbiology 109, 1668–1676 ª 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology\nª 2010 The Authors\n\n\n\noutbreaks of marine flexibacteriosis within marine cages.\n\nHigher than average water temperatures (21�C), sunny\ncloudless days and poor feeding management were identi-\n\nfied as contributing factors to the outbreak (Handlinger\n\net al. 1997). Control of the disease has been managed by\n\nchanging feeding practices, fish handling and the use of\n\nantibiotics (Carson et al. 1992).\n\nHowever, there is limited information on the biological\n\nfactors that could initiate further outbreaks of the disease.\n\nPatterns of infection are variable and effective manage-\n\nment strategies would be difficult to implement (Carson\n\net al. 1994). Antibiotics such as trimethoprim and amoxi-\n\ncillin have been utilised in the treatment of marine flexi-\n\nbacteriosis on Tasmanian salmonid farms (Cameron\n\n1991, 1993a,b), but are undesirable for prolonged use\n\nwith issues of bacterial resistance and tissue residence\n\ntimes. Therefore, development of a safe and effective\n\nvaccine against T. maritimum in salmonids for the\n\nTasmanian salmonid aquaculture industry requires as a\n\nfirst step a comparison of local isolates of T. maritimum\n\nto identify candidates for pathogenicity assessment and\n\nsubsequent vaccination experiments.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nBacterial strains\n\nEighteen T. maritimum isolates were cultured from skin\n\nlesions on Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout in Tasma-\n\nnia from 1989 to 2001 (Table 1). Isolates were grown on\n\nmarine Shieh’s agar, (MSA) (g l)1: peptone L37 (Oxoid,\n\nAdelaide, Australia), 5 g; yeast extract (Oxoid), 0Æ5 g;\nsodium pyruvate (Oxoid), 0Æ1 g; sodium acetate (Oxoid),\n0Æ01 g; citric acid (Oxoid), 0Æ01 g; distilled water, 100 ml;\naged seawater, 900 ml; pH, 7Æ5–7Æ8), an adaptation of the\nmedium of Shieh (Song et al. 1988). The isolates were\n\nidentified by phenotype (Schmidtke et al. 1991) and con-\n\nfirmed as T. maritimum by PCR using primers for the\n\n16S rRNA gene (Carson and Wilson 2003). Two addi-\n\ntional strains were used for comparison: the type strain of\n\nT. maritimum (NCIMB 2154T) and a reference strain\n\nBaxa lyl-1 (Baxa et al. 1988a). Stock cultures were stored\n\nfrozen in peptone water with 8% glycerol (Ward and\n\nWatt 1971) at )80�C in single use cryovials. Bacteria were\nmaintained in culture on MSA at 25�C or in marine\nShieh’s broth (MSB) at room temperature (20�C).\n\nIndirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT)\n\nAll isolates were tested by IFAT as this technique would\n\nbe used later in other trials as a confirmatory test for\n\nT. maritimum. The procedure described by Carson et al.\n\n(1992) was used. Smears were produced using bacteria\n\nfrom plate culture that were then air-dried and heat fixed.\n\nThe smears were overlaid with 40 ll of polyclonal rabbit\nantiserum to strain 89/0329-5 of T. maritimum diluted\n\n1 : 100 in PBS (pH 7Æ2, 0Æ1 mol l)1) and incubated in a\nmoist chamber for 30 min at 37�C before rinsing in PBS\nfor 15 min. After the removal of excess buffer by blotting,\n\n20 ll of anti-rabbit FITC (Silenus, Melbourne) diluted\n1 : 60 in PBS was added to each slide. Smears were incu-\n\nbated at 37�C for 30 min and rinsed for 30 min in PBS,\nwhich was changed every 10 min. Slides were coverslip\n\nmounted using alkaline glycerol buffer (Johnson and\n\nMunday 1993) and examined at ·40 magnification with\nepifluorescent microscopy using UV illumination. A mar-\n\nine Flavobacterium sp. (99 ⁄ 1972-4b), isolated from Atlan-\ntic salmon, the primary antibody only and the anti-rabbit\n\nFITC only were used as negative controls. All isolates\n\nwere tested in triplicate.\n\nWhole cell protein and lipopolysaccharide profiles (LPS)\n\nWhole cell and LPS samples were prepared using a 48 h\n\nbroth culture. After harvesting, whole cell suspensions\n\nwere washed twice by centrifugation at 2900 g for 30 min\n\nand re-suspended in PBS (pH 7Æ2). The suspensions were\nonly washed twice because auto-agglutination occurred in\n\nmost isolates in subsequent washes or re-suspension. Each\n\nsuspension was standardised to an absorbance of 1Æ0 at\n550 nm in a spectrophotometer. Cells were collected from\n\naliquots of 1Æ5 ml of suspension by centrifugation at\n6500 g for 3 min and the supernatant removed. Whole\n\ncell lysates were produced by resuspending the cell pellet\n\nin 500 ll of SDS solubilisation buffer (Laemmli 1970)\nand heating for 10 min at 100�C. Cell debris from\nextracts were centrifuged at 6500 g for 3 min; the super-\n\nnatant was removed and stored at )20�C.\nLipopolysaccharide analysis was based on the method of\n\nHitchcock and Brown (1983) with minor modifications.\n\nCells were harvested at 16 500 g for 5 mins and samples\n\nwere washed once in PBSA (0Æ14 mol l)1 NaCl,\n0Æ01 mol l)1 Na2HPO4, pH 7Æ4, 1 mg of bovine serum\nalbumin per ml) and adjusted to 1 · 109 cell ml)1. The cell\npellet was re-suspended in 100 ll of 2% SDS and mixed\nthoroughly. Glass beads (700–1200 lmol l)1 diameter,\nSigma-Aldrich, Sydney) were added to break up the bacte-\n\nrial pellet as T. maritimum tended to form well bound cell\n\naggregates. To assist solubilisation of the pellet, in addition\n\nto the glass beads, samples were heated to 60�C.\nProteinase K (Boehringer-Mannheim, Sydney) at a\n\nconcentration of 20 mg ml)1 was added to each sample\n\nto give a final concentration of 5 mg ml)1. Samples were\n\nthen incubated in a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Sydney)\n\nfor an hour at 60�C. The temperature was increased to\n99�C for 30 min, after which the samples were stored at\n\nR. van Gelderen et al. T. maritimum for vaccine development\n\nª 2010 The Authors\nJournal of Applied Microbiology 109, 1668–1676 ª 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology 1669\n\n\n\n)20�C. Prior to loading, samples were thawed and mixed\nwith 134 ll of 2 · SDS solubilisation buffer. Each sample\nwas heated in a water bath at 100�C for 10 mins and then\ncentrifuged at 16 000 g for 5 mins. Controls for LPS\n\nanalysis were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (positive) and\n\nLactococcus garvieae TCFB 0713 (negative).\n\nECPs\n\nExtracellular products (ECPs) were produced by the cello-\n\nphane overlay method (Liu 1957). For each isolate, three\n\nplates of MSA were incubated for 72 h at 25�C as this\nyielded the greatest quantity of ECP. This also allowed\n\nminimal growth-phase effects as different proteases are\n\nproduced at different times of the growth curve\n\n(Gudmundsdóttir 1996). After incubation, the culture was\n\nwashed off the cellophane with 1 ml of PBS (pH 7Æ2) and\ncentrifuged at 4000 g for 20 min. The supernatant fluid\n\n(ECP) was filter sterilised (0Æ22 lmol l)1 pore size) and\nstored in aliquots at )80�C. Protein content was deter-\nmined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method\n\n(Pierce Protein Research Products, Thermo Scientific,\n\nMelbourne, Victoria, Australia). Duplicate cultures of\n\neach strain of bacteria to produce ECP were used to\n\nconfirm reproducibility of the results.\n\nAnalysis of proteins and LPS\n\nECPs and whole cell proteins were separated by SDS-\n\nPAGE (Laemmli 1970) with a 5% stacking gel and 12%\n\nresolving gel. Samples were heated to 100�C for 10 mins\nprior to loading (10 ll). Electrophoresis was carried out\nfor 1 h at 40 mA and 200 V. Gels were stained with\n\n0Æ125% Coomassie Blue R-250.\nLPS was run on a NuPAGE� (Invitrogen, Melbourne,\n\nAustralia) 12% Bis-Tris Gel for 1 h at 200 V. Gels were\n\nsilver stained according to the method of Tsai and Frasch\n\n(1982) but as this did not reveal banding, therefore\n\nWestern blotting was used to detect LPS bands (Fig. 1).\n\nWestern blots were run using the method of Towbin\n\net al. (1979) with a single modification. As NuPAGE�\nBis-Tris gels were used, 10% methanol was added in the\n\ntransfer buffer instead of 20% methanol. LPS was\n\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using an\n\nInvitrogen Novex (Melbourne) XCell II Blot Module\n\n(semi-dry transfer) for an hour at 30 V. After transfer, the\n\nnitrocellulose membranes were rinsed in PBSA and then\n\nblocked for 30 mins with 3% skim milk powder in Tris-\n\nsaline (Ab SM). Membranes were washed with Tris-saline\n\nand incubated for 30 mins with antisera against T. maritimum\n\n89/0329-5 in rabbit (dilution, 1 : 100) in Ab SM. After\n\nbeing washed twice in Tris-saline–0Æ05% Tween 20, and\nonce in Tris-saline, the membranes were incubated for 1 h\n\nwith anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) (Bio-Rad,\n\nSydney, Australia) diluted 1 : 1000 in Ab SM. Membranes\n\nwere washed as previously described above. Bands were\n\nvisualized by incubating the membranes in 30% w ⁄ v H2O2\nin Tris-saline and a 4-chloro-1-napthol tablet according to\n\nthe manufacturer’s directions (Sigma-Aldrich, Sydney,\n\nAustralia) solubilised in 100% methanol combined\n\nTable 1 Tenacibaculum maritimum isolates used in this study\n\nAccession no.

The reaction was\n\nstopped by the addition of water.\n\nHydrophobicity\n\nThe hydrophobicity assay was modified from the method\n\ndescribed by Rosenberg et al. (1980). Twenty-four hour\n\nMSB cultures of T. maritimum were centrifuged for\n\n30 min at 2000 g. Cell pellets were resuspended and\n\nwashed twice in PBS (pH 7Æ2) and diluted to an initial\nOD (ODI) of 0Æ6 with a spectrophotometer (k = 600 nm).\nIn a glass test tube, 1Æ2 ml of each bacterial suspension\nwas added along with 0Æ2 ml of the hydrocarbons n-hex-\nadecane (Merck Chemicals, Melbourne, Australia), n-\n\noctane (Sigma-Aldrich) or p-xylene (Merck Chemicals).\n\nEach bacterial suspension-hydrocarbon test was prepared\n\nand assayed in triplicate. The suspension was agitated vig-\n\norously for 2 min, and then allowed to separate for\n\n20 min into the hydrocarbon and aqueous phases.\n\nFrom each tube, 1 ml of the aqueous phase was trans-\n\nferred to a cuvette and the final OD (ODF) of each sus-\n\npension measured (k = 600 nm). The hydrophobicity of\neach bacterial suspension to each hydrocarbon was\n\nexpressed as the percentage partitioning into the hydro-\n\ncarbon phase:\n\nPartitioning into hydrocarbonð%Þ ¼\n½ðODI �ODFÞ=ODI� � 100\n\nFor each hydrocarbon of each isolate the percentage parti-\n\ntioning was ranked. Each rank was added together and\n\nthen divided by three (i.e. three hydrocarbons). This gave\n\na final rank that could be sorted in order of greatest to\n\nlowest overall hydrophobicity.\n\nResults\n\nOut of the eighteen local isolates, 16 produced the same\n\nwhole cell protein profile as the type strain NCIMB 2154T\n\nand reference strain Baxa lyl-1 (Fig. 2). These isolates\n\nshowed banding patterns from 118Æ4 kDa down to\n9Æ2 kDa. Major single bands are located around 12, 15Æ5,\n25, 45Æ6, and 99Æ5 kDa with a triplet at 20 kDa. The two\nlocal isolates that varied (89/4747 and 01/0356-7) showed\n\nsimilarities to the other isolates, however there was a\n\ndistinct band at 17Æ6 kDa for 89/4747 and bands at 135,\n22 and 12Æ7 kDa for 01/0356-7 which indicate they are\ndifferent from each other (Fig. 2).\n\nEight different ECP groupings were detected from all\n\n20 isolates (Table 2). Bands that all isolates have in\n\ncommon occurred at 46Æ5 and 73 kDa. Isolates 01/0356-\n7 and 89/4747 showed the greatest variation, making up\n\nindividual groups. Strains used for comparison, NCIMB\n\n2154T and Baxa lyl-1, showed identical profiles to each\n\nother, which was again different from the local isolates\n\n200\n\n31\n\n21\n\n6\n\n97\n\nGB ED F HC IA\n\n46·5\n\n73\n\nFigure 2 SDS-PAGE of extracellular product profiles of Tenacibacu-\n\nlum maritimum isolates stained with Coomassie Blue R.

There was no correlation of isolates between year\n\ngroups or geographical locations within Tasmania.\n\nLPS profiles indicated that there are at least two sero-\n\ntypes amongst the isolates as 89/4747 and 01/0356-7 did\n\nnot show any banding using the Western blotting\n\ntechnique (Fig. 4). However, in this study, it was not\n\ndetermined if these isolates (89/4747 and 01/0356-7) had\n\na shared serotype. Laddering appeared uniform across\n\nmost other isolates; the major exceptions were 89/0329-\n\n5, Baxa lyl-1, 89/4762 and 91/0126 which had a distinct\n\nband at 55 kDa and isolates 00/1793, 00/0400-3 and 98/\n\n3186 showed a different LPS profile. Based on differ-\n\nences in the profiles, isolates were grouped together\n\n(Table 3).\n\nAll isolates of T. maritimum were hydrophobic\n\n(Fig. 5). In all cases, isolates showed the lowest hydro-\n\nphobicity towards n-hexadecane and the highest to\n\np-xylene, with moderate hydrophobicity to n-octane.\n\nTwo exceptions were isolates 89/4762 and Baxa lyl-1 that\n\npossessed strong hydrophobic tendencies with all three\n\nhydrocarbons. Overall, all isolates were hydrophobic and\n\nas surface area of the alkane molecule decreased, hydro-\n\nphobicity increased. After final rankings, isolate 89/4762\n\nwas found to be the most hydrophobic. Isolates 89/4747\n\nand 01/0356-7 were IFAT negative; all other 18 isolates\n\nwere IFAT positive, including Baxa lyl-1 and NCIMB\n\n2154T.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe aims of this study was to determine if all local strains\n\nwere homologous in respect of an arbitrary reference\n\nTable 2 Extracellular product profiles groupings of Tenacibaculum\n\nmaritimum isolates based on SDS-PAGE analysis\n\nGroups Isolates accession numbers\n\n1 89/1579-2G, 89/0329-5, 89/4762, 96/0457-4\n\n2 89/4913-6, 90/1445, 90/1123, 91/0126, 91/0247\n\n3 89/4747\n\n4 89/0329-1, 00/0813\n\n5 00/0422-3, 00/3280\n\n6 01/0356-7\n\n7 00/0400-3, 00/1793-1\n\n8 Baxa lyl-1, NCIMB 2154T\n\n111\n\n93\n\n53.5\n\n36.1\n\n29.5\n\n21.3\n\nA B C D E F G\n\nFigure 3 SDS-PAGE of silver stained lipopolysaccharide profiles of Te-\n\nnacibaculum maritimum isolates.

Establishing homo-\n\ngeneity is important so that strain variation can be assessed\n\nand taken into account for subsequent pathogenicity trials\n\nand for nominating a representative strain that can be\n\nused for a prototype vaccine in Atlantic salmon.\n\nBased on the cell envelope, including whole cell\n\nanalysis, T. maritimum has been described by other\n\nauthors as a homogeneous species (Bernardet et al. 1994;\n\nAvendaño-Herrera et al. 2004). Initial observations of\n\nthe local T. maritimum isolates using whole cell protein\n\nprofiles indicate a relatively homogeneous group. These\n\nfindings are similar to that of Pazos (1997), who reported\n\nT. maritimum isolates with a large level of similarity\n\nbetween isolates for proteins with molecular mass in the\n\nrange of 14Æ4–97Æ4 kDa. While minor banding is evident\nabove 100 kDa with the Tasmanian isolates, major bands\n\ncould be seen from 12 to 99Æ5 kDa. For the purpose of\nthis study, assessment of the protein profiles was intended\n\nto be qualitative only, and although the gel loading\n\nvolume was constant (10 ll), protein concentration of\n\npreparations was not standardised. No weight can be\n\napplied to relative differences in band intensity between\n\nthe different isolates. With the exception of two isolates\n\n(89/4747 and 01/0356-7), all other local isolates showed\n\nthe same profile to that of the type strain NCIMB 2154\nT\n.\n\nSimilarly, by IFAT, all isolates were positive using the\n\npolyclonal antibody to isolate 89/0329-5 except for iso-\n\nlates 89/4747 and 01/0356-7 suggesting these two isolates\n\nrepresent some other distinct serogroup or groups.\n\nLPS analysis revealed further antigenic heterogeneity\n\nwithin the group of isolates, with three distinct patterns\n\nevident compared to the reference strain NCIMB 2154\nT\n.\n\nInitial attempts at silver staining LPS were successful only\n\nwith the positive control E. coli ATCC 25922. While this\n\nmethod produced clear laddering for E. coli isolates, it\n\nproved unsatisfactory for T. maritimum as the banding\n\nappeared to be masked possibly by protein (Fig. 1).\n\nAlthough cell preparations had been digested with pro-\n\nteinase K, it is known that some proteins are resistant to\n\ndigestion with proteinase K (Sørensen et al. 1992) which\n\nmight account for the failure to disclose the LPS moieties\n\nusing the method of Hitchcock and Brown (1983). The\n\nunderlying LPS profiles however could clearly be shown\n\nby Western blotting using polyclonal antiserum to 89/\n\n0329-5.\n\nAlthough initially described as antigenically homoge-\n\nneous (Wakabayashi et al. 1986), T. maritimum is has been\n\nreported to be antigenically heterogeneous (Ostland et al.\n\n1999; Avendaño-Herrera et al. 2004). Antigenic differences\n\nhave been demonstrated among T. maritimum isolates\n\nfrom Atlantic salmon using immunoblot analysis of LPS\n\n(Ostland et al. 1999) where differences were detected\n\namong isolates and between the isolates and reference\n\nstrains (NCIMB 2153, 2154T). These differences have been\n\nattributed to the O-antigen side chains, which may be\n\nassociated with different strains from outbreaks on both\n\ntemporal and geographical aspects (Ostland et al. 1999).\n\nThe current study reported here supports evidence of anti-\n\ngenic variation, though it appears that most of the strains\n\nform a homogeneous group with little LPS variation,\n\ndespite isolates being collected over a 12 year period from\n\ntwo different hosts: Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout.\n\nWhile most of the isolates seemed to be homogeneous\n\nantigenically, as assessed by IFAT, strains 89/4747 and\n\n01/0356-7 appeared different. The identity of both strains\n\nhad been confirmed previously by PCR using 16S rRNA\n\ngene primers for T. maritimum (Carson and Wilson\n\n2003) and had a phenotype consistent with T. maritimum\n\n(Schmidtke et al. 1991), yet there were differences in\n\nthe whole cell and LPS profiles as well as serotyping\n\nby IFAT. We concluded that these two isolates may\n\nrepresent a different serotype or serotypes but requires\n\nfurther analysis.\n\nPartitioning into hydrocarbon (%)\n0 20 40 60 80 100\n\nIs\no\n\nla\nte\n\ns \n(i\nn\n\n o\nrd\n\ne\nr \n\no\nf \n\nra\nn\n\nk)\n\n98/3186\n\n00/1793-1\n\n90/1445\n\n01/0356-7\n\n91/0126\n\n89/0329-5\n\n89/4747\n\nNCIMB 2154T\n\n00/0813\n\n00/0400-3\n\n00/3280\n\n89/1579-2G\n\n90/1123\n\n89/4913-6\n\n89/0329-1\n\n91/0247\n\n96/0457-4\n\n00/0422-3\n\nBaxa lyl-1\n\n89/4762\n\nFigure 5 Graph showing the partitioning of each Tenacibaculum\n\nmaritimum isolate into the three hydrocarbons (±SE).

T. maritimum for vaccine development\n\nª 2010 The Authors\nJournal of Applied Microbiology 109, 1668–1676 ª 2010 The Society for Applied Microbiology 1673\n\n\n\nPrevious work by Avendaño-Herrera et al. (2004)\n\nreported distinct serotypes for T. maritimum in turbot\n\n(Scophthalmus maximus), sole (S. solea) and gilthead sea\n\nbream (Sparus aurata). They also found different sero-\n\ntypes according to the source of the isolation. For\n\nexample, strains isolated from turbot reacted only with\n\nthe antiserum derived from turbot isolates. Similar find-\n\nings were noted for sole and gilthead sea bream strains\n\nwith the antiserum obtained against the sole isolate\n\n(Avendaño-Herrera et al. 2004). The relationship between\n\nserotype and host evident from this study was not found\n\nwith the salmonid strains. The antiserum to 89/0329-5\n\nisolated from Atlantic salmon reacted with isolate 00/3280\n\nfrom rainbow trout, the Baxa lyl-1 strain from Japanese\n\nflounder and NCIMB 2154T from red sea bream.\n\nThe primary purpose of evaluating serotype in this\n\nstudy was to establish the extent of serological diversity\n\nthat might exist among isolates from Atlantic salmon for\n\nthe purpose of selecting a strain that might serve for\n\ndeveloping a vaccine for use in Tasmania. Establishing\n\nthe serological relationship to strains of T. maritimum\n\nfrom other hosts and determining their serotype once\n\nsuch a schema is developed will provide context to sero-\n\ntype observations which have been generated thus far.\n\nECPs are compounds secreted by bacteria and thought\n\nto facilitate invasion of the host (Dalsgaard 1993).\n\nAlthough toxic activities of T. maritimum have been\n\ninvestigated previously (Baxa et al. 1988b), this is the first\n\naccount of ECP protein profiles for T. maritimum. The\n\nECP findings suggest significant heterogeneity within the\n\nspecies.\n\nHeterogeneity of ECPs is present in other marine\n\npathogenic bacterial species including Aeromonas salmoni-\n\ncida (Gudmundsdóttir 1996). Out of 32 strains analysed,\n\nsix different protease groups were detected. All typical\n\nstrains belonged to a single group, while atypical strains\n\nshowed significant differences from the typical strains and\n\nbetween each other. It was suggested that ECP type was\n\nmore strongly associated with geographic location than the\n\nhost fish species. Our results indicate that host may not be\n\nan important factor since isolate 00/3280 from rainbow\n\ntrout grouped with 00 ⁄ 0422-3 from Atlantic salmon. Both\nisolates however are from salmonids which may account\n\nfor the similarity in ECP profile. The type strain NCIMB\n\n2154\nT\n\nand Baxa lyl-1 are also from different host species,\n\nyet are grouped together having identical protein profiles.\n\nAttachment of bacterial pathogens to different sub-\n\nstrates is considered an important step in colonisation of\n\nhost cells as this has the potential to initiate disease\n\n(Vatsos et al. 2001). A number of techniques are\n\nemployed to assess non-specific and specific attachment\n\nto different substrates e.g., salt aggregation test (SAT),\n\nphase partitioning with hydrocarbon solvents, and adher-\n\nence to nitrocellulose filters (NCF). While more than one\n\nassay system is normally used to obtain a robust measure-\n\nment of hydrophobicity (Santos et al. 1990), a single assay\n\nwas used here because the focus of this study was to\n\nassess similarities and differences between a range of iso-\n\nlates. Also, implementing other assays was found to be\n\nproblematic because of the profound auto-agglutination\n\nof T. maritimum. Of the methods available, phase parti-\n\ntioning with hydrocarbons was found to be more accom-\n\nmodating than other techniques for assessing surface\n\nhydrophobicity of T. maritimum. As expected, all isolates\n\nwere hydrophobic, consistent with other T. maritimum\n\nhydrophobicity studies (Sorongon et al. 1991; Magariños\n\net al. 1996; Kawahara and Kusuda 1998).\n\nUsing the phenotypic markers described, the isolates\n\nwere grouped and ranked in order to make selections for\n\nlater pathogenicity and vaccination trials (van Gelderen\n\net al. 2009, in press). The three isolates chosen for the path-\n\nogenicity trials were: 89/4747, 89/4762, 00/3280. Isolate 89/\n\n4747 was chosen due to its differences with other isolates\n\nfor the characterisation tests and in particular because it\n\nmay represent a distinct serotype. Isolates 00/3280 and 89/\n\n4762 showed similarities to each other and most other iso-\n\nlates in whole cell protein profile and serotype. However, in\n\nthe ECP groupings, 89/4762 occurred within a common\n\ngroup, whereas 00/3280 was grouped with only one other\n\nisolate with a distinct electropherotype. This contrasts with\n\nthe LPS groupings, where 00/3280 was similar to most\n\nother isolates while conversely 89/4762 was different and\n\nplaced into a minor group. Isolate 89/4762 was also the\n\nmost hydrophobic of all the isolates and was included to\n\ndetermine if this characteristic was a marker of virulence.\n\nThe data collected from this study enabled the\n\nresearchers to make educated decisions about the choice\n\nof isolate tested based on similarities and differences\n\nbetween them. It provided more information and sound\n\nreasoning for choices, rather than random selections.\n\nIsolate 89/4762 was used in the final vaccination study\n\n(van Gelderen et al. 2009).\n\nReferences\n\nAlsina, M. and Blanch, A.R.
