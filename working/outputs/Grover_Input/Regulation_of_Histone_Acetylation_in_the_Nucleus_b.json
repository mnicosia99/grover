Sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2), one of\nthe isoenzymes that generates S1P, was associated with histone H3 and produced S1P that regulated\nhistone acetylation. S1P specifically bound to the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and\ninhibited their enzymatic activity, preventing the removal of acetyl groups from lysine residues within\nhistone tails. SphK2 associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 in repressor complexes and was selectively\nenriched at the promoters of the genes encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 or the\ntranscriptional regulator c-fos, where it enhanced local histone H3 acetylation and transcription.\nThus, HDACs are direct intracellular targets of S1P and link nuclear S1P to epigenetic regulation of\ngene expression.\n\nPhospholipid and sphingolipid metabolites have established roles in signal transduction\npathways initiated by activation of cell surface receptors. The recent identification of nuclear\nlipid metabolism has highlighted a new signaling paradigm for phospholipids. The best\ncharacterized of the intranuclear lipids are the inositol lipids that have critical roles in nuclear\nfunctions, such as pre-mRNA splicing, mRNA export, transcriptional regulation, and\nchromatin remodeling (1). Sphingomyelin has long been known to be a component of the\nnuclear matrix (2), but the possibility that sphingolipids are also metabolized within the nucleus\nhas only recently emerged from observations that enzymes controlling sphingolipid\nmetabolism, including neutral sphingomyelinase and ceramidase, are also present in the\nnucleus (3).\n\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed. sspiegel@vcu.edu.\nSupporting Online Material\nwww.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/325/5945/1254/DC1\nMaterials and Methods\nFigs.

Most of its actions are mediated by\nbinding to a family of five heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein (G protein)-\ncoupled receptors, designated S1P1–5 (5). S1P may also function inside the cell independently\nof S1P receptors (4); however, direct intracellular targets of S1P have not been identified. Since\nthe discovery that S1P is produced intracellularly by two closely related sphingosine kinase\nisoenzymes, SphK1 and SphK2, much has been learned about SphK1 and its functions, yet\nthose of SphK2 remain enigmatic (7).\n\nBecause, in many cells, SphK2 is mainly localized to the nucleus or can shuttle between the\ncytosol and the nucleus in accordance with its nuclear localization and export signals (8), we\nsought to determine its function there (9). In human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, SphK2 is\npredominantly localized to the nucleus (10), where it is enzymatically active and can produce\nS1P from sphingosine (Fig. 1A). The nucleus contained high amounts of sphingosine (table\nS1), and SphK2 expression significantly increased nuclear abundance of S1P by sixfold and\ndihydro-S1P, which lacks the trans double bond at the 4 position, by twofold (Fig. 1A).\nEndogenous SphK2 was mainly associated with isolated chromatin and was not detected in\nthe nucleoplasm (Fig. 1B). SphK2 was present in purified mononucleosomes fractionated by\nsucrose density gradient centrifugation, and its distribution paralleled that of native histones\n(fig. S1A). Thus, we tested whether SphK2 was associated with core histone proteins.\nImmunoprecipitation of proteins from nuclear extracts prepared from MCF-7 cells\noverexpressing SphK2 or SphK1 and subsequent Western blot analysis demonstrated that\nhistone 3 (H3) was associated with SphK2 (Fig. 1C), but not with SphK1. H3 was also\ncoimmunoprecipitated with catalytically inactive SphK2G212E (in which glycine 212 is\nreplaced by glutamic acid) (Fig. 1C), which does not increase nuclear S1P (4.4 ± 0.3 and 4.6\n± 0.6 pmol/mg for vector and SphK2G212E, respectively); these findings suggest that enzymatic\nactivity is not required for association of these two proteins. H3 from nuclear extracts also\nassociated with histidine (His)–tagged SphK2 isolated with Ni2+–nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)–\nagarose beads (fig. S1B). To further confirm the specificity of the physical interaction of SphK2\nwith H3, we measured in vitro association of Ni-NTA-agarose–bound His-tagged SphK2 or\nHis-SphK1 with individually purified histones. Only H3, but not histones H4, H2B, or H2A,\nbound to SphK2 (fig. S1C). In contrast, none of the purified histones interacted with SphK1\n(fig. S1C).\n\nWe noticed that expression of SphK2 increased acetylation of lysine 9 of H3 (H3-K9), lysine\n5 of histone H4 (H4-K5), and lysine 12 of histone H2B (H2B-K12) (Fig. 2A), without affecting\nacetylation of other lysines or acetylation of histone H2A. In contrast, expression of\ncatalytically inactive SphK2G212E (Fig. 2A) or SphK1 did not influence acetylation of any\nresidues examined. Although catalytically inactive SphK2G212E also bound to H3 (Fig. 1C),\nit did not affect its acetylation status (Fig. 2A), which correlated with the formation of S1P in\nthe nucleus with histone acetylation. Addition of S1P or dihydro-S1P, which can both be\nproduced intranuclearly by SphK2 (Fig. 2D), to isolated nuclei also increased specific\nacetylations of the same lysine residues on histones H3, H4, and H2B without causing\nacetylation of H2A (Fig. 2B).\n\nAll these results indicate that SphK2 in the nucleus regulates histone acetylation. Depletion of\nSphK2 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Fig. 2C) reduced nuclear but not cytoplasmic\namounts of S1P and dihydro-S1P (Fig. 2D), consistent with the specificity of SphK2 for both\nsphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (11). As expected from its cytosolic localization, siRNA\ntargeted to SphK1 (siSphK1) only reduced amounts of S1P in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2D). siSphK2\nspecifically decreased acetylation of H3-K9, H4-K5, and H2B-K12, without affecting\nacetylation of other lysines or acetylation of H2A (Fig. 2C). In contrast, depletion of SphK1\n\nHait et al. Page 2\n\nScience.

Similar results were\nobtained with siRNAs targeted to different sequences in SphK2. Addition of S1P to isolated\nnuclei reversed the decreased acetylation of H3-K9, H4-K5, and H2B-K12 induced by\ndepletion of SphK2 (fig. S2A). siRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous SphK2 (fig. S2B),\nbut not that of overexpressed V5-SphK2 (fig. S2C), decreased acetylation of particular histone\nresidues (fig. S2C), which could be reversed by cotransfection with a siRNA-insensitive V5-\nSphK2 construct (fig. S2C). Together, these observations indicate that S1P produced in the\nnucleus by endogenous SphK2 acts there to regulate histone acetylation.\n\nLysine acetylation of histones is a critical component of an epigenetic indexing system\ndemarcating transcriptionally active chromatin domains. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs)\nand histone deacetylases (HDACs) maintain the delicate, dynamic equilibrium in acetylation\nlevels of nucleosomal histones (12,13). Neither S1P nor dihydro-S1P increased HAT activity\nin HeLa cell nuclear extracts, nor did overexpression of SphK2 (fig. S3). In sharp contrast, S1P\nand dihydro-S1P inhibited HDAC activity in nuclear extracts by 50%, compared with 95%\ninhibition by the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (fig. S4A). Conversely, siSphK2, which\nreduced SphK2 expression by 70% in HeLa cells without affecting SphK1 expression (fig.\nS4C), enhanced HDAC activity (fig. S4B). This increased HDAC activity was not due to\nincreased abundance of HDAC1 or HDAC2 (fig. S4D). We also assessed the effect of S1P on\nenzymatic activity of endogenous HDACs. S1P inhibited the enzymatic activity of\nimmunoprecipitated HDAC1 (Fig. 3A) and HDAC2 (fig. S4E) almost as effectively as did\nTSA. Both S1P and dihydro-S1P also inhibited recombinant HDAC1 (Fig. 3B) and HDAC2\n(fig. S4F). However, neither sphingosine nor lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), another bioactive\nlysophospholipid structurally related to S1P, had significant effects on HDAC1 (Fig. 3B) or\nHDAC2 activity (fig. S4F). Thus, S1P and dihydro-S1P appear to be endogenous inhibitors of\nHDAC. To provide further evidence that HDACs are targets for S1P, we examined binding of\nendogenous HDACs in nuclear extracts to S1P immobilized on agarose beads. Both HDAC1\nand HDAC2 were associated with matrices carrying S1P but not by control or LPA matrices\n(Fig. 3C). In contrast, other class I HDACs (HDAC3, HDAC8), class IIa HDACs (HDAC4,\nHDAC5, HDAC7), class IIb HDAC (HDAC6), and the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide\n(NAD+)–dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1 did not bind to S1P agarose beads (fig.\nS5). 32P-labeled S1P specifically bound to either His-tagged HDAC1 or HDAC2 immobilized\non Ni-NTA-agarose beads and was displaced by excess unlabeled S1P (fig. S6). Modeling of\nS1P into the active site of the HDAC1 homolog from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Aquifex\naeolicus (14) revealed that it docks well (fig. S7), with a predicted binding energy comparable\nto that of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (fig. S7), a potent inhibitor of HDACs.\nIndeed, both SAHA and TSA completely displaced bound [32P]S1P from HDAC1 and\ndecreased binding to HDAC2 to a similar extent, as did excess unlabeled S1P (fig. S6). To\ndetermine whether endogenous S1P is bound to nuclear HDAC1, we measured the abundance\nof sphingolipids in HDAC1 immunoprecipitates from nuclear extracts by mass spectrometry.\nOf all the sphingolipids present in the nucleus, only S1P was bound to HDAC1 (Fig. 3D and\ntable S1). Thus, S1P can bind to the active site of HDAC1 and HDAC2 and inhibit their activity.\n\nHDAC1 and HDAC2 are catalytically active components of distinct multiprotein co-repressor\ncomplexes that include Sin3 and NuRD. Over-expressed SphK2 associated with proteins of\nthese co-repressor complexes, mSin3A and MBD2/3, and with HDAC1 and HDAC2 (fig.\nS8A). Endogenous SphK2 also associated with HDAC1 and HDAC2 and interacted with\nhistone H3 (fig. S8B). These results place SphK2, the enzyme that produces S1P in the nucleus,\nin close proximity to its potential nuclear targets. To determine whether nuclear S1P levels are\nregulated in response to external signals and whether HDACs sense these changes, we treated\ncells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C, which\nenhances phosphorylation and catalytic activity of SphK2 (15). Indeed, PMA increased\namounts of S1P in the nucleus by more than twofold within 5 min (fig. S8C) and also rapidly\n\nHait et al. Page 3\n\nScience.

S9). Prolonged treatment with PMA\ninduced nuclear export of SphK2 (8) (fig. S9), which ensured transient inhibition of HDACs.\n\nA common response to inhibition or depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 is the induction of cyclin-\ndependent kinase inhibitor p21 independently of the p53 tumor suppressor protein (16–19). In\nagreement with possible involvement of SphK2 in p53-independent expression of p21 (10),\nsilencing SphK2 in MCF-7 cells reduced basal and PMA-induced accumulation of p21 protein\n(fig. S10A) and mRNA (fig. S10B). Overexpression of SphK2, but not catalytically inactive\nSphK2, enhanced PMA-stimulated transcription of a reporter construct containing the p21\npromoter (fig. S10C), and its depletion reduced it (fig. S10D). Overexpression of SphK2\nincreased acetylation of histone H3-K9 associated with the proximal p21 promoter and further\nenhanced the response to PMA (Fig. 4A), in accordance with the participation of SphK2 in\nPMA-induced expression of p21 (fig. S10, A to D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\nanalysis also revealed that, like HDAC1, SphK2 is also associated with the proximal p21\npromoter (Fig. 4A). Depletion of SphK2 suppressed PMA-induced acetylation of histone H3\nat the p21 promoter (Fig. 4C), which further supported the notion that SphK2 regulates\nHDAC1-dependent deacetylation of histone H3 and repression of p21 gene transcription.\n\nWe also examined another target gene that shows increased transcription in cells treated with\nPMA, c-fos (12,20). SphK2 depletion compromised the induction of endogenous c-fos\nexpression by PMA (fig. S11A) and blocked enhanced c-fos promoter activity (fig. S11B).\nOverexpression of SphK2, but not that of catalytically inactive SphK2, increased PMA-induced\nexpression of c-fos mRNA (fig. S11C) and enhanced c-fos promoter activity (fig. S11D).\nFinally, ChIP analysis confirmed the presence of SphK2 on the c-fos promoter and\ndemonstrated that overexpression of SphK2 (but not that of the mutant SphK2 that cannot\nproduce S1P) enhanced H3 acetylation at the c-fos promoter (Fig. 4B). Conversely, down-\nregulation of SphK2 decreased acetylation of histone H3 at the c-fos promoter in response to\nPMA (Fig. 4D).\n\nWe conclude that HDACs appear to be intra-cellular targets of S1P. Our data reveal a new\nparadigm of S1P signaling produced by nuclear sphingolipid metabolism, suggesting an\nimportant function for SphK2 in the nucleus. Abundance of nuclear S1P may influence specific\nand contextual chromatin states that impact gene transcription (Fig. 4E). HDACs have emerged\nas key targets to reverse aberrant epigenetic changes associated with human diseases (18,21),\nsuch as cancer. S1P may therefore influence the delicate balance and dynamic turnover of\nhistone acetylation and the transcription of target genes, linking them to epigenetic regulation\nin response to environmental signals.\n\nSupplementary Material\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by grants from the NIH R37GM043880 and R01CA61774 (S.S.).

(A) Nuclei\nwere isolated from MCF-7 cells transfected with vector (white bar) or SphK2 (gray bar) and\nincubated with [3H]sphingosine (1.5 μM) and ATP (1 mM) for 30 min. Formation of [3H]S1P\nwas determined by differential extraction (22). Abundance of sphingoid bases sphingosine\n(Sph) and dihydrosphingosine (DHS), and their phosphorylated products, S1P and dihydro-\nS1P (DHS1P), in nuclei of vector and SphK2-expressing MCF-7 cells (7 × 106) were\ndetermined by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/\nMS). The data are averages of triplicate determinations and are expressed as picomoles of lipid\n± SD. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences (P < 0.05 by Student’s t test)\nrelative to vector transfectants. (B) Association of SphK2 with chromatin. Equal amounts of\ncytosol, nucleoplasm, and chromatin fractions from MCF-7 cells were separated by SDS–\npolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotted with SphK2-specific\nantibody. Antibodies against H3 and tubulin were used as markers for chromatin and cytosol,\nrespectively. Lysate from MCF-7 cells overexpressing SphK2 was included as a positive\ncontrol (leftmost lane). (C) Association of SphK2 and histone H3. Proteins of nuclear extracts\nfrom MCF-7 cells transfected with vector, V5-SphK2, or catalytically inactive V5-\nSphK2G212E were immunoprecipitated with V5-specific antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE,\nand probed with antibodies against V5 or H3.\n\nHait et al.

(A and B) Effect of S1P and dihydro-S1P on HDAC1 activity.\nHeLa cell nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with control IgG or HDAC1-specific\nantibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed, and HDAC activity was measured in the presence\nof vehicle, 1 μM S1P, 1 μM dihydro-S1P (DHS1P), or 1 μM trichostatin A (TSA). HDAC\nactivities are averages of triplicate determinations ± SD and expressed as arbitrary fluorescence\nunits (AFU).

(B) Activity of recombinant HDAC1 (250\nng) determined in the absence or presence of two concentrations of S1P or dihydro-S1P (0.5\nor 5 μM), sphingosine (5 μM), LPA (5 μM), or TSA (1 μM). (C) Association of HDAC with\nimmobilized S1P. Nuclear extracts (NE) from MCF-7 cells were incubated with control (no\nlipid), LPA, or S1P affinity matrices (as indicated), then washed and bound proteins were\nresolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies against HDAC1 or\nHDAC2.

Relative binding to the promoter is expressed as the percentage of\ninput. Data are means ± SD. **P < 0.01, relative to vector transfectants, *P < 0.01, relative to\nPMA-treated vector transfectants, by Student’s t test.

(E) Model for regulation of\nhistone acetylation and gene transcription by nuclear SphK2 and S1P. PMA stimulates nuclear\nSphK2, which is associated with specific promoter regions, such as those for p21 and c-fos\ngenes, and increases production of S1P. S1P in turn inhibits HDAC1 and HDAC2, which results\nin increased acetylation (Ac) of histone(s) and leads to enhanced gene transcription.\n\nHait et al. Page 9\n\nScience.
