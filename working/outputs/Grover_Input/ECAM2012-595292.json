Previous studies have identified that Terminalia catappa leaf extracts (TCE) exert hepatoprotective, antioxidative,\nantiinflammatory, anticancer, and antimetastatic activities. However, the effects of TCE on HCC and the underlying molecular\nmechanisms of its activities have yet to be fully elucidated. The present study’s findings demonstrate that TCE concentration\ndependently inhibits human HCC migration/invasion. Zymographic and western blot analyses revealed that TCE inhibited\nthe activities and expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Assessment of mRNA levels, using reverse transcriptase\npolymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR, and promoter assays confirmed the inhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9\nexpression in HCC cells. The inhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9 proceeded by upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-\n1 (TIMP-1), as well as suppressing nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and\nactivating protein-1 (AP-1) on the MMP-9 promoter in Huh7 cells. In conclusion, TCE inhibits MMP-9 expression and HCC\ncell metastasis and, thus, has potential use as a chemopreventive agent. Its inhibitory effects are associated with downregulation of\nthe binding activities of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignant\nneoplasm and major cause of cancer-related deaths in Asian\ncountries. A high mortality rate for HCC in Taiwan is princi-\npally caused by uncontrolled tumor invasion and metastasis\n[1]. Cancer cell metastasis involves multiple processes and\nvarious cytophysiological changes, including changes in the\n\nadhesive capability between cells and the extracellular matrix\n(ECM). This involves proteolytic degradation and damaged\nintracellular interaction. Degradation of the ECM by cancer\ncells occurs through proteases, such as serine proteinase\nand the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This leads to\nthe separation of the intercellular matrix to promote the\nmobility of cancer cells, eventually leading to metastasis\n[2]. Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9 or gelatinase B,\n\nmailto:hlchiou@csmu.edu.tw\nmailto:ysf@csmu.edu.tw\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n92 kDa) is the proteases most significantly involved in the\ndegradation of the basement membrane and, thus, in tumor\ninvasion and metastasis. A number of pathological states,\nincluding cancer, inflammation, and vascular diseases, are\nassociated with increased proteinase activities [3, 4]. The\nexpression of MMPs is regulated by various factors, such\nas growth factors, cytokines, and proteinase inhibitors. The\nendogenous tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs)\nare the specific inhibitors of MMPs. Imbalance between\nthe MMPs and TIMPs might, therefore, contribute to\ndegradation or deposition of the ECM [5, 6]. Inhibition of\nMMP-mediated migration or invasion could thus provide a\nmeans of preventing cancer metastasis.\n\nTerminalia is a genus of combretaceous plants widely\ndistributed in tropical and subtropical regions. In several\nAsian countries, physicians have used the leaves, bark, and\nfruit of Terminalia catappa to treat dermatitis and pyresis.\nTerminalia catappa leaf extracts (TCE) contain flavonoids\nand hydrolysable tannins, which have preventive effects\non hepatoma and reduce hepatotoxicity. The antioxidative,\nhepatoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and carcinogenesis-\npreventing effects of TCE could potentially provide ben-\nefits to human health [7–9]. The group’s previous study\nshowed that TCE can inhibit lung cancer metastasis in vivo\nand in vitro [9]. However, the effects of TCE on HCC\ninvasion and metastasis, and the underlying mechanisms\nof the antimetastatic effects, have yet to be evaluated. The\npresent study, therefore, investigated the potential inhibitory\neffects of TCE on hepatocellular carcinoma (Huh7 cell)\ninvasiveness, and the possible mechanisms of TCE-induced\nantimetastatic effects.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Preparation of Terminalia catappa Leaves Extracts (TCE).\nTerminalia catappa leaves were purchased from local herb\nstores in Taichung and the TCE were prepared by an\ninitial condensation followed by lyophilization as described\npreviously [9]. Briefly, 100 g of air-dried leaves were boiled at\n70◦C for 24 h with 500 mL of 50% ethanol. The extraction\nprocedure was repeated twice. Then, solvent was removed\nfrom the combined extract with a vacuum rotary evaporator.\nThe filtrate was then lyophilized and stored at −20◦C.\nFurthermore, the chemical profile of TCE was analyzed by\nusing high-pressure liquid chromatograms (HPLC) mass\nspectrometer as described previously [9]. For subsequent\nexperiments, TCE powder was dissolved in 50% in dimethyl\nsulfoxide (DMSO) to achieve an indicated concentra-\ntion with the highest concentration of DMSO less than\n0.1%.\n\n2.2. Cell Culture and TCE Treatment. HCC (Huh7) cells\nobtained from Food Industry Research and Development\nInstitute (Hsinchu, Taiwan) was cultured in Dulbecco’s mod-\nified Eagle’s medium (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY,\nUSA), 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL\npenicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 400 ng/mL hydro-\ncortisone. All cell cultures were maintained at 37◦C n a\n\nhumidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For TCE treatment,\nappropriate amounts of stock solution of TCE were added\ninto culture medium to achieve the indicated concentrations\nand then incubated with cells for indicated time periods,\nwhereas dimethyl sulfoxide solution without TCE was used\nas blank reagent.\n\n2.3. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). For cell\nviability experiment, a microculture tetrazolium (3-(4,5-d\nimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) col-\norimetric assay was performed to determine the cytotoxi-\ncity of TCE [10, 11]. Huh7 cells were seeded in 24-well\nplates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well and treated with TCE\nat a concentration between 0–100 μg/mL at 37◦C for 24 h.\nAfter the exposure period, the media was removed, and cells\nwere washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then\nincubated with 20 μL MTT (5 mg/mL) (Sigma chemical Co.,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. The viable cell number per dish\nis directly proportional to the production of formazan, which\ncan be measured spectrophotometrically at 563 nm following\nsolubilization with isopropanol.\n\n2.4. In Vitro Wound Closure. Huh7 cells (1 × 105 cells/well)\nwere plated in 6-well plates for 24 h, wounded by scratching\nwith a pipette tip, then incubated with DMEM medium\ncontaining 0.5% FBS and treated with or without TCE (0,\n25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL) for 0, 12, and 24 h. Cells were\nphotographed using a phase-contrast microscope (×100).\n\n2.5. Cell Invasion and Migration Assays. Cell invasion and\nmigration were assayed according to the methods described\nby Yang et al. [12]. After a treatment with TCE (0, 25, 50,\n75, and 100 μg/mL) for 24 h, surviving cells were harvested\nand seeded to Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John,\nMD, USA) at 104 cells/well in serum-free medium and then\nincubated for 24 hours at 37◦C. For invasion assay, 10 μL\nMatrigel (25 mg/50 mL; BD Biosciences, MA, USA) was\napplied to 8 μm pore size polycarbonate membrane filters\nand the bottom chamber contained standard medium. Filters\nwere then air-dried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. The\ninvaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained\nwith 5% Giemsa. Cell numbers were counted under a light\nmicroscope. The migration assay was carried out as described\nin the invasion assay with no coating of Matrigel [13].\n\n2.6. Determination of MMP-9 by Zymography. The activities\nof MMP-9 in conditional medium were measured by gelatin\nzymography protease assays as previously described [12].\nBriefly, collected media of an appropriate volume (adjusted\nby vital cell number) were prepared with SDS sample buffer\nwithout boiling or reduction and subjected to 0.1% gelatin-\n8% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, gels\nwere washed with 2.5% Triton X-100 and then incubated\nin reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 10 mM CaCl2\nand 0.01% NaN3) for 12 h at 37◦C. Then gel was stained with\nCoomassie brilliant blue R-250.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nC\nel\n\nl \nvi\n\nab\nil\n\nit\ny \n\n(%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\no\nl)\n\n \n20\n\n0\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n0 25 50 75 100\n\nTCE concentration (μg/mL)\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n12 hr 24 hr\n\n100 μg/mL\n75 μg/mL\n\n50 μg/mL\n25 μg/mL\nControl\n\n∗\n∗\n\n∗\n∗\n\nN\nu\n\nm\nb\n\ner\n o\n\nf \nm\n\nig\nra\n\nte\nd\n\n c\nel\n\nls\n (\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\no\nl)\n\n0 hr\n\n12 hr\n\n24 hr\n\n0 25 50 75 100\n\nTCE concentration (μg/mL)\n\nTCE concentration (μg/mL)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: Effect of TCE on cell viability and in vitro wound closure in Huh7 cells.

Preparation of Total Cell Lysates and Nuclear Fraction.\nFor total cell lysates preparation, cells were rinsed with PBS\ntwice and scraped with 0.2 mL of cold RIPA buffer containing\nprotease inhibitors cocktail, and then vortexed at 4◦C for\n10 min. Cell lysates were subjected to a centrifugation of\n10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4◦C, and the insoluble pellet was\ndiscarded. Nuclear extracts were obtained using a modifica-\ntion of a previously described method [13]. Briefly, harvested\ncells were scraped and lysed with buffer A (10 mM HEPES,\n10 mM KC1, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2% NP40,\n\n1 mM DTT, and 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride),\nfollowed by vortexing to shear the cytoplasmic membranes\nand nuclear pellets were collected by a centrifugation at\n3000 rpm for 30 s at 4◦C. Nuclear proteins were extracted\nwith high-salt buffer B (20 mM HEPES, 25% glycerol,\n1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM EDTA, 420 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT,\nand 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The protein\nconcentration of total cell lysates and nuclear fraction were\ndetermined by Bradford assay [15].\n\n2.9. Western Blot Analysis.

A\ndifference at P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically\nsignificant and the experiments were repeated three times.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Effects of TCE on Huh7 Cell Viability. Figure 1(a) displays\nthe cytotoxic effects of various concentrations of TCE\n(0 μg/mL to 100 μg/mL) on Huh7 cells. Results from MTT\nassay revealed that TCE did not influence Huh7 cell viability\nat all tested concentrations. A lower TCE concentration range\nwas, thus, used for all subsequent experiments.\n\n3.2. Effects of TCE on Wound Closure, Invasion, and Migration\nof Huh7 Cells In Vitro. Figure 1(b) displays the findings from\nwound closure assay to evaluate the effects of TCE on Huh7\ncell migration, showing representative photographs of Huh7\ncells migrating into scratch wounds following treatment with\nTCE. Figures 2(a) and 2(b) demonstrate the effects of TCE\non cell migration and invasion in Huh7 cells treated with\n0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL TCE for 16 h (cell migration)\n\nand 24 h (cell invasion). Cell migration and invasion assays\nusing a Boyden chamber revealed that TCE induced marked\nreductions in the invasion and migration abilities of Huh7\ncells in a concentration-dependent manner.\n\n3.3. Effects of TCE on the Expression of MMP-9 and Its\nEndogenous Inhibitor. The Huh7 cells were treated with TCE\n(0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 μg/mL) for 24 h, and then subjected\nto gelatin zymography to analyze MMP-9 activity. As shown\nin Figures 3(a)-3(b), TCE treatment reduced MMP-9 activity\nin a dose-dependent manner. Figure 3(c) shows Western blot\nanalysis of the expression of MMP-9 and its endogenous\ninhibitor TIMP-1. The MMP-9 and TIMP-1 protein levels\nwere adjusted using β-actin. Following TCE treatment,\nMMP-9 expression decreased significantly, whereas TIMP-1\nexpression increased (Figure 3(d)).\n\n3.4. Effects of TCE on MMP-9 Transcription. To evaluate the\ninhibitory effects of TCE on MMP-9 expression in Huh7\ncells, Huh7 cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, and\n100 μg/mL TCE for 24 h, and then subjected to reverse trans-\ncriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time\nPCR to analyze mRNA levels. After treatment with various\nconcentrations of TCE, the levels of MMP-9 mRNA showed\nmarked decreases in a concentration-dependent manner\n(Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). Promoter analysis using a luciferase\nassay kit identified significant inhibition of the luciferase\nactivities of MMP-9 (Figure 4(c)). These results indicate that\nTCE regulates the expression of MMP-9, at least partially, at\na transcriptional level.\n\n3.5.

Sequence analysis of the MMP-9 promoter revealed a\nnumber of cis-acting regulatory elements that could poten-\ntially be involved in the regulation of MMP-9 expression,\nincluding NF-κB and AP-1. Chromatin immunoprecipita-\ntion (ChIP) assay then investigated the involvement of these\ntranscription factors in the TCE-induced transcriptional\ninhibition of MMP-9 (Figure 5(a)). Results from quantitative\nreal-time PCR indicated that TCE significantly reduced the\nbinding of NF-κB and AP-1 to the MMP-9 promoters\n(Figure 5(b)).\n\nTo further investigate the involvement of AP-1 and NF-\nκB in the transcriptional regulation of MMP-9 by TCE in\nHuh7 cells, the effects of TCE on nuclear translocation\nof NF-κB, c-fos, and c-Jun were evaluated. Treatment of\nHuh7 cells with 0, 25, and 100 μg/mL TCE reduced nuclear\ntranslocation of NF-κB, and phosphorylation of IκB, c-Fos,\nand c-Jun (Figures 6(a) to 6(c)). These findings indicated\nthat TCE might induce transcriptional inhibition of MMP-\n9 in Huh7 cells by suppressing NF-κB and AP-1 nuclear\ntranslocation and MMP-9 promoter binding activity.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nHerbal products are used worldwide in the prevention and\ntreatment of various chronic diseases, and their potential\nanticancer and antimetastatic effects are currently under\ninvestigation. Terminalia catappa leaf extracts exert a range\nof biological effects on cells, including antioxidant and hep-\natoprotective activity on hepatocytes and liver mitochondria,\nand preventive activity against hepatocyte apoptosis [16–19].\nIn previous studies, water extracts of TCE could effectively\n\nreduce carbon-tetrachloride- (CCl4-) induced hepatotoxicity\nand bleomycin-induced genotoxicity of Chinese hamster\novary cells [20, 21]. Tang et al. reported that ethanol extracts\nof TCE contain higher active components than water extracts\nof TCE [8]. In an earlier study, the same group identified that\nchloroform extracts of TCE induce hepatoprotective effects\nthat might be related to the regulation of liver IL-6 gene\nexpression [22]. Different methods of extraction of TCE can,\ntherefore, influence the physiological nature of the active\ncompound and modify its effects directly.\n\nAs described in previous studies, the protective activities\nof TCE against liver mitochondrial damage induced by car-\nbon tetrachloride (CCl4) might be related to the inhibition of\nIL-6 gene overexpression [20, 23]. Studies have also suggested\nthat its protective effects might be related to the scavenging\nof reactive oxygen species (ROS) [20, 21, 24]. The groups\nof Fan and Tang speculated that TCE might prevent DNA\ndamage and carcinogenesis by inhibiting ROS generation\nor reducing DNA adduct formation [19, 25]. In the study\nof Wen et al., T. catappa L. hydrophilic extract (TCLW)\ninhibited MMP-1, MMP-3, and MMP-9 expressions at a\nrange of concentrations and promoted the expression of type\nI procollagen by inhibiting MMP-1, -3, and -9 activities.\nThis afforded it antiaging activity and potential cosmetic\nuse [24]. Ko et al. also described that SC-CO2 extract of\nTCE exhibited potent antimutagenicity and demonstrated\nhigher cytotoxicity against HCC cells than against normal\nliver cells. Therefore, TCE is a potent antioxidant and might\nprovide a novel source of biomedicinal phytochemicals for\ncancer prevention [26]. However, constraints on the use of\nherbal products for prevention of cancer metastasis have yet\nto be cleared, and the underlying biological mechanisms of\n\n\n\n10 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\ntheir activities have yet to be fully characterized. Our group’s\nprevious studies identified that TCE induces antimetastatic\neffects in lung cancer (A549, Lewis lung carcinoma, LLC) and\noral cancer cells (SCC-4) [5, 9]. The present study’s results\nindicate that TCE also exerts inhibitory effects on HCC cell\nmetastasis through regulation of MMP-9. Morioka et al.\nreported that TCE has a potent short-term chemopreventive\neffect on biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis and might\nbe associated with inhibition of the development of aber-\nrant crypt foci (ACF) and beta-catenin-accumulated crypts\n(BCACs) [27]. It is, therefore, possible that other proteases\nare involved in the antimetastatic effects of TCE on HCC.\nFurther investigation is needed to confirm the involvement\nof other antimetastatic mechanisms, and changes in the\nexpression of proteases, in TCE-induced effects.\n\nTranscription of the MMP-9 gene is regulated by\nupstream sequences, including motifs corresponding to NF-\nκB or AP-1 binding sites [6, 28, 29]. In the present study,\nTCE inhibited the binding of NF-κB and AP-1 to the\nMMP-9 promoter in Huh7 cells. The transcription nuclear\nfactors NF-κB and AP-1 can promote tumorigenesis and are\nlinked to invasion and metastasis. In the study by Aggarwal,\ninhibition of NF-κB and AP-1 activities was effective in the\nprevention and treatment of cancer [30]. This result was\nsimilar to the group’s previous finding that norcantharidin\n(NCTD) exerted inhibitory effects on metastasis in HCC cells\n[6]. Activation of NF-κB occurs through the phosphorylation\nof IκBα. This releases NF-κB, which then translocates from\nthe cytosol to the nucleus to regulate gene expression at a\ntranscriptional level. In the present study, TCE treatment\nresulted in inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity,\naccompanied by inhibition of IκBα phosphorylation, leading\nto the downregulation of MMP-9.\n\nIn conclusion, the present study’s findings demonstrate\nthat TCE exerts inhibitory effects on several critical stages\nof metastasis, including cell invasion and migration, by\nregulating the activities of metastasis-associated proteases\nand their natural inhibitors. Terminalia Catappa leaf extracts\nmight, therefore, have potential use in the development\nof preventive and treatment agents for cancer metastasis.\nTerminalia catappa leaf extracts inhibit NF-κB and AP-1\nDNA binding activities effectively, resulting in the down-\nregulation of MMP-9 expression and the inhibition of\nmetastasis (Figure 7). By targeting the signal transduction\nmediators and transcriptional factors involved in the TCE\nantimetastatic process in human hepatoma cells, it might\nbe possible to develop specific mediators to inhibit cell\nmetastasis. Further in vivo analysis is needed to confirm\nthe effectiveness of TCE in the prevention or treatment of\nhepatoma invasion or migration.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nTCE: Terminalia catappa leaf extracts\nECM: Extracellular matrix\nMMP: Matrix metalloproteinase\nTIMP: Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase\n\nHCC: Hepatocellular carcinoma\nChIP: Chromatin immunoprecipitation.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis study was supported by a Research Grant from Chung\nShan Medical University Hospital, Taiwan (CSH-2012-C-\n006).\n\nReferences\n\n[1] T.
