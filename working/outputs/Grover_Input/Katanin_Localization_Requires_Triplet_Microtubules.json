Esparza, Eileen O’Toole, Linya Li, Thomas H. Giddings, Jr., Benjamin Kozak, Alison J. Albee,\n\nSusan K. Dutcher*\n\nDepartment of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nCentrioles and basal bodies are essential for a variety of cellular processes that include the recruitment of proteins to these\nstructures for both centrosomal and ciliary function. This recruitment is compromised when centriole/basal body assembly\nis defective. Mutations that cause basal body assembly defects confer supersensitivity to Taxol. These include bld2, bld10,\nbld12, uni3, vfl1, vfl2, and vfl3. Flagellar motility mutants do not confer sensitivity with the exception of mutations in the p60\n(pf19) and p80 (pf15) subunits of the microtubule severing protein katanin. We have identified additional pf15 and bld2 (e-\ntubulin) alleles in screens for Taxol sensitivity. Null pf15 and bld2 alleles are viable and are not essential genes in\nChlamydomonas. Analysis of double mutant strains with the pf15-3 and bld2-6 null alleles suggests that basal bodies in\nChlamydomonas may recruit additional proteins beyond katanin that affect spindle microtubule stability. The bld2-5 allele is\na hypomorphic allele and its phenotype is modulated by nutritional cues. Basal bodies in bld2-5 cells are missing proximal\nends. The basal body mutants show aberrant localization of an epitope-tagged p80 subunit of katanin. Unlike IFT proteins,\nkatanin p80 does not localize to the transition fibers of the basal bodies based on an analysis of the uni1 mutant as well as\nthe lack of colocalization of katanin p80 with IFT74. We suggest that the triplet microtubules are likely to play a key role in\nkatanin p80 recruitment to the basal body of Chlamydomonas rather than the transition fibers that are needed for IFT\nlocalization.\n\nCitation: Esparza JM, O’Toole E, Li L, Giddings TH Jr, Kozak B, et al.

Taxol is used for treatment of a\n\nvariety of cancers as it blocks mitosis [1]. In the unicellular green\n\nalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Schibler and Huang showed that a\n\nmutation in b-tubulin (tub2-1) confers resistance to colchicine and\nsupersensitivity to Taxol. They concluded that the microtubules in\n\ntub2-1 cells are hyperstabilized, which causes the Taxol supersen-\n\nsitive phenotype [2]. Katanin is a microtubule severing protein\n\n[3,4]. It is composed of two subunits; the p60 subunit is a catalytic\n\nAAA ATPase and the p80 subunit targets the heterodimer to the\n\ncentrosome in metazoans. Katanin influences microtubule dy-\n\nnamics through its ability to sever microtubules. This property is\n\nobserved in Drosophila S2 mitotic spindles [5] and C. elegans meiotic\n\nspindles [6]. Sharma and colleagues [7] showed that loss of either\n\nthe catalytic (p60) or the targeting (p80) subunit of katanin in\n\nTetrahymena results in short cilia and a knockout allele of p60\n\nconfers Taxol supersensitivity. Thus, there appear to be several\n\npathways in cells that when mutated confer Taxol sensitivity.\n\nBecause katanin localizes to the centrosome, this localization\n\nseems likely to require intact centrioles/basal bodies. Centrioles\n\nare a component of the metazoan centrosome and help to recruit\n\npericentriolar material (PCM) that nucleates both cytoplasmic and\n\nspindle microtubules [8,9]. Functional centrioles and intact\n\nsubdistal appendages are required for the recruitment of PCM\n\nproteins in animals. SPD-2, SPD-5 and SAS-4, which were first\n\nidentified in C. elegans and localize to centrioles by immuno-\n\nelectron microscopy, play essential roles in centriole biogenesis and\n\nthey are needed to recruit c-tubulin and aurora kinase to the PCM\n[9–11]. Sas-4 is thought to play a key role as it shows binding to\n\nab-tubulin dimers [12] as well as with Sas-5 and Cep152/Asl.\nRecruitment in Drosophila requires Asl (Cep152) and D-Spd2\n\n(Cep192) [13]. The SPD-2/Cep192 homolog and centrosomin\n\n(Cnn), localizes to the centrioles and spd2 mutants show\n\nsignificantly reduced concentrations of several centrosomal pro-\n\nteins that include Cnn, c-tubulin, Dd4/Dgrip91, and D-TACC\n[8,14]. Subdistal appendages on mature centrioles contain ninein\n\n[15]. Tissue culture cells depleted of ninein by siRNA show a\n\nsignificant reduction in c-tubulin and the complete absence of the\nprotein, astrin, at the centrosome [16]. Thus, defective centrioles\n\nor depletion of centriolar proteins prevent recruitment of some or\n\nall pericentriolar proteins.\n\nWhen a centriole matures and converts to a basal body, it\n\nrecruits intraflagellar transport (IFT) proteins and motors [17,18].\n\nJust as centriolar proteins are required to recruit PCM compo-\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940\n\n\n\nnents for cytoplasmic and spindle microtubules, defective basal\n\nbodies disrupt localization of IFT proteins. In wild-type Chlamy-\n\ndomonas cells, IFT proteins accumulate around the basal body in a\n\nhorseshoe-shaped structure [19,20]. The bld2-1 mutant has an\n\nincompletely assembled basal body [21], and although the IFT\n\nproteins are present, their localization is diffuse rather than in the\n\nhorseshoe-shaped pattern.\n\nWe reasoned that Chlamydomonas mutants with basal body\n\ndefects that lack the ability to dock intraflagellar transport proteins\n\ncorrectly could also fail to localize PCM components properly. We\n\nreport a new phenotype that is associated with basal body\n\nbiogenesis defects; these mutant strains show increased sensitivity\n\nto the microtubule-stabilizing drug, Taxol. We hypothesize that\n\nlack of localization or mislocalization of PCM-targeted proteins\n\ncontributes to the Taxol supersensitivity phenotype.\n\nStrains with basal body integrity defects fall into several classes.\n\nThe first class shows defects in the assembly of the microtubule\n\nblades and includes bld2, bld10, bld12, uni2 and uni3. The bld2,\n\nbld10, and bld12 mutants lack complete microtubule blades, and\n\nuni3 mutants lack triplet microtubules [22–25]. The uni1 and uni2\n\nmutant shows a defect in the transition zone [26,27] and the uni1;\n\nuni2 double mutant affects the change from triplet to doublet\n\nmicrotubules [28]. The second class of mutants shows defects in\n\nthe fibers that are required to maintain proper basal body\n\norientation and segregation and include vfl1, vfl2, and vfl3 [29–31].\n\nWe screened existing basal body and flagellar mutants for\n\nincreased sensitivity to the microtubule-stabilizing drug, Taxol, as\n\nwell as performed several screens for additional mutants that\n\nconfer Taxol sensitivity. We find that katanin mutants in\n\nChlamydomonas confer Taxol sensitivity and that mutants with\n\nbasal body defects confer Taxol sensitivity, and have abnormal\n\nrecruitment of the p80 katanin subunit to the basal bodies.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell Culture, Genetic and Phenotypic Analyses\nChlamydomonas reinhardtii growth conditions [32], matings [33],\n\nand revertant isolation using ultraviolet irradiation [34] were\n\nperformed as previously described. Aflagellate strains were mated\n\nwith 100 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,\n\nMO) and 30 mM isobutyl 1-methylxanthine (Aldrich, Milwaukee,\n\nWI) [33]. For each sample, 200 cells were counted after fixation\n\nwith 1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Taxol\n\n(paciltaxel, Sigma-Aldrich) was tested at concentrations varying\n\nfrom 2 mM to 18 mM in DMSO. Media with Taxol were kept in\nthe dark for storage and in yellow Lucite boxes during growth to\n\nprevent its break down [35]. To determine if cells recovered from\n\nexposure to Taxol, cells were stained with 0.01% Trypan blue\n\n(Sigma-Aldrich). Oryzalin was a gift of Eli Lilly and Company.\n\nOryzalin and colchicine (Sigma-Aldrich) were tested at 0.5–1 mM\nand 1–5 mM, respectively. The drugs, canavanine, cycloheximide,\nglyphosate, tunicamycin, methionine sulfoximine, anisomycin,\n\nerthyromycin, spectinomycin, 0.1% NP-40, 5-methyl anthranilic\n\nacid, and 3-aminopyridine were tested at a 2, 3, and 4 fold higher\n\nand lower than in [36]. Cleavage furrow placement measurements\n\nwere performed as previously described [34], except ImageJ (NIH)\n\nwas used to measure the area of the cells. Permutation tests were\n\nperformed using 1000 permutations to determine significance\n\n[37].\n\nThe tub2-1 (b2-tubulin mutant that was first published as colR4,\npf15-1, pf19-1, uni2-2, vfl1-1, vfl2-1 and vfl3-1 strains were obtained\n\nfrom the Chlamydomonas Genetics Center. The PF15 vector (pPF15)\n\nwas obtained from E. Smith (Dartmouth University). The bld10-1\n\nand bld12-1 strains were obtained from M. Hirono (University of\n\nTokyo).\n\nFor synchrony, cells were grown in high salt medium [38] with a\n\n14:10 light: dark cycle as described previously [39] at 21uC and\nwere maintained at a density of 1–36105 cells/ml. Samples were\ntaken at 15 and 30 min time points beginning at 15 min into the\n\ndark phase.\n\nMutagenesis and Isolation of new bld2 Alleles\nTo isolate new alleles by noncomplementation, bld2-2 NIT2\n\nac17/BLD2 nit2-1 AC17 diploid cells were used as previously\n\ndescribed [34]. Diploid cells were grown on rich (R) solid medium\n\nand subjected to 75,000 mJoules/cm2 of ultraviolet irradiation and\nallowed to recover in the dark for 24 hours. Each plate was divided\n\ninto 12 sections and each section was placed individually into\n\n20 ml R liquid medium in 256150 mm culture tubes. Cells at the\nbottom of the tube were transferred to new tubes containing 20 ml\n\nR medium every 2–3 days for a total of 12 times and 10 ml from\nthe bottom of the last tube was plated onto solid R medium.\n\nIndividual colonies were picked into 2.5 ml R liquid medium and\n\nassayed for their ability to oppose gravity.\n\nTo differentiate between mutations resulting from chromosome\n\nloss or mitotic recombination, dominant enhancers, and new\n\nalleles we took advantage of the absence of a FokI restriction\n\nenzyme site in the bld2-2 allele. PCR amplification of the region\n\naround the mutation and digestion with the FokI restriction\n\nenzyme produces both the digested wild-type product and uncut\n\nbld2-2 product in the heterozygous parental diploid. If mitotic\n\nrecombination or chromosome loss occurs, only the bld2-2\n\nfragment would be amplified by PCR [34].\n\nTo isolate new alleles in haploid strains, an insertional mutant\n\ncollection with 3000 independent strains, which was a kind gift\n\nfrom Dr. Lauren Mets (University of Chicago), was used. It was\n\nconstructed in the CC-125 strain by transformation with the ble\n\ngene [40]. The collection was screened by replica plating using\n\nRepliPlate pads (FMC, Rockland, ME) onto solid R medium with\n\n8 mM Taxol at 25uC. Plates containing Taxol were maintained in\nyellow Lucite boxes [35].\n\nPCR and Sequencing\nGenomic DNA from bld2-5 and bld2-6 cells was isolated using a\n\nmodified protocol of the Genisol Maxi-Prep Kit (Abgene, Rock-\n\nford, IL). Between 10\n5\n–10\n\n6\ncells were suspended in 50 ml of 1X\n\nTris-EDTA buffer with a 100-fold reduction in the suggested\n\nvolumes. Primers for sequencing were described previously and\n\nare available upon request. REDTaq DNA polymerase (Sigma-\n\nAldrich) was used with the following conditions: 31 cycles of 1 min\n\nat 95uC, 1 min at 57uC and 1 min at 72uC followed by a 10 min\nextension at 72uC. PCR products were column purified (QIA-\nGEN, Valencia, CA) and then cycle sequenced using the following\n\nconditions: 2 min at 96uC and 32 cycles of 96uC for 10 sec, 50uC\nfor 5 sec and 60uC for 4 min. Sequencing reactions were\nprecipitated with the addition of 125 mM EDTA and 100%\n\nethanol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT).\n\nReactions were centrifuged, washed with 70% ethanol and dried\n\nbefore the addition of Hi-Di formamide (Applied Biosystems,\n\nFoster City, CA). After 2 min incubation at 95uC, the reactions\nwere loaded onto a 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).\n\nSequenced data were aligned and analyzed with Sequencher\n\n(Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, MI). Genomic DNA from the eight\n\nintragenic revertants was isolated and sequenced as described\n\nabove with primers that produce a 367 bp fragment (tns-28-1f;\n\n(GTGACAACGGGGAACTAAGC and tns-28-1r:GA-\n\nCAGCTGCTGCATTGTGAT).

The PF15 NOT primers\n\ncontain the NotI restriction enzyme site and it changes the last\n\namino acid of PF15 from a leucine to an asparagine. These\n\nfragments were amplified using Klentaq Long and Accurate\n\npolymerase using the following conditions: 30 cycles of 1 min at\n\n95uC, 1 min at 56uC and 1 min at 68uC, followed by a 30 min\nextension at 68uC. The fragments were purified from a 2%\nagarose gel (Gel Purification Kit; MO BIO Laboratories Inc.,\n\nCarlsbad, CA). The above PCR was repeated using equal\n\nquantities of each PCR product and the PF15 FRAG primers to\n\nincorporate a NotI restriction site that was used to clone the HA tag\n\ninto the gene (Figure S1). The resulting approximately 500 bp\n\nfragment was gel purified and cloned into the pCR4-TOPO\n\nvector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Transformed colonies were\n\nverified by colony PCR and used to isolate plasmid DNA with the\n\nFigure 1. Basal body mutant strains show supersensitivity to Taxol.

Images\n\nwere captured every 1u over a 660u range using a Gatan\n2 K62 K CCD camera at a pixel size of 1 nm. The grid was\nrotated 90u, and a second tilt series was acquired. Dual-axis\ntomographic reconstruction was carried out using the IMOD\n\nsoftware package as previously described [46,49,50]. Briefly, the\n\ntilted views were aligned using the positions of the colloidal gold\n\nparticles, and tomograms were calculated using an R-weighted\n\nback projection algorithm. The two tomograms were then aligned\n\nto each other and combined. Finally, dual-axis tomograms from\n\nserial sections were aligned and combined using the methods\n\ndescribed by O’Toole et al. [46]. A total of 7 dual-axis tomograms\n\nwere reconstructed to examine the 3-D fine structure of the bld2-5\n\nbasal bodies.\n\nIndirect Immunofluorescence\nInterphase cells were treated with autolysin to remove cell walls\n\n[51,52] and resuspended in MT buffer [53] and 12% hexylene\n\nglycol [32] and applied to slides pretreated with poly-L-lysine\n\n(Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min at RT and dried.

Similar to the\n\nloss of the p60 katanin subunit in Tetrahymena [7], these mutants\n\nconfer sensitivity to Taxol (Figure 1). Wild-type cells arrest as\n\nswollen cells on 18 mM Taxol medium, while pf15-1 and pf19-1\nmutant cells become swollen and do not divide on 8 to 18 mM\nTaxol media (Figure 1C, G). We screened other mutants with\n\ndefects in axonemal substructures needed for motility (pf2, pf9,\n\npf14, pf16, pf17, pf18, oda2, ida3) [55,57,58]and only the two\n\nkatanin mutants confer Taxol supersensitivity.\n\nWe next examined the role of basal bodies in this phenotype.\n\nThe bld2-1 [34], uni3-1 [22], bld10-1 [23], bld12-1 [25], vfl1 [30],\n\nvfl2-1 [31], and vfl3 [29] mutations confer Taxol supersensitivity\n\n(Figure 1A, B), while the uni1-2 [26] and the uni2-2 [27] mutants\n\ndo not confer supersensitivity. Since a majority of these strains\n\nhave a high proportion of aflagellate cells, we asked if the Taxol\n\nphenotype was related to the aflagellate phenotype or the basal\n\nbody phenotype. Mutants that lack flagella due to defects in IFT\n\nproteins and motors (bld1, ift80 at 21uC and fla8, fla10, fla11, fla15,\nfla17 at 32uC) [20,59–65] do not show Taxol supersensitivity\n(Figure 1A, B). To ask if the Taxol supersensitivity reflects a\n\ngeneral defect in drug uptake or export, we examined the bld2-1\n\nand pf15-1 strains for resistance or sensitivity to other inhibitors\n\n(see Materials and Methods for a list). No resistance or\n\nsupersensitivity was observed, which suggests that the Taxol\n\nsupersensitivity of the bld2 and pf15 alleles does not result from\n\ndefective import or export. In summary, multiple basal body\n\nmutants and the katanin mutants confer Taxol sensitivity. The\n\nwild-type strains show similar swelling but require increased\n\nconcentrations of Taxol (Figure 1 C–J).\n\nIt is likely that multiple proteins may require intact basal bodies\n\nfor localization and some of these may influence microtubule\n\ndynamics. Thus, the Taxol phenotype of the basal body mutants\n\ncould arise from a failure to recruit katanin or a failure to recruit\n\nkatanin and other proteins. This can be tested in double mutants\n\nof null mutants of katanin and basal body proteins. Therefore, we\n\nsought to identify null alleles of pf15 and bld2.\n\nIsolation of pf15-3 as a Taxol Supersensitive Mutant\nWild-type cells were mutagenized with ultraviolet light and 100\n\nindependent, nonmotile strains were isolated and 12 of these\n\nconfer Taxol supersensitivity. One of these strains had immotile\n\nflagella. Three lines of evidence show that it carries a new pf15\n\nallele. The strain was mapped and is tightly linked to the PF15\n\nlocus in 36 tetrads. The gene was sequenced and a C to T change\n\nwas observed that generates a nonsense codon at amino acid Q59.\n\nThe immotile cilia defect and the Taxol supersensitivity is rescued\n\nby the PF15::HA transgene (described below) in 17 independent\n\ntransformants. The rescued strains have flagella with normal\n\nlength and motility. The new allele is likely to be a null allele and\n\nthe phenotype of the new pf15-3 strain has similar phenotypes to\n\nthe original pf15-1 allele, although the presence of central pair\n\nmicrotubules has not been determined in the pf15-3 mutant.\n\nIsolation of a Taxol Supersensitive bld2-6 Allele\nA collection of 3000 mutant strains made by insertional\n\nmutagenesis with the ble gene, which confers Zeocin resistance,\n\n[40] was screened for the failure to form colonies on 8 mM Taxol\nmedium. Thirty-five strains showed Taxol supersensitivity and\n\nwere crossed with a wild-type strain (CC-124) to determine if the\n\ninsertional ble marker cosegregates with the Taxol phenotype.\n\nCosegregation of Zeocin resistance and Taxol supersensitivity was\n\nobserved in only one strain (strain ble12), which suggests that the\n\nselection on Zeocin medium was highly mutagenic as this high\n\nfrequency of a lack of cosegregation is not observed in other\n\ninsertional collections. In the ble12 strain, the Taxol phenotype\n\n(Figure 1A, B) and resistance to Zeocin cosegregates in 370 tetrads.\n\nThis strain has a third phenotype; it completely lacks flagella\n\n(Table 1) and this phenotype cosegregates as well. The three\n\nphenotypes map to linkage group III near the NIT2 locus based on\n\ncrosses to CC-1952. The ble12 strain fails to complement the bld2-\n\n2 and bld2-5 mutations (see below) for the Taxol and flagellar\n\nphenotypes in 8 independent diploid strains for each allele. It also\n\nfails to complement the bld2-2 mutation for the meiotic phenotype;\n\nno viable progeny were recovered from 104 tetrads of this cross.\n\nPCR with 21 primer pairs in this region revealed that ble12 carries\n\na 12.6 kb deletion that removes the e-tubulin gene and the coding\nregion of the PRMT1 gene, which encodes a protein methyltrans-\n\nferase protein (Table S2). The ble12 mutant allele is named bld2-6.\n\nbld2; pf15 Double Mutants have an Additive Phenotype\nThe Taxol phenotype of the bld2 alleles and the pf15 strains is\n\nsimilar and both are unable to grow on 8 mM Taxol containing\nmedium. Double mutants were constructed to ask if the phenotype\n\nof double mutants is more severe than either mutant alone. If there\n\nare other proteins that must be recruited, then an additive or\n\nsynthetic phenotype should be observed using the two null alleles.\n\nWild-type, pf15-3, bld2-6, pf15-3; bld2-6, bld2-6; pf15-1, and bld2-6;\n\npf15-3 were grown on 0, 4, 6, 10 mM Taxol containing medium.\nAll strains grow on 4 mM and only the bld2-6, pf15-1 and the bld2-\n6; pf15-3 double mutant strains fail to grow on 6 mM Taxol\ncontaining medium while the single mutant strains form colonies\n\non this concentration (Figure 1K). This additive phenotype\n\nsuggests that the recruitment of other proteins besides katanin\n\np80 may affect microtubule dynamics. This is not surprising in\n\nthat over 100 proteins have postulated to reside at the centrosome\n\n[66].\n\nCharacterization of the bld2-4 allele\nWe had previously reported that e-tubulin is an essential gene\n\nbased on the bld2-4 allele [34]. The bld2-4 allele is an insertional\n\nFigure 6. Katanin p80 is absent or diffusely localized in the bld2 mutant strains.

Genetic\n\nanalysis showed that the bld2-4 allele could only be recovered in a\n\ndisomic background, which suggested that e-tubulin was an\nessential gene in Chlamydomonas. The isolation of the bld2-6 brought\n\ninto question if e-tubulin is an essential gene. To ask if the BLD2\ntransgene is sufficient to rescue the lethal phenotype [34], we used\n\nthe disomic bld2-1; bld2-4 in a series of crosses (Figure S2). We\n\nfound that two copies of the BLD2 gene are necessary to rescue the\n\nmeiotic lethal phenotype and that the BLD2 transgene fails to\n\nrescue the mitotic lethality. To ask if the insertion is associated\n\nwith a deletion and to determine the extent of the deletion,\n\nprogeny obtained from a cross with the polymorphic strain, CC-\n\n1952, were used. Progeny were scored by the presence of the NIT2\n\nallele from the CC-1952 parent, the absence of the bld2-1 allele,\n\nthe presence of the BLD2 transgene. The extent of the deletion was\n\nestimated by the presence/absence of heterozygosity of physical\n\nmarkers surrounding the BLD2 gene (Table S1). The deletion\n\nextends from position 4125635 on chromosome 3 to between\n\n4026909 and 4021900, which removes 28 predicted genes. The\n\ndominant meiotic lethality is likely to be due to the loss of multiple\n\ngenes given that the transgene rescues the meiotic phenotype of\n\nbld2-6 (see below). Rescue of the mitotic lethality of bld2-4 is likely\n\nto require additional flanking DNA and thus e-tubulin is not an\nessential gene as reported previously [34].\n\nIsolation and Identification of the bld2-5 Allele\nConcurrently, we identified an additional bld2 allele using a\n\nnoncomplementation screen. A screen of phenotypically wild-type\n\nheterozygous BLD2/bld2 diploid strains produced six strains that\n\nfailed to swim. Non-complementation screens produce several\n\noutcomes in addition to new alleles, which include mitotic\n\nrecombination, chromosome loss and unlinked dominant enhanc-\n\ners [34]. Two of the mutant strains resulted from mitotic\n\nrecombination or chromosome loss based on the loss of the FokI\n\nrestriction site (see Material and Methods). The remaining four\n\nstrains remained heterozygous at the BLD2 locus and were mated\n\nto a bld2 strain to determine if the new mutations were new alleles\n\nor unlinked dominant enhancers. Two of the mutants produced\n\nswimming progeny that suggest an unlinked dominant enhancer.\n\nThe other two strains did not produce swimming progeny, which\n\nsuggests new alleles. One of these strains (4-1) was characterized.\n\nThe 4-1 mutant strain was backcrossed twice to wild-type cells\n\nto remove unlinked mutations and to restore euploidy as judged by\n\ngreater than 86% meiotic viability. The backcrossed 4-1 strain\n\nfailed to oppose to gravity and lacked flagella and the aflagellate\n\nphenotype was used for mapping. The mutation failed to\n\nrecombine with the bld2-1 allele in 210 complete tetrads. We\n\nanalyzed 1571 progeny from the cross of 4-1 to the polymorphic\n\nstrain, CC-1952 [67] using dCAPs markers (Table S2). The 4-1\n\nmutation maps to a 54.1 kb region that includes the BLD2 gene\n\n[68] and gives a value of 102 kb per map unit for this region.\n\nWe sequenced e-tubulin from the 4-1 strain and found a T to A\ntransition that changes an isoleucine to an asparagine at amino\n\nacid 163 (I163N).

The FokI restriction\n\nenzyme digest assay (see Materials and Methods) differentiates\n\nbetween swimming progeny with the BLD2 transgene and the\n\nbld2-1 allele (heterozygous) or the 4-1 allele (homozygous).\n\nApproximately one-half of the swimming progeny show the\n\nhomozygous digestion pattern predicted for the 4-1 strain and the\n\nremainder shows the heterozygous pattern of wild-type and bld2-1\n\n(n = 6; data not shown). Thus, the transgene rescues the flagellar\n\nphenotype of the 4-1 allele to the same extent as it rescues the bld2-\n\n1 allele (see Table 1). Unlike the other bld2 alleles, the 4-1 allele\n\ndoes not display a meiotic phenotype in four homoallelic or 16\n\nheteroallelic meiotic crosses of independent meiotic progeny.\n\nThe isoleucine is not highly conserved in e-tubulin from a\ndiverse range of organisms (7 of 28), therefore we screened for\n\nreversion of the aflagellate phenotype to provide further evidence\n\nthat this change was responsible for the phenotypes. Cells were\n\nmutagenized with ultraviolet light and 25 independent strains that\n\nswim were isolated. In crosses of these swimming strains to wild-\n\ntype cells, the aflagellate phenotype was not recovered in 8 of the\n\n25 strains in at least 10 tetrads; these are likely to be intragenic\n\nrevertants or tightly linked suppressors. The other 17 strains\n\nsegregated the aflagellate phenotype, which indicates that they\n\ncontain extragenic suppressor mutations. The characterization of\n\nthese extragenic suppressors will be reported elsewhere. To\n\ndetermine if the mutation in the 4-1 strain is changed in the\n\nrevertants, a 367 bp fragment containing the I163N mutation was\n\nsequenced. Four of the strains convert the asparagine back to\n\nisoleucine; these are true revertants. The remaining four strains\n\nare pseudorevertants. Two strains (T42 and T16) change the\n\nasparagine to serine (N163S) and the other two strains (T33 and\n\nT29) convert the serine at position 144 to a glycine (S144G, I163N),\n\nbut retain the asparagine. The amino acids from e-tubulin are\ncompared to the corresponding amino acids of the b-tubulin\ncrystal structure using Modeller [69]. The isoleucine of e-tubulin\nlies in a hydrophobic region and the S144 lies in loop between a b-\nstrand (B4) and a a-helix (H3), which is a part of the nucleotide\nbinding region [70]. The change of a hydrophobic isoleucine to a\n\nhydrophilic asparagine should greatly change the properties of this\n\nregion. In the T42 and T16 strains, asparagine is mutated to the\n\nsmaller and more neutral amino acid serine. The identification of\n\na mutation in the coding region of e-tubulin, the rescue of the\nphenotype with a wild-type e-tubulin transgene and the identifi-\ncation of both true and pseudorevertants suggest that the 4-1 strain\n\nis a new e-tubulin allele that we call bld2-5. Furthermore, the\npseudorevertants identify new bld2 alleles: the T42 and T16\n\npseudorevertants are named bld2-7 and bld2-8 and the T33 and\n\nT29 pseudorevertants are named bld2-9 and bld2-10. The bld2-5\n\nstrain with an extra copy of BLD2 (e-tubulin) as well the bld2-7 and\nbld2-9 intragenic revertants do not show the Taxol supersensitivity\n\nphenotype (Figure 1A, B).\n\nPhenotypic Analysis of the bld2-5 and Pseudorevertant\nStrains\n\nThe bld2-5 strain exhibits a less severe flagellar assembly defect\n\nthan observed in previously described bld2 alleles. Ninety-five\n\npercent of the bld2-5 cells are aflagellate, but 4% of the cells have\n\none flagellum and 1% has two flagella in logarithmically grown\n\ncells (n = 200) (Table 1). Surprisingly, when bld2-5 cells are\n\ndeprived of nitrogen and arrested in G1 of the cell cycle as gametic\n\ncells, 20.5% of the cells assemble at least one flagellum. Changing\n\nthe cell cycle time by growing cells at 14uC or 32uC does not\nchange the number of flagellated cells (Table 1), which suggests the\n\nbld2-5 allele is not temperature-sensitive, but may be modulated by\n\nnutritional cues. This is the only bld2 allele that shows this\n\nphenotype.\n\nIn wild-type strains, centrin is a component of the distal striated\n\nfiber that connects the distal ends of the basal bodies, the stellate\n\nfibers of the transition zone, and extends as fibers from the basal\n\nbody to the nucleus (the nucleo-basal body connector) [71]\n\n(Figure 2A, B). In bld2-1 strains, centrin collapses on or around the\n\nnucleus [34,72]. Collapsed centrin occurs in 41% of bld2-5 cells\n\n(n = 50, Figure 2C) while the remainder has a wild-type\n\nlocalization pattern (Figure 2D). It appears that the presence of\n\nan extended nucleo-basal body connector does not guarantee\n\nflagellar assembly.\n\nIn wild-type strains, acetylated a-tubulin labeling of rootlet\nmicrotubules forms a cruicate pattern [32,73] Figure 3A, B). The\n\nbld2-5 strain, like other bld2 strains, shows disorganized rootlet\n\nmicrotubules in 95% of the cells (Figure 3C, D). The 5% of cells\n\nwith wild-type rootlet microtubules are likely to have intact\n\nmicrotubule blades at the proximal end of the basal bodies [74].\n\nProper placement of the cleavage furrow depends on both centrin\n\nand rootlet microtubules [75]. Defects in these cytoskeletal\n\nstructures cause aberrant cleavage furrow placement [76]. The\n\narea of newly divided daughter cells was measured to determine if\n\nthe cleavage furrows were properly placed, since wild-type cells\n\nproduce daughters with equal sizes [34]. Based on measurements\n\nof 100 pairs of cells, the bld2-5 strain produces daughters with\n\nsignificantly different areas (p = 0.001), which indicates a defect in\n\ncleavage furrow placement (Figure 4A). The sum of bld2-5 sister\n\ncells’ areas is significantly smaller than wild-type (p = 5610214,\nFigure 4B), which may suggest that the cells divide earlier than in\n\nwild-type cells. Both rescued transformants (bld2-5; BLD2TG) and\n\nintragenic revertants (bld2-7 and bld2-9) assemble comparable\n\nnumbers of flagella as wild-type cells (Table 1). They display wild-\n\ntype centrin localization (Figure 2E–J). The transgene containing\n\nstrain has wild-type rootlet microtubules (Figure 3E–J), but\n\napproximately 50% of rootlet microtubule bundles (n = 15) in\n\nthe intragenic revertants appear to be slightly splayed at their ends\n\n(Figure 3H).\n\nThe bld2-6 allele also shows centrin collapsed on the nucleus\n\n(Figure 2K, L) and disorganized rootlet microtubules (Figure 3M,\n\nN). bld2-6 cells are 100% aflagellate as vegetative or gametic cells\n\n(Table 1). A single copy of the e-tubulin gene rescues the flagellar,\nTaxol, and meiotic defects as well as centrin localization (n = 20)\n\nand the rootlet microtubules phenotypes of the bld2-6 allele (n = 15).\n\nbld2-5 Cells have Staggered Microtubule Blades Lengths\nin Mature Basal Bodies\n\nEach mature basal body is associated with a probasal body that\n\nwill elongate during the next mitotic cycle [77,78]. In wild-type\n\nFigure 8. IFT74 localization is aberrant in the bld2 alleles. (A–C) IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize. (D–F) IFT74 (green) localizes to the\nbase of the flagella in wild-type cell as a band as well as to the proximal region of the flagella and partially colocalizes with centrin (red) in the striated\nfiber at the distal end of the basal body but not along the nucleo basal body connectors at the proximal end (red). (G–I) bld2-5 cells show staining at\nthe base of the flagella, however the localization appears reduced compared to wild-type cells. (J–L) IFT74 localizes throughout the cytoplasm in bld2-\n6 cells. In about one-half of the cells examined, IFT74 localizes near the aberrant centrin staining at the nucleus. DNA (blue) is stained with DAPI. Scale\nbar in Panel A equals 5 mm. Panels A–L are at the same magnification.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0053940.g008\n\nBasal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin Function\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940\n\n\n\ncells, the probasal bodies are roughly 80 nm in length and consist\n\nof a proximal ring of amorphous material, a nine-spoked cartwheel\n\nand nine triplet microtubule blades [79]. In bld2-5 cells, the\n\nproximal ends of the probasal bodies maintain a ring of\n\namorphous material and a cartwheel, however microtubule blades\n\nmay be incomplete (Figure 5; Movie S1). Unlike the probasal\n\nbodies, the amorphous material in the mature bld2-5 basal body is\n\nnot present as a thin ring rather it can extend to over 200 nm,\n\nwhich is variable from cell to cell. Most tomographic reconstruc-\n\ntions have both amorphous material and microtubule blades\n\n(Figure 5A–E; arrowheads; Figure S3; arrowheads). The assembly\n\nof microtubule blades is also incomplete with singlet, doublet and\n\nsometimes triplet microtubules present as one moves from the\n\nproximal base of the basal body to the distal end (Figure 5; right;\n\nFigure S3). Incomplete basal bodies were also observed with only 7\n\nor 8 blades are present at the distal tip (Figure S3A). In some cells\n\nthe cartwheel structure assembles farther from the proximal base\n\nthan in wild-type basal bodies (Figure 5 C, D; arrow; Figure S3C;\n\narrow). Basal bodies competent to template flagella assemble\n\nectopic transition zone material in the basal body proper (Figure\n\nS3B, D; arrow), which resembles the ectopic transition zone\n\npresent in the uni3-1 strain [47]. Probasal bodies in the bld2-5\n\nstrain assemble with minor defects; however, as the basal body\n\nmatures, it loses its integrity, which indicates that Bld2p is needed\n\nto maintain basal body structure. The collapsed centrin fibers and\n\naberrant rootlet microtubules observed by immunofluorescence\n\nare confirmed by the tomography in which the fibers are\n\nmisplaced in many of the cells.\n\nTaxol Supersensitive Strains Recover from Taxol\nTreatment\n\nMutant and wild-type cells were treated with 8 mM Taxol for 48\nhours, washed twice in rich medium and stained with Trypan blue\n\nto determine the number of dead cells in each replicate sample\n\n(n = 3). There was no significant difference between the average\n\nnumber of live cells in treated and untreated cultures of bld2-5,\n\nbld2-6, tub2-1, pf15-1 and pf15-3 strains (Table 2). These data\n\nsuggest that the Taxol supersensitivity of these mutants does not\n\narise from a basal body integrity checkpoint but rather from an\n\narrest.\n\nKatanin is Mislocalized in the bld2 Mutants\nKatanin influences microtubule dynamics by severing microtu-\n\nbules. The PF15 gene encodes p80 katanin [56] and pf15 strains\n\nshow Taxol supersensitive (Figure 1A, B). We constructed a PF15-\n\nHA epitope tagged vector that places the HA tag at the terminal\n\namino acid, which was changed from a leucine to an asparagine,\n\ntransformed the plasmid into the pf15-1 strain, and screened for\n\nrescue of the paralyzed flagellar phenotype. Twenty-one indepen-\n\ndent swimming strains were isolated and each transgenic strain\n\nalso rescues the Taxol supersensitive phenotype. Immunoblots\n\nwere used to determine which transgenic lines have the highest\n\nlevel of PF15-HA protein. Seven of the twenty-0ne strains showed\n\na band detected by antibodies to HA antibody with the correct\n\nmolecular weight (,100 kDa). Based on immunoblot and\nimmunofluorescence data, one of the lines was used for further\n\nanalysis (Figure 6).\n\nBy immunofluorescence, katanin localizes as two dots in\n\ninterphase (n = 57, (Figure 6A–D) and to the spindle poles during\n\nmitosis (n = 4, Figure 6Y–A’; Figure 7) in wild-type cells. Sixty-six\n\npercent of bld2-6 cells (n = 70) lack katanin p80 staining and the\n\nremainder have diffuse, lower intensity staining (Figure 6E–H).\n\nThe bld2-5 cells (n = 30) show two centrin localization patterns\n\n(Figure 2C, D), which are correlated to the katanin localization\n\npattern. Of the cells with collapsed centrin, the majority (n = 12/\n\n14) has no katanin p80 localization while the remaining two have\n\ndiffuse katanin p80 at the basal bodies (Figure 6I, J). Of the cells\n\nwith wild-type centrin fibers (n = 16), 4 lack katanin p80 staining\n\nand 8 show diffuse katanin p80 localization (Figure 6K, L). The\n\nremaining 4 cells show wild-type katanin p80 localization.\n\nIntragenic revertants display wild-type katanin p80 localization\n\n(n = 40) (Figure 6P–S). Immunoblots show that the amount of\n\nkatanin p80 protein in the bld2 cells is similar to the expression in\n\nwild-type cells. Therefore, the lack of localization is not due to a\n\ndecrease in katanin p80 expression (Figure 6B’). Intact basal bodies\n\nappear to be important for katanin p80 localization.\n\nKatanin Localization Requires Triplet Microtubules, but\nnot the Transition Zone\n\nTo further determine which structures in the basal body\n\napparatus are needed for katanin p80 localization, we examined\n\np80 localization in uni1-2 cells, which lack a transition zone on the\n\ndaughter basal body [26] in uni3-1 cells, which assemble doublet\n\nbut not triplet microtubules [22,80]; and in bld10 cells, which lack\n\nany microtubule blades [23]. Katanin p80 localization in uni1-2\n\ncells appears as two dots (n = 6), which suggests it does not require\n\nthe transition zone for proper localization (Figure 6Q, R). In bld10-\n\n1 cells, there is no localization of katanin p80 (n = 30), which\n\nfurther supports the need for the basal body for localization of\n\nkatanin. Localization of katanin p80 in the uni3 cells shows a\n\nvariety of phenotypes that include the complete absence (40/50),\n\ndiffuse staining (5/50) or increased signal (5/50) (Figure 6S–V).\n\nBecause uni3-1 cells lack triplet microtubule blades except at the\n\ndistal tip of the basal body [22], it seems likely that triplet\n\nmicrotubules are important for katanin p80 localization but are\n\nnot sufficient.\n\nIFT52 localizes to transition fibers and localizes aberrantly in\n\nthe bld2-1 allele [20], we examined localization of another\n\ncomponent of the IFT B complex, IFT74. As shown previously\n\n[61], IFT74 localizes to the flagellar base as a punctate dot and in\n\nthe proximal region of the flagella in wild-type cells (Figure 8D–F).\n\nIFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize in wild-type cells\n\n(Figure 8A–C). This result supports the uni1-2 result that katanin\n\np80 is not present on the transition fibers.\n\nLike the katanin p80 localization, the IFT74 pattern in bld2-5 is\n\nmore diffuse than in wild-type cells (n = 40, Figure 8G–I). In bld2-6\n\ncells, there is increased staining throughout the cytoplasm of all\n\ncells with dots that are not at the basal body region (n = 40)\n\n(Figure 8J–L). Sixteen cells show IFT74 localization near the basal\n\nbodies. The increased cytoplasmic staining in bld2-6 cells may\n\nreflect an increased level of IFT74 in the cytoplasm that would\n\nnormally be present in the flagella.\n\nDiscussion\n\nLoss of Basal Body Integrity Perturbs Katanin Localization\nThe pf15 and pf19 alleles are unique among the flagellar motility\n\nmutants tested in Chlamydomonas; they confer supersensitivity to\n\nTaxol (Figure 1). The mutants with basal body integrity defects\n\n(bld2, bld10, bld12, uni3) or basal body fiber defects (vfl1, vfl2, vfl3)\n\nalso confer Taxol supersensitivity and suggest a simple hypothesis\n\nthat we tested. These organelles help to recruit proteins for spindle\n\nassembly and function. Specifically, we showed that a loss of basal\n\nbody integrity results in a failure to recruit and localize katanin\n\nand this failure mimics the loss of function phenotype of the pf15\n\nand pf19 strains. Acetylation, a post-translational modification of\n\nK40 in a-tubulin, is associated with more stable microtubules [81],\nand the Taxol supersensitivity phenotype of a b-tubulin mutant [2]\n\nBasal Body Integrity Needed for Katanin Function\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 January 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 1 | e53940\n\n\n\nor in the katanin mutants in Tetrahymena [7] is associated with\n\nincreased levels of acetylated a-tubulin. The bld2 alleles do not\nhave increased acetylation of interphase microtubules (Figure 3).\n\nWe identified viable null alleles in the PF15 and BLD2 genes,\n\nwhich suggest that these two genes are not essential in\n\nChlamydomonas. The bld2-6; pf15 double mutant confers a more\n\nsevere defect than in either single mutant on Taxol medium. This\n\nmore severe phenotype indicates that recruitment of additional\n\nproteins at basal bodies affects microtubule dynamics. None of the\n\nmutants block spindle function in mitosis in the absence of Taxol.\n\nGiven that the bld2-1 and bld2-6 alleles have a recessive meiotic\n\ndefect, there may be a stronger requirement for the recruitment of\n\nproteins to the meiotic spindle than to the mitotic spindle in\n\nChlamydomonas. Although mutants with basal body integrity defects\n\ncan still build spindles and progress through the cell cycle,\n\nmicrotubules in these cells may be inherently unstable as judged by\n\nTaxol sensitivity.\n\nElectron tomography of the bld2-5 allele suggests that e-tubulin\nis necessary for basal body assembly/elongation. This staggered\n\nphenotype of bld2-5 is also observed in the bld2-1; rgn1-1 strain,\n\nwhere rgn1-1 is a partial suppressor of the bld2-1 allele [34], and it\n\nis similar to the knockdown phenotype observed in Paramecium\n\n[82]. Since the probasal body structure is not affected to a large\n\ndegree, this allele suggests that this mutant e-tubulin is able to\nparticipate in the initiation events needed to build the probasal\n\nbody, but not in the elongation of the probasal body to the\n\ndaughter basal body. Based on tomographic reconstruction of\n\nduplicating basal bodies, these two events are separated in time.\n\nThe existing probasal body elongates to become the daughter\n\nbasal body at prophase and the new probasal body forms in\n\nmetaphase (O’Toole and Dutcher, in preparation).\n\nRasi and colleagues reported that katanin p60 is an essential\n\ngene, is required for release of the basal bodies from the flagella\n\nusing an RNA interference strategy to the p60 gene, and that\n\nkatanin localizes to the basal bodies [83]. However, Dymek and\n\nSmith suggest that katanin p60 is encoded by the PF19 gene [84].\n\nBased on two pf19 alleles, this gene does not play a role in release\n\nof flagella, and the anti-p60 serum reported by Rasi does not\n\nrecognize the tagged p60-GFP protein in whole cell extracts [84],\n\nwhich makes our tagged gene the only means to examine\n\nlocalization of the katanin heterodimer. Our phenotypes for pf15\n\nand pf19 are similar and suggest that katanin p60 and p80 behave\n\nsimilarly in Chlamydomonas as in other organisms.\n\nLocalization of Katanin Requires Intact Basal Bodies\nThe transition fibers are required for IFT localization, and\n\nsubdistal appendages are required for PCM localization in animal\n\ncells, several of our observations were unexpected. In uni1-2 cells,\n\nwhich lack the transition zone and transition fibers on the younger\n\nof the two basal bodies, two dots of katanin are observed rather\n\nthan one. Additionally, IFT74 and katanin p80 do not colocalize.\n\nThus, we suggest that the transition fibers are not required for\n\nkatanin p80 localization and that the requirements at the basal\n\nbodies for IFT and katanin p80 recruitment and localization are\n\ndifferent.\n\nWe suggest that the recruitment requires triplet microtubules as\n\nthe uni3 mutant shows defects in p80 localization but has normal\n\ntransition fibers. The uni3 mutant fails to assemble triplet\n\nmicrotubules, but 25% of the cells assemble two flagella, 25%\n\nassemble one flagellum, and 50% have no flagella. We have\n\nhypothesized that the age of the basal bodies influences this\n\ndistribution [22,47]. As the basal bodies age, they may acquire\n\nadditional proteins or post-translational modifications that allows\n\nfor recruitment. Thus, the katanin localization phenotype is\n\nintriguing in that there are three localization phenotypes in uni3\n\nmutants. These may correspond to the age of the older basal body.\n\nThe triplet microtubules are known to be important for the\n\nlocalization of centrin and rootlet microtubules via specific\n\nmicrotubule blades [47]. We cannot rule out the model that the\n\ntriplet microtubules do not directly recruit p80, but may play an\n\nindirect role via intermediary proteins. Basal bodies in C. elegans\n\nand Drosophila lack triplet microtubules, but still recruit PCM. Like\n\nChlamydomonas, basal body mutants in these organisms also fail to\n\nrecruit PCM and suggest the mechanism of PCM recruitment may\n\ndepend on the basal body structure of an organism.\n\nOther Proteins that Moderate Taxol Sensitivity\nBesides basal body defects, work in other systems has shown\n\nmultiple modes to confer Taxol sensitivity. Interestingly, two\n\nsmoothened antagonists sensitize cells to Taxol in ovarian cancer\n\ncell lines [85]. It is interesting to consider that localization of the\n\nhedgehog pathway in the cilia could modulate recruitment of\n\nother proteins to the basal bodies. Increased expression of Nek4, a\n\nNimA-like kinase is associated with Taxol sensitivity [86]. Its\n\ntargets remain unknown. Finally, changes in expression of\n\nSeptin10 and Bub3 alter Taxol sensitivity. Increased Sept10\n\nexpression is associated with sensitivity while decreased expression\n\nis associated with resistance to Taxol [87,88]. Modifiers that\n\nconfer Taxol sensitivity have been identified in HapMap\n\nlymphoblastoid cell lines; the predominant class of genes with\n\nvariants encodes solute carriers (SLC) [89]. Resistance to Taxol\n\nhas been observed in a large number of clinical samples following\n\ntreatment with this drug. Mutations in over 20 amino acids in b-\ntubulin have been observed in Taxol resistant cell lines [90]. There\n\nmay be many targets and mechanisms by which Taxol sensitivity is\n\nmodulated. Further screens for the Taxol supersensitivity pheno-\n\ntype may provide a new class of variants that will be useful for\n\ncancer therapeutics.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Schematic drawing of the katanin p80\nepitope-tagged transgene.

Cross I\nis a repeat of the results obtained previously [34] showing that the\n\ndisomic strain (red and black chromosomes) produces no viable\n\nprogeny when crossed by wild-type strain (CC-124, blue) (n = 120\n\ntetrads). Cross II involves a wild-type CC-1952 parent (green\n\nchromosome) carrying the BLD2 transgene (purple) that is\n\nunlinked to the BLD2 locus. The presence of the transgene is\n\nsufficient to rescue the meiotic phenotype (75% of the progeny\n\nfrom 40 tetrads survive). This result is reinforced by results in\n\nCross III that uses progeny from Cross II that lack the bld2-1\n\nchromosome, which were eliminated from consideration using\n\nPCR and digestion with FokI (Materials and Methods). This leaves\n\nsix possible genotypes.
