\n\n\nIdentification of the pollen self-incompatibility determinant in\nPapaver rhoeas\n\nMichael J. Wheelera,*, Barend H. J. de Graafa,†, Natalie Hadjiosifa, Ruth M. Perry, Natalie S.\nPoulter, Kim Osman, Sabina Vatovec, Andrea Harper, F. Christopher H. Franklinb, and\nVernonica E. Franklin-Tongb,c\nSchool of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, Birmingham, B15 2TT, U.K.\n\nAbstract\nHigher plants produce seed through pollination, using specific interactions between pollen and\npistil. Self-incompatibility (SI) is an important mechanism used in many species to prevent\ninbreeding, and is controlled by a multi-allelic S locus1,2. “Self” (incompatible) pollen is\ndiscriminated from “non-self” (compatible) pollen, by interaction of pollen and pistil S locus\ncomponents, and is subsequently inhibited. In Papaver rhoeas, the pistil S locus product is a small\nprotein that interacts with incompatible pollen, triggering a Ca2+-dependent signalling network,\nresulting in pollen inhibition and programmed cell death3-7. Here we have cloned three alleles of\na highly polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS, from Papaver and provide evidence that this\nencodes the pollen S locus determinant. PrpS is a single copy gene linked to the pistil S gene,\nPrsS. Sequence analysis indicates that PrsS and PrpS are equally ancient and are likely to have co-\nevolved. PrpS encodes a novel ~20 kDa protein. Consistent with predictions that it is a\ntransmembrane protein, PrpS is associated with the plasma membrane. We show that a predicted\nextracellular loop segment of PrpS interacts with PrsS and, using PrpS antisense oligonucleotides,\nwe demonstrate that PrpS is involved in S-specific inhibition of incompatible pollen. Identification\nof PrpS represents a major advance in our understanding of the Papaver SI system. As a novel\ncell-cell recognition determinant it contributes to the available information concerning the origins\nand evolution of cell-cell recognition systems involved in discrimination between “self” and “non-\nself”, which also include histocompatibility systems in primitive chordates and vertebrates.\n\nKeywords\nSelf-incompatibility; pollen S receptor; Papaver rhoeas; pollen tube inhibition\n\nIt has been established that self-incompatibility (SI) has evolved independently several\ntimes. Three SI systems have been well characterised at a molecular level1,2. Both pollen\nand pistil S determinants are expected to have co-evolved and be physically linked to the S\nlocus in order to maintain a functional SI system. Other characteristics expected of them are\nhigh levels of allelic polymorphism and tissue specific expression.

To fully understand how different SI systems\noperate, identification of both the pistil and pollen S locus components, together with\nestablishing mechanisms involved in pollen inhibition is crucial. Previously, we identified\nthe pistil S determinant for Papaver rhoeas8-10 and established several components involved\nin pollen inhibition3-7,11. Although we identified a glycoprotein in pollen that bound to the\npistil S protein, studies indicated that it was not the pollen S determinant, though it might\nmodulate the SI response12. Recent analysis of the S1 locus enabled identification of the\npollen component of the S locus on a cosmid clone comprising a 42 kb region at the S1\nlocus.\n\nNucleotide sequencing and analysis identified a novel putative open reading frame (ORF)\n457 bp from the S1 pistil gene (Fig 1a). Expression analysis using RT-PCR revealed that the\nORF was specifically transcribed in pollen (Fig 1b), appearing during anther development\n(Fig 1c). The temporal expression pattern is very similar to that of the pistil S gene8. These\ndata suggested that this ORF was a candidate for the Papaver pollen S gene (designated\nPrpS: Papaver rhoeas pollen S). We propose renaming the gene that determines SI\nspecificity in pistils (currently designated simply S) to provide a clearer nomenclature; we\nsuggest PrsS (for Papaver rhoeas stigma S determinant).\n\nThe cDNA of PrpS1 comprises 1206 bp containing a coding region of 579 bp encoding a\n192 amino acid polypeptide with a predicted Mr of 20.5 kDa, pI 7.55. We subsequently\ncloned PrpS3 and PrpS8 from S3S8 pollen RNA. The PrpS3 and PrpS8 coding sequences are\n576 bp and 582 bp (191 and 193 amino acids) respectively (Fig 1d); PrpS3 and PrpS8 encode\nproteins of predicted Mr of 21.1 kDa (pI 6.57) and 20.9 kDa (pI 8.51) respectively. Southern\nblotting revealed that PrpS is single copy (Supplemental Fig 1), so the related sequences\nidentified as PrpS3 and PrpS8 are clearly allelic to PrpS1, rather than being related/\nparalogous genes.\n\nSegregation analyses were conducted to obtain evidence of genetic linkage at the S locus\nbetween PrsS3 and PrpS3 and between PrsS8 and PrpS8. Specific primers were used to\namplify regions of the pistil PrsS1, PrsS3 and PrsS8 and pollen PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8\ngenes from genomic DNA from two full-sib families segregating for these haplotypes (45\nand 25 individuals, a total of 140 PrpS/PrsS pairs). PrpS1 was amplified only from plants\ncarrying S1; PrpS3 was amplified only from plants carrying S3 and PrpS8 was amplified only\nfrom plants carrying the S8 haplotype. The pistil PrsS1, PrsS3 and PrsS8 sequences were also\namplified only from plants carrying the respective S haplotypes (Fig 1e), as expected. This\ndemonstrates co-segregation and linkage of PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8 and their cognate PrsS\ngenes, as no recombination was detected (recombination frequency <0.021). Thus, at the\n95% rejection level we can be confident that there is no recombination.\n\nA strikingly high level of allelic sequence polymorphism is a well-documented feature of S\nlocus proteins; S alleles have unusually high amino acid sequence divergence within\nspecies13-15. Papaver is no exception; the pistil proteins PrsS1 and PrsS3 exhibit 46%\nsequence divergence; PrsS1 and PrsS8 have 40%, and PrsS3 and PrsS8 46% divergence.\nPrpS proteins exhibit a similar level of polymorphism (Fig 1d); the PrpS1 and PrpS3\npredicted amino acid sequences are 50% divergent; PrpS1 and PrpS8 exhibit 40%\ndivergence; PrpS3 and PrpS8 are 47% divergent16.\n\nThe pollen and pistil S determinants should exhibit evidence of co-evolution. Examination\nof the PrpS sequences for non-synonymous to synonymous (Ka/Ks) substitutions reveal that\nthe PrsS alleles have a mean Ka/Ks ratio of 0.234, and the PrpS alleles have a mean Ka/Ks\nratio of 0.368 (Supplemental Table 1). A two-tailed t-test showed no significant difference\n\nWheeler et al. Page 2\n\nNature.

These data suggest that the pollen and\npistil S alleles co-evolved and are likely to be similarly ancient.\n\nPrpS has no significant sequence homology to any protein in existing databases. Sequence\nanalysis, using a range of prediction programmes, indicated that PrpS has 3-5 predicted\ntransmembrane helices and alignment of the three PrpS alleles indicates that they share a\nsimilar topology (Fig 1d; Supplemental Fig 2). In support of predictions that PrpS is a\ntransmembrane protein, western analysis using antisera raised against PrpS1, revealed that\nPrpS1 was detected as a ~20 kDa protein specifically in S1 pollen membrane-enriched\nextracts (Fig 2a-c). Moreover, immunolocalization studies revealed that PrpS1 is associated\nwith the pollen tube plasma membrane (Fig 2d). Although the PrpS sequences do not show\nany particular bias for the “positive inside rule”17, structural predictions suggest an\nextracellular loop segment, comprising amino acids ~60-100 (63-97 using TMHMM, Fig\n1d; Supplemental Fig 2). We hypothesized that this region might be involved in the\ninteraction with PrsS and show that a peptide corresponding to part of the predicted PrpS\nextracellular loop interacted with the PrsS protein, while the corresponding randomized\npeptide did not (Fig 2e).\n\nTo determine whether PrpS is functionally involved in the SI response, we investigated\nwhether it mediates S specific pollen inhibition, using in vitro SI bioassays8. Peptides based\non extracellular domains of receptors have been used to identify ligand-binding epitopes via\ntheir ability to block the receptor-ligand interaction18. Preliminary experiments with the\npeptide used in the binding assay tested if it could block SI-mediated inhibition. Pollen from\nplants with haplotypes S1S3, when challenged with incompatible recombinant PrsS, were\nrescued from inhibition by PrpS1 peptides (n = 6; P < 0.001, ***), while randomized\npeptides based on the same amino acids had no effect (n=3; N.S.; Supplemental Fig 3). This\nis consistent with the hypothesis that this region is involved in recognition and indicated that\nPrpS might mediate pollen inhibition. To confirm this possibility, we used an antisense\noligonucleotide approach3,19. We hypothesized that if PrpS functions as the pollen S\ndeterminant, knockdown of its expression should result in alleviation of pollen tube\ninhibition in an S-specific manner. We induced SI in vitro in the presence of either\nantisense- (as-ODNs) or sense- (s-ODNs) oligonucleotides to test this hypothesis. As our\nplants are heterozygous for S haplotypes, the pollen phenotype of plants with S1S3\nhaplotypes should theoretically be 50% S1 and 50% S3. Thus, if the interaction is S-specific,\nas-ODNs specific for PrpS1 should only affect the 50% of pollen (carrying S1).\n\nSI induced strong inhibition of pollen tube growth (a 79% reduction in length compared to\nthe controls) and we observed a significant alleviation of this inhibition in an incompatible\ncombination in the presence of as-ODNs and not with corresponding s-ODNs (Fig 3). With\npollen from plants with S1S3 haplotypes, SI induced strong inhibition of pollen tube length\n(22.1%, P<0.001 ***, n=300) and addition of as-PrpS1-ODNs gave a highly significant\nrecovery of SI-treated tubes (58.3% increase in length compared to SI-treated; P<0.001, ***,\nn=150), and incompatible pollen responded in a bimodal manner, consistent with only S1\npollen being affected (Supplemental Fig 4). When as-PrpS8-ODNs were added to the same\npollen from plants with S1 and S3 haplotypes, they did not alleviate SI-induced inhibition\n(P=0.604, N.S., n=150). This demonstrates that the PrpS1 and PrpS8 as-ODNs had an S-\nspecific effect. As expected, s-PrpS1-ODNs did not affect the SI response (P=0.591, N.S.,\nn=150).\n\nTo further confirm the S-specific effect of the as-ODNs, we also tested their effect on pollen\nfrom plants with haplotypes S3S8. SI resulted in inhibited pollen tubes (19.8% of the control,\nn=300), and addition of as-PrpS8-ODNs alleviated the SI-induced inhibition, giving a highly\nsignificant 100.3% increase in pollen tube length (P=<0.001, ***, n=150), whereas there\n\nWheeler et al.

Together these data demonstrate that PrpS plays a crucial role in SI-\ninduced S haplotype-specific pollen tube inhibition.\n\nIn summary, we have cloned a polymorphic pollen-expressed gene, PrpS. Together our data\nare consistent with the hypothesis that PrpS is the Papaver pollen S determinant as it\nmediates S-specific recognition and inhibition. SI in Papaver is distinct from the other well\ncharacterized SI systems (i.e. from both the Brassica pollen S determinant SCR/SP11 and\nthe pollen F-box protein SLF/SFB from the S-RNase based SI system)1,20-23. As PrpS has\nno homologues, its nature is intriguing. Self-nonself discrimination and other recognition\nsystems which are controlled by a highly polymorphic locus are not limited to SI; other\nsystems include disease resistance in plants24, and histocompatibility systems in\nanimals25-27. These parallels between non-analogous recognition systems were recognized,\nand their importance appreciated, long before the molecular basis of these systems were\nelucidated25 and the nature of their polymorphism has intrigued population and\nevolutionary biologists for decades. The identification of PrpS as a novel cell-cell\nrecognition determinant thus contributes to the available information regarding the evolution\nof self-nonself recognition systems.\n\nMETHODS SUMMARY\nCloning of PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8\n\nA genomic clone of PrpS1 was identified by nucleotide sequence analysis of a 42 kb clone\ncarrying the S1 locus, obtained by screening a Papaver rhoeas S1S3 cosmid genomic DNA\nlibrary (SuperCos1, Stratagene) with PrsS1 cDNA. The DNA upstream and downstream of\nthe PrsS1 gene was sequenced and analyzed using BLAST (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST)\nand ORF Finder (http://searchlauncher.bcm.tmc.edu)28. The organisation of PrpS1 and\nPrsS1 genes was confirmed using PCR on genomic DNA of S1- and non-S1- containing\nplants. PrpS3 and PrpS8 cDNAs were obtained using RT-PCR, 3′ and 5′-RACE PCR (see\nOn-line Methods for primer details) on pollen cDNA from suitable S-haplotypes, using low\nannealing temperatures (48 °C).\n\nKa/Ks calculations\nDNAsP29 was used to estimate the Ka (the number of non-synonymous substitutions per\nnon-synonymous site), and Ks (the number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous\nsite) for pairs of PrsS and PrpS nucleotide sequences.\n\nPeptide binding assay\nA 15 aa peptide (DQKWVVAFGTAAICD) corresponding to part of the predicted\nextracellular loop segment of PrpS1 (TMHMM; http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM\n30) and a randomized version (FTVDVKDCAAAWGQI) were synthesized (Alta\nBioscience, University of Birmingham). The peptides (10 μg, 1 μg, 0.1 μg) were bound to\nPVDF membrane. This was incubated with recombinant PrsS1 and then probed for binding\nusing α-PrsS1 antisera and alkaline phosphatase detection.\n\nAntisense oligo silencing of PrpS expression\nPhosphorothioated gene-specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (as-ODN) and their sense\ncontrols (s-ODN) were designed (PrpS1 as-ODN: gtccTCCCAGTATTAttga, PrpS1 s-ODN:\ntcaaTAATACTGGGAggac, PrpS8 as-ODN: ttccCACCAGCACAGCaatt, PrpS8 s-ODN:\naattGCTGTGCTGGTGggaa; lower case letters indicate bases linked by phosphorothioate\nbonds).

Work in the labs of F.C.H.F. and V.E.F-T. is funded by the\nBiotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (B.B.S.R.C.); this was supported by grant BB/\nC501325/1.\n\nMethods\n\nSequence homology comparisons\nSequence identities were calculated for PrsS and PrpS, using pairwise comparisons of the\namino acids comprising the mature peptide, using BLAST (BLOSUM62)31.\n\nSouthern blotting\nSouthern blots of Papaver genomic DNA from plants of different S-haplotypes (S1S8, S1S3,\nS3S8, S2S4, S3S4, S7Sx) digested with EcoRV, BamHI, Pst1 or BglII, were probed with a\nPrpS1 probe. Blots were hybridised at 60°C overnight and washed down to 0.5 × SSC at\n50°C, and signals detected using autoradiography.\n\nStructural predictions for PrpS and interpretation of the data\nWe analysed PrpS sequences using a number of protein prediction programmes:\nTMHMM2.032, PredictProtein, SOSUI, HMMTOP, TMpred, TM-Finder, SPLIT 4,\nConPredII, Phobius. TMHMM2.0 in particular, is regarded as a very robust transmembrane\nhelix predictor, though predicting the number of membrane-spanning regions remains\ndifficult33. Although predictions differ, they all predict that PrpS has transmembrane\nhelices. We have been advised that the predictions suggest anything between 3-5\ntransmembrane segments and the alignment of the PrpS sequences suggests that all three\nproteins share a similar topology. Although many predictions indicated 3 or 5 TM domains,\nit is more likely that PrpS has four transmembrane segments, as it is a good number to make\na four helix bundle in the membrane, as 3 and 5 TM proteins are rare (Dr. A. Lovering,\npersonal communication). All the predictions indicate an extracellular loop segment. SI Fig\n2 shows a cartoon indicating a prediction for the regions; this is a tentative assignment of\npossible topology.\n\nLinkage analysis\nSegregation analysis was carried out on individual plants from several full-sib families\nwhich share three S haplotypes and segregate for haplotypes S1S3 or S3S8 and S1S8 or S3S8.\nThese are well established families, in which S haplotypes were designated ~20 years ago,\nproduced using controlled crosses between individuals which had their S-haplotypes verified\nusing aniline blue microscopy; they have been analyzed for S allele segregation for at least\nseven generations in a pedigree going back to 1994.\n\nWheeler et al.

We carried out analysis of a full-sib family,\nsegregating for pollen PrpS1 and PrpS3 and pistil PrsS1 and PrsS3 alleles (25 plants, 50\nalleles) and for the S1 and S8 loci, we analysed 45 full-sib plants (90 alleles) to show\nsegregation of pollen PrpS1 and PrpS8 and pistil PrsS1 and PrsS8. Thus, we examined\nsegregation of a total of 140 PrpS/PrsS pairs of alleles. Genomic DNA from leaf tissue was\nextracted (Extract-N-Amp™ Plant PCR kit, Sigma-Aldrich) and gene specific primers used\nto specifically amplify PrsS1, PrsS3, PrsS8, and PrpS1, PrpS3 and PrpS8 sequences. See SI\nTable 3 for primer details. No recombination was detected (RF <0.021). Thus, at the 95%\nrejection level, we can be confident that there is no recombination.\n\nRT-PCR to show tissue and developmental specificity\nStandard RT-PCR techniques were used for expression analysis. Total RNA was extracted\nfrom anthers from plants with the S1 haplotype at different stages of development and from\ndifferent tissues (RNAeasy plant mini kit, QIAGEN) and cDNA synthesised (Omniscript RT\nkit, QIAGEN). Gene-specific primers (see SI Table 3) were used to amplify PrpS1\ntranscripts; primers for the P. rhoeas glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPD)\ngene acted as controls.\n\nProduction of antisera\nThe predicted 60 amino acid C-terminus of PrpS1 (designated PrpS1-60C) was expressed as\na HIS-tagged recombinant protein using pET21b (Novagen). Recombinant protein was\nisolated from E. coli BL21 (DE3) using Ni-NTA resin following the manufacturer’s\n(QIAGEN) protocol. Antisera (PrpS1-60C) was raised in rats (ISL Immune Systems,\nPaignton, UK).\n\nProtein extraction for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting\nExtracts enriched for membrane proteins were made in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 200 mM\nNaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 1 M sucrose, 0.5% Triton X-100, Protease Inhibitor cocktail (Roche).\nProtein concentrations were determined35 and proteins separated using SDS-PAGE and\nelectroblotted (400 mA, 3 h) onto Hybond C membranes (GE Healthcare). These were\nincubated with the PrpS1-60C antibody (1:2000) for 2 h, followed by alkaline phosphatase-\nconjugated anti-rat secondary antibody (Sigma); detection used BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3′-\nindolyphosphate p-toluidine salt) and NBT (Nitroblue tetrazolium chloride).\n\nImmunolocalization\nPapaver rhoeas pollen from plants with haplotypes S1S3 was grown in germination medium\n(GM)36 for 1 h at 25°C and prepared according to37, followed by incubation with the\nPrpS1-60C antibody (1:500 in TBS+ 1% BSA; 4°C overnight), then FITC-conjugated goat\nanti-rat antibody (1:50, 1.5 h). Cells were mounted on slides and examined by confocal\nmicroscopy (Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 MP) using single scans (100x plan-Apo 1.4 NA oil\nobjective, Nikon). When pre-immune antiserum was used, no signal was obtained using\nidentical additions and settings.\n\nThe in vitro bioassay for Papaver SI: use of this as an assay for function\nWe have used in vitro bioassays for demonstration of PrpS function instead of the\nalternative strategy of stable transformation with a PrpS allele because the latter is not\n\nWheeler et al.

These bioassays have been routinely used to demonstrate S-specific\nfunction. Because it has not been possible to generate plants that are homozygous for S\nhaplotypes in Papaver, we use full-sib families that are segregating for plants that are\nheterozygous for S haplotypes. This makes the interpretation of the data slightly more\ncomplicated, as we always have a mixed population of pollen grains in our samples.\n\nThe Papaver SI in vitro bioassay was initially used for demonstrating that stigmatic extracts\nhad S-specific biological activity; we showed the distribution of individual pollen tube\nlengths for control, fully compatible, incompatible, and half-compatible interactions, with\nbimodal distribution of inhibition in a half-compatible SI response, as expected38. This SI\nbioassay was used to provide evidence for the pistil S gene (now named PrsS) being the S\ndeterminant39; we demonstrated S-allele-specific inhibition of pollen by recombinant PrsS1\nprotein. This half-compatible interaction gave 40-44% mean inhibition (compared to the\ntheoretical maximum of 50%) with pollen from plants with haplotypes S1S3 or S1S6, but no\ninhibition with pollen from plants with haplotypes S3S6 or S2S4. As we now have several\ncloned pistil PrsS alleles, for any in vitro SI bioassay, we routinely add two recombinant\nPrsS proteins to obtain a full SI response where all pollen is inhibited (see e.g.40-42).\n\nFor the SI in vitro bioassays carried out here, we used two recombinant PrsS proteins (PrsS1\nand PrsS3 to pollen from plants with haplotypes S1S3, and PrsS3 and PrsS8 proteins to pollen\nfrom plants with haplotypes S3S8) to achieve a full SI response (all pollen inhibited). With\nthe peptide bioassay (see below), we added the PrpS1 peptide to the SI bioassay, so the\nexpectation was that a maximum of 50% of pollen would be rescued if we obtained S\nhaplotype-specific alleviation of SI. For the antisense oligonucleotide experiments we used\npollen from plants with S1S3 and S3S8 haplotypes in combination with antisense-PrpS1 and/\nor antisense-PrpS8. The expectation was that S-haplotype-specific alleviation of SI would be\nobtained using antisense-PrpS1 with pollen from plants with S1S3 haplotypes, but this would\nonly be 50% rescue (pollen carrying PrpS1, but not pollen carrying PrpS3); we would also\nexpect no alleviation of SI with antisense-PrpS1 with the pollen from S3S8 plants. We also\ncarried out experiments with antisense-PrpS8 in these combinations, with the prediction that\nantisense-PrpS8 will alleviate the SI response by a maximum of 50% with pollen from plants\nwith S3S8 haplotypes (rescue of pollen carrying PrpS8, but not PrpS3). SI Fig 3 shows data\nfor populations of individual pollen tubes for an experiment using a PrpS1 antisense\noligonucleotide added to an SI assay using pollen from plants with S1S3 or S3S8 haplotypes.\nThe expectation is that PrpS1 antisense oligonucleotide should rescue pollen carrying the\nPrpS1 allele and not the PrpS3 or PrpS8 alleles. The plot shows that the rescue is clearly\nbimodal, with some pollen tubes still strongly inhibited, whilst others have alleviated\ninhibition, which gives confidence to the mean data shown in Fig 3.\n\nWe designed these experiments to be reciprocal so that we could demonstrate allelic\nspecificity of rescue and to rule out some non-specific effects, as if the antisense-PrpS1\ncaused pollen tubes to grow longer for some other reason, we should see this effect with the\npollen from plants with S3S8 haplotypes. Sense oligonucleotides were used as additional\ncontrols, in order to demonstrate that the antisense oligonucleotides specifically had this\neffect on pollen tube growth. These assays provide a robust test of whether PrpS1 and PrpS8\nare allelic, as we show that they have the same biological function and they exhibit allelic\nspecificity. If PrpS8 was not allelic to PrpS1, then it would not affect pollen tube growth as\npredicted. Statistical tests were carried out using MINITAB. Tests comprised two-way\ncomparisons between pairs of data using a student’s t-test.\n\nWheeler et al. Page 7\n\nNature.
