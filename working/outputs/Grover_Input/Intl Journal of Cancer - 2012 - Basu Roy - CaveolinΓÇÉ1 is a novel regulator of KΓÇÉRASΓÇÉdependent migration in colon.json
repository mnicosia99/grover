It is an important regulator of cellular processes such as signal\n\ntransduction and endocytosis. We report here, for the first time, that caveolin-1 is a target of the K-RAS oncogene in colon\n\ncarcinogenesis. Caveolin-1 is induced in colon cancer cells and in human colon tumor samples, in response to K-RAS activat-\n\ning mutations. An activated K-RAS oncogene transcriptionally induces caveolin-1 expression in human colon cancer cells and\n\nthis effect is not restricted to the type of activating K-RAS mutation. Inhibition of the P-I3 Kinase-AKT pathway, but not the\n\nERK MAPK pathway, both important K-RAS effectors, leads to a decrease in caveolin-1 expression indicating that the AKT\n\npathway is involved in caveolin-1 expression in response to an activated K-RAS. Increased AKT signaling induces caveolin-1\n\nexpression by increasing the activity of the transcription factor, Sp1. Interestingly; caveolin-1 depletion alters K-RAS-depend-\n\nent signaling by decreasing Grb2-SOS activity. Consistent with these finding, caveolin-1-depleted cells shows decreased\n\nmigration in vitro. However, caveolin-1 overexpression by itself does not increase migration whereas an activated Src can\n\nincrease migration in a caveolin-1-dependent manner. This increased migration is highly dependent on the RhoA GTPase,\n\nindicating that an activated K-RAS modulates migration in part via caveolin-1 induction, and increasing RhoA activity via\n\nphospho-caveolin-1. Our findings indicate that K-RAS regulates both caveolin-1 expression and other factors affecting\n\ncaveolin-1 functions in colon cancer-derived cell migration.\n\nCaveolin-1, a component of membrane caveolae, is a multi-\nfunctional protein, governing signal transduction, membrane\ntransport, and lipid homeostasis.1 The role of caveolin-1 in\ncancer development and progression has been a subject of\ncontroversy among biologists. Initial studies in murine fibro-\nblast (NIH-3T3) cells showed that loss of caveolin-1 was suf-\nficient to induce anchorage-independent growth and tumor\n\nformation in SCID mice.2 Similar studies showed that expres-\nsion of oncogenes like K-RAS, H-RAS, V-ABL and SRC were\nsufficient to reduce caveolin-1 expression in NIH-3T3 cells.3,4\n\nEngelman et al. showed that the CAV1 gene can be mapped\nto the D7S522 locus (chromosome 7q31.1), a site commonly\ndeleted in human cancers.5 These findings strengthened the\nhypothesis that caveolin-1 functions as a potential tumor\nsuppressor and its loss aids in tumorigenesis. With respect to\nits function during cancer development, the tumor suppres-\nsive activities of caveolin-1 have been attributed to its ability\nto bind to signaling molecules via its scaffolding domain, and\nnegatively regulate their activity. Indeed, re-expression of cav-\neolin-1 in transformed murine fibroblasts has been shown to\nbe sufficient to down-regulate signaling via the Ras-Raf-Erk\npathway.6 Consistent with these findings, caveolin-1 is down-\nregulated in several cancers such as breast and ovarian.7\n\nHowever, the other domains present in caveolin-1 can nullify\nits tumor suppressive functions. In human tumors, caveolin-1\nseems to play a tumor-promoting role in certain types of can-\ncers. In prostate cancer, caveolin-1 can maintain activated AKT\nby inhibiting serine/threonine phosphatases PP1 and PP2A.8\n\nCaveolin-1 has the ability to be secreted by prostate cancer cells\n\nKey words: colon cancer, K-RAS, caveolin-1, invasion and migra-\n\ntion, AKT\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online ver-\n\nsion of this article.\n\nGrant sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Grand numbers:\n\nCA095060 and CA123065\n\n*U.K.B.R. and R.S.H. contributed equally to this work\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.28001\n\nHistory: Received 28 May 2012; Accepted 5 Dec 2012; Online 22\n\nDec 2012\n\nCorrespondence to: Natalia Ignatenko, Arizona Cancer Center,\n\n1515 North Campbell Ave., R.0912, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA,\n\nTel.: 11-520-626-6612, E-mail: NIgnatenko@azcc.arizona.edu (or)\n\negerner@azcc.arizona.edu\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nInt.

This phenomenon is associated with an increase in\nexpression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). P-gp has been shown to be\nlocalized in caveolae of MDR-cells, implicating these membrane\nmicro-domains in conferring the MDR phenotype.10 In line\nwith these observations, an increased expression of caveolin-1\nhas been reported to be associated with increased metastasis in\nprostate cancer. Thus caveolin-1 can have tumorigenic as well as\ntumor-suppressive properties.\n\nWith regards to the colon, certain groups have reported\nthat caveolin-1 is down-regulated in colon cancer tissue, as\ncompared with normal colon tissue.11 Other studies have\nrevealed that caveolin-1 is over-expressed in adenocarcinoma\nof the colon.12,13 Thus, there is still a major conflict regarding\ncaveolin-1 expression during colon cancer progression.\n\nWe have previously demonstrated that caveolin-1 is\ninduced by the APC tumor suppressor gene.14 In this study,\nwe have shown that caveolin-1 is a transcriptional target of\nthe K-RAS oncogene. Acquisition of K-RAS mutations is a\nlate event in colon cancer progression.15 K-RAS is commonly\nmutated at codon 12 or 13, or in more rare instances, codon\n61.16,17 Interestingly, caveolin-1 increases K-RAS activity\nthrough increased SOS activation and migration through the\nactivation of the RhoA-ROCK pathway. Studies regarding\ncaveolin-1 expression in human colon tumor samples have\nnot accounted for mutations in the tumor samples. Our find-\nings demonstrate the upregulation of caveolin-1 in colon tu-\nmor cells and tissue samples, harboring K-RAS mutations\nand provide a possible mechanism by which the K-RAS/Cav-\neolin-1 pathway can aid in colon cancer progression.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nCell culture\n\nThe HCT116 cells (with a G13D mutation in one of the\nK-RAS alleles) was obtained from American Type Culture\nCollection (ATCC) and maintained in DMEM medium sup-\nplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% peni-\ncillin-streptomycin. The Hkh2 cells, which are a clone of\nHCT116 cells wherein the activated K-RAS oncogene has\nbeen disrupted by homologous recombination, was a kind\ngift from Drs. Shirasawa and Sasazuki18 and maintained in\n\nDMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-strepto-\nmycin and 600 mg/ml G418. The Caco2 colon cancer cells,\ntransfected with pcDNA3.0 empty vector (Caco/Neo#3) or an\nactivated K-RAS (G12V) expression vector (clones Kras#6\nand Kras#26), were developed in our laboratory and have\nbeen previously characterized.19 The HCT116-Mock and\nCaveolin-1 antisense cells were a kind gift of Drs. Cadvallo-\nMedved and Sloane.20 The Caco2-Mock and Caco2-caveolin-\n1 cells have been previously described.21 All cells were grown\nat 37�C in a humidified incubator with 5% carbon dioxide.\n\nReagents and antibodies\n\nAll chemicals and reagents were of the highest grade. LY294002\n(PI-3-Kinase inhibitor) was obtained from Calbiochem, San\nDiego, CA. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from\nSigma, St. Louis, MO. G418 sulfate was purchased from CellGro\nMediatech, Inc. Lipofectamine 2000, Hygromycin B and all\nmedia were from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA. A list of all antibod-\nies used in this study is mentioned in Supporting Information\nTable 1. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa\nCruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Pan-Src kinase inhibitor\nPP2 was purchased from EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ.\n\ncDNA microarray study\n\ncDNA microarray analysis was performed as previously\ndescribed.22 Briefly, HCT116 and Caco2 isogenic cells, cells\nwere plated for 48 hr after which total cellular RNA was\nextracted using the Qiagen RNEASY Kit (Catalog No.:\n74104) obtained from Qiagen, Valencia, CA, using manufac-\nturer’s instructions. The RNA was quantified and used for\ncDNA microarray analysis.\n\nTissue immunohistochemistry\n\nColon cancer tissues were obtained from patients with meta-\nstatic colorectal cancer (Stage IV colorectal cancer). All the\npatients were treated at the Oncology Unit of Ospedale Santa\nChiara in Pisa, Italy and expressed their written informed con-\nsent to molecular analyses. All tissues were obtained at colono-\nscopy in accordance with the Institutional Review Board\nregulations of the Department of Oncology, University of Pisa.\nFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks of colorectal cancer\nspecimens were analyzed for the presence of K-RAS mutation.\nCaveolin-1 expression was analyzed in samples with WT and\nmutant K-RAS using anti-caveolin-1 antibody from Cell\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nThe role of the membrane protein caveolin-1 in cancer development has been a subject of controversy. Here the authors\n\nreport, for the first time, that caveolin-1 is a target of the K-RAS oncogene in colon carcinogenesis. They demonstrate that\n\ncaveolin-1 is induced in response to mutant K-RAS through AKT activation in colon cancer. They also identify caveolin-1 as a\n\nnovel activator of K-RAS-dependent signaling and cancer cell migration. The data suggest that caveolin-1 is a conditional\n\n“oncogene” in colon cancer whose activity depends on mutant K-RAS, and that a positive feedback loop exists between K-\n\nRAS-dependent caveolin-1 expression and signaling.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n44 Regulation of cancer cell migration by caveolin-1 and K-RAS\n\nInt.

Immunoreactivity was determined as: absent\n(no or weak staining in 10% or fewer cells), moderate (moderate\nstaining in 10–25% of cells), strong (strong staining in greater\nthan 25% cells). K-RAS mutational status of the tumor samples\nused in the study are shown in Supporting Information Table 2.\n\nWestern blotting and immunoprecipitation\n\nCells (2 3 106 cells/100 mm plate) were plated for 48 hr.\nThey were lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)\nbuffer with protease inhibitors (10 mg/ml Aprotinin, 10 mg/ml\nphenyl-methyl-sulfony chloride (PMSF) and 50 mM sodium\northovanadate). Samples were kept on ice for 30 min, followed\nby centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatants\nwere collected and protein concentration was determined with\nthe Bio-Rad DC protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Fifty\nmicrograms of protein were resolved on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE\ngel and transferred overnight to a Hybond-C nitrocellulose\nmembrane, at 4�C. The next day, the membrane was blocked\nin Blotto A [5% non-fat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline with\n0.05% Tween-20 (TBST)] for 1 hr at room temperature. Mem-\nbranes were probed with antibodies in blocking buffer over-\nnight at 4�C, as described in the Supplementary Information\nTable 1. Alternately, primary antibodies were diluted in 5%\nbovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBST. After washing with\nTBST three times, the membrane was probed with horse-rad-\nish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody, washed\nand protein was detected with an enhanced chemilumines-\ncence detection reagent (Amersham). All blots were then\nstripped with Pierce Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer\n(Pierce, Rockford, IL) as described by the manufacturer and\nreprobed with appropriate protein loading controls. For\nimmunoprecipitation, whole cell extracts of indicated cell lines\nwere precleared with normal rabbit serum and Protein A/\nGPlus-Agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 1 hr at\n4�C. CAV-1 was immunoprecipitated from precleared lysates\nwith polyclonal CAV-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\nInc.) or Sp1 antibody (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) overnight\nat 4�C, in the presence of protein A/GPlus-Agarose. Immuno-\nprecipitated beads were washed four times, and then boiled in\nSDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immuno-\nblotted with antibodies as indicated in figure legends.\n\nChromatin immuniprecipitation (ChIP) assay\n\nCells (2 3 105 cells/100 mm plate) were plated and next day,\ntransfected with respective plasmids. Medium was changed\n24 hr after transfection. Cells were harvested 28 hr after\ntransfection and ChIP assay was carried out using the ChIP\nassay kit (Catalog No.: 53006) from Active Motif, Carlsbad,\nCA. The antibody used for ChIP analysis of Sp1 was from\nCell Signaling, Danvers, MA.\n\nQ-RT-PCR\n\nFor total cellular RNA extraction, cells (2.5 3 106) were plated\nin 100 mm plates. Cells were harvested by trypsinization after\n\n48 hr of plating. Total cellular RNA was extracted using the\nQiagen RNAEASY Kit (Catalog No.: 74104) obtained from Qia-\ngen, Valencia, CA, using manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse\ntranscription was performed on 1 mg of total RNA with random\nprimers and the Reverse Transcription System kit (Promega\nCorp., Madison, WI). The cDNA template (100 ng) obtained\nfrom the above reaction was amplified using specific primers\nand puReTaq\n\nTM\n\nReady-To-Go\nTM\n\nPCR Beads (Amersham Bio-\nsciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ). For caveolin-1 RT-PCR analy-\nsis, usually 200 ng of cDNA (for the HCT116 cells) and 500 ng\nof cDNA (for the Caco2-derived cells) were used as template.\nThe PCR products were then resolved on 2% agarose gels and\nphotographed using the Kodak 1D Imaging software. PCR pri-\nmers used, along with their Tm and amplicon sizes for various\ngenes were: caveolin-1 forward 5’ TCA ACC GCG ACC CTA\nAAC ACC 3’; caveolin-1 reverse 5’ TGA AAT AGC TCA GAA\nGAG ACA T 3’.

J. Quon, National Insti-\ntutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.24 The Renilla-TK plasmid was\npurchased from Promega, (Madison, WI) and used as a trans-\nfection efficiency control in all promoter-reporter transfection\nexperiments. For transfection with promoter-reporter con-\nstructs, 5 3 105 cells were plated per well, in six-well plates.\nThe next day, cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000\ntransfection reagent, as described by the manufacturer. Typi-\ncally, cells were transfected with 2 mg of promoter and 0.01 mg\nof Renilla-TK vector. For studies with DN-AKT and MYR-\nAKT, 1.5 mg of MYR/DN AKT was transfected with 2 mg of\npromoter and 0.01 mg of Renilla-TK vector. The next day, the\ncells were lysed in Passive Lysis Buffer from the Dual Lucifer-\nase Assay kit, Promega, Madison, WI, and dual luciferase ac-\ntivity was measured, as described by the manufacturer.\n\nThe caveolin-1 expression vector (pCINeo-Caveolin-1)\nwas a kind of Dr. Eric Smart, University of Kentucky.25 Cav-\neolin-1 Y14F was generated from the parent plasmid using\nthe QuickChange Site-directed Mutaganesis Kit from Strata-\ngene, La Jolla, CA. The Src plasmids were a kind gift from\nDr. Sara Courtneidge, from University of California, San\nDiego.26 The RhoA constructs (RhoA T19N—Plasmid Num-\nber: 15901 and RhoA Q63L—plasmid number: 15900) were\nobtained from Addgene, Cambridge, MA.\n\nCaveolin-1 and Sp1 siRNA experiments\n\nHCT116 and Caco-2 isogenic cell lines were transfected with\ncaveolin-1 siRNA purchased from Dharmacon, and used for\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nBasu Roy et al. 45\n\nInt.

Dharmacon siGENOME SMARTpool anti-\nCAV-1 siRNA, anti-Sp1 siRNA and ON-TARGET plus\nsiCONTROL\n\nTM\n\nnegative control siRNA (Catalog No.:\nL-003467-00, L-026959-00 and D-001820-01, respectively)\nwere prepared as per manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, the\nlyophilized sequences were resuspended in the manufacturer’s\nsiRNA Suspension Buffer to a concentration of 20 lM. The\nsuspension was incubated at 90�C for 1 min, then at 37�C\nfor 60 min to disrupt aggregates formed during lyophiliza-\ntion. All siRNA sequences were used at a final concentration\nof 75 nM during cell transfection. Sixteen to 18 hr preceding\ntransfection, 2.0 3 105 cells/well were plated in six-well\nplates in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and no antibi-\notics. Just before transfection, cells were rinsed 33 with\nsaline. Cells were then incubated in Opti-MEM with siRNA\nand Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen) (12 ll/well) for 6 hr.\nAfter the 6 hr, an equal volume of Opti-MEM plus 10% fetal\nbovine serum was added to each well. All experiments were\nperformed 48 hr after transfection.\n\nMigration and invasion assays\n\nThe cell migration assays were performed with BIOCOATV\nR\n\ncontrol cell culture inserts (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware,\nBedford, MA). Inserts were coated with 2 lg/well of laminin\n(Sigma-Aldrich, Life Science Research, St. Louis, MO). Cell\nsuspensions were prepared at a concentration of 5.0 3 105\n\ncells/ml in serum-free medium. Two hundred microliters of\nthe cell suspensions were plated in the inner chamber of the\ncoated insert in a 24-well tissue plate. Five hundred microliters\nof complete growth medium was added to the outer chamber\nof the insert. Twenty hours after plating, the cells that\nmigrated through the surface of the membrane were stained\nwith 100 ll/well of staining solution (0.5% crystal violet, 20%\nmethanol, 80% water) for 1 min. The stained cells were dis-\nsolved in 200 ll 0.1 M citric acid in a 96-well plate. The plate\nwas placed on a high speed titre plate shaker for 5 min. One\nhundred fifty microliters of the supernatant was then trans-\nferred to a new well and read at 560 nm on an EL800 Univer-\nsal Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Inc.,Winooski,\nVT). Migration experiments were carried out in sextuplet. The\nMatrigel cell invasion assays were performed similar to the\nmigration assays on prepared 24-well plate sized Matrigel\ninserts (BD Biosciences Discovery Labware, Bedford, MA).\n\nLipid raft fractionation\n\nLipid raft fractionation was carried out by using a detergent-\nfree, alkaline lysis method as described previously.27 Briefly,\nHCT116 or Caco2 cells (7 3 106cells/150 mm plate) were\nplated for 48 hr. Each plate was then lysed with 2 ml of 500\nmM sodium carbonate (pH 11.0). The lysate was sonicated\nfor three 20-sec bursts using a SONIC Vibra Cell sonicator.\nThe lysate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose by mixing with\nequal volumes of 90% sucrose prepared in Mes-buffered sa-\nline (MBS—25 mM Mes, pH 6.5, 0.15 M NaCl), and placed\nat the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. A 5 to 35% discon-\n\ntinuous sucrose gradient was formed above (4 ml of 5% su-\ncrose/4 ml of 35% sucrose; both in MBS containing 250 mM\nsodium carbonate) and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16 hr\nin an SW40-Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA).\nA light-scattering band at the 5 to 35% sucrose interface was\nobserved. This fraction contains caveolin-1/lipid raft proteins.\nTwelve 1 ml fractions were collected from top to bottom of\nthe tube. For detection of caveolin-1 in the fractions, equal\nvolume from each fraction were loaded on a 12.5% SDS-\nPAGE gel and visualised as described in Western Blotting.\n\nRas and RhoA activity assay\n\nActivated RAS and RhoA levels were measured using the\nRAS activation assay kit (Catalog No.: 17-218) and the RhoA\nactivation assay kit (Catalog No.: 17-294) from Upstate,\nMillipore, Billerica, MA. For all these assays, cells for grown\nfor 48 hr under regular tissue culture conditions and proc-\nessed as per the manufacturer’s instructions. However, since\nactivity of these GTPases are highly dependent on the ECM\nused for the assay,28,29 we have deliberately measured basal\nlevels of the active GTPases on non-ECM coated plates.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nAll statistical analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel\nSoftware and the paired student’s t-test was used to establish\nsignificance. In all figures shown, *p<0.05. Evaluation of cav-\neolin-1 staining by immunohistochemistry was done using\nFisher’s Exact test.\n\nResults\nAn activated K-RAS oncogene induces caveolin-1\n\nexpression in human colon tumor -derived cells\n\nThe Caco2 cells expressing an activated K-RAS oncogene have\nbeen previously characterized in our laboratory.19 Here we per-\nformed a RAS activity assay to confirm that the K-RAS trans-\nfected clones have higher GTP-bound (active) K-RAS protein.\nAs shown in Figure 1a (left panel), the K-RAS clones have sig-\nnificantly increased levels of GTP-bound K-RAS. In a cDNA\nmicroarray study carried out in our laboratory, caveolin-1 was\nfound to be a transcriptional target of the activated K-RAS\noncogene (Supporting Information Table 3). Validation of the\nmicroarray results was then performed with quantitative RT-\nPCR and immunoblotting. Caveolin-1 mRNA and protein levels\nwere significantly increased in the K-RAS expressing clones, as\ncompared to the vector control cells (Figs. 1b, left panel and 1c,\nleft panel). The cell culture experiments indicated that an acti-\nvating mutation in the K-RAS oncogene induces caveolin-1\nexpression. We confirmed whether the effect of activated K-RAS\nobserved in the Caco2 cell system was specific to a certain codon\nin the K-RAS gene. In order to test this, another isogenic cell\nline system was employed. The HCT116 cells are a colon adeno-\ncarcinoma cell line, which possess a mutation in the K-RAS\ngene at codon 13 (G13D).18 The Hkh2 cells are derived from\nthe HCT116 cells, wherein the activated K-RAS oncogene has\nbeen disrupted by homologous recombination.18 Again, a RAS\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n46 Regulation of cancer cell migration by caveolin-1 and K-RAS\n\nInt.

J. Cancer: 133, 43–58 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nactivity assay revealed that loss of the oncogene leads to a\ndecrease in GTP-bound RAS in Hkh2 cells (Fig. 1a, right panel).\nA cDNA microarray analysis using these two cell lines showed\nthat the Hkh2 cells had lower caveolin-1 mRNA levels, as com-\npared to HCT116 cells (Supplementary Information Table 3).\nThese results were validated at mRNA and protein levels (Figs.\n1b and 1c, right panels). Caveolin-1 is expressed as a longer\n(caveolin-1a) and a shorter isoform (caveolin-1b) that are\ntranslated from methionine 1 and 32, respectively leading two\nbands on a Western blot.30 These studies confirm that a mutant\nK-RAS induces caveolin-1 expression in cell culture and in\nhuman tumor samples and that caveolin-1 overexpression is\nobserved in the presence of both K-RASG12V and K-RASG13D\n\nmutations.\nWe extended our analysis to human colon tumor samples\n\nand analyzed the expression of caveolin-1 in 10 colon tumor\nsamples harboring WT and 10 samples harboring mutant K-\nRAS (K-RAS mutation status of samples is shown in Sup-\nporting Information Table 2). The tumor samples were from\npatients with late stage disease (Stage IV colorectal cancer).\nWe focused our analysis on samples from Stage IV patients\nsince K-RAS mutations occur late in the disease progression\nand are often associated with metastatic disease.31 Interest-\ningly, we found that 8 of 10 tumor samples with mutant\nK-RAS had high levels of caveolin-1 expression as against 2\nsamples of 11 in which the WT allele was present (p<0.05\nby Fisher’s Exact test) (Fig. 1d). As seen in Figure 1d, the\nsample with WT K-RAS shows few caveolin-1 positive cells.\nOn the other hand, the tumor samples with mutant K-RAS\nshowed intense staining of caveolin-1. To confirm whether\nthe increased caveolin-1 expression we observed in the colon\ntumor samples corresponded to increased levels of caveolin-1\nmRNA, we analyzed caveolin-1 mRNA levels in tumors sam-\nples harboring WT and mutated K-RAS alleles and found\nthat caveolin-1 mRNA was significantly increased (p<0.05 by\npaired t-test) in samples with K-RAS mutations (Supporting\nInformation Fig. 1).\n\nK-RAS-dependent caveolin-1 upregulation occurs via the\n\nAKT pathway\n\nIn order to assess whether the effect observed was because of\nincreased transcription versus other mechanisms, the Caco2\nisogenic clones were transfected with a caveolin-1 promoter\nreporter construct. As shown in Figure 2a, an activated\nK-RAS oncogene increases caveolin-1 promoter reporter ac-\ntivity in the Caco2 isogenic cell system. Similarly, we wanted\nto assess whether the decrease in caveolin-1 expression in the\nHkh2 cells was a result of decreased transcription. The Hkh2\ncells showed a dramatic reduction in caveolin-1 promoter\nreporter activity as compared to the HCT116 cells (Fig. 2a).\nActivation of the RAS oncogene can result in upregulation of\nseveral signaling pathways in transformed cells, which in\nturn can have different outcomes. In order to assess the role\nof these pathways in K-RAS mediated caveolin-1 upregulation\nin Caco-Kras26 and HCT116 cells, we used PD98059 to in-\n\nhibit the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway and LY294002 to inhibit the\nP-I3Kinase/AKT pathway. We then determined caveolin-1\npromoter-reporter activity, as well as the levels of caveolin-1\nmRNA (Supporting Information Fig. 2a) and protein levels\nin PD98059- and LY294002-treated cells. While PD98059 did\nnot affect caveolin-1 promoter-reporter activity, treatment\nwith LY294002 diminished promoter reporter activity (Fig.\n2b), indicating that caveolin-1 is regulated by the P-I3 kinase\npathway at the level of transcription. As shown in Figure 2c,\nthere is a decrease in caveolin-1 protein levels in LY294002-\ntreated cell lines indicating that the PI-3 Kinase/AKT\nsignaling pathway is the main K-RAS effector pathway for\ncaveolin-1 upregulation in colon cancer cells expressing an\nactivated K-RAS oncogene. To further confirm the pharma-\ncological findings, we transfected the Caco-Kras26 cells with\na dominant negative (DN) AKT construct. This construct has\na mutation in the ATP-binding site, K179A, and acts in a\ndominant inhibitory manner.24 As shown in Figure 2d, there\nis a significant reduction in caveolin-1 mRNA (left panel)\nand protein (right panel) levels in the presence of the domi-\nnant negative AKT construct in the CacoKras#26 cells. Simi-\nlarly, transfection of the Caco-Neo3 cells with a constitutively\nactive (MYR) AKT, which produces a high level of AKT\nactivity24 leads to the induction of caveolin-1 mRNA and\nprotein levels (Fig. 2d, left and right panels). Similar results\nwere obtained in the HCT116 and Hkh2 cells (Supporting\nInformation Fig. 2b), thus confirming that caveolin-1 is tran-\nscriptionally induced by the AKT pathway.\n\nAKT increases caveolin-1 transcription through Sp1\n\nIn order to elucidate the mechanism by which AKT upregu-\nlates caveolin-1, we sought to determine which transcription\nfactors are activated in response to AKT signaling. One of\nthe key transcription factors whose DNA binding activity is\nincreased by AKT-dependent phosphorylation is Sp1.32,33\n\nThe human caveolin-1 promoter (AF019742) has a consensus\nSp1 binding site at the 2148 position from the transcrip-\ntional start site.34 To assess the role of Sp1 in AKT-depend-\nent caveolin-1 upregulation, we first determined the levels of\nphospho-Sp1 in the two independent isogenic cell line sys-\ntems. As seen in Figure 3a (left panel), both the HCT116\ncells and the Caco-Kras 26 cells have higher ratios of phos-\npho-Sp1 to total Sp1 protein levels, as compared to their\nwild-type K-RAS counterparts respectively. To determine\nwhether increased phospho-Sp1 corresponds to increased\nbinding to the caveolin-1 promoter site, we determined the\nextent of Sp1 binding using Chromatin Immuno-Precipita-\ntion (ChIP) assay with caveolin-1 promoter-specific primers.\nAs seen in Figure 3a (right panel), there is increased Sp1\nbinding to the caveolin-1 promoter region in the HCT116\nand the Caco-Kras26 cells. While these findings suggested\nthat AKT might activate Sp1, to conclusively determine the\ncontribution of the AKT-Sp1 pathway, we established\nwhether activation of the AKT pathway in the Caco-Neo cells\nor inhibition of the AKT pathway in the K-RAS expressing\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n48 Regulation of cancer cell migration by caveolin-1 and K-RAS\n\nInt.

Cancer: 133, 43–58 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nCaveolin-1 regulates K-RAS activity and is required for\n\nK-RAS signaling of migration in colon cancer cells\n\nCaveolin-1 expression is required to maintain correct subcel-\nlular localization of H-RAS and loss of caveolin-1 disrupts\nH-RAS–membrane localization in mouse embryo fibroblasts\nisolated from mice with knockout of caveolin-1 gene.35 Simi-\nlarly, we wanted to determine whether caveolin-1 expression\nis required for the activity of K-RAS in colon cancer cells.\nCaveolin-1 is tyrosine phosphorylated at tyrosine residue 14\nand can serve as an adaptor for signaling molecules with\nSH2 binding domains such as Shc and Grb2.36,37 As seen in\nFigure 4a, phospho-caveolin-1 levels are elevated in the\nHCT116 cells, as compared to the HCT116-Cav-1-AS cells,\nand the Hkh2 cells, suggesting that phospho-caveolin-1 levels\nmight be a regulator of K-RAS activation. In order to deter-\nmine whether phospho-caveolin-1 expression sustains RAS\nsignaling, we introduced in to HCT116-Cav-1 AS cells either\na full-length caveolin-1 expression construct (WT) or a\nmutant form of caveolin-1 that is deficient in tyrosine pho-\nphorylation at residue 14 (Caveolin-1 Y14F) and assayed for\nthe association of caveolin-1 with the two signaling molecules\nGrb2 and SOS1. Grb2 is an adaptor protein with an SH2 do-\nmain that binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and\nrecruits SOS, the RAS GEDF that is responsible for increas-\ning the activity of RAS proteins. As seen in Figure 4b, while\nintroduction of a full-length caveolin-1 protein was sufficient\nto form a complex of Grb2 and SOS, indicating the recruit-\nment of SOS1 to the membrane, this complex was not seen\nin the cells expressing caveolin-1 Y14F. Introduction of cav-\neolin-1 in Caco2 cells (that do not express caveolin-1 and\nhave a WT K-RAS) leads to a similar activation of Grb2 and\nSOS1 (data not shown). In line with these findings RAS\nactivity was restored in the cells expressing WT and not\nmutant caveolin-1 (Fig. 4b). These studies strongly suggest\nthat phosphorylated caveolin-1 sustains K-RAS signaling\nthrough increased activation of SOS1. Thus, even in the pres-\nence of WT K-RAS caveolin-1 expression can lead to sus-\ntained SOS1 and Grb2-dependent signal transduction.\n\nSince K-RAS has been shown to associate with caveolin-1,\nwe also assessed whether caveolin-1 alters K-RAS localization.\nWe knocked out caveolin-1 expression in the K-Ras#26 cells\nvia transient transfection of caveolin-1 siRNA and deter-\nmined the distribution of caveolin-1 protein in lipid raft by\nsucrose density gradient fractionation. As seen in Figure 4c,\nK-Ras#26 cells treated with scrambled siRNA show a regular\ndistribution of caveolin-1 protein in fractions 4, 5 and 6 in\nthe sucrose density gradient, following lipid raft fractionation.\nIn these cells, K-RAS is primarily distributed in fractions 4, 5\nand 6 also with flotillin-1 (a protein commonly localized to\nlipid rafts39). Interestingly, K-RAS distribution was altered in\nthe K-ras expressing cells with reduced caveolin-1 expression\nand is seen in fractions 5, 6, 7 and 8. We also determined\nthe distribution of K-RAS in HCT116-Mock (control) and\nHCT116-Cav-AS cells (HCT116 cells stably expressing a cav-\n\neolin-1 antisense construct and showing reduced levels of\ncaveolin-120) and found that K-RAS distribution is altered in\nlipid rafts following caveolin-1 depletion in HCT116 cells\n(Fig. 4d). Thus, caveolin-1 expression is required for main-\ntaining distribution of the K-RAS protein to lipid raft micro-\ndomains. This effect is specific to K-RAS since the\ndistribution of flotillin-1, another lipid raft-associated protein,\ndoes not get altered in caveolin-1 depleted cells.\n\nCaveolin-1 protein modulates the levels of active RAS\n(GTP-bound) following its depletion in the K-Ras#26 cells or\nin HCT116-Cav-1-AS cells without changes in total RAS pro-\ntein levels (Supporting Information Fig. 3). In line with these\nfindings, we also found that phosphorylated Erk1/2 and Akt\nlevels are substantially decreased in the lines with reduced\ncaveolin-1 expression, indicating that loss of caveolin-1\nexpression disrupts K-RAS-mediated intracellular signaling.\n(Supporting Information Fig. 3). It should be mentioned that\nwe did not detect any evidence of interaction between K-RAS\nand caveolin-1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiments.\n\nK-RAS increases migration of colon cancer cells in a\n\ncaveolin-1 and Src-dependent manner\n\nAcquisition of K-RAS mutations is a relatively late event in\ncolorectal carcinogenesis and is associated with poor progno-\nsis and increased metastatic disease. Cancer cell migration is\nan important aspect of cancer-associated metastasis. We and\nother groups have demonstrated that caveolin-1 is required\nfor the regulated secretion of extracellular proteases associ-\nated with cell migration.20,40 In order to determine whether\ncaveolin-1 is required for K-RAS-dependent migration, we\ndetermined the effect of caveolin-1 depletion on migration of\nCaco2 cells expressing mutant K-RAS and HCT116 cells. As\nseen in Figure 5a, the Kras#26 cells migrate significantly\nhigher than the Caco-Neo#3 (control) cells in an in vitro\ntranswell migration assay. Depletion of caveolin-1 in Caco-\nKras cells using siRNA dramatically reduces their caveolin-1\nexpression and migration, almost similar to that of control\ncells. Similarly, knockdown of caveolin-1 expression in\nHCT116 cells reduced their migration and migration (Fig.\n5b). These studies indicate that caveolin-1 is an essential reg-\nulator of cancer cell migration.\n\nIn order to determine whether caveolin-1 by itself can\naffect migration, we determined the rate of migration of\nCaco2 cells expressing an empty vector, or an expression vec-\ntor with WT or mutant (Y14F) caveolin-1. As seen in Figure\n6a, caveolin-1 is increased in cells transfected with a caveo-\nlin-1 expression construct. Interestingly, caveolin-1 expression\nby itself is not sufficient to increase migration of Caco2 cells\n(Fig. 6a). We had previously demonstrated that activated\nK-RAS increases caveolin-1 phosphorylation in a Src-depend-\nent manner.41 Src, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, is localized\nin caveolae and can phosphorylate caveolin-1 at tyrosine-\n14.7,42 Several recent reports have demonstrated that phos-\nphorylated caveolin-1 can increase migration in cancer\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nBasu Roy et al. 51\n\nInt.

However, pres-\nence of activated Src protein is unable to increase migration\nin Caco2 cells expressing caveolin-1 Y14F. These data suggest\nthat phosphorylated caveolin-1 can increase migration in co-\nlon cancer cells in a Src-dependent manner. To conclusively\n\ndetermine whether an activated K-RAS increases migration of\ncolon cancer cells by phosphorylating caveolin-1 via Src, we\ninhibited Src activity in Caco-Kras cells using the Pan-Src ki-\nnase inhibitor, PP2. Treatment with 25 mM PP2 leads to a\ndramatic reduction in phospho-caveolin-1 tyrosine-14 and\nphospho-Src (Fig. 6b). Reduction in caveolin-1 phosphoryla-\ntion is accompanied by a decrease in migration of the Caco-\nKras cells (Fig. 6b) indicating that Src plays a critical role in\nK-RAS dependent migration through caveolin-1\nphosphorylation.\n\nFigure 5.

Migration of cells was measured as described in\n\nRef. 39. Each experiment was performed in triplicate at least twice. Results of a representative experiment are shown.\n\n\n\nTyrosine phosphorylated caveolin-1 increases migration\n\nthrough activation of the RhoA GTPase\n\nOur data suggest that an activated K-RAS uses two distinct\nmechanisms to increase caveolin-1-dependent migration: (i)\nat the transcriptional level, it regulates caveolin-1 expression\nand (ii) at the post-translational level, it activates Src-depend-\nent phosphorylation of caveolin-1 (Figs. 6a and 6b). To\ndetermine the mechanism by which phospho-caveolin-1\nincreases migration, we examined the activation state of vari-\nous pro-migratory pathways. The Rho family of GTPases is\nimportant players in cancer cell migration and has been\nshown to increase migration through increased Src activity.\nInterestingly, RhoA activity is increased in cells expressing an\nactivated RAS,45 and caveolin-1 has been shown to be neces-\nsary for maintaining RhoA activity.46\n\nWe first determined the levels of active RhoA levels in the\ncells expressing active K-RAS. As seen in Figure 6c, active\nRhoA levels are increased in cells expressing an active K-RAS\ngene. Consistent with previously published reports,45 we\nfound no change in active Cdc42 and Rac1 levels in cells\nexpressing mutant K-RAS protein. Since caveolin-1 phospho-\nrylation status correlates with active RhoA levels, we then\ndetermined whether caveolin-1 expression was sufficient to\nincrease RhoA activity. As seen in Figure 6d, constitutive\nexpression of caveolin-1 is not sufficient to increase the activ-\nity of RhoA GTPase. However, concurrent expression of an\nactive form of Src that increase tyrosine phosphorylation of\ncaveolin-1 (Fig. 6a) increases the levels of active RhoA. This\nincrease is dependent on phospho-caveolin-1 since a phos-\nphorylation-deficient form of caveolin-1 is unable to increase\nRhoA activity, even in the presence of a constitutively active\nform of the Src kinase. These findings suggest that RhoA\nactivity might be a critical event in caveolin-1-dependent\nmigration. To assess the contribution of active RhoA in cav-\neolin-1-dependent migration, we introduced in the Caco2\ncells either a constitutively active RhoA mutant (RhoQ63L)\nor a dominant negative form of the protein (RhoT19N). As\nseen in Figure 6e, presence of the active form of RhoA is suf-\nficient to induce migration in the cells expressing mutant\ncaveolin-1 Y14F. More importantly, expression of RhoT19N\nblocks migration induced in caveolin-1-expressing cells in the\npresence of active Src. These results prove that RhoA\nactivation by phosphorylated caveolin-1 is a crucial event in\nmigration induced by an activated K-RAS protein.\n\nDiscussion\nIn this study, we have shown that caveolin-1 is a transcrip-\ntional target of the K-RAS oncogene in late stage colon cancer.\nThis upregulation is independent of the type of activating\nmutation present in the gene, since both G12V and G13D\nmutations are sufficient to upregulate caveolin-1 expression in\nhuman colon tumor-derived cells and in human colon tumor\ntissue harboring activating K-RAS mutations. An activated K-\nRAS can mediate signal transduction via multiple pathways,\n\nleading to various cancer phenotypes like decreased apoptosis\nand increased proliferation and migration. Using a combina-\ntion of pharmacological inhibitors and genetics, we show that\nthe P-I3 Kinase-AKT pathway is involved in K-RAS mediated\ncaveolin-1 expression in these colon cancer cell lines. The P-I3\nkinase/AKT pathway is an important signal transduction path-\nway which is involved in cell survival and apoptosis resistance.\nWe finally demonstrate that caveolin-1 is required for K-RAS-\ndependent signal transduction and migration. We propose a\nmodel for K-RAS-mediated caveolin-1 expression and activity\n(Supporting Information Fig. 4). An activated K-RAS onco-\ngene increases Sp1 transactivation in an AKT-dependent man-\nner. This in turn increases caveolin-1 transcription. Caveolin-1\nprotein then localizes to the membrane and is phosphorylated\nby Src. Caveolin-1 phosphorylated at tyrosine residue 14 then\nrecruits signaling molecules such as Grb2 and SOS1 to sustain\nsignal transduction and RhoA-dependent migration. In fact,\nwe have found that depletion of caveolin-1 in colon cancer\ncells harboring an activated K-RAS oncogene decreases GTP-\nbound (active) RAS suggesting that caveolin-1 expression is\nnecessary to sustain RAS-dependent signaling. These studies\nsuggest that the K-RAS-caveolin-1 pathway might elicit a posi-\ntive feedback loop to aid tumor cell migration and metastasis\nespecially in the late stages of colorectal cancer.\n\nThe role of RAS signaling in caveolin-1 expression is\nhighly debated. In studies carried out by Engelman et al., the\nRAS oncogene was shown to downregulate caveolin-1 expres-\nsion in NIH-3T3 cells.3 However, in a study carried out by\nSasai et al in human dermal fibroblasts, an activated K-RAS\noncogene was not sufficient to downregulate caveolin-1\nexpression levels.47 Thus, transformation by oncogenes in\nmurine cell culture systems is differentially regulated as com-\npared to human cell culture systems.48 Also, specific and dif-\nferential pathways are activated in murine and human cells,\nin response to an activated RAS oncogene.48 Thus, K-RAS-de-\npendent upregulation of caveolin-1 in human colon cancer\ncells is a unique finding and highlights the differential regula-\ntion of gene expression by K-RAS in murine and human car-\ncinogenesis. The involvement of the P-I3 Kinase pathway in\ncaveolin-1 upregulation has been demonstrated previously.\nThis pathway has been implicated in progestin- mediated\ncaveolin-1 expression in human breast cancer cells, and this\nis necessary for breast cancer proliferation.49 Our study\ndefines the role of AKT activation through K-RAS, in the\nexpression of caveolin-1 through the transcription factor Sp1.\n\nWe have previously shown that caveolin-1 is transcrip-\ntionally regulated by the APC tumor suppressor.50 The APC\ntumor suppressor is mutated in as many as 85% of diagnosed\ncolorectal cancer cases, and is often considered to be an ini-\ntiating mutation.51 The K-RAS oncogene in mutated in 35%\ncases of sporadic colorectal cancer, and occurs at the later\nstages of cancer development.52,53 Thus, caveolin-1 expression\nmight be differentially regulated at different stages of colo-\nrectal cancer progression. In the initial stages, following an\nAPC mutation, there is downregulation of caveolin-1.14\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\nBasu Roy et al. 55\n\nInt. J. Cancer: 133, 43–58 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nHowever, acquisition of a K-RAS mutation might then be a\npotential mechanism to upregulate caveolin-1. It is interesting\nto note that caveolin-1 expression is elevated in late stage co-\nlon adenocarcinoma where K-RAS is often activated through\nmutations.12,13 Thus, caveolin-1 upregulation might occur at\nlate stages of colorectal carcinogenesis.51,54\n\nOur studies also identify caveolin-1 as a novel regulator of\nK-RAS-dependent signaling and cancer cell migration. Caveo-\nlin-1 has been shown to be necessary for the activation of the\nP-I3 Kinase/AKT pathway.55 In prostate cells, caveolin-1 can\nconfer a survival advantage by maintaining an activated AKT\nthrough negative regulation of the AKT phosphatases, PP1\nand PP2A.8 Additionally, caveolin-1 is phosphorylated at res-\nidue Tyr14 by several oncogenes, and this can help recruit-\nment of GRB7 through its SH2 domain and lead to sustained\nsignaling.42 Thus, while caveolin-1 can negatively regulate\nsignal transduction,56 tyrosine phosphorylation of caveolin-1\nconverts it into a highly efficient scaffold for proteins with\nSH2 domain thereby increasing mitogenic signaling. Interest-\ningly, we have found that colon cancer cells harboring an\nactivated K-RAS mutation are sensitive to caveolin-1 levels\nsince depletion of caveolin-1 decreases active K-RAS levels\nand mitogenic signaling. This could be explained by the re-\ndistribution of K-RAS protein from lipid rafts in cells that\nhave been depleted of caveolin-1. While these studies high-\nlight a novel role for caveolin-1 in K-RAS-dependent mito-\ngenic signaling, it is noteworthy to point out that work by\nRoy and colleagues demonstrates that K-RAS is unaffected by\nthe expression of a dominant negative mutant of caveolin-1\nin BHK cells.57 Their study shows that lipid-raft associated\nH-RAS is more susceptible to a caveolin-1 mutant than K-\nRAS in BHK cells. However, work from Kranenburg et al.\ndemonstrate that in COS cells, K-RAS localizes to caveolae\nand that its activity it highly dependent on this localization58\n\nwith disruption of caveolar structures leading to altered K-\n\nRAS activity. Thus, the effect of caveolin-1 on K-RAS might\nbe cell-type specific and sensitive to the cholesterol content\nof the cells. In colon cancer cells, depletion of caveolin-1\ndecreases free cholesterol (our unpublished observation).\nThus, K-RAS activity in these cells might be sensitive to cav-\neolin-1 depletion because of altered cholesterol metabolism.\n\nCaveolin-1 was originally identified as a substrate of the\nSrc tyrosine kinase. Recent reports have demonstrated that\nphosphorylated caveolin-1 has been associated with increased\ntumor cell migration.43,59 Phosphorylated caveolin-1 increases\ncell migration via the modulation of the RHO/Rock pathway.\nThus, acquisition of a K-RAS mutation, followed by conse-\nquent upregulation of caveolin-1 and Src-dependent caveolin-\n1 phosphorylation might aid in cancer progression by increas-\ning the metastatic potential of cancer cells. Furthermore, cav-\neolin-1 has been shown to be necessary for the localization\nand secretion of the tumor proteases, cathepsin B and kallik-\nrein 6, both of which are necessary for migration.20,40,60,61\n\nOur data suggest that caveolin-1 is a conditional “oncogene”\nin colon cancer whose activity is dependent on mutant K-RAS.\nOur data suggests that activation of AKT and Src regulate cav-\neolion-1 expression and post-translational modification. In fact,\nphospho-AKT and phosphor-Src levels are elevated in the\ntumors samples harboring K-RAS mutations. Through regula-\ntion by the K-RAS oncogene at late stages of colorectal carcino-\ngenesis, caveolin-1 might play pleiotropic roles in cancer\ndevelopment, depending on the stage of cancer.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported in part by grants from the National Institutes of\nHealth, CA095060 (to E.W.G., PI) and CA123065 (to N.A.I. and E.W.G.,\nCo-PI’s).
