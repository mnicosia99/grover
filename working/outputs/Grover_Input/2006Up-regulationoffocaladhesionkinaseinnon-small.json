Introduction\n\nnumber of factors regulate tumour cell growth, migration\nnd proliferation, and a major role is played by interac-\nions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1]. Integrins are\nell membrane-spanning proteins that bind to the ECM and\nontribute to the assembly of the cellular focal adhesion\nites in which focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is located. FAK\ns a non-receptor tyrosine kinase protein that was origi-\nally detected in Rous sarcoma virus (v-src)-transformed\nhicken embryo fibroblasts [2]. A primary autophosphory-\nation site (Tyr397) is located in the N-terminal region of\nAK and directs the interaction with the Src homology-2\nomain [3]. Two highly conserved tyrosine residues (Tyr576\nnd Tyr577) are part of the central catalytic domain that is\nnvolved in signalling events to downstream effectors [4],\nnd multiple protein—protein interaction sites are present\nn the C-terminal region [5]. FAK is a point of convergence for\nhe signalling events mediated by both integrins and growth\nactor receptors [6] that regulate processes, such as cell\ndhesion [5], motility [7], migration [8], and apoptosis [9].\n\nFAK phosphorylation leads to the activation of various\nownstream intracellular signalling molecules such as Src\namily kinases [10], phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [11], phos-\nholipase C [12] and Grb7 [13]. As all of these effectors\nctivate pathways that are intimately involved in neoplastic\nransformation, invasion and metastases, FAK may play an\nmportant role in tumourigenesis [14], a hypothesis that is\nupported by the original isolation of the human FAK gene\nrom a primary human sarcoma [15] and the high FAK lev-\nls found in several tumour cell lines of different origin [16].\nAK is also up-regulated in different primary human tumours\nncluding breast, colorectal [17], prostate [18], thyroid [19],\nvarian [20], and brain tumours [21]. The extent of its mRNA\nxpression has been linked to the progression of epithe-\nial and mesenchymal tumours to invasive and metastatic\nhenotypes [22], and to poor prognoses in patients with hep-\ntocellular carcinoma [23] and acute myeloid leukemia [24].\ninally, at cell level, FAK regulates matrix metalloproteinase\nxpression and secretion, and EGF-stimulated chemotaxis\notility [14].\nThe FAK signal transduction pathway may be a promising\n\narget for cancer therapy [14]. It has recently been shown\nhat inhibiting FAK expression and activation by inducing\nAK-related non-kinase (FRNK) increases the sensitivity of\nransformed human kidney epithelial cells to 5-fluorouracil,\nhich suggests that FAK may play a role in tumour chemore-\n\nistance [25]. The same has been found in pancreatic ade-\nocarcinoma cells, in which the suppression of FAK expres-\nion by means of mRNA interference enhances gemcitabine-\nnduced in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity, and increases\numour susceptibility to chemotherapy [26]. Moreover, the\nctivation of FAK and its molecular partners improves cell\nesistance to ionizing radiation in lung adenocarcinoma cells\n27]. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in\nestern countries: its incidence continues to increase [28]\n\nnd it has a poor prognosis as only 15% of affected subjects\n\nurvive for 5 years or more after diagnosis [29]. However,\nespite the increasing importance of FAK in human cancer,\nhere is still a lack of data concerning FAK expression in pri-\nary human NSCLCs. The aim of this study was to investigate\n\nhe expression and clinical significance of FAK in 60 surgically\n\nL\n�\nS\no\ni\n\nS. Carelli et al.\n\nesected stage I—IV NSCLCs with known clinicopathological\neatures.\n\n. Materials and methods\n\n.1. Patients and samples\n\nhe study population consisted of 60 NSCLC patients who\nnderwent curative surgical resection, without having pre-\niously received chemotherapy or radiation therapy; all of\nhe enrolled patients have their informed consent to the\ntudy.\n\nTissue samples representative of the tumour, non-\neoplastic lung parenchyma (normal tissue sections and\neactive lung parenchyma adjacent to carcinomas) and five\nicroscopically normal lung specimens were routinely fixed\n\nn 10% buffered neutral formalin, and processed for conven-\nional histopathological examination. Immediately adjacent\neoplastic specimens and 21 macroscopically non-neoplastic\nissue samples (taken as far as possible from the neoplastic\nrea) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen within 10 min of\nurgical resection, and standard 5 �m thick sections from\naraffin-embedded blocks were stained with hematoxylin\nnd eosin, and examined by light microscopy. Tumour his-\notype and stage were, respectively, determined according\no the WHO classification of lung and pleural tumours (1999)\nnd the TNM staging system (1997). All of the non-neoplastic\namples were microscopically judged to be benign.\n\nThe clinical follow-up of 43 patients was available for a\nean post-surgical period of 28 months (range: 12—45); the\n\nollow-up data were obtained by means of direct patient\nontact at 2-month intervals for the first 2 years and 4-\nonth intervals thereafter. At the time of the last follow-up,\n\n3 patients had died for cancer-related causes. The clinico-\nathological characteristics of the study patients are shown\nn Table 1.\n\n.2. Tissue homogenisation and protein\nuantification\n\nresh frozen lung tissues were homogenised under iso-\nonic condition (25 mM Tris—HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose,\n% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1% NP-40 (v/v), 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM\nGTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonylfluoride, 1 mM aprotinin,\nmM leupeptin, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM sodium\noride) using an ULTRA-TURRAX T25 homogeniser (IKA-\n\nabortechnik GmbH, Staufen, Germany). The homogenates\nere centrifuged at 2800 rpm for 20 min at 4 ◦C, after which\n\nhe supernatants were collected and their protein concen-\nration determined by means of Lowry Ciocalteau’s method\nsing bovine serum albumin as standard.\n\n.3. Western blotting\n\nqual amounts of solubilised protein (75 �g) were heated in\n\naemmli sample buffer (Biorad, Hercules, CA) containing 2-\nmercaptoethanol (70 mM), separated by one-dimensional\n\nDS-PAGE gel under reducing conditions, and electroblotted\nnto nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked\nn TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (v/v), containing 5% slim milk\n\n\n\nFAK in lung cancer\n\nTable 1 Clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC\npatients and tumours\n\nClinicopathological characteristics No. of cases (%)\n\nAge (years)\nMean 65\nRange 22—79\n\nGender\nMan 48 (80)\nWoman 12 (20)\n\nTumour histotype\nADK 42 (70)\nSQ 11 (18)\nOthersa 7 (12)\n\nTumour grade\nG1 2 (3)\nG2 26 (44)\nG3 32 (53)\n\nPathological tumour stage\nT1 8 (13)\nT2 38 (63)\nT3 3 (5)\nT4 11 (18)\nN0 29 (48)\nN1, N2 31 (52)\n\nStage grouping\nI 24 (40)\nII 16 (27)\nIII 18 (30)\nIV 2 (3)\n\nu\nt\nt\nF\nt\nw\nm\nC\nh\ne\nb\na\ns\nE\no\nl\n\n2\np\na\nm\nt\np\na\nw\ns\n4\nt\nw\n(\na\n4\na\ni\ns\nt\nw\n(\nh\nc\ne\n\n2\n\nF\nt\nP\nt\na\ne\nl\nl\n�\n\nB\n\n2\n\nADK: adenocarcinoma; SQ: squamous cell carcinoma.\na Two adenosquamous carcinomas; three large-cell carcino-\n\nmas; two pleomorphic carcinomas.\n\n(w/v), and probed with anti-FAK polyclonal antibody specific\nfor the C-terminal portion of the protein (1:200 dilution;\nSanta Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) overnight at 4 ◦C.\nThe membrane was then incubated with goat anti-rabbit\nIgG-horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution; Chemicon,\nTemecula, CA). p53 and �1-Integrin expression was assessed\nusing specific polyclonal antibodies (1:200 dilution, Santa\nCruz Biotechnology). Membranes were then incubated using\nanti-�-actin (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) as\ninternal control. FAK activation was investigated using the\nFAK pY Sampler Pack (Biosource, Camarillo, CA), which\ncontains polyclonal antibodies recognising phosphorylated\ntyrosines (Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576, Tyr577, Tyr861); FAK phos-\nphorylation was normalised to its expression levels. The\nproteins were visualised by means of an enhanced chemilu-\nminescence detection system (ECLTM, Amersham, Arlington\nHeights, IL). After being acquired using a GelDocTM image\ncapture system (Biorad), the autoradiograms were quanti-\nfied using Quantity OneTM software.\n2.4. Immunohistochemistry\n\nFive micrometer thick sections representative of the tumour\nand non-neoplastic lung parenchyma were immunostained\n\nR\nT\nn\ng\nV\n\n265\n\nsing a standard avidin—biotin—peroxidase complex (ABC)\nechnique and the Super Sensitive Non-Biotin HRP Detec-\nion System (Menarini, Florence, Italy), with the anti-\nAK antibody that recognises the N-terminal portion of\nhe protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, the slides\nere dewaxed, rehydrated and processed using an Opti-\nax Plus automated immunostainer (BioGenex, San Ramon,\nA). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 3%\nydrogen peroxide in distilled water for 10 min and, after\nxtensive washing in TBS/Triton X-100, the slides were incu-\nated with the primary antibody (1:500 dilution) overnight\nt 4 ◦C; 3,3′-diaminobenzidine was used as the chromogenic\nubstrate. Positive and negative controls were included.\nach tissue section was separately evaluated by two pathol-\ngists (MF and SB) who were unaware of the clinicopatho-\nogical characteristics.\n\nThe intensity of FAK immunostaining (1 = weak,\n= moderate, and 3 = intense) and the percentage of\nositive tumour cells (0% = negative, 1—40% = 1, 41—70% = 2,\nnd >70% = 3) were assessed in at least five areas at ×400\nagnification; in the case of heterogeneous immunos-\n\naining, the predominant pattern was used for scoring\nurposes. The scores of each case were multiplied to give\nfinal score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 9, and the tumours\n\nere finally classified as negative: score 0; low expres-\nors (LE): score ≤ 3; intermediate expressors (IE): score\n; or high expressors (HE): score ≥ 6. The staining of\nhe adjacent non-neoplastic parenchyma in each section\nas also evaluated.

The scores of each case were multiplied\no give a final score of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 9, and the tumours\nere finally classified as negative: score 0; low expressors\n\nLE): score ≤ 3; intermediate expressors (IE): score 4; or\nigh expressors (HE): score ≥ 6. The staining of the adja-\nent non-neoplastic parenchyma in each section was also\nvaluated.\n\n.5. Real-time RT-PCR\n\nAK mRNA levels were quantified by real-time quantita-\nive RT-PCR based on TaqManTM technology, using the ABI\nRISM 7900 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosys-\nems, Foster City, CA) as previously described [30]. The\nmount of FAK mRNA was normalised to an endogenous ref-\nrence (�-actin, ACTB) and expressed as n-fold FAK mRNA\nevels in relation to a calibrator or 1× sample (MCF7 cell\nine).

Results\n\n.1. FAK Western blotting\n\nestern blotting was used to evaluate p125FAK protein\nxpression in 16 NSCLCs (six stage I, six stage II, four stage III)\nTable 1) and paired non-neoplastic lung parenchymas. FAK\nxpression was significantly increased in 13 NSCLC samples\nn comparison with their non-neoplastic counterparts. The\nestern blotting of seven samples is shown in Fig. 1(panel\n); the ratio between the optical density of the neoplas-\nic (T) and non-neoplastic (N) tissues (OD T/N) of the same\natients was calculated and expressed graphically (Fig. 1,\nanel B). The increased expression of FAK in the NSCLCs\ns documented by the mean ratio of 2.98 (range 0—7.3),\nnd comparable results were obtained using a polyclonal\nntibody specific for the FAK N-terminal portion (data not\nhown). FAK activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphoryla-\n\nion [32], and so the phosphorylation status of FAK tyrosine\nesidues measured by specific antibodies can be considered\nn index of protein activation. All of the evaluated tyro-\nine residues (see Section 2) were phosphorylated in the\neoplastic and non-neoplastic specimens, with no quan-\n\nanalysis was made in all other 15 patients with similar results\n(data not shown).

Tissue localisation of FAK by\nimmunohistochemistry\n\nFAK immunoreactivity was detected in both normal and neo-\nplastic lung cells. In normal bronchus, FAK protein expression\nwas detected in epithelial ciliated and basal cells, chon-\ndrocytes, and the ductal and serous cells of the submu-\ncosal glands; FAK immunostaining was also detected in the\nendothelial cells of the vessels within the lung parenchyma.\nImmunoreactivity was greater in reactive lesions, such as\nsquamous metaplastic bronchial epithelium, and in the\nhyperplastic/reactive pneumocytes surrounding the neo-\nplasia. Fig. 2 shows FAK protein immunodetection in non-\nneoplastic lung parenchyma.\n\nIn comparison with the non-neoplastic lung parenchy-\nmas, FAK was overexpressed in every neoplastic tissue\nsection. Furthermore, FAK immunoreactivity was stronger\nin the NSCLCs than in previously described reactive lung\nlesions, with moderate-strong immunoreactivity in between\n40% and more than 90% of tumour cells. Forty-six of\nthe NSCLCs (77%) were HE (moderate-intense immunore-\nactivity in more than 70% neoplastic cells; scores 6\nand 9), 10 (17%) were IE (moderate immunoreactivity in\n40—70% of neoplastic cells; score 4), and 4 (7%) were LE\n(moderate-intense immunoreactivity in less than 40% neo-\nplastic cells; scores 2 and 3). FAK was also observed in\nthe endothelial cells of the vessels within the neoplastic\nstroma.\n\nFurthermore, as shown in Table 2, there was no sig-\n\nnificant difference in FAK immunostaining between the\ntwo most represented tumour histotypes (ADK versus SQ,\np = 0.947, �2-test).

Original\n\n3.3. Quantitative evaluation of FAK mRNA by\nreal-time RT-PCR\n\nFAK mRNA levels were investigated in 60 NSCLCs and 21\nmatched non-neoplastic lung tissues (16 of these matched\nsamples were also studied by Western blotting, see Fig. 1).\nThe non-neoplastic lung samples were used to establish the\nbasal levels of FAK mRNA, and FAK transcripts ranging from\n0.5n to 3.3n (mean 1.3n; median 1.1n) were determined in\nall of them. Three tumour samples were discarded because\nof RNA degradation, but FAK mRNA was assayed in all of\nthe remaining 57 and ranged from 0.5n to 4.5n (mean 1.8n;\nmedian 1.5n). Both Wilcoxon’s test and the t-test showed\nthat FAK mRNA levels were significantly higher in the NSCLCs\nwhether all of the samples were considered (p = 0.016 and\n0.013) (Fig. 4), or just the 21 matched neoplastic and non-\nneoplastic lung samples (p = 0.038 and 0.04).\n\n3.4.

Expression of �1-integrin and p53 in NSCLCs\n\nhe correlations between FAK up-regulation and changes in\nther adhesion- and apoptosis-related proteins were evalu-\nted by Western blotting in 12 of the above samples. The\nxpression of �1-integrin was comparable in the neoplastic\nnd non-neoplastic lung tissues (p = 0.13, t-test), as can be\neen in the example of Western blotting and densitomet-\nic analysis of all of the examined cases in Fig. 5 (panel\n). The up-regulation of FAK therefore seems to be spe-\nific among adhesion-related molecules. We also assessed\nhe pro-apoptotic p53 protein, which is capable of suppress-\nng FAK expression [31], and found that the increased FAK\nxpression in NSCLCs did not correspond to changes in p53\nxpression in any of the 12 cases (p = 0.3, t-test) (Fig. 5,\nanel B).\n\n. Discussion\n\nAK is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell motility\n7], migration [8], apoptosis [9] and cell matrix interac-\nions [6]. All of these processes are crucial for neoplastic\nransformation, invasion and dissemination, and suggest a\notential role of FAK in the development and progression\nf cancer [14]. FAK is overexpressed in a variety of human\numours including breast [17], colorectal [17,33], prostate\n18,34], thyroid [19], ovarian [20], endometrial [35], and\nrain cancers [21]. Agents aimed at inhibiting the FAK signal\nransduction pathway may be useful in the development of\nffective new anticancer therapies [14,36]. Inhibited FAK\nFig. 3 FAK protein overexpression in NSCLCs as detected by imm\nmous cell carcinoma. Original magnification: (A) ×600 and (B) ×4\n\nimmunostaining. Considering all of the FAK protein expres-\nsion values, Western blotting showed a statistically signif-\nicant correlation between higher protein levels and a high\ntumour stage (stage I + II versus stage III + IV, p = 0.019). The\nFAK mRNA overexpression revealed by real-time RT-PCR not\nonly correlated with a high tumour stage (stage I + II ver-\nsus stage III + IV, p = 0.028), but there was also a statistically\nsignificant association between FAK mRNA level and tumour\nsize (T1 versus T2, T3 and T4, p = 0.046).\n\nThe association between FAK mRNA measured by real-\ntime RT-PCR and the presence of node metastases at the\ntime of resection was also observed. The 21 matched spec-\nimens were analysed separately and sub-classified on the\nctivity or modulated FAK expression have recently been\nssociated with the decreased resistance of human pan-\nreatic adenocarcinoma cells to acquired apoptosis with\netachment from the ECM [37], the increased sensitivity of\nransformed human kidney epithelial cells to 5-fluorouracil\n\n\n\nFAK in lung cancer 269\n\nFig. 5 FAK regulation in NSCLCs. �1-integrin (A) and p53 (B) expression in matched neoplastic (T) and non-neoplastic homogenates\nhown\ns are\nE. of\n\nc\nm\nn\nb\nt\nT\nt\no\ni\nb\np\nc\nr\no\n\nc\na\nm\nt\nt\ns\na\ns\ni\na\np\ns\nc\nt\np\n\n(N) of 12 NSCLC patients.

Mean values ± S.\n\n[30], and enhanced gemcitabine-induced in vitro and in vivo\ncytotoxicity [26].\n\nThis paper describes FAK expression in NSCLCs and non-\nneoplastic lung parenchyma for the first time. We analysed\n60 tumours by means of immunohistochemistry and quan-\ntitative real-time RT-PCR, 16 of which were also analysed\nby Western blotting, and provide immunohistochemical and\nmolecular evidence of FAK up-regulation in NSCLCs. FAK\ndistribution within neoplastic tissue was quite diffuse and\nhomogeneous, thus supporting its potential role in confer-\nring an advantage on growth and survival, and giving tumour\ncells more invasive behaviour [16]. We also found that FAK\nup-regulation is common in NSCLCs, regardless of tumour\nhistotype and grade: weak-moderate FAK immunostaining\nwas detected in ciliated basal epithelial cells, ductal cells\nof the submucosal glands of the bronchus, as well as in\nchondrocytes and vessel endothelial cells of non-neoplastic\nlung parenchyma. Interestingly, more intense FAK protein\nimmunostaining was observed in bronchial squamous meta-\nplastic epithelium and hyperplastic alveolar cells, which are\nconsidered reactive changes that may evolve into dysplastic\nand neoplastic transformations.\n\nThese immunohistochemical observations may partially\nexplain our quantitative Western blotting and real-time RT-\nPCR evaluations of FAK protein and mRNA in non-neoplastic\nlung tissues. FAK mRNA levels were significantly higher in the\nneoplastic than in the non-neoplastic lung samples, which is\nconsistent with previous observations of FAK overexpression\nin human malignancies [16]. Moreover, all of the neoplas-\ntic samples whose FAK overexpression was determined by\nWestern blotting and real-time RT-PCR came from patients\nwith a high tumour stage at the time of resection. Taken\n\ntogether, these findings suggest that FAK up-regulation may\nbe an early event in lung neoplastic transformation, and fur-\nther support previously published data favouring its crucial\nrole in the development and maintenance of human cancers\n[17,32,33].\n\nc\ns\ni\np\nt\n\n; the quantitative densitometric ratio between the neoplastic\nplotted under the gel images. As a gel loading control, the\ntwo independent experiments with similar results.\n\nWe also found that the expression of �1-integrin does not\nhange in NSCLCs, and so it is possible that FAK up-regulation\nay be specific to NSCLCs. Furthermore, the up-regulation is\n\not accompanied by any changes in FAK activity, as assessed\ny evaluating the extent of protein phosphorylation [32]:\nhe five tyrosine residues analysed (Tyr397, Tyr407, Tyr576,\nyr577 and Tyr861) proved to be equally phosphorylated in\nhe neoplastic and non-neoplastic tissues. It is known that\nne of the possible mechanisms involved in FAK regulation\ns the action of p53, which inhibits FAK transcription [31],\nut we found that the expression of p53 in our tumour sam-\nles overexpressing FAK was comparable with that in the\nontrol non-tumoural lung tissues. It is possible that the up-\negulation of FAK may be due to the amplification of its gene\nr p53 gene mutations.\n\nFAK overexpression in human malignancies has been asso-\niated with cancer cell migration and invasiveness, and more\nggressive tumour behaviour including distant and/or nodal\netastases [17,23,24,38,39]. The lack of FAK signalling in\n\nhe endothelial cells of FAK−/− mice embryos has shown\nhat the function of this protein is crucial for morphogene-\nis and the formation of blood vessels [40]. In addition, FAK\nctivation in mouse microvascular endothelial cells is neces-\nary to regulate in vitro tube formation [41]. We found FAK\nmmunoreactivity in the endothelial cells of both neoplastic\nnd adjacent non-neoplastic lung parenchyma, similarly to\nreviously described findings in the vascular network of oral\nquamous cancers [41], and the microvascular endothelial\nells of malignant astrocytic tumours [42]. These charac-\neristics may explain the invasive and metastatic malignant\nhenotype of tumours overexpressing FAK.\n\nIn conclusion, our study provides the first immunohisto-\n\nhemical and molecular evidence that increased FAK tran-\ncript levels and protein expression are common events\nn NSCLC. By immunohistochemistry, FAK protein overex-\nression was also detectable in reactive changes, such as\nhe squamous cell metaplasia of bronchial epithelial cells\n\n\n\n2\n\na\nt\nt\nr\nb\nt\nT\nl\ni\nn\nv\np\nf\n\nA\n\nT\nI\n\nR\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n[\n\n70\n\nnd alveolar hyperplasia. The immunohistochemical detec-\nion of FAK overexpression in all of our cases regardless of\numour stage supports the hypothesis that FAK may play a\nole in maintaining the malignancy of the morphological and\niological characteristics of transformed lung cells, rather\nhan a crucial role in the later stages of NSCLC progression.\nhe detection of FAK overexpression, particularly at protein\n\nevel, may represent a novel target for inhibitory therapies\nn lung cancer [43]. However, the up-regulation of FAK could\not be statistically related to disease-free or overall sur-\nival in our patients probably because of the short follow-up\neriod. The prognostic significance of FAK in NSCLCs there-\nore requires further evaluation.\n\ncknowledgement\n\nhis work was supported in part by a grant from Associazione\ntaliana Ricerca sul Cancro (AIRC).\n\neferences\n\n[1] Aplin AE, Howe AK, Juliano RL.
