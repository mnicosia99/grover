Since drugs can have off-target effects, we studied the effects of AR deletion on the\ndevelopment and molecular abnormalities that contribute to diabetic retinopathy. Since recent data suggests an important\nrole for leukocytes in the development of the retinopathy, we determined also if AR in leukocytes contributes to leukocyte-\nmediated death of retinal endothelial cells in diabetes.\n\nMethods: Wild-type (WT; C57BL/6J) and AR deficient (AR2/2) mice were made diabetic with streptozotocin. Mice were\nsacrificed at 2 and 10 months of diabetes to evaluate retinal vascular histopathology, to quantify retinal superoxide\nproduction and biochemical and physiological abnormalities in the retina, and to assess the number of retinal endothelial\ncells killed by blood leukocytes in a co-culture system.\n\nResults: Diabetes in WT mice developed the expected degeneration of retinal capillaries, and increased generation of\nsuperoxide by the retina. Leukocytes from diabetic WT mice also killed more retinal endothelial cells than did leukocytes\nfrom nondiabetic animals (p,0.0001). Deletion of AR largely (P,0.05) inhibited the diabetes-induced degeneration of\nretinal capillaries, as well as the increase in superoxide production by retina. AR-deficiency significantly inhibited the\ndiabetes-induced increase in expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in retina, but had no significant effect on\nexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), phosphorylated p38 MAPK, or killing of retinal endothelial cells by\nleukocytes.\n\nConclusions: AR contributes to the degeneration of retinal capillaries in diabetic mice. Deletion of the enzyme inhibits the\ndiabetes-induced increase in expression of iNOS and of superoxide production, but does not correct a variety of other pro-\ninflammatory abnormalities associated with the development of diabetic retinopathy.\n\nCitation: Tang J, Du Y, Petrash JM, Sheibani N, Kern TS (2013) Deletion of Aldose Reductase from Mice Inhibits Diabetes-Induced Retinal Capillary Degeneration\nand Superoxide Generation.

Particularly with\n\nregard to cataractogenesis, evidence suggested that pathology\n\noccurred as a result of osmotic consequences of AR-mediated\n\nreduction of glucose to its polyol, sorbitol [2]. Since then, AR has\n\nbeen found also to regulate a variety of additional abnormalities\n\n(including oxidative stress and inflammation) that have been\n\nimplicated in the pathogenesis of various complications of diabetes\n\n[3–5] and other diseases [6–16].\n\nEfforts to inhibit this pathway to inhibit diabetic retinopathy in\n\npatients have relied heavily on pharmacologic inhibitors of the\n\nenzyme [17]. Nevertheless, results of these studies with regard to\n\nthe retinopathy have been inconsistent and controversial. Some\n\nstudies of diabetic or galactosemic rodents or dogs showed\n\nbeneficial effects of AR inhibitors on lesions of the retinpathy\n\n[18–23], whereas no significant effects were detected in clinical\n\nstudies in patients and other studies of diabetic and galactosemic\n\ndogs and rodents [24–27]. Possibilities that have been discussed to\n\nexplain the lack of agreement among studies include differences in\n\nthe degree of inhibition of AR, the presence of isoforms of the\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62081\n\n\n\nenzyme that respond differently to therapies, genetic differences\n\namong individuals, and possible off-target effects of the different\n\nAR inhibitors [17].\n\nGeneration of animals that are totally deficient in AR is one way\n\nto overcome the shortcomings associated with the use of\n\npharmacologic inhibitors of AR. Moreover, AR\n2/2\n\nanimals allow\n\nthe opportunity to investigate the molecular pathways by which\n\nAR acts in hyperglycemia. Thus, the availability of AR\n2/2\n\nanimals makes it worthwhile to revisit this topic. In the present\n\nstudy, we investigated the effect of AR deficiency on diabetes-\n\ninduced degeneration of retinal capillaries in early diabetic\n\nretinopathy, and on diabetes-induced pro-inflammatory and pro-\n\noxidant changes in the retina.\n\nResearch Design and Methods\n\nExperimental Animals\nAR\n\n2/2\nmice were prepared [28] and backcrossed with C57BL/\n\n6 mice for seven generations. Male C57Bl/6J mice and AR\n2/2\n\nmice were randomly assigned to become diabetic or remain as\n\nnondiabetic group. Diabetes was induced by 5 sequential daily\n\nintraperitoneal injections of a freshly prepared solution of\n\nstreptozotocin in citrate buffer (pH 4.5) at 45 mg/kg of body\n\nweight. Insulin was given as needed to prevent weight loss without\n\npreventing hyperglycemia and glucosuria (0–0.2 units of NPH\n\ninsulin subcutaneously, 0–3 times per week). Glycohemoglobin\n\n(GHb) was measured by Bio-Rad Total Glycated Hemoglobin\n\nAssay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA) every 2–\n\n3 mos and just before animals were sacrificed. Food consumption\n\nand body weight were measured weekly. Animals were studied for\n\ndurations of 10 months or 2 months of diabetes in order to\n\ninvestigate effects of the therapy on retinal histopathology, or\n\nmolecular and physiologic changes, respectively. These durations\n\nwere chosen because 2 mos diabetes has been found to result in\n\nnumerous metabolic alterations which precede (and likely\n\ncontribute to) the later appearance of vascular histopathology,\n\nand 10 mos duration of diabetes has been shown to have\n\ndeveloped robust vascular histopathology characteristic of the\n\nearly stages of the retinopathy.\n\nEthics Statement\nTreatment of animals conformed to the ARVO Resolution on\n\nTreatment of Animals in Research, as well as to institutional\n\nguidelines (Case Western Reserve University IACUC # 2010–\n0156).\n\nRetinal histopathology. After 10 months of diabetes, one\n\nretina was fixed in 10% buffered formalin, washed in running\n\nwater overnight, and digested in elastase (Calbiochem,\n\nCat#324682) buffer (40 unit/ml elastase in 100 mM sodium\nphosphate buffer (containing 150 mM sodium chloride and 5 mM\n\nethylenediamene tetraacetic acid (EDTA; pH 6.5) in an agitating\n\nwater bath at 37u for 1K h [29]. Then, retinas were washed\novernight in 100 mM Tris-HCI (pH 8.5) at room temperature,\n\nand cleaning was finished the next day. When totally cleaned of\n\nneural cells, the isolated vasculature was laid out on a glass\n\nmicroscope slide, dried overnight, stained with hematoxylin and\n\nperiodic acid-Schiff, dehydrated and coverslipped. Degenerate\n\n(acellular) capillaries were quantitated in 6–7 field areas corre-\n\nsponding to the mid-retina in a masked manner. Acellular\n\ncapillaries were identified as capillary-sized vessel tubes having\n\nno nuclei anywhere along their length, and were reported per\n\nsquare millimeter of retinal area.\n\nSuperoxide Measurement\nAt 2 months of diabetes, fresh retinas from animals were\n\nanalyzed for superoxide production as previously described\n\n[30,31]. Briefly, whole retinas were placed in 0.2 ml Krebs/Hepes\n\nbuffer and allowed to equilibrate in the dark for 30 mins at 37uC\nunder 5% CO2. To each tube, 0.5 mM lucigenin (Sigma\n\nChemical Company, St. Louis, MO) was added, and photon\n\nemission was detected over the following 10 min using a\n\nluminometer. Retinal protein was quantified per samples (Bio-\n\nRad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA) and luminescence was\n\nexpressed per milligram protein.\n\nWestern Blots\nAt 2 months of diabetes, retinal homogenates separated by\n\nSDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad\n\nLaboratories, Inc, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were blocked\n\nin Tris-buffered saline containing 0.02% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat\n\nmilk., washed, and were incubated with anti-rat ICAM-1 (1:2000\n\ndilution; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), anti-rat iNOS (1:1000\n\ndilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-rat\n\nnitrotyrosine (1;1000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Bill-\n\nerca, MA), anti-rat p38 MAPK and p-p38 MAPK (1;1000\n\ndilution; Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Danvers, MA) for\n\n2 hrs, and then stained with respective horseradish peroxidase\n\ncoupled secondary antibody (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, Hercules,\n\nCA) at a dilution of 1:3000 for 1 hr. After extensive washing,\n\nimmunostaining detected by the antibodies was visualized by\n\nenhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Santa Cruz Biotechnology,\n\nSanta Cruz, CA). The protein levels were quantitated relative to ß-\n\nactin-loading control (1:3000 dilution, Abcam, Inc., Cambridge,\n\nMA) in the same samples. Results are expressed as a percent of\n\nvalues detected in the nondiabetic controls. Protein was quantified\n\nwith the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc;\n\nHercules, CA).\n\nReduced glutathione (GSH)\nAt 2 months of diabetes, tissues of interest were homogenized in\n\n0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 5 mM EDTA. After\n\ncentrifugation, a quantity of the resulting supernatant was\n\nremoved for storage at 280uC for subsequent protein determina-\ntion by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay method (Pierce\n\nBiotechnology, Inc.). GSH determinations were carried out on the\n\nfreshly prepared tissue extract following the fluorometric method\n\ndescribed previously [32]. Fluorometric measurements were\n\ncarried out using a Biotek Synergy4 microplate reader and data\n\nfitted by linear regression to a standard curve generated using\n\npurified GSH as a quantitation standard. In all cases, analytes\n\nwere measured in triplicate.\n\nCo-culture\nA mouse retinal endothelial cell line (mREC; generated from\n\nImmortomice [33]) was grown in DMEM containing 10% FBS\n\nand 5.5 or 25 mM glucose. Cells were cultured at 37uC in 5%\nCO2 and 95% air, and the media was changed every other day for\n\n5 days. When mRECs were 80% confluent (app 500,000 cells),\n\nleukocytes (100,000; purified from blood with RBC lysis buffer)\n\nfrom male C57Bl/6J mice and AR\n2/2\n\nmice groups were added to\n\nthe mREC and incubated for 24 hrs. After incubation, the\n\nleukocytes were carefully removed by gentle washing, and viability\n\nof remaining retinal endothelial cells was measured by trypan blue\n\nextrusion. Briefly, an aliquot of the endothelial cell suspension was\n\ndiluted 1:1 (vol/vol) with 0.1% trypan blue, and the cells were\n\ncounted with a hemocytometer. Cell death was reported as the\n\nAldose Reductase and Early Diabetic Retinopathy\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62081\n\n\n\npercentage of blue-stained cells (dead cells) of the total number of\n\ncells. Approximately 200–400 cells were counted in each sample.\n\nStatistical analyses\nData are expressed as mean 6 SD. Statistical analysis was\n\nperformed using ANOVA, followed by Fischer’s test. A value of\n\np,0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\n\nAnimals\nDiabetic mice were hyperglycemic over the entire duration of\n\nthe 10 month experiment, and failed to gain weight at normal rate.\n\nSerum glucose levels of the diabetic groups (356658 mg/dl and\n\n344662 in in wildtype and AR\n2/2\n\ngroups, respectively) were all\n\nsignificantly greater than nondiabetic values (132–137 mg/dl).\n\nThe degree of hyperglycemia, as denoted by glycated hemoglobin,\n\ndid not vary among diabetic mice (wild-type, 10.1%61.0 ;\n\nAR\n2/2\n\n, 10.2%61.1 respectively), and was significantly greater in\n\ndiabetic groups as compared with the corresponding nondiabetic\n\ngroups (wildtype, 3.060.2; AR\n2/2\n\n2.960.3). Body weight at 10\n\nmonths of diabetes averaged 28 g61in the wildtype group and\n\n27 g62 in AR\n2/2\n\ngroup, and these values were about half of\n\nthose in nondiabetic mice of each group (51–60 g). Data from the\n\n2 month experiment was similar (not shown). Deletion of AR had\n\nno apparent effect on glycemia or health of any animals. Cross-\n\nsections of retina in nondiabetic animals (12 mos of age) indicated\n\nthat deletion of AR had no significant effects on retinal thickness\n\nor retinal architecture, and no effect on vascular density in\n\nnondiabetic animals.\n\nInhibition of diabetes-induced retinal histopathology by\nAR deletion\n\nWild-type diabetics developed the expected increase in numbers\n\nof degenerate retinal capillaries by 10 mos of study (p,0.0001). In\n\ncontrast, retinas from AR\n2/2\n\ndiabetic animals exhibited signifi-\n\ncantly fewer diabetes-induced acellular capillaries (Figure 1).\n\nNondiabetic AR\n2/2\n\nmice showed a normal retinal vasculature\n\npattern. Diabetes of 10 mos duration did not cause a significant\n\ndecrease in the number of cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer in\n\nthese C57Bl/6 mice (not shown), so we could not assess any effect\n\nof the AR deletion on neurodegeneration.\n\nIn an effort to investigate the mechanism by which the AR\n\ndeletion mediated the beneficial effect on degeneration of retinal\n\ncapillaries in diabetes, we measured several parameters related\n\nespecially to inflammation and nitrative (oxidative) stress, these\n\nbeing physiologic and molecular abnormalities that have been\n\nfound in other studies to be associated with (and possibly causally\n\nrelated to) the development of the early stages of diabetic\n\nretinopathy.\n\nOxidative stress\nOxidative stress was evaluated in the present study by\n\nmeasuring superoxide generation by the freshly isolated retina.\n\nDiabetes significantly increased retinal superoxide production by\n\nalmost two-fold (Figure 2a), whereas retinas from AR\n2/2\n\nmice\n\nwere totally protected from diabetes-induced increase in superox-\n\nide production (p,0.0001). In contrast, retinal GSH tended to be\n\nsubnormal in wild-type diabetics, but deletion of AR had little\n\neffect on this diabetes-induced reduction (Figure 2b). The\n\naccumulation of nitrotyrosine, a marker of nitrative stress, tended\n\nto be greater than normal in wild-type diabetic animals and tended\n\nto be inhibited in the absence of AR, but the results were not\n\nstatistically significant (Figure 2c).\n\nPro- inflammatory proteins\nExpression of iNOS and ICAM-1 in whole retina were\n\nsignificantly increased by diabetes compared to that of wildtype\n\nnondiabetic animals (both p,0.05), but deletion of AR inhibited\n\nthe diabetes-induced enzyme induction only for iNOS (Figure 3).\n\nThe expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, and activity of\n\npoly-ADP ribose synthase (PARS) tended to be greater than\n\nnormal in wild-type diabetic animals, but the increases were not\n\nstatistical significant and deletion of AR had no apparent effect\n\n(not shown).\n\nEndothelial cells killed by white blood cells\nPrevious studies have demonstrated an important role of\n\nleukocytes in development of early stages of diabetic retinopathy\n\n[34,35]. To investigate if white blood cells might contribute to the\n\nAR-mediated degeneration of retinal capillaries in diabetes, mouse\n\nretinal endothelial cells (mREC) were incubated with peripheral\n\nblood leukocytes from non-diabetic or diabetic mice. After 24 hrs\n\nof co-culture, the number of endothelial cells killed by leukocytes\n\nfrom wild-type diabetic mice was significantly greater than those\n\nkilled by incubation with leukocytes from nondiabetic wild-type\n\nmice (1.7 fold increase; p,0.05; Figure 4). In contrast, leukocytes\n\nfrom diabetic animals lacking AR killed fewer endothelial cells\n\nthan did leukocytes from wild-type diabetics, but this decrease did\n\nnot achieve statistical significance.\n\nDiscussion\n\nAR and the polyol pathway were among the first molecular\n\nmechanisms considered to explain how hyperglycemia initiates\n\ndiabetic retinopathy and other complications of diabetes. At that\n\ntime, AR was regarded as the enzyme responsible for the\n\nreduction of glucose into sorbitol, a molecule that penetrates\n\npoorly through cell membranes, thus leading to cellular damage\n\nvia the ‘‘osmotic hypothesis’’ [2]. In an effort to further investigate\n\nthe role of AR in these complications, a number of pharmacologic\n\ninhibitors of the enzyme were developed. Since then, research on\n\nthis pathway has expanded beyond the initial hypothesis, but\n\nresults using pharmacologic inhibitors of AR in clinical (and some\n\npre-clinical) studies of diabetic retinopathy have been disappoint-\n\ning. Whether this was due to inadequacies of the pharmacologic\n\nFigure 1. Diabetes (SD) of 10 months duration significantly\nincreased degeneration of retinal capillaries in wildtype (WT)\nanimals compared to nondiabetic (ND) animals. Deletion of AR\nsignificantly, but only partially, inhibited the diabetes-induced vascular\ndegeneration (n = 7 per group).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0062081.g001\n\nAldose Reductase and Early Diabetic Retinopathy\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e62081\n\n\n\ninhibitors, limited penetration of target tissues, or unfavorable\n\npharmacokinetic characteristics has remained unclear.\n\nUse of AR inhibitors revealed a variety of diabetes-induced\n\nalterations in retinal metabolism that could be manipulated. AR\n\ninhibitors were reported to inhibit diabetes-induced abnormalities\n\nin oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis in the retina\n\n[5,36,37,38,39]. Recent studies using pharmacologic inhibitors of\n\nAR found anti-inflammatory actions even in the absence of\n\nFigure 2. Effects of 2 mos diabetes and AR2/2 on retinal oxidative stress.

Thus, it is unclear whether the\n\nobserved effects of AR inhibitors are really mediated via\n\nhyperglycemia-induced activation of polyol pathway activity or\n\nalternatively via other mechanisms possibly unrelated to glucose\n\nmetabolism (such as metabolism of lipid-derived aldehydes and\n\nretinoids by AR and closely-related aldo-keto reductases [44,45]).\n\nTo avoid potential uncertainties associated with pharmacologic\n\ninhibitors, mice genetically lacking AR were generated [28,46].\n\nInitial studies of db/db mice deficient in AR suggested that AR\n\ncontributed to the diabetes-induced abnormalities in the retina,\n\nincluding breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, loss of pericytes,\n\nand even an effect on neovascularization was claimed. The present\n\nresults using C57Bl/6 mice that are deficient in AR demonstrated\n\nthat this genetic modification substantially (but not totally)\n\ninhibited the diabetes-induced degeneration of retinal capillaries,\n\nand totally inhibited superoxide generation by the retina in\n\ndiabetes. Consistent with most other studies of diabetic mice,\n\nhowever, no retinal neovascularization was observed. Unlike\n\nstudies using pharmacologic inhibitor, genetic deletion of AR had\n\nno significant effect on retinal GSH levels in diabetes in the\n\npresent study. Consistent with this, reported inhibition of diabetes-\n\ninduced defects in electroretinogram using pharmacologic inhib-\n\nitors [47–49] was not confirmed using AR\n2/2\n\nmice studied by us\n\n[50], raising a possibility that some of the observed effects of AR\n\ninhibitors were due to off-target effects. In addition, the differences\n\ncould be secondary to metabolic pathways induced in response to\n\nthe deletion of AR, thus altering the retinal environment. Deletion\n\nof AR also inhibited the diabetes-induced increase in expression of\n\niNOS but not ICAM-1, which is interesting because both are\n\nregulated by NF-kB, and both have been shown to be strongly\nrelated to the capillary degeneration occurring in retinas of\n\ndiabetic animals [51,52]. Inasmuch as superoxide and iNOS-\n\ngenerated NO can lead to the generation of nitrotyrosine on\n\nproteins [53,54], it is surprising that AR deletion inhibited both\n\nsuperoxide and iNOS expression in diabetic mice, yet did not\n\ncorrect nitrotyrosine. This finding needs to be confirmed with\n\nadditional animals.\n\nIt has been assumed by many that the molecular abnormalities\n\ncontributing to vascular pathology in diabetic retinopathy are\n\npresent in vascular cells themselves. In vitro studies have indicated\n\neffects of AR within endothelial cells [35,54,55. Recent evidence\n\nindicating that leukocytes play a critical role in the capillary\n\ndegeneration [Li, 2012 #6144], however, led us to test the\npossibility that AR present in leukocytes might contribute to the\n\ncapillary cell death. Our in vitro studies compared leukocyte-\n\nmediated killing of retinal endothelial cells by leukocytes having,\n\nand not having, AR. These results suggest that AR contributes\n\nonly little to the hyperglycemia-induced killing of endothelial cells\n\nby leukocytes, suggesting that the beneficial effect of AR deletion\n\nmight in fact be within cells of the retina itself.\n\nOur results utilizing AR mutant mice, together with results from\n\nother investigators using a similar approach [46], demonstrate that\n\nAR contributes to the pathogenesis of vascular pathology of early\n\ndiabetic retinal disease in mice. Surprisingly, the AR knockout did\n\nnot inhibit several diabetes-induced molecular abnormalities that\n\npreviously have been found to contribute to the retinopathy\n\n[51,56], suggesting that multiple molecular pathways contribute to\n\nthe vascular lesions of the retinopathy in mice. Perhaps the relative\n\ncontributions of these various pathways differs among species, and\n\nthese differences among species contributed to the lack of\n\nsignificant effect of AR inhibitors in diabetic dogs [25] or patients\n\n[24], in contrast to more positive effects in rodents. In the absence\n\nof information as to which pathways predominate in the\n\ndevelopment of retinopathy in diabetic humans, future strategies\n\nprobably will benefit from targeting of multiple pathways that each\n\npartially contribute to the pathogenesis of the retinopathy.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nChieh Allen Lee provided expert management of the diabetic animal\n\ncolony.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: TSK.
