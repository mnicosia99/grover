The prevalence\nof diabetic nephropathy is rising in developed countries, and it was reported to be the primary\ncause for end-stage renal disease in diabetic patients worldwide [1, 2]. Moreover, the high inci-\ndence of diabetic nephropathy, its poor prognosis, and its high cost of treatment has caused it\nto become a public health issue. Therefore, early diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is required\nto promptly intervene and prevent or delay deterioration due to the disease [3]. Currently,\nmicroalbuminuria is a widely-used early marker for nephropathy in diabetic patients [3]. How-\never, the sensitivity and accuracy of microalbuminuria as a predictor has been questioned in\nrecent years [3, 4]. Therefore, novel biomarkers with the ability to predict disease progression\naccurately are needed in clinic practice.\n\nThe glomerular capillary wall consists of podocytes (or visceral epithelial cells), glomerular\nendothelial cells, glomerular basement membranes, and mesangial cells [5]. One of the main\ncharacteristics of diabetic nephropathy is the expansion of the mesangial matrix which leads to\nthe subsequent accumulation of mesangial cell-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) compo-\nnents [6]. During this process, members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family\nare thought to play an indispensable role [7]. Generally, TGF-β family proteins are essential for\nregulating cellular growth, differentiation, autophagy, and apoptosis, as well as immune sup-\npression [8, 9]. However, TGF-β1 has also been recognized as a key mediator in ECM forma-\ntion [10]. Up-regulation of TGF-β1 expression is reported to be indispensable in fibrosis and in\ntissue remodeling in various organs during disease progression [11], including glomerular\nfibrosis in the kidney [12].\n\nCurrently, evidence from various studies have implicated TGF-β1, as well as its associated\nsignaling pathways, were associated with diabetic nephropathy [13–16]. Moreover, there are\nalso reports of abnormal expression of TGF-β1 in the serum and urine of patients with diabetic\nnephropathy [17–19]. However, due to the limited clinical samples in individual studies, it is\ndifficult to reach consensus regarding the relationship between serum TGF-β1 level and dia-\nbetic nephropathy. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis based on a combination of a num-\nber of relevant reports to determine if serum TGF-β1 could serve as a novel biomarker for\ntesting for the early occurrence of diabetic nephropathy.\n\nMethods\n\nLiterature searching\nA literature search was conducted using the Chinese VIP, Wangfang, China National Knowledge\nInfrastructure, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Embase databases for randomized controlled trials\nby using the keywords “Transforming Growth Factor” and “Diabetic Nephropathy” through\nJune 2015. There were no language preferences.\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria\nEligible studies included in this meta-analysis met the following criteria: (1) patients with dia-\nbetic nephropathy were enrolled; (2) the study included at least two case control groups:\nhealthy control subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes but without nephropathy; and (3)\nserum TGF-β1 levels (mean ± SEM) were reported in the study. Exclusion criteria included: (1)\nreviews, editorials, conference reports, and dissertations; 2) studies conducted in animal mod-\nels (mice, rats, rabbits, and others); 3) cell line-based or in-vitro studies; and 4) duplicate publi-\ncations (i.e., in multiple languages).\n\nSerum TGF-β1 Predicts Diabetic Nephropathy\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149513 February 22, 2016 2 / 9\n\nCompeting Interests: The authors have declared\nthat no competing interests exist.\n\n\n\nData extraction\nTwo reviewers independently extracted the data using a special data extraction form. The fol-\nlowing information was recorded: (1) first author’s family name and publication year; 2) aver-\nage age and ethnicity of patients; (3) sample size of each group; (4) diagnosis markers and\ndiscrete value of serum TGF-β1 levels. Disagreements were resolved by the intervention of a\nthird reviewer.\n\nOutcomes and statistical analysis\nThe main outcome was the comparison of serum TGF-β1 levels in diabetic nephropathy\npatients to those in healthy controls and type 2 diabetes patients without nephropathy. Ran-\ndom modeling was performed by using Stata software version 12.0 (StataCorp LP, College Sta-\ntion, Texas) for meta-analysis. Weighed mean differences, standardized mean differences, and\n95% confidence intervals (CI) for the outcome of continuous variables were determined. The\nvalue of I2 was assessed for heterogeneity; if the I2 value was greater than 50%, efforts were\nmade to determine the source of heterogeneity by sensitivity or subgroup analysis to identify\noutliers. The S1 PRISMA Checklist (2009) was list at the end of this paper.\n\nResults\n\nStudy selection and characteristics\nAs shown in the flow diagram in Fig 1, a total of 74777 articles were obtained from the initial\ndatabase search. After perusing the title and abstracts, 132 randomized controlled trials deemed\nrelevant for TGF-β1 level analysis in diabetic nephropathy patients remained for additional\nreviewing. After excluding duplicates, 86 articles were fully read. Of these, nine met the inclu-\nsion criterion, all of which involved studies conducted in China.\n\nData from the included articles were extracted and are shown in Table 1. The average ages\nof the patients tended to be similar. Furthermore, some studies (including Ju 2001, Li 2011,\n\nFig 1.

As shown in Fig 2, the instrumental variable (IV) was 3.94, (95% CI 3.20–\n4.68, P<0.01) which indicated that serum TGF-β1 levels were significantly increased in\npatients with diabetic nephropathy. The total I2 value was 83.6% (P<0.01), suggesting a signifi-\ncant heterogeneity in all the included studies. Moreover, the instrumental variable (IV) was\n-0.76, (95% CI -0.93 to -0.59, P>0.5) indicates that that serum TGF-β1 levels were not changed\nin patients with only Type II diabetic.\n\nTable 1.

In the studies by Wu et al., Fu et al., and\nXie et al., no detailed information was provided regarding the criteria for diagnosing diabetic\nnephropathy. In the studies by Ju et al., Wang et al., and Zhang et al. (2004), the average uri-\nnary protein in diabetic nephropathy patients was above 300 mg per 24 h. However, for the\nother studies, the urinary protein in the experimental groups ranged between 30 and 300 mg\nper 24 h. Therefore, we divided diabetic nephropathy patients from these studies into three\nsubgroups depending on the urinary protein quantity. As shown in Fig 3, the SMD was 3.02\n(95% CI 2.52–3.53, p<0.01) and the I2 = 37% in group 1; the SMD was 3.43 (95% CI 2.85–4.01,\np<0.01) and the I2 = 4.6% in group 2; and the SMD was 5.49 (95% CI 3.20–4.68, p<0.01)\nand I2 = 0% in group 3. These results indicated that the criteria used for diagnosing diabetic\nnephropathy may be responsible for the high heterogeneity in these studies.\n\nEvaluation of publication bias\nAs positive results are more readily to be accepted and negative results may be omitted,\naccounting for the possible publication bias in our included study, therefore, publication bias\nwas tested by Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s test. No obvious publication bias was observed\nfor the overall population (Begg’s p = 0.048 and Egger p = 0.019) which indicate that the con-\nclusion we draw from our results believable.\n\nDiscussion\nThe activation of the TGF-β1 signaling pathway in the renal system was found to be an inter-\nmediary step in diabetic kidney injury. TGF-β1 not only stimulates the synthesis of some key\ncomponents of the ECM, such as type I and type IV collagen, but also decreases matrix degra-\ndation by inhibiting the protease activity [26, 27]. Many studies have shown that the outcome\nof diabetic nephropathy is often linked to the abnormal expression of TGF-β1 in both animal\nmodels and human subjects. Moreover, long-term administration of anti-TGF-β1 antibody to\nblock the TGF-β1 mediated signaling pathway in animal models prevented mesangial matrix\nexpansion [28, 29]. However, due to the limited samples sizes in individual publications, it\n\nFig 3.

Our results showed that serum TGF-β1 was significantly up-regulated in patients\nwith diabetic nephropathy (p<0.01), and that serum TGF-β1 does represent a risk factor for\nthe occurrence of diabetic nephropathy. As the population sample of this meta-analysis was\nsufficiently large (>200), the results of our meta-analysis are persuasive. Moreover, no signifi-\ncant publication bias was observed when tested using Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s test.\n\nHigh heterogeneity was found when analyzing all the included studies; the I2 value was\n83.6%. By analyzing the data in detail, we concluded that the heterogeneity was due to the dif-\nferent criteria used to diagnose diabetic nephropathy, as well as the fact that data was extracted\nfrom patients with different stages of nephropathy. Some studies had not adequately described\nhow diabetic nephropathy was diagnosed and lacked discrete urinary protein values, while\npatients in other studies were divided into different stages of nephropathy depending on their\nurinary microalbuminuria gradient. The I2 values in the three subgroups (the third being stud-\nies not included in the two aforementioned groups) did not exceed 50%.\n\nFig 4. Begg’s funnel plot for evaluating publication bias in the included studies.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0149513.g004\n\nSerum TGF-β1 Predicts Diabetic Nephropathy\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0149513 February 22, 2016 6 / 9\n\n\n\nPrevious meta-analyses had reported the association of the TGF-β1 T869C gene polymor-\nphism with diabetic nephropathy risk. A survey of eligible studies from PubMed, the Cochrane\nLibrary, and the Chinese Biological Medicine Database found the TT genotype of TGF-β1\nT869C was associated with diabetic nephropathy risk in the overall population. This suggested\na potential role for TGF-β1 gene expression in the progression of diabetic nephropathy [30].\nAnother study also provided a similar conclusion [31]. Concordantly, our results highlighted\nthe correlation of TGF-β1 protein levels with the risk of diabetic nephropathy. However, cer-\ntain limitations should be considered in regards to this study. Although the p value (<0.01)\nfrom the Begg’s funnel plots and Egger’s test suggested no publication bias, we still noticed\nasymmetry in the funnel plot graph (Fig 4). Therefore, other relevant published or unpublished\nstudies with null results may have been omitted.\n\nIn conclusion, our study is the first meta-analysis to have assessed the association between\nserum TGF-β1 levels and diabetic nephropathy risk. The results suggest that up-regulation of\nserum TGF-β1 is associated with an increased risk of diabetic nephropathy. Larger-scale case\ncontrolled studies are required to confirm these findings.\n\nSupporting Information\nS1 PRISMA Checklist.
