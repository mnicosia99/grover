Some C. perfringens isolates also produce the newly\ndiscovered beta2-toxin (CPB2). Recent epidemiological studies suggested that C. perfringens isolates carrying\nthe gene encoding CPB2 (cpb2) are strongly associated with clostridial GI diseases in domestic animals,\nincluding necrotic enteritis in piglets and typhlocolitis in horses. These putative relationships, obtained by\nPCR genotyping, were tested in the present study by further genotyping and phenotyping of 29 cpb2-positive C.\nperfringens isolates from pigs with GI disease (pig GI disease isolates). PCR and restriction fragment length\npolymorphism analysis reconfirmed the presence of cpb2 gene sequences in all the disease isolates included in\nthe study. Furthermore, genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses showed that the pig GI disease\nisolates included in this study all carry a plasmid cpb2 gene, yet no clonal relationships were detected between\nthe cpb2-positive pig GI disease isolates surveyed. Finally, CPB2-specific Western blotting demonstrated CPB2\nexpression by all of the cpb2-positive isolates surveyed. The CPB2 proteins made by five of these pig GI disease\nisolates were shown to have the same deduced amino acid sequences as the biologically active CPB2 protein\nmade by the original type C isolate, CWC245. Collectively, our present results support a significant association\nbetween CPB2-positive C. perfringens isolates and diarrhea in piglets.\n\nClostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, endospore-form-\ning, anaerobic bacterium that has long been recognized as a\nsignificant cause of both histotoxic and gastrointestinal (GI)\ndiseases in humans and domestic animals (20). The virulence\nof this bacterium largely results from its ability to produce at\nleast 15 different C. perfringens toxins (21). A commonly used\nclassification scheme (21) assigns C. perfringens isolates to one\nof five types, types A to E, depending upon the isolate’s ability\nto produce the four major lethal toxins (i.e., the alpha, beta,\nepsilon, and iota toxins). C. perfringens type A strains are de-\nfined as producing alpha toxin, and type C strains are defined\nas producing alpha and beta toxins. The major lethal toxins,\nhowever, are not the only biomedically important toxins; some\nC. perfringens isolates (mostly belonging to type A) produce C.\nperfringens enterotoxin (CPE), and some type C isolates pro-\nduce a newly discovered C. perfringens toxin, the beta2 toxin\n(CPB2) (10).\n\nCPB2, a 28-kDa protein, was first purified from C. perfrin-\ngens type C strain CWC245, which was isolated from a piglet\n\nthat died of necrotizing enterocolitis (16). Purified CPB2 was\nreported to be cytotoxic for Chinese hamster ovary cells and to\ninduce hemorrhagic necrosis of the intestinal mucosa in a\nguinea pig ligated intestinal loop (16). In 1997, the gene en-\ncoding this 28-kDa protein was cloned from C. perfringens type\nC strain CWC245, and its nucleotide sequence was determined\n(10). Since the deduced amino acid sequence showed no sig-\nnificant homology with beta toxin, the respective protein cor-\nresponded to a new C. perfringens toxin, referred to as CPB2.\n\nC. perfringens type C is generally considered to be the pri-\nmary cause of necrotic enteritis in piglets aged 0 to 2 weeks\n(29), but type A isolates have also been linked to enteric\ndisease in suckling and feeding pigs with mild necrotic entero-\ncolitis and villous atrophy (8, 15, 22, 24, 25). The role of alpha\ntoxin (produced by all C. perfringens toxinotypes) as a virulence\nfactor in type A enterotoxemia remains unclear (29). Type A\nenterotoxemia syndrome could be produced by oral inocula-\ntion of type A isolates into gnotobiotic colostrum-deprived pigs\nas well as conventional weaner pigs (14). However, this effect\ncould not be explained by the contribution of alpha toxin alone\nbecause purified alpha toxin was unable to produce significant\nlesions and fluid loss in a pig ileal loop assay (25, 29). Although\nCPE has been implicated in porcine diarrheal disease (5, 29,\n32), only nonenterotoxigenic C. perfringens type A and type C\n\n* Corresponding author.

Experimental reproduction of the disease in pigs\nrequires viable bacteria as well as toxin (as crude culture su-\npernatants) (23).\n\nThe availability of the cpb2 gene sequence has provided a\npowerful genetic tool for the detection of CPB2-positive C.\nperfringens isolates, which has greatly improved our under-\nstanding of the association between C. perfringens toxinotypes\nand animal GI diseases. For example, by using a multiplex\nPCR assay incorporating cpb2 gene-specific primers, cpb2-pos-\nitive C. perfringens type A isolates could be detected from\ndiarrheic piglets (9, 17), horses with typhlocolitis (13), diar-\nrheic dogs (31), an African elephant with ulcerative enteritis\n(1), and calves with enterotoxemia (19).\n\nIn two studies performed in Switzerland and The Nether-\nlands, all C. perfringens isolates obtained from diarrheic piglets\nwere genotyped as nonenterotoxigenic types A and C (17).\nInterestingly, however, the cpb2 gene was found to be highly\nprevalent in isolates from diarrheic piglets in both studies.\nThese data suggest a causal relationship between cpb2-positive\nstrains and digestive tract diseases in piglets (17). In a recent\nPCR genotyping study (9), most of the C. perfringens isolates\nfrom pigs with GI disease (pig GI disease isolates) were found\nto be genotype A. Of the 33 isolates from piglets with diarrhea\nexamined, 27 (82%) were positive for the cpb2 gene, whereas\nnone of the isolates from the piglet controls were positive for\nthe cpb2 gene, consistent with cpb2-positive type A isolates\nbeing significantly associated with diarrhea in piglets. How-\never, these putative associations between cpb2-positive isolates\nand GI diseases in piglets remain tentative because this con-\nclusion was drawn only on the basis of the results of PCR\ngenotyping, in which only the presence of cpb2 sequences and\nnot the expression of CPB2 were demonstrated.\n\nTo better appreciate the involvement of cpb2-positive C.\nperfringens isolates in GI diseases of piglets, the present study\ngenotypically and phenotypically characterized 35 pig fecal C.\nperfringens isolates. Notably, this study includes the first in-\ndepth genotypic analysis of cpb2-positive fecal isolates ob-\ntained from piglets with CPB2-associated GI diseases. Results\nfrom the present study indicate that all cpb2-positive C. per-\nfringens fecal isolates carry the cpb2 gene on a plasmid and\nexpress CPB2, confirming their virulence potential. These new\nfindings hold potential epidemiologic significance, as they are\nconsistent with cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates being re-\nsponsible for GI diseases in piglets.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial strains and growth conditions. The C. perfringens isolates used in this\nstudy are listed and described in Table 1. Each strain was from a separate disease\ninstance in piglets, as described earlier (9, 10, 17). A starter culture (6 ml) of each\nC. perfringens isolate was prepared by overnight growth at 37°C in fluid thiogly-\ncolate broth (FTG; Difco), as described previously (7). For DNA isolation or\nculture supernatant protein preparation, an aliquot (0.2 ml) of each FTG culture\nwas inoculated into 10 ml of TGY broth (3% Trypticase, 2% glucose, 1% yeast\nextract, 0.1% cysteine) (7), which was then incubated at 37°C overnight.\n\ncpb2-specific PCR analysis. Total C. perfringens DNA was isolated from the\novernight TGY cultures by a previously described protocol (7). The isolated\nDNA was then subjected to screening by a cpb2-specific PCR with two sets of\nprimers. The primer set 5�-AAACTGAATTTTTAAATGGTGC-3� (primer 1F)\nand 5�-TCCACATCCAATGATCTACAA-3� (primer 2R) was used to amplify a\n\ncpb2 gene-specific internal 318-bp PCR product. The primer set 5�-GCTCTAG\nAGGATATCTTAAATTTAGCACAG-3� (primer 3F) and 5�-CCGGAATTCT\nTTTTTAAGCTCAATTTTTACTGG-3� (primer 4R) was used to amplify a\n1,373-bp DNA fragment carrying the entire cpb2 open reading frame (ORF) and\n263-bp upstream and 312-bp downstream sequences. These PCRs used 100 ng of\ntemplate DNA, 25 pM each primer, 200 �M deoxynucleoside triphosphates\n(Roche), 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 1 U of TaqDNA polymerase (Fermentas) in a total\nvolume of 50 �l. The reaction mixture was placed in a thermal cycler (Techne)\nfor an initial period of 5 min at 94°C (denaturation) and was then subjected to\n28 cycles, each consisting of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 58°C (annealing), and 1 min\nat 72°C (extension), followed by an additional period of extension for 10 min at\n72°C. After PCR, the presence of an amplified product was analyzed by subject-\ning an aliquot of each PCR sample to electrophoresis at 100 V in 1.5% agarose\ngels, followed by ethidium bromide staining and visualization under UV illumi-\nnation.\n\nPreparation of DIG-labeled cpb2 probe for Southern blotting experiments. A\n318-bp digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled, double-stranded cpb2-specific DNA gene\nprobe was prepared by a two-step PCR amplification method. Briefly, a 318-bp\ncpb2 internal fragment (nucleotides 581 to 899 of the cpb2 ORF) (10) was first\namplified from the total DNA of C. perfringens type C strain CWC245 by PCR,\nas described above.\n\nThe 318-bp PCR product obtained from this amplification was then gel puri-\nfied by using the Prep-A-Gene DNA Purification system (Bio-Rad) and was used\nas the template for a second PCR in order to produce a 318-bp PCR product\ncontaining DIG-labeled nucleotides. This second PCR involved the incubation of\n50 ng of the 318-bp purified product obtained from the previous PCR; 2.5 mM\nMgCl2; 100 �M dATP, dCTP, and dGTP; 65 �M dTTP; and 35 �M DIG-dUTP\n(Roche) under the same amplification conditions described above.\n\nRestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and Southern blotting\nanalyses. Isolated C. perfringens DNA samples, prepared as described above,\nwere digested to completion with BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, EcoRV, HpaI, or XbaI\n(New England Biolabs); separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels; trans-\nferred to positively charged nylon membranes (Roche); and fixed to the mem-\nbranes with UV light, as described previously (26). The blots were hybridized\nwith the DIG-labeled cpb2 probe, and the hybridized cpb2 probe was then\ndetected with a DIG chemiluminescence detection system with CSPD [disodium\n3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2�-(5�-chloro)tricyclo[3,3.1.13.7]decan}-4-yl)\nphenyl phosphate] ready-to-use substrate (Roche), as described earlier (26).\n\nPulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Southern blotting analyses. Cells\nfrom overnight TGY cultures were collected by centrifugation and used to\nprepare agarose plugs containing genomic C. perfringens DNA, as described\npreviously (2, 3, 6, 27, 30). The undigested total unsheared genomic DNA in 100\n�l of an agarose plug was electrophoresed at 200 V with a Bio-Rad CHEF-DRII\napparatus, with pulse times ramped from 50 to 90 s over 20 h (27, 30). These\npulsed-field gels were then subjected to cpb2 Southern blotting analysis by the\nsame procedure described above for RFLP and Southern blotting analyses.\n\nPFGE studies for clonal relationships. Total DNA in 100 �l of an agarose plug\nwas digested overnight with SmaI at 30°C or with MluI at 37°C in 200 �l of the\nbuffer solution recommended by the enzyme manufacturer. Both SmaI- and\nMluI-digested DNA samples were then analyzed by PFGE with 1% agarose gels\nprepared with PFGE-grade agarose (Bio-Rad), with pulse times ramped from 5\nto 120 s over 46 h at 150 V (4). After PFGE, these gels were subjected to\nethidium bromide staining and photographed under a UV transilluminator (Bio-\nRad).\n\nIsolation of culture supernatant proteins. An aliquot (0.2 ml) of each C.\nperfringens FTG starter culture was inoculated into two tubes containing 10 ml of\nTGY broth and grown overnight at 37°C. The culture supernatant (�20 ml) was\nseparated from the bacterial pellet by centrifugation. To precipitate the super-\nnatant proteins, ammonium sulfate [4.76 g of (NH4)2SO4/10 ml of supernatant]\nwas added, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 4°C. The precipitated\nproteins were then collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 25 �l of sterile\nwater and 25 �l of sample buffer. The prepared proteins were immediately used\nfor Western blotting or were stored at �80°C.\n\nIsolation of total cell proteins. Total cell protein was prepared from the\nbacterial pellet of the 20-ml TGY culture that was used to prepare the culture\nsupernatant proteins. After aspiration of the culture supernatant, the bacterial\npellet was resuspended in 500 �l of sterile water, transferred to an Eppendorf\ntube, and then washed twice with 500 �l of sterile water. The resultant pellet was\nresuspended in 500 �l of sterile water and 500 �l of sample buffer, and the\nmixture was boiled for 5 min. Five microliters of this total cell protein was\nimmediately electrophoresed and Western blotted or stored at �80°C.\n\nCPB2 Western blotting analysis. The prepared proteins were electrophoresed\non a 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)–12% polyacrylamide gel and trans-\n\nVOL. 41, 2003 GENOTYPING OF BETA2-TOXIGENIC C.

The membrane was then washed once in 10 ml of Tris-buffered\nsaline (TBS) for 5 min and blocked by incubation in 10 ml of 5% bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three washes with\nTween plus TBS (TTBS; 10 ml for each wash). The membrane was then incu-\nbated overnight in a rabbit polyclonal CPB2 antibody solution (1:500 dilution in\n5% BSA) (10). After four more washes in TTBS, the membrane was incubated\nin anti-rabbit–horseradish peroxidase antibody (Pierce) solution (1:20,000 dilu-\ntion in 5% BSA) for 1 h. Finally, the membrane was washed three times in TTBS\nand twice in TBS, incubated for 5 min in SuperSignal West Pico Chemilumines-\ncent Substrate (Pierce) according to the protocol of the manufacturer, and\nexposed to autoradiography film (Kodak).\n\nCloning and sequencing of the cpb2-containing fragments from various cpb2-\npositive isolates. To facilitate nucleotide sequencing, the 1,373-bp DNA frag-\nment carrying the cpb2 ORF and the �262-bp upstream and �312-bp down-\nstream sequences from each of several representative pig GI disease isolates\nwere first amplified by PCR and cloned into Escherichia coli. To reduce the\nPCR-induced mutation(s) introduced during the amplification process, the strat-\negy described by Collie et al. (4) was adopted. Briefly, the 1,373-bp cpb2-con-\n\ntaining DNA fragment from each cpb2-positive isolate was amplified in five\nidentical, but independent, reaction tubes, as described above. After confirma-\ntion of the presence of the expected amplification products in all reaction tubes\nby agarose gel electrophoresis, the five individual PCR mixtures with one iso-\nlate’s DNA were combined. These mixed PCR products were then ligated into\nthe pCR-XL-TOPO vector by using the TOPO XL cloning kit (Invitrogen), and\nTOP10 E. coli was transformed with the ligated mixture according to the instruc-\ntions of the manufacturer. Plasmid-containing transformants were then selected\non tryptic soy agar plates containing kanamycin (50 �g/ml). The presence and the\norientation of the expected cpb2-containing insert in plasmids isolated from\nthese transformants were confirmed by restriction analysis with EcoRI or Hin-\ndIII. Five clones carrying the cpb2 insert of one C. perfringens isolate, placed in\nthe same orientation in pCR-XL-TOPO, were then grown as separate overnight\ncultures in 3.0 ml of tryptic soy broth with kanamycin (50 �g/ml). These over-\nnight cultures were combined, and plasmid DNA was isolated by using a Qiagen\nmini plasmid prep kit, according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The\ninsert present in the plasmid DNA was then sequenced by the fluorescence-based\nautomated DNA sequencing facilities available in the Center for Gene Research\n\nTABLE 1.

The cpe-specific PCR analysis was performed as described\nbefore (7, 26) with the primer set 5�-GGTACCTTTAGCCAATCA-3� (primer\n2F) and 5�-TCCATCACCTAAGGACTG-3� (primer 5R).\n\nAlpha toxin expression by cpb2-positive C. perfringens pig GI disease isolates.\nAlpha toxin expression by pig GI disease isolates was tested by the reverse\nCAMP test (12).\n\nRESULTS\n\ncpb2-specific PCR screening for presence of entire cpb2 ORF\nsequences in C. perfringens isolates associated with GI diseases\nin piglets. The isolates in our collection of pig GI disease\nisolates have previously been identified (9, 17) as cpb2 positive\nby a multiplex PCR assay by monitoring the isolates for the\npresence of a 516-bp PCR product from the internal cpb2\nsequence. In our present study, we determined (Fig. 1)\nwhether these isolates carry the entire cpb2 ORF sequence by\nPCR analysis with two sets of primers designed from the\nCWC245 cpb2 gene sequence published earlier (10).\n\nTo ensure the reliability of the PCR results obtained with\nthe template DNAs isolated from our pig GI disease strains,\ncontrol PCRs were run by using template DNAs isolated from\nCWC245 (a known cpb2-positive C. perfringens type C isolate)\nand 106527 (previously determined to be a cpb2-negative C.\nperfringens type C strain). As shown in Fig. 1, the expected\n318-bp PCR product (which is internal to the cpb2 ORF) and\nthe expected 1,373-bp PCR product (which contains the whole\ncpb2 ORF) were amplified from CWC245 DNA with primer\npairs 1F-2R and 3F-4R, respectively. However, no such PCR-\n\namplified products were obtained when DNA from cpb2-neg-\native strain 106527 was used as the template. These results\nindicate that our PCR results are reliable and specific for the\ndetection of isolates carrying the cpb2 ORF sequence.\n\nWhen template DNA isolated from each pig GI disease\nisolate was subjected to these same PCR analyses, both 318-\nand 1,373-bp products were obtained from the DNA of 28 of\n29 isolates tested with primer pairs 1F-2R and 3F-4R, respec-\ntively (Table 1; see Fig. 1 for representative results). The\n318-bp cpb2 internal fragment but not the 1,373-bp fragment\ncontaining the whole cpb2 ORF was amplified from the DNA\nof the remaining isolate, JGS1818. These results confirm that\nour pig GI disease isolates carry the cpb2 ORF sequence.\n\nGenotyping of cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates by RFLP\nanalysis. Next, our collection of cpb2-positive isolates was sub-\njected to RFLP analysis. We first performed RFLP and South-\nern blotting analyses with a representative cpb2-positive C.\nperfringens isolate (isolate CWC245) and a representative\ncpb2-negative C. perfringens isolate (isolate 106527) using a\nseries of restriction enzymes which have no cleavage site within\nthe cpb2 ORF. When RFLP analysis with XbaI, EcoRI,\nBamHI, or BglII and Southern blotting assays were performed,\na DIG-labeled cpb2 probe always hybridized to a �20-kb frag-\nment of DNA from cpb2-positive isolate CWC245 (data not\nshown). However, when RFLP analysis with HpaI or EcoRV\nand Southern blotting assays were performed with that isolate\n(Fig. 2), the cpb2 probe hybridized to an �5-kb HpaI DNA\nfragment and an �7.5-kb EcoRV DNA fragment of CWC245,\nrespectively. No hybridizing band was observed with DNA\nfrom cpb2-negative healthy pig isolate 106527, indicating that\nour cpb2-specific RFLP and Southern blotting analyses were\nreliable and specific.\n\nWhen the same assay consisting of RFLP analysis with HpaI\nand Southern blotting was applied to our collection of cpb2-\npositive pig GI disease isolates, the cpb2-specific probe hybrid-\n\nFIG. 1.

The Southern blots\nwere probed with a 318-bp, DIG-labeled cpb2-specific probe.

PERFRINGENS 3587\n\n\n\nized to an �5-kb HpaI DNA fragment for 25 of 29 pig GI\ndisease isolates (Table 1; see Fig. 2 for representative results).\nFour pig GI disease isolates (isolates JGS1548, JGS1818, 2011,\nand 97-4029) produced different hybridizing bands of �5 kb\n(Table 1 and Fig. 2). In order to confirm that these different\nresults by RFLP analysis with HpaI were not simply due to the\nloss of an HpaI restriction site, further RFLP analyses were\nperformed with EcoRV-digested DNA (Fig. 2). The results of\nRFLP analysis with EcoRV confirmed our results obtained by\nRFLP analysis with HpaI, demonstrating that the patterns of\nthese four isolates obtained by RFLP analysis with EcoRV are\ndifferent from those of the other pig GI disease isolates sur-\nveyed (Fig. 2 and data not shown).\n\nFinally, the specificity of the cpb2-specific probe used in the\npresent RFLP studies has been confirmed by further control\nstudies demonstrating (Table 1; see Fig. 2 for representative\nresults) that this probe does not hybridize to HpaI-digested\nDNA from C. perfringens healthy pig isolates (isolates 106527,\nJGS1537, JGS1540, JGS1569, JGS1580 and D9703881) that\nare genotyped as cpb2-specific PCR negative (Table 1).\n\nPFGE evidence supporting the plasmid localization of cpb2\nin isolates from pigs with GI diseases. To determine whether\nthe cpb2 gene is located on the chromosome or plasmid of\ncpb2-positive pig GI disease isolates, representative cpb2-pos-\nitive C. perfringens isolates were subjected to PFGE and South-\nern blotting analyses, which have successfully been used (2, 3,\n6, 27, 30) to formally establish the chromosomal or plasmid\nlocalization of the cpe gene. Briefly, the principle of this\nmethod is that, without any restriction enzyme digestion, un-\nsheared C. perfringens chromosomal DNA is too large to enter\na pulsed-field gel. However, because of its smaller size, at least\nsome plasmid DNA should enter a pulsed-field gel, even with-\nout any restriction enzyme digestion. Therefore, when total\nDNA from cpb2-positive isolates is subjected to this PFGE\nanalysis and then Southern blotted for cpb2, either of two\nspecific profiles should be observed: (i) if the cpb2 gene is\nlocated on the chromosome, all cpb2-containing DNA should\nremain in the gel wells and no hybridizing band should be\nobserved in the gel; or (ii) if the cpb2 gene is located on the\nplasmid, some cpb2-containing plasmid DNA should enter the\npulsed-field gels and should produce a hybridizing band in the\nblot.\n\nWhen PFGE genotyping experiments were performed with\nthe DNA of control cpb2-positive type C isolate CWC245,\ncpb2-containing DNA entered the pulsed-field gel in the ab-\nsence of restriction enzyme digestion and produced a hybrid-\nizing band of �50 kb (Fig. 3). These PFGE results confirmed\nprevious observations that the cpb2 gene is located on the\nplasmid of cpb2-positive isolate CWC245 (10). The apparent\nsize of the CWC245 plasmid carrying cpb2 matches the calcu-\nlated size of the plasmid from type A strain 13 whose cpb2 gene\nwas sequenced (28).\n\nWhen similar PFGE genotyping analyses were performed\nwith the DNA of representative cpb2-positive isolates, their\ncpb2-containing plasmid DNA entered the pulsed-field gels\nand produced hybridizing bands that comigrated with the cpb2-\ncontaining plasmid DNA from CWC245 (Table 1; see Fig. 3\nfor representative results). These results indicate that both\ntype A and C cpb2-positive C. perfringens pig GI disease iso-\nlates carry the cpb2 gene on a plasmid.\n\nPFGE analysis for clonal relationship between cpb2-positive\nisolates. The final series of experiments conducted for the\ngenotyping of cpb2-positive isolates involved the use of PFGE\nanalyses to examine the possibility that cpb2-positive pig iso-\nlates share a common clonal relationship with each other.\nPFGE analyses of SmaI-digested DNA identified no clonal\nrelationship between the 17 pig GI disease isolates tested (see\nFig. 4 for representative results). In order to confirm that the\nresults of the SmaI digestions were not due to uneven migra-\n\nFIG. 3. PFGE evidence supporting the plasmid localization of cpb2\nin pig GI disease isolates. PFGE and Southern hybridization were used\nto analyze undigested DNA, prepared in agarose plugs, from each of\nthe C. perfringens isolates specified. The blots were probed with a\n318-bp cpb2-specific probe. Results are shown for control strains\nCWC245 (a cpb2-positive type C isolate carrying the cpb2 gene on a\nlarge plasmid) and 106527 (a cpb2-negative type C isolate) and rep-\nresentative cpb2 pig isolates JGS1552, JGS1561, JGS1817, 2011, 2142,\nand 10618J. The pulsed-field gel was calibrated with bacteriophage\nlambda DNA markers, whose migration is shown at the left of the blot.\n\nFIG. 4. Analysis of clonal relationships among C. perfringens pig GI\ndisease isolates. DNA from each of the specified C. perfringens isolates\nin agarose plugs was digested with SmaI (A) or MluI (B) and subjected\nto PFGE and ethidium bromide straining. The gel was calibrated with\nbacteriophage lambda ladder DNA. The molecular sizes of the DNA\nmarkers are between the two gels.\n\n3588 WATERS ET AL. J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\ntion throughout the gel, further PFGE analyses were per-\nformed with MluI-digested gel blocks. The results of PFGE\nwith MluI-digested DNA confirmed the lack of a clonal rela-\ntionship between 17 pig GI disease isolates (see Fig. 4 for\nrepresentative results).\n\nCPB2 expression by cpb2-positive isolates. The phenotypic\ncharacteristic of the cpb2-positive C. perfringens pig GI disease\nisolates examined in this study was whether these isolates can,\nin fact, express CPB2. Because cpb2 sequencing information\n(10) supports the fact that CPB2 is a secreted protein, we first\nanalyzed culture supernatant proteins from cpb2-positive C.\nperfringens isolates. C. perfringens culture supernatants (Fig. 5)\ncontained more than 15 protein bands in SDS-polyacrylamide\ngels stained with Coomassie blue. When CPB2-specific West-\nern blotting was performed with supernatant proteins from C.\nperfringens CWC245 (Fig. 5), an �28-kDa immunoreactive\nband was obtained, which is consistent with the results pre-\nsented previously (10). However, no CPB2 expression could be\ndetected in the culture supernatant of cpb2 PCR-negative iso-\nlate 106527. These results indicate that our CPB2-specific\nWestern blotting analyses are specific and reliable.\n\nWhen similar CPB2-specific Western blotting analyses were\nperformed with culture supernatant proteins prepared from\nour 29 unknown cpb2-positive pig GI disease isolates, an �28-\nkDa immunoreactive band that comigrated with the 28-kDa\nband of CWC245 was observed (Table 1; see Fig. 5 for repre-\nsentative results). These results indicate that all of our pig GI\ndisease isolates surveyed express CPB2.\n\nTo investigate whether CPB2 is truly a secreted protein and\nnot just a lysed cell product, we compared the results of CPB2-\nspecific Western blotting with culture supernatant proteins and\nCPB2-specific Western blotting with total cell proteins (Fig. 5)\nfor the detection of CPB. As expected, an �28-kDa immuno-\nreactive band was observed with the culture supernatant pro-\nteins but not with the total cell proteins of CWC245 (Fig. 5).\n\nWhen similar Western blotting analyses were performed with\npig GI disease isolate JGS1807 or 106640, an immunoreactive\nband that comigrated with the �28-kDa immunoreactive band\nof CWC245 was observed in the assays with the culture super-\nnatant proteins but not in the assays with the total cell proteins\n(Fig. 5). These results support the fact that the CPB2 detected\nin the culture supernatant proteins is most likely an excreted\nproduct and not a product of cell lysis.\n\nComparison of cpb2 ORFs present in different cpb2-positive\nisolates. To examine whether the cpb2 ORF of pig GI disease\nisolates encodes a CPB2 protein with an amino acid sequence\nsimilar to that of the classical CPB2 protein of pig type C\nisolate CWC245 (10), the nucleotide sequences of both strands\nof a 1,373-bp PCR-amplified DNA insert (as shown in Fig. 1)\ncarrying the cpb2 ORFs from five different cpb2-positive pig GI\ndisease isolates (three type A isolates and two type C isolates)\nwere determined. These analyses revealed (data not shown)\nthat the cpb2 ORF sequences present in isolates JGS1817,\n120-98, and 170-98 (three U.S. type A isolates) and isolate\n97-4029 (a U.S. type C isolate) are identical to those present in\nisolate 106640 (a French type C isolate). Furthermore, the\ncpb2 ORF sequences present in five of these isolates exactly\nmatch the cpb2 ORF sequence from CWC245 (a type C strain\nisolated from a diseased pig in France) determined previously\n(10). Comparison of the cpb2 upstream and downstream se-\nquences present in all five isolates revealed that both the up-\nstream and the downstream sequences are highly conserved in\nall five isolates and match the cpb2 upstream and downstream\nsequences of CWC245 determined previously (10).\n\ncpe-specific PCR screening for presence of cpe gene in cpb2-\npositive isolates. The cpb2-positive C. perfringens pig GI dis-\nease isolates used in this study had been identified earlier as\ncpe negative by multiplex PCR analysis (9). In this study, we\nreevaluated whether the cpb2-positive C. perfringens isolates\nthat we surveyed carry the cpe gene by a single cpe-specific\n\nFIG. 5.

The\nblot was probed with CPB2 antibodies and developed by chemiluminescence detection to identify immunoreactive species.

Molecular mass markers (in kilodaltons) are shown between the gels.\n\nVOL. 41, 2003 GENOTYPING OF BETA2-TOXIGENIC C. PERFRINGENS 3589\n\n\n\nPCR analysis with primers 2F and 5R (7, 25) (note that primers\n2F and 5R are different from the primers used in the multiplex\nPCR). These PCR analyses confirmed (data not shown) that\nnone of the isolates examined in this study, regardless of their\nsource, carry the cpe gene; i.e., all type A isolates examined in\nthis survey were classified as cpe-negative type A C. perfringens\nisolates. The reliability of the cpe-specific PCR assay for the\ndetection of the genes encoding CPE, if they are present, was\ndemonstrated by blinded control studies with reference C. per-\nfringens type A isolates that were cpe negative (isolate ACTC\n3624) (18) and cpe positive (isolate NCTC 8239) (18) (data not\nshown).\n\nAlpha toxin expression by cpb2-positive pig GI disease iso-\nlates. The cpb2-positive C. perfringens pig GI disease isolates\nused in this study were characterized for their alpha toxin-\nproducing capabilities. By using the reverse CAMP test (12),\nall cpb2-positive type A or type C isolates surveyed in this study\nproduced (data not shown) the arrow-shaped zone of syner-\ngistic hemolysis indicative of alpha toxin expression.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe present study offers several significant contributions to\nour understanding of the pathogenesis of recently discovered\nCPB2-positive C. perfringens isolates. First, the results of PCR\nand RFLP analysis presented in this study for 6 isolates from\nhealthy pigs and 29 isolates from pigs with GI diseases previ-\nously genotyped by multiplex PCR, which reconfirmed the\npresence of cpb2 only in the diseased pig isolates and not in the\nhealthy pig isolates, significantly strengthen the hypothesis (9,\n10, 17) that cpb2-positive isolates are highly associated with GI\ndiseases in pigs.\n\nSecond, the present study reports the first PFGE genotypic\ncharacterization of cpb2-positive isolates. Our PFGE and\nSouthern blotting results for 14 of the cpb2-positive type A pig\nGI disease isolates indicates that 14 of these type A isolates\ncarry their cpb2 gene on a large plasmid. When these results\nare coupled with similar results for type C isolates obtained in\nthis study and a previous study (10), it is now clear that the\ncpb2 gene has a plasmid location in C. perfringens pig GI\ndisease isolates, regardless of their toxinotypes or geographical\norigins. Furthermore, the PFGE and RFLP analyses per-\nformed in this study demonstrated no clonal relationship\namong the pig GI disease isolates surveyed. Collectively, these\nPFGE results suggest that the acquisition of the putative cpb2-\ncontaining plasmid may be a critical step for C. perfringens\nisolates to become enteropathogenic for animals. Further stud-\nies are needed to determine (i) whether this cpb2-containing\nplasmid, like the cpe-containing plasmid (2), can be mobilized\nbetween C. perfringens isolates and (ii) whether virulence genes\nother than cpb2 might be encoded on the cpb2-containing\nplasmid.\n\nThird, the present study’s most significant finding is the\npresentation of the first evidence that CPB2 is expressed by\nmany or all cpb2-positive type A isolates originating from pigs\nwith CPB2-associated GI diseases. Our CPB2-specific Western\nblotting results provide direct evidence that the CPB2 pro-\nduced by cpb2-positive type A isolates from pigs with GI dis-\neases is a secreted protein, as it is for type C isolate CWC245\n(10). Furthermore, the results of the present study also show\n\nthat type A isolates secrete a CPB2 protein of the same size as\nthat from type C isolates and that the sequences of the CPB2\nproteins from the two types are identical (10; this study). Col-\nlectively, these findings offer important evidence supporting\nthe virulence potential of type A isolates and suggest that the\ncpb2 present in many, if not all, type A isolates is regulated\nsimilarly to that present in type C isolates.\n\nThe similarity between the CPB2 protein produced by the\nisolates surveyed and the CPB2 protein produced by original\ncpb2-positive strain CWC245 (10) receives further support\nfrom the nucleotide sequencing data obtained in this study,\nwhich reveal that the cpb2 ORF sequences present in five\ndifferent isolates (originating from different geographic\nsources) are identical to each other and to a previously deter-\nmined (10) cpb2 ORF sequence from CWC245. These se-\nquencing results also provide the strongest evidence to date\nthat the cpb2 ORF is highly conserved, if not identical, in most\nor all cpb2-positive pig GI disease isolates.\n\nThe involvement of CPB2-positive C. perfringens type C iso-\nlates in GI diseases in piglets raises an important, but still\nunanswered, question about the pathogenesis of CPB2-associ-\nated GI diseases in animals; i.e., is CPB2 responsible for most\nor all GI symptoms of CPB2-associated GI diseases, or do\nthese symptoms also result from the expression of another C.\nperfringens toxin(s)? All of the type A pig GI disease isolates\nsurveyed in this study were classified as cpe-negative type A\nisolates, arguing that the expression of CPE or the beta, iota,\nor epsilon toxin is not required for a CPB2-producing type A\nisolate to cause GI diseases in piglets. Since the present study\nconfirms that cpb2-positive type A porcine disease isolates can\nproduce both CPB2 and alpha toxin, it is possible that the\nenteropathogenicities of these CPB2-producing type A isolates\nare augmented by either alpha toxin (particularly since alpha\ntoxin has been implicated in some veterinary enteric illnesses\n[11]) or their ability to produce one or more of the minor C.\nperfringens toxins (21). Further gene knockout studies should\naddress the relative contributions of CPB2 versus those of\nother toxins in CPB2-associated GI diseases in animals.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis research was supported by grant from the N.
