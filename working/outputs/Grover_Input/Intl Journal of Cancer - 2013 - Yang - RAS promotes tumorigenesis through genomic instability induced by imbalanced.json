To better understand how RAS functions, we measured the activity of the functionally\n\nrelated genes Aurora-A and BRCA2 in ovarian cancer cell lines and tumor samples containing RAS mutations. We found that\n\nAurora-A and BRCA2 inversely controlled RAS-associated genomic instability and ovarian tumorigenesis through regulation of\n\ncytokinesis and polyploidization. Overexpression of mutated RAS ablated BRCA2 expression but induced Aurora-A accumula-\n\ntion at the midbody, leading to abnormal cytokinesis and ultimately chromosomal instability via polyploidy in cancer cells.\n\nRAS regulates the expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 through dysregulated protein expression of farnesyl protein transferase\n\nb and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3. Our results suggest that the imbalance in expression of Aurora-A and\n\nBRCA2 regulates RAS-induced genomic instability and tumorigenesis.\n\nRAS signaling induces genomic instability,1 which provokes\ncancer development in many organs; however, the underlying\nmechanism remains elusive. Activation of RAS largely\ndepends on its active form without CAAX at the C-terminus\n(C, Cys; A, usually aliphatic amino acid; X, another amino\nacid) that is processed by farnesyl transferase (FT) during\nposttranslational modification of RAS proteins.2 Thus, vari-\nous inhibitors of farnesyl protein transferase activity,\ndesigned to prevent the farnesylation of RAS, have been\ndeveloped to treat RAS-associated cancers.3 The insulin-like\ngrowth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) was shown to\nblock RAS cleavage and thus to inhibit farnesyl protein trans-\nferase in lung carcinoma and head and neck squamous cell\ncarcinoma.4 These reports suggest that FT and IGFBP-3 may\nbe involved in regulating RAS-induced genomic instability\nand tumor development.\n\nGenomic instability is largely classified into two types:\nmicrosatellite instability, which is associated with a mutator\nphenotype, and chromosome instability, which is associated\nwith gross chromosomal abnormalities.5 The centrosome is\nbelieved to play an important role in maintaining chromo-\nsome stability by aiding in the formation of bipolar spindles\nduring cell division,6 thereby ensuring equal segregation of\nduplicated chromosomes into two daughter cells, whereas\nmultipolar mitotic spindles are usually resulted from various\ncentrosome abnormalities such as amplification in cancer\n\nKey words: RAS, Aurora-A, BRCA2, polyploid cancer cells, cytoki-\n\nnesis, genomic instability\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online\n\nversion of this article.\n\nGrant sponsor: Ministry of Education of China (Doctoral Fund);\n\nGrant number: 20120071110079; Grant sponsor: Shanghai\n\nMunicipal Government of China (Shanghai Pujiang Program); Grant\n\nnumber: 11PJ1402200; Grant sponsor: National Nature Science\n\nFoundation of China; Grant number: 91129721; Grant sponsor:\n\nU.S. National Institutes of Health; Grant number: 1R01CA131183-\n\n01A2; Grant sponsor: Research Excellence ovarian cancer research\n\n(Specialized Programs); Grant number: IP50CA83638; Grant\n\nsponsor: U.S. National Cancer Institute Cancer Center Core; Grant\n\nnumber: CA016672; DOI: 10.1002/ijc.28032\n\nHistory: Received 22 Aug 2012; Accepted 21 Dec 2012; Online 15\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nCorrespondence to: Gong Yang, Cancer Research Laboratory,\n\nFudan University Shanghai Cancer Center; Department of Oncology,\n\nShanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai 200032,\n\nChina, Tel.: 86-21-6417-5590, Fax: 86-21-6417-2585,\n\nE-mail: yanggong@fudan.edu.cn; Jinsong Liu, Department of\n\nPathology, Unit 85, The University of Texas M.

Because the RAS/RAF mutation accounts for 30–40% of\nlow-grade serous and borderline ovarian cancer cases,22 we\nmainly conducted the study in ovarian cancer cell lines and\nhuman ovarian tumor tissues with RAS mutations. Our\nresults provide insight into how RAS/RAF mutations induce\ngenomic instability and tumorigenesis.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nPlasmids and siRNAs\n\nWe used pBabe/Aurora-A/puromycin23 and pBabe/U6/\nAurora-A shRNA (targeting 50-GUCUUGUGUCCUUCAAA\nUU-30 of Aurora-A mRNA) (puromycin or neomycin)21 to\ndeliver Aurora-A into immortalized ovarian epithelial cell\nlines T29 and T80 and Aurora-A shRNA into RAS-trans-\nformed cell lines T29H, T80H and ovarian cancer cell line\nHEY. A plasmid (PCINBRCA2) containing a full-length\nBRCA2 cDNA was used to deliver BRCA2 into RAS-trans-\nformed cells and Capan-1 cells (a pancreatic cancer cell line)\nusing a previously described method.24 Clones were selected\nafter confirmation of BRCA2 expression by Western blotting.\nThe retroviral expression plasmid IGFBP-3 (pBabe/IGFBP-3/\npuromycin) was generated with a pair of primers (sense:\n50-ATGGATCCatgcagcgggcgcgacccacgctc-30, bold cases are\nBamHI site, and antisense: 50- CAGAATTCctacttgctctg-\ncatgctgtagc-30, italic cases are EcoRI site) using a template of\nan adenoviral expression vector containing IGFBP-3 cDNA\n(a kind gift from Dr. Ho-Young Lee). pBabe/U6/IGFBP-3\nshRNA/puromycin was generated to target IGFBP-3 mRNA\nat 403–422nt (50-ggaaatgctagtgagtcgga-30) using the protocols\ndescribed in our previous publication.25 The control vectors\nwere empty plasmids (pBabe/puromycin or PCIN) or\nconstructed by directly inserting GFP shRNA into pBabe/U6/\npuromycin or neomycin vectors.26 Retrovirus production and\ntarget cell infection were performed with our well-established\nmethod.25 FTb siRNA (#sc-35417) and control siRNA\n(#sc-37007) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa\nCruz, CA). FTI-276 (#F9553) was purchased from Sigma\nAldrich (St. Louis, MO).\n\nCell culture and tumor formation\n\nT29, T29H, T80 and T80H cells have been described previ-\nously.27 Ovarian cancer cell lines HOC-7, SKOV3 and HEY\nand pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 were cultured with\nEMEM or DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine\nserum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. T29 cells trans-\nformed by KRASV12 (T29K) was described previously.27 To\ngenerate tumor growth in vivo, we subcutaneously injected 5\n3 106 T29H/BRCA2, T80H/BRCA2, T29/Aurora-A, T80/\nAurora-A, T29H/Aurora-A shRNA (Aurora-Ai), T80H/\nAurora-Ai cells or control cells expressing empty vectors or\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nThe mechanism underlying RAS-induced genomic instability, an event associated with cancer development, has remained\n\npoorly understood. Here, in an attempt to better understand the phenomenon, RAS transformation was found to be associated\n\nwith ablated expression of the tumor suppressor BRCA-2 and accumulation of Aurora-A during cytokinesis. The tumorigenicity\n\nof cancer cells with RAS mutation is determined by the expression ratio of BRCA2 and Aurora-A. The regulation of Aurora-A\n\nand BRCA-2 was further discovered to be mediated through insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 and farnesyl protein\n\ntransferase beta in the presence of mutated RAS. These findings suggest that BRCA2 and Aurora-A signaling loop plays a criti-\n\ncal role and may provide novel targets for therapeutic intervention in RAS-mutated cancers.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n276 Dysregulation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 by RAS oncogene\n\nInt.

For T29H and T80H cells transfected with\nBRCA2, one of three clones from each cell line with high\nBRCA2 expression was used to conduct tumor formation\nassays. Each cell line was injected into two sites in eight\nmice, for a total of 16 injections. Tumor burden was assessed\nand recorded using methods described previously.28\n\nWestern blotting\n\nFor all Western blots, we analyzed samples with a total of 40-lg\nproteins from whole-cell lysates using the protocol described in\nour previous publication.21 The primary antibody used to detect\nAurora-A (cat. #GTX13824) was obtained from GeneTex\n(Irvine, CA), while the antibody used to detect BRCA2 (cat.\n#MAB2476) was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Anti-\nbodies against RAS either targeting N-terminus (#sc-166691) or\nC-terminus (#sc-521, KRAS; #sc-520, HRAS) and antibodies\nagainst IGFBP-3 (#sc-9028), FTa (#sc-487) and FTb (# sc-137)\nwere purchased from Santa Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz,\nCA).b-Actin (cat. #A2228, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was\nused as a loading control. T29/Vector and T29/Aurora-A cells\nwere treated with proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Sigma) at the\nconcentration of 10 lM and analyzed for the expression of\nAurora-A and BRCA2 by Western blotting. The intensity of\nprotein bands was quantified with ImageJ software downloaded\nfrom NIH website (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/).\n\nImmunofluorescence\n\nImmunofluorescence staining was performed according to a\npublished protocol.21 Primary antibodies against Aurora-A\nand BRCA2 were obtained from GeneTex and R&D Systems,\nrespectively. DNA dye To-Pro-3 was obtained from Molecular\nProbes (Carlsbad, CA). In brief, cells were cultured in chamber\nslides (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) for 24 hr,\nfed with fresh medium to increase the number of mitotic cells\nfor 8–16 hr and then fixed (with PBS-buffered paraformalde-\nhyde solution: 3% paraformaldehyde, PBS, pH 7.4, 2%\nsucrose) and permeabilized (with a buffer containing 0.5%\nTriton X-100, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 3 mM\nMgCl2, 300 mM sucrose). Slides were blocked by a 2-hr incu-\nbation with 20% FBS and 2% goat serum in PBS, and then\nthe slides were incubated with primary antibody at 4�C over-\nnight. Afterward, the cells were incubated with fluorescein\nisothiocyanate (FITC)–conjugated secondary antibody against\nmouse IgG or Texas red–conjugated antibody against rabbit\nIgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory, West Grove, PA)\nfor 30 min. Stained cells were examined and photographed\nwith an Olympus FV500 confocal fluorescence microscope.\n\nCell cycle and cytogenetic analysis\n\nCells were applied for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry\naccording to our previously published method.21 T29/vector,\n\nT29/Aurora-A, T80/vector, T80/Aurora-A, T29H/GFPi,\nT29H/Aurora-Ai, T80H/vector and T80H/BRCA2 cells were\ncultured for 24 hr and collected for chromosome preparation\nusing standard procedures.29 Briefly, cells were exposed to\nColcemid (0.04 mg/mL) for 1 hr, subjected to hypotonic treat-\nment (0.075 M KCl for 20–25 min at room temperature) and\nfixed in a mixture of methanol and acetic acid. Slides were\nstained with Giemsa stain and examined for structural and\nnumerical abnormalities in the chromosomes. A minimum of\n30 metaphase spreads were analyzed for each cell line, and\nrepresentative spreads were captured using a Genetiscan\nimaging system. The proportions were compared using\nchi-squared analysis of Fisher’s exact test. The assay was\nrepeatedly performed by Molecular Cytogenetics Core Facility\npersonnel in the Department of Genetics at The University\nof Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\nImmunostaining of Aurora-A and BRCA2\n\nOvarian tumor tissues from 22 patients diagnosed with low-\ngrade serous carcinoma or borderline tumor were analyzed\nby immunohistochemical staining for expression of Aurora-A\nand BRCA2. KRAS/BRAF mutations with either G12V or\nV600E were identified from tissue genomic DNA of all cases\nby PCR amplification with specific primers targeting the\ncoding regions of RAS-G12V and RAF-V600E, followed by\nsequencing of the DNA fragment. Ten cases were confirmed\nwith RAS/RAF mutations, while the remaining cases lacked\nKRAS/BRAF mutations. The use of tissue blocks and\nchart reviews were approved by the Institutional Review\nBoard of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer\nCenter. Slides were treated and stained using the method\npublished before.21 The primary antibody against Aurora-A\n(GTX13824, monoclonal antibody, Genetax) or BRCA2\n(MAB2476, monoclonal antibody, R&D Systems) was applied\nat a dilution of 1:200 or 1:100 at 4�C in a humidified\nchamber.\n\nEvaluation of staining intensity and expression percentage\nfor BRCA2 and Aurora-A was scored. using the following\ncriteria: tissues with <5% of cells positive for BRCA2 or\nAurora-A were given a score of 0, those with 5–20% positive\ncells were scored as 1, those with 20–40% positive cells were\nscored as 2, those with 50–70% positive cells were scored as\n3 and those with 70–100% were scored as 4. The expression\ncorrelation of BRCA2 and Aurora-A was analyzed by\nPearson’s correlation using SPSS16.0 software.\n\nCell treatment with FTb siRNA or FTI-276\nTo transfect HEY and T29K cells with FTb siRNA, 5 3 105\n\ncells per well in 6-well plates were used for FTb siRNA and\ncontrol siRNA transfection using the manufacturer’s protocol\nfrom Santa Cruz Biotech Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The transfec-\ntion medium was replaced with fresh growth medium 12 hr\nlater, and the cells were kept in culture for additional 24, 48\nand 72 hr and harvested to detect FTb, Aurora-A and\nBRCA2 expression.

Next, we determined whether\nBRCA2 can regulate the expression of Aurora-A or RAS by\ntransfecting RAS-transformed ovarian epithelial cell lines\n(T29H and T80H) with a vector expressing BRCA2.24\n\nSelected stable clones with ectopic expression of BRCA2\nshowed a marked decrease of Aurora-A and RAS (Fig. 1b),\nindicating that BRCA2 suppresses Aurora-A and RAS expres-\nsion. To determine whether Aurora-A can suppress the\nexpression of BRCA2, we delivered Aurora-A cDNA into\nimmortalized nontumorigenic T29 and T80 cells (Aurora-A;\nFigs. 1c and 1d) or silenced Aurora-A expression in T29H\nand T80H cells with Aurora-A-specific short hairpin RNA\n(shRNA) (Aurora-Ai; Figs. 1c and 1d). Ectopic expression of\nAurora-A suppressed BRCA2 expression, but did not stimu-\nlate RAS expression in T29 and T80 cells compared with in\nvector-transfected control cells, and knockdown of Aurora-A\nrestored the BRCA2 level and reduced RAS expression in\nT29H and T80H cells, suggesting that Aurora-A also nega-\ntively regulates the expression of BRCA2. We infer from\nthese results that RAS-driven malignancy is modulated by\nAurora-A and BRCA2.\n\nAurora-A and BRCA2 regulates cell cycle progression and\n\ntumor growth of RAS-transformed cells\n\nAs Aurora-A and BRCA2 participate in cell cycle regulation\nwhich controls ovarian tumorigenesis, we detected the cell\ncycle distribution by flow cytometry (Fig. 1e). Introduction of\nRAS or Aurora-A in immortalized OSE cells promoted cell\ncycle progression by increasing cell population in S phase\nand downregulating cell population in G0/G1 phase as com-\npared to these in control cells. In contrast, overexpression of\nBRCA2 or knockdown of Aurora-A in RAS-transformed cells\npromoted cell arrest at G0/G1 phase and reduced cells in S\nphase as compared to these in control cells.\n\nTo test whether Aurora-A and BRCA2 affect ovarian\ntumor growth, we injected RAS-transformed T29H or T80H\ncells overexpressing BRCA2 into nude mice and compared\ntumor growth to that in mice receiving vector control cells.\nNo tumors were observed in any of the mice injected with\nBRCA2-transfected T29H and T80H cells, while all the mice\ninjected with vector control cells experienced rapid tumor\n\ngrowth within 4–7 weeks (Figs. 1f and 1g), indicating that\nthe expression of BRCA2 completely blocked tumor forma-\ntion of the RAS-transformed cells. In addition, when ectopic\nAurora-A expression was induced in immortalized nontu-\nmorigenic T29 and T80 cells, subcutaneous tumor growth\nresulted (Figs. 1h and 1i), whereas shRNA-induced knock-\ndown of Aurora-A in RAS-transformed cells reduced or\ndelayed tumor growth, compared with tumor growth in con-\ntrol cells expressing GFPi (Figs. 1j and 1k). Taken together,\nthe above data demonstrated that Aurora-A and BRCA2 play\nopposite roles in RAS-associated tumor formation in vivo.\n\nUnbalanced expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 in cancer\n\ncells and tissues with RAS/RAF mutations\n\nAs the above results were derived from RAS-transformed\nOSE cells, we set out to confirm the results in a panel of cells\nincluding normal OSE cells, ovarian cancer cells and pancre-\natic cancer cells harboring KRAS mutations. We detected\nhigher expression of BRCA2 and lower expression of Aurora-\nA in OSE 151 cells (Fig. 2a), a normal OSE cell line\ndescribed in our previous report,25 but lower BRCA2 and\nhigher Aurora-A in the ovarian cancer cell lines HOC-7 and\nHEY with confirmed mutations in KRAS (Supporting Infor-\nmation Fig. 1) and in the pancreatic cancer cell line CAPAN-\n1, which has a reported KRAS mutation and a truncated\nBRCA2 mutation (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, knockdown of\nAurora-A by shRNA in HEY cells and introduction of\nBRCA2 in CAPAN-1 cells resulted in decreased Aurora-A\nexpression and increased BRCA2 expression (Fig. 2a).\n\nThe above results also suggested the possibility that\nAurora-A and BRCA2 are negatively regulated in ovarian\ncancer, particularly in low-grade serous ovarian carcinomas\nand ovarian borderline tumors with KRAS/BRAF mutations.\nThus, we selected tumor tissue samples from 22 cases diag-\nnosed with low-grade serous ovarian carcinoma and border-\nline tumor with or without identified KRAS/BRAF mutations\nand detected Aurora-A and BRCA2 expression by immuno-\nstaining. We measured high expression of Aurora-A and low\nexpression of BRCA2 in six of ten (60%) samples with RAS/\nRAF mutations (p5 0.018, two-tailed Pearson’s correlation),\nbut high expression of BRCA2 and low expression of\nAurora-A in eight of 12 (66.7%) samples without KRAS/\nBRAF mutations (p5 0.023, two-tailed Pearson’s correlation)\n(Table 1). No statistical differences in Aurora-A and BRCA2\nexpression were found in samples with low-grade serous\ncarcinoma and in those with borderline tumor or between\nsamples with KRAS mutation and those with BRAF\nmutation. Representative images are shown in Figure 2b.\n\nFarnesyl protein transferase b and insulin-like growth\nfactor binding protein 3 mediate the regulation of Aurora-A\n\nand BRCA2 in RAS-associated cancer cells\n\nAs IGFBP-3 was reported to inhibit farnesyl protein transfer-\nase, which thereby blocks RAS cleavage.4 We measured the\nexpression of IGFBP-3 and farnesyl protein transferase in a\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n278 Dysregulation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 by RAS oncogene\n\nInt.

We found that the expression of\nIGFBP-3 was decreased in T29H and T29/Aurora-A cells\ncompared with vector control cells, but was increased by\nectopic introduction of BRCA2 in T29H and Capan-1 cells,\nand by disruption of Aurora-A in HEY cells compared with\nin their corresponding control cells (Fig. 3a). In contrast, the\nexpression of farnesyl protein transferase b(FTb) (but not\nFTa, data not shown) was increased in RAS- and Aurora-\nA-transformed cells (T29H and T29/Aurora-A), but\n\ndecreased in BRCA2-transfected cells (T29H/BRCA2, Capan-\n1/BRCA2) and Aurora-A shRNA-treated cells (HEY/Aurora-\nAi) compared with in their controls. These changes led to\ncorresponding increases or decreases in RAS farnesylation\n(Fig. 3a). These results suggest that transformation of ovarian\nepithelial cells by RAS or Aurora-A can inhibit IGFBP-3,\nleading to an increased expression of FTb, which may in\nturn promote RAS farnesylation and ovarian tumorigenesis.\nThey also suggest that the restoration of BRCA2 expression\n\nFigure 1.

Quantification data of FTb and IGFBP-3 expression\nwith ImageJ software was shown in Supporting Information\nFigure 2. These results suggest that IGFBP-3 is involved in\nregulation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 through FTb in terms of\nfarnesylation of RAS. To strengthen evidence for this notion,\nwe treated HEY and T29K (KRASV12-transformed T29 cells)\nwith FTb-specific siRNA or with FTI-276, which specifically\ninhibits farnesyl protein transferases activity.30 As shown in\nFigure 3c, treatment with FTb-specific siRNA reduced the\nfarnesylation of KRAS and Aurora-A expression, which is\nconsistent with a recent report,31 but increased BRCA2\nexpression compared with control siRNA-treated cells at the\n\nsame time point. Moreover, treatment of HEY and T29K\ncells with FTI-276 yielded the same results as those from\ntreatment with FTb siRNA (Fig. 3d). These data suggest that\nFTb not only regulates RAS by farnesylation but also con-\ntrols the expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 through a\nmechanism that may be associated with IGFBP-3.\n\nAurora-A and BRCA2 regulate chromosomal instability\n\nthrough dysregulated cytokinesis\n\nAmplification of Aurora-A and inactivation of BRCA2 are\nknown to be closely associated with chromosomal instability.\nBy analyzing chromosomal aberrations, as expected, the pro-\nportion of polyploid cells was markedly higher in RAS- and\nAurora-A-transformed cells than in control cells, and the\nknockdown of Aurora-A or introduction of BRCA2 in RAS-\ntransformed cells resulted in less polyploidy in the experi-\nmental cell lines than in the control lines (Table 2, Fig. 3e).\nIn addition, the overall chromosome aberration was increased\nin cells overexpressing RAS or Aurora-A compared with in\ncontrol cells; however, the ectopic expression of BRCA2 or\nsilencing of Aurora-A in the transformed cells decreased the\noverall chromosome aberration. These results demonstrate\n\nFigure 1. Continued\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n280 Dysregulation of Aurora-A and BRCA2 by RAS oncogene\n\nInt. J.

Abnormal cytoki-\nnesis usually results in cell multinuclearity and eventually\ninduces chromosomal instability. Since Aurora-A and BRCA2\nare involved in regulating cytokinesis,32,33 we examined the\nexpression of both Aurora-A and BRCA2 in the midbody of\nlate mitotic T29, T29H and T29/Aurora-A cells. In immortal-\n\nized T29/vector cells, BRCA2 and Aurora-A colocalized at\nthe midbody during the late stage of mitosis (Fig. 3f). The\ntransformation of T29 cells by RAS or Aurora-A diminished\nthe localization of BRCA2 and increased the accumulation of\nAurora-A in the midbody as compared with T29/vector cells.\nCounts of cells with two or more nuclei showed that the\ntransformation by RAS or Aurora-A induced at least four\ntimes as many as were induced in their control cells (Fig. 3g).\nIn normal ovarian epithelial cells (OSE151), Aurora-A and\nBRCA2 were colocalized at the midbody, while BRCA2 was\nundetectable in the midbody of mitotic HOC-7, HEY and\nCapan-1 cells with KRAS mutations (Figs. 4a, 4b and 4c).\nHowever, knockdown of Aurora-A or introduction of BRCA2\nin HEY or Capan-1 cells restored BRCA2 accumulation in\nthe midbody (Figs. 4b and 4c). Consistent with the results\nfrom T29, T29H and T29/Aurora-A cells, there were fewer\nOSE151 cells with multinuclearity than HOC-7 cells, and the\nnumber of HEY/GFPi and Capan-1/vector cells with multi-\nnuclearity was greater than HEY/Aurora-Ai and Capan-1/\nBRCA2 cells (Fig. 4d). These results suggest that RAS muta-\ntions can diminish BRCA2 and enhance Aurora-A expression\n\nTable 1.

We showed that RAS transformation of ovarian epithe-\nlial cells can induce amplification of Aurora-A and simulta-\nneously repress BRCA2 expression, which was also observed\nin ovarian cancer cell lines and ovarian cancer tissues with\nRAS/RAF mutations. Aurora-A and BRCA2 oppositely regu-\nlated RAS-induced genomic instability in RAS-mutated cells\nthrough abnormal cytokinesis. In normal or immortalized\novarian epithelial cells, Aurora-A and BRCA2 are colocalized\nat the midbody during late mitosis, in which BRCA2 and Au-\nrora-A may control the segregation of two daughter cells\nthrough regulation of cytokinesis and prevent the generation\nof polyploid cells. A model on how Aurora-A and BRCA2\nfunction in RAS mutated cancer is illustrated in Figure 4e.\nUpon activation by the RAS oncogene, which tips the balance\ntoward Aurora-A, the diminished expression of BRCA2 and\nthe accumulation of Aurora-A in the midbody may hamper\nthe abscission of cleavage furrow to induce polyploidy or an-\neuploidy, which ultimately results in cellular genomic insta-\nbility and tumorigenesis.\n\nCytokinesis is the last important step of cell division\nwhere identical eukaryotic daughter cells finally separate. The\nassociation of cancer with abnormal cytokinesis has been fre-\nquently reported over the past 20 years.

KRAS mutation results in Aurora-A increase and BRCA2\n\ndepletion in midbody during cytokinesis, whereas knockdown of\n\nAurora-A in HEY cells or introduction of BRCA2 in Capan-1 cells\n\nrestored the appearance of BRCA2 in the midbody although the\n\nreduced level of Aurora-A was still detectable in HEY/Aurora-A and\n\nCapan-1/BRCA2 cells.

We and other research\ngroups have found that BRCA2 is involved in regulation of\ncytokinesis,32,39 although a recent study reported that BRCA2\nmay not regulate cytokinesis in Hela cells,40 indicating that\nthe role of BRCA2 in regulation of cytokinesis is sophisti-\ncated. It is interesting to note that no RAS or BRCA2 muta-\ntions in Hela cells were reported, but the amplification of\nRAS or Aurora-A has been observed in some literatures.41,42\n\nTherefore, it is possible that mutated RAS may be essential\nto defective cytokinesis through altering the expression ratio\nof Aurora-A and BRCA2.\n\nOur results demonstrated that FTb and IGFBP-3 plays an\nimportant role in mediating the effect of RAS on Aurora-A\nand BRCA2. The two proteins appear to form a negative reg-\nulatory loop to repress the expression of each other; such\nnegative loop plays an important role in regulating the\nexpression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 and the chromosomal\ninstability induced by RAS. However, whether the interaction\nof FTb and IGFBP-3 could regulate chromosomal instability\nwithout directly involving RAS, Aurora-A and BRCA2 is\nunknown, although it has been reported that FTb-stimulated\nfarnesylation can increase RAS activity, and RAS-induced\nMAPK activation can lead to resistance of breast cancer cells\nto IGFBP-3.43 It is known that RAS mutations or Aurora-A\namplification can activate the NF-jB which is involved in\nregulating the expression of FTb and IGFBP-3,44–46 therefore,\nit will be very interesting to examine the role of NF-jB in\n\nthe regulation of FTb and IGFBP-3 and RAS-mediated\ntransformation.\n\nCurrently, there are no reports to show that Aurora-A can\nregulate BRCA2; however, as a kinase in cancer cells, over\nexpression of Aurora-A may phosphorylate BRCA2 and\nresult in proteasome-mediated degradation during the late\nstage of mitosis, leading to abnormal cytokinesis. Moreover,\nemerging evidences suggest that both Aurora-A and BRCA2\ncan be regulated by various factors during cell cycle by prote-\nolysis-mediated degradation. Studies have demonstrated that\nBRCA2 can interact with multiple gene products such as\nUSP11 (a deubiquitinating enzyme),47 Skp2 (a subunit of the\nSkp1-Cul1-F-box protein ubiquitin complex),48 and cancer-\nassociated BRAD1 beta,49 leading to its proteasome-mediated\nubiquitination and degradation in different cancer cells. Poly-\nubiquitination of Aurora-A by anaphase-promoting complex,\nor Cdh1 (a WD40 repeat protein) can promote the protea-\nsome-mediated degradation of Aurora-A.50 Thus, we treated\nT29 and T29/Aurora-A cells with proteasome inhibitor MG-\n132 at the concentration of 10 lM and found that the\nincreased full length of Aurora-A and BRCA2 was accompa-\nnied with the decreased degradation of Aurora-A and\nBRCA2 over a time course of 1, 4 and 8 hr (Supporting In-\nformation Fig. 3). However, the detailed regulation of Au-\nrora-A and BRCA2 by proteolysis mediated ubiquitination\nand degradation in cells with RAS mutations will require\nadditional studies. As RAS/Aurora-A is amplified in multiple\nepithelial cancers, the molecules we identified in this study\nshould have a general implication in clinical treatment of\nthose cancers.\n\nAcknowledgements\nG.Y. is supported by Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China\n(20120071110079), by Shanghai Pujiang Program (11PJ1402200) from\nShanghai Municipal Government of China and by National Nature Science\nFoundation of China (91129721).
