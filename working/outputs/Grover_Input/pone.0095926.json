Inhibits Myoblast Differentiation into Myotubes\nXiaomei Ge., Yafei Zhang., Sungwon Park¤, Xiaofei Cong, David E. Gerrard, Honglin Jiang*\n\nDepartment of Animal and Poultry Sciences, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, Virginia, United States of America\n\nAbstract\n\nThe functionally undefined Stac3 gene, predicted to encode a SH3 domain- and C1 domain-containing protein, was recently\nfound to be specifically expressed in skeletal muscle and essential to normal skeletal muscle development and contraction.\nIn this study we determined the potential role of Stac3 in myoblast proliferation and differentiation, two important steps of\nmuscle development. Neither siRNA-mediated Stac3 knockdown nor plasmid-mediated Stac3 overexpression affected the\nproliferation of C2C12 myoblasts. Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes as\nevidenced by increased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA and protein expression\nof myogenic markers including myogenin and myosin heavy chain. In contrast, Stac3 overexpression inhibited the\ndifferentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes as evidenced by decreased fusion index, decreased number of nuclei per\nmyotube, and decreased mRNA and protein expression of myogenic markers. Compared to wild-type myoblasts, myoblasts\nfrom Stac3 knockout mouse embryos showed accelerated differentiation into myotubes in culture as evidenced by\nincreased fusion index, increased number of nuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA expression of myogenic markers.\nCollectively, these data suggest an inhibitory role of endogenous Stac3 in myoblast differentiation. Myogenesis is a tightly\ncontrolled program; myofibers formed from prematurely differentiated myoblasts are dysfunctional. Thus, Stac3 may play a\nrole in preventing precocious myoblast differentiation during skeletal muscle development.\n\nCitation: Ge X, Zhang Y, Park S, Cong X, Gerrard DE, et al.

The\n\nprocess of formation of myofibers from muscle progenitor cells is\n\ncalled myogenesis, and this process is controlled by a set of\n\ntranscription factors, including Myf5, Mrf4, MyoD, and myogenin\n\n(MyoG). While Myf5 and MyoD determine the myogenic lineage\n\nof muscle progenitor cells [1–3], MyoG and Mrf4 drive the\n\nterminal differentiation and fusion of myoblasts into myotubes, the\n\ndeveloping myofibers [4–7]. Skeletal muscle plays important roles\n\nin initiating movements, supporting respiration, and maintaining\n\nhomeostasis; loss of skeletal muscle mass or function is associated\n\nwith ageing and diseases such as cancer and diabetes [8,9].\n\nSkeletal muscle in meat-producing animals is a tissue of major\n\neconomic importance. Therefore, identification of new factors and\n\nmechanisms that control skeletal muscle development and\n\nphysiology has significant implications for improving human\n\nhealth and animal productivity.\n\nThe functionally undefined Stac3 gene appears to be a new\n\nfactor regulating skeletal muscle development and function. This\n\ngene is predicted to encode a protein containing two Src homology\n\nthree (SH3) domains and a cysteine rich (C1) domain [10]. The\n\nStac3 gene is specifically expressed in skeletal muscle [10–14].\n\nStac3 knockout in mice caused perinatal death and marked\n\nabnormalities in skeletal muscle [11,13]. In zebrafish, morpholino-\n\nmediated Stac3 knockdown resulted in defective myofibrillar\n\nprotein assembly [14]; absence of Stac3 expression due to a\n\nmissense mutation in a splice donor site or morpholino-mediated\n\nStac3 knockdown caused the fish to be immobile or shiver [12]. It\n\nwas proposed that Stac3 plays a role in excitation-contraction\n\ncoupling through interaction with the dihydropyridine receptor\n\nand the ryanodine receptor [11,12].\n\nThe function of Stac3 has also been studied in C2C12 myoblasts\n\n[14]. Bower and colleagues observed that Stac3 knockdown\n\nprevented C2C12 myoblasts from fusing into myotubes and\n\nconcluded that Stac3 is essential for myoblast differentiation and\n\nmyotube formation [14]. However, an essential role of Stac3 in\n\nmyoblast differentiation does not appear to be supported by the\n\nfacts that Stac3 knockdown or mutation did not prevent the\n\nformation of myofibers in zebrafish [12,14] and that Stac3\n\nknockout did not block the formation of myofibers in mice [11,13].\n\nIn this study, we examined the role of Stac3 in myoblast\n\ndifferentiation and myotube formation by determining the effects\n\nof Stac3 knockdown, overexpression, and knockout on myoblast\n\ndifferentiation and fusion into myotubes in both C2C12 myoblast\n\nline and mouse embryonic myoblasts. Our results suggest an\n\ninhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast differentiation and myotube\n\nformation.\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0095926&domain=pdf\n\n\nExperimental Procedures\n\nCulture of C2C12 cells\nC2C12 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were expanded in growth\n\nmedium composed of Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium\n\n(DMEM), 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and 1% Antibiotic-\n\nAntimycotic (ABAM) at 37 uC under 5% CO2. Differentiation was\ninduced by replacing the growth medium with differentiation\n\nmedium consisting of DMEM, 2% horse serum, and 1% ABAM.\n\nCell culture media and supplements were purchased from\n\nMediatech Inc. (Manassas, VA) unless otherwise specified.\n\nStac3 knockdown\nC2C12 cells were plated in 24-well plates and grown to\n\napproximately 70% confluence. Cells in each well were transfected\n\nwith Stac3 siRNAs (MSS239387, MSS239388, MSS239389 from\n\nInvitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), in combination of three (10 nM per\n\nsiRNA) or separately (30 nM). Control cells were transfected with\n\n30 nM scrambled siRNA (Invitrogen). The transfection reagent\n\nwas Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Since an appropriate Stac3\n\nantibody was not available, knockdown efficiency was estimated by\n\nquantitative RT-PCR of Stac3 mRNA.\n\nStac3 overexpression\nStac3 cDNA was amplified from mouse skeletal muscle total\n\nRNA and linked to a Flag tag at the 39 end via PCR using primers\n\n59-GAGGATCCGGGGCCCAATCTCTTGTAA-39 and 59-\n\nTCTCTAGACTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAATCG-\n\nTAAATCTCCTCC-39. The Stac3-Flag fusion cDNA was cloned\n\ninto the pcDNA3.1-hygro (+) vector (Invitrogen) at the BamHI\nand XbaI sites to generate the plasmid pcDNA3.1/Stac3-Flag. To\n\noverexpress Stac3 in C2C12 cells, the cells at 70% confluence\n\nwere transfected with 0.5 mg of pcDNA3.1/Stac3-Flag using\nLipofectamine 2000 as the transfection reagent. Transfection of an\n\nequivalent amount of pcDNA3.1-hygro (+) plasmid served as a\ncontrol. Overexpression of Stac3 was confirmed by quantitative\n\nRT-PCR of Stac3 mRNA and western blot analysis of Stac3-Flag\n\nfusion protein using an anti-Flag antibody (see details below).\n\nStac3 mutant mice\nGeneration, breeding, and genotyping of Stac3 mutant mice\n\nwere described in detail in a previous report [13]. Mice were\n\nhoused on a timed 12 h light/dark schedule with free access to\n\nstandard rodent diet and water. All procedures involving animals\n\nwere approved by the Virginia Tech Institutional Animal Care\n\nand Use Committee.\n\nIsolation and culture of myoblasts from mouse embryos\nMouse embryonic myoblasts were isolated as described [15],\n\nwith minor modifications. Briefly, limb muscles from embryonic\n\nday 17.5 (E17.5) embryos were dissected and digested in a solution\n\nconsisting of 1.5 U/ml collagenase (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 2.4\n\nU/ml dispase (Roche), and 2.5 mM CaCl2 at 37 uC for 30\nminutes. The released cells were collected by centrifugation and\n\nresuspended in Ham’s F-10 medium supplemented with 20% FBS,\n\n2.5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (Promega, Madison, WI),\n\nand 1% ABAM. The cells were allowed to attach to the plates for 2\n\nh at 37 uC. The medium containing the unattached cells was\ntransferred to collagen I-coated dishes (BD Biosciences, San Jose,\n\nCA). When the cells reached 50% confluence, they were subjected\n\nto 3 to 5 times of 20-min preplating or until 70% of them were\n\nestimated to be myoblasts [16]. To induce differentiation, cells at\n\n80% confluence were switched to DMEM medium supplemented\n\nwith 2% horse serum and 1% ABAM.\n\nQuantitative RT-PCR\nTotal RNA was isolated using TRI reagent according to the\n\nmanufacturer’s instructions (Molecular Research Center, Cincin-\n\nnati, OH). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed essentially as\n\ndescribed previously [13]. Stac3, myogenin (Myog), myosin heavy\n\nchain 3 (Myh3), myoglobin (Mb), troponin T type 1 (Tnnt1),\n\ntroponin T type 3 (Tnnt3), and creatine kinase, muscle (Ckm)\n\nmRNAs were quantified by PCR using primer pairs 59-\n\nTACAGCGACCAACAGTACGC-39 and 59-TCTGCATTGT-\n\nTTCCATCCTG-39; 59-CGGCTGCCTAAAGTGGAGAT-39\n\nand 59-AGGCCTGTAGGCGCTCAA-39; 59-CGCAGAATCG-\n\nCAAGTCAATA-39 and 59-ATATCTTCTGCCCTGCACCA-\n\n39; 59-ATGTGAGGGCCAGAGAAAGG-39 and 59-TCCAGG-\n\nTACTTGACCGGGAT-39; 59-AAACCCAGCCGTCCTGTG-\n\n39 and 59-TCATCTCCCGACCAGTCTGT-39; 59-GCCCAA-\n\nGAGGAAGAAGTCCA-39 and 59-TAGCTGCTGTAGTTGG-\n\nCACC-39; and 59-CGCAGCATCAAGGGTTACAC-39 and 59-\n\nAGGTGCTCGTTCCACATGAA-39, respectively. mRNA abun-\n\ndance was calculated as relative to 18S rRNA, which was\n\nquantified by RT-PCR using primers 59-TTAAGAGGGACG-\n\nGCCGGGGG-39 and 59-CTCTGGTCCGTCTTGCGCCG-39.\n\nBased on the Ct values, expression of 18S rRNA was not different\n\n(P.0.1) between the conditions used in this study.\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nCells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate\n\nbuffered saline (PBS) for 15 min and permeated with 0.25% Triton\n\nX-100 for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were then blocked\n\nwith 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBST (PBS + 0.05%\nTween-20) and incubated with anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC)\n\nantibody (MF20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank,\n\nUniversity of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) at 1:200 dilution at 4uC\novernight. The anti-MHC antibody was detected by incubating\n\nthe cells with anti-mouse IgG FITC antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St.\n\nLouis, MO) at 1:200 dilution at room temperature for 1 h. Cell\n\nnuclei were stained by incubating the cells in 1 mg/ml DAPI\n(Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was\n\ndetected with a Nikon eclipse E600 florescence microscope (Nikon\n\nMetrology, Inc., Brighton, MI).\n\nCell proliferation assay\nThe numbers of viable cells at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after initiation\n\nof culture were measured using the nonradioactive CellTiter 96\n\nassay kit, according to the manufacturer’s (Promega) instructions.\n\nThe absorbance at 570 nm reflected the number of viable cells.\n\nCell proliferation rate was represented by the slope of the line that\n\nconnected the absorbance at different times in culture.\n\nCharacterization of myotubes\nTo visualize myotubes and nuclei, differentiating myoblasts\n\nwere washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10\n\nmin. Cells were then stained with Giemsa (Invitrogen) for 10 min.\n\nTotal cell nuclei and nuclei within myotubes were counted using\n\nthe NIH ImageJ software. A muscle cell containing 3 or more\n\nnuclei was considered as a myotube, as defined previously [17].\n\nFusion index was calculated as the number of nuclei in myotubes\n\ndivided by the total number of nuclei counted. Average number of\n\nnuclei per myotube was determined by dividing the number of\n\nnuclei in myotubes by the total number of myotubes.\n\nWestern blot analysis\nTotal cellular protein lysates were prepared and western blot\n\nanalyses were conducted essentially as described previously [18],\n\nRole of Stac3 in Myoblast Differentiation\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926\n\n\n\nexcept that the primary antibodies were detected using IRDye\n\nsecondary antibodies at 1:20,000 dilution (LI-COR, Lincoln,\n\nNebraska) and the ODYSSEY CLx system (LI-COR). The\n\nfollowing primary antibodies were used: anti-myosin heavy chain\n\nMF20 at 1:500 dilution (Developmental Studies Hybridoma\n\nBank), anti-myogenin F5D at 1:500 dilution (Developmental\n\nStudies Hybridoma Bank), and anti-b-actin N21 at 1:1,000\ndilution (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).\n\nStatistical analyses\nTwo-tailed student’s t test was used to determine the\n\nsignificance of the difference between two groups. The differences\n\nbetween more than two groups were analyzed by ANOVA\n\nfollowed by Tukey HSD multiple comparisons. These tests were\n\nperformed using the JMP software (SAS, Cary, NC). A difference\n\nwas considered significant when the associated P value was less\n\nthan 0.05. All data were expressed as means 6 s.e.m. (standard\n\nerror of the mean).\n\nResults\n\nStac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of C2C12\nmyoblasts into myotubes\n\nWe investigated the potential role of Stac3 in myoblast\n\nproliferation by siRNA-mediated knockdown of Stac3 in C2C12\n\nmyoblasts. Transfecting these cells with a pool of three siRNAs\n\ntargeting Stac3 mRNA decreased the expression of endogenous\n\nStac3 mRNA by 65% as compared to the transfection of a\n\nscrambled siRNA (P,0.01, Fig. 1A). However, Stac3 siRNAs had\n\nno effect on the proliferation rate of C2C12 myoblasts (P.0.1,\n\nFig. 1B). To determine the potential role of Stac3 in myoblast\n\ndifferentiation, C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Stac3 siRNAs\n\nor scrambled siRNA were induced to differentiate, and their\n\ndifferentiation status was assessed by measuring the fusion index\n\nand average number of nuclei per myotube. At 72 h of\n\ndifferentiation, more C2C12 myoblasts transfected with Stac3\n\nsiRNAs formed myotubes than those transfected with scrambled\n\nsiRNA (66% vs. 40%, P,0.05; Fig. 1C and 1D). Myotubes formed\n\nfrom Stac3 siRNAs-transfected C2C12 myoblasts had more nuclei\n\non average than those from scrambled siRNA-transfected C2C12\n\nmyoblasts (19 vs. 7 nuclei/myotube, P,0.01, Fig. 1C and 1E).\n\nThese morphological data indicated that Stac3 knockdown\n\nstimulated the differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.\n\nWe also assessed the differentiation status of C2C12 myoblasts\n\nby measuring the mRNA levels of 6 myogenic markers including\n\nmyogenin (Myog), myosin heavy chain 3 (Myh3), myoglobin (Mb),\n\ntroponin T type 1 and 3 (Tnnt1 and Tnnt3), and creatine kinase,\n\nmuscle (Ckm), and the protein levels of 2 myogenic markers\n\nincluding myogenin (MyoG) and myosin heavy chain (MHC) at 0,\n\n24, 48, and 72 h of differentiation. The cells transfected with Stac3\n\nsiRNAs had greater expression of Myog, Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1,\n\nTnnt3, and Ckm mRNAs than those transfected with scrambled\n\nsiRNA at 24, 48, and/or 72 h of differentiation (P,0.05, Fig. 1F).\n\nThe former cells also had greater expression of MyoG and MHC\n\nproteins than the latter at 24, 48, and/or 72 h of differentiation\n\n(Fig. 1G). These myogenic marker expression data further\n\nindicated that Stac3 knockdown promoted the differentiation of\n\nC2C12 myoblasts into myotubes.\n\nTo validate the specificity of the effect of siRNA-mediated Stac3\n\nknockdown on myoblast differentiation, the three Stac3 siRNAs\n\nused as a pool in the above experiments were transfected\n\nindividually into C2C12 myoblasts. These transfections decreased\n\nStac3 mRNA expression (Fig. 2A) and increased the fusion index\n\n(Fig. 2B and 2C) and mRNA expression of Myog, Myh3, Mb,\n\nTnnt1, Tnnt3, and Ckm (Fig. 2D) in a similar manner to\n\ntransfection of the three siRNAs in combination. These data ruled\n\nout the possibility that off-target effects mediated Stac3 siRNAs-\n\nenhanced differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts.\n\nStac3 overexpression inhibited the differentiation of\nC2C12 myoblasts into myotubes\n\nWe also determined the effect of Stac3 overexpression on\n\nproliferation and differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts. We achieved\n\nStac3 overexpression by transfecting the cells with a Stac3-Flag\n\nfusion protein expression plasmid and confirmed Stac3 overex-\n\npression at both the mRNA (Fig. 3A) and protein (Fig. 3B) levels.\n\nStac3 overexpression did not alter the proliferation rate of C2C12\n\nmyoblasts (P.0.1, Fig. 3C). At 72 h of differentiation, approxi-\n\nmately 25% of C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the Stac3-Flag\n\nexpression plasmid formed myotubes, whereas this percentage was\n\nnearly 40% for those transfected with the empty vector (P,0.05,\n\nFig. 3D and 3E). Myotubes formed from Stac3-overexpressing\n\nC2C12 myoblasts had 4 nuclei on average, whereas those formed\n\nfrom control cells had 7 nuclei (P,0.05, Fig. 3D and 3F). At 48\n\nand 72 h of differentiation, myotubes formed from Stac3-\n\noverexpressing C2C12 myoblasts had less expression of Myog,\n\nMyh3, Mb, Tnnt1, Tnnt3, and Ckm mRNAs than those formed\n\nfrom C2C12 myoblasts transfected with the empty vector (P,\n\n0.05, Fig. 3G). The former cells also expressed less myogenin\n\nprotein than the latter at 24, 48, and 72 h of differentiation, and\n\nless myosin heavy chain protein than the latter at 48 and 72 h of\n\ndifferentiation (Fig. 2H). These changes caused by Stac3\n\noverexpression were opposite to those caused by Stac3 knockdown\n\nin C2C12 myoblasts (Fig. 1).\n\nMyoblasts from Stac3 mutant mouse embryos showed\naccelerated differentiation in culture\n\nWe isolated myoblasts from E17.5 Stac3 homozygous mutant\n\nmouse embryos and wild-type littermates and compared their\n\npotential to differentiate into myotubes in culture. Quantitative\n\nRT-PCR analysis confirmed the absence of Stac3 mRNA in\n\nmyoblasts from Stac3 homozygous mutant embryos (Fig. 4A). At\n\n72 h of differentiation, 53% of Stac3 mutant myoblasts fused into\n\nmyotubes, whereas this percentage was much lower (18%) for\n\nwild-type myoblasts (P,0.01, Fig. 4B and 4C). On average,\n\nmyotubes formed from Stac3 mutant myoblasts contained 2 more\n\nnuclei than those from wild-type myoblasts (P,0.01, Fig. 4B and\n\n4D). These morphological differences indicated that Stac3 mutant\n\nmyoblasts differentiated more rapidly than wild-type myoblasts in\n\nculture. At 72 h of differentiation, Stac3 mutant myoblasts\n\nexpressed 50 to 150% more Myog, Myh3, Mb, Tnnt1, and\n\nTnnt3 mRNAs than wild-type myoblasts (P = 0.2 to 0.3; Fig. 4E).\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this study we determined whether Stac3 plays a role in\n\nmyoblast proliferation and differentiation in two myogenic cell\n\nsystems: C2C12 myoblast line and primary murine myoblasts.\n\nWhile Stac3 knockdown had no effect on proliferation of C2C12\n\nmyoblasts, it stimulated their differentiation into myotubes, as\n\nevidenced by increased fusion rate, increased average number of\n\nnuclei per myotube, and increased mRNA and protein expression\n\nof myogenic markers including myogenin, the myogenic regula-\n\ntory factor that controls the terminal differentiation of myoblasts\n\ninto myotubes [4,7]. In contrast, Stac3 overexpression inhibited\n\nthe differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts into myotubes, as\n\nevidenced by decreased fusion rate, decreased average number\n\nof nuclei per myotube, and decreased mRNA and protein\n\nRole of Stac3 in Myoblast Differentiation\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95926\n\n\n\nexpression of myogenic markers. Judged by the number and size of\n\nmyotubes formed, myoblasts from Stac3-null mouse embryos\n\ndifferentiated more rapidly in culture than wild-type myoblasts.\n\nThese results imply an inhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast\n\ndifferentiation into myotubes.\n\nOur finding that Stac3 inhibits C2C12 t differentiation into\n\nmyotubes is seemingly at odds with an earlier report concluding\n\nthat Stac3 is essential for myotube formation from C2C12 cells\n\n[14]. The cause for this discrepancy is not clear. It could be due to\n\nthe different culture conditions or different passage numbers of\n\nC2C12 cells, which are difficult to control, used between the two\n\nstudies. However, an essential role of Stac3 for myotube\n\nformation, as concluded in the earlier study [14], is not supported\n\nby the phenotypes of Stac3 knockout mice and Stac3 knockdown\n\nzebrafish, where myofibers clearly are formed [11–14]. An\n\ninhibitory role of Stac3 in myoblast differentiation into myotubes\n\nindeed can explain some of the phenotypes in Stac3 knockout\n\nmice. Skeletal muscle of Stac3 knockout mice had fewer yet larger\n\nmyofibers and had a disproportional number of myofibers with\n\nlarge cross-sectional areas [13]. In theory, the increased size in\n\nmyofibers can be caused either by hastened myoblast differenti-\n\nation and fusion into myotubes or by hypertrophy of fused\n\nmyotubes. However, it is unlikely that Stac3 mutant myotubes\n\nwere undergoing hypertrophy because they indeed had fewer and\n\nsmaller myofibrils than wild-type or Stac3 heterozygous mutant\n\nmyotubes [13]. The relative number of proliferating myoblasts\n\nversus differentiating myoblasts during muscle development\n\ndetermines the total number of myofibers formed in mature\n\nmuscle [19,20]. If myoblasts withdraw from the cell cycle and\n\nbegin differentiation before an adequate number of founder\n\nmyoblasts have developed, this will decrease the overall number of\n\nmyofibers formed. Therefore, hastened myoblast differentiation\n\nand fusion into myotubes could also explain why Stac3 knockout\n\nskeletal muscle had fewer total myofibers than wild-type or Stac3\n\nheterozygous mutant skeletal muscle [13].\n\nFigure 1.

Myogenesis is a tightly controlled program; premature\n\nmyoblast differentiation would lead to the formation of dysfunc-\n\ntional myofibers [21,22]. Thus, Stac3 could be one of those factors\n\nthat prevent precocious myoblast differentiation during skeletal\n\nmuscle development. Obviously, the mechanism by which Stac3\n\ninhibits myoblast differentiation into myotubes is an interesting\n\nfuture question to investigate. The SH3 domain contained in the\n\nStac3 protein is a classical protein-protein interaction domain\n\n[23,24]; therefore, Stac3 might inhibit myoblast differentiation\n\nthrough interaction with other proteins. It would be interesting to\n\nknow if Stac3 interacts with or affects the expression of proteins\n\nsuch as Delta-like protein 1, myogenin, MRF4 (Myf6), Stat1, and\n\nStat3 that are known to play a role in normal or premature\n\nmyoblast differentiation [21,22,25].\n\ncell cultures).
