In this study, we tried to further investigate the potential\n\nroles of Tiam1 in the progression of HCC in a larger set of samples. By detecting Tiam1 expression in 213 HCC patients, we\n\nobserved that Tiam1 had a higher probability of being overexpressed in HCC patients with metastasis than those without\n\nmetastasis (68.3% vs. 52.7%, p 5 0.036). In addition, the cell line with high metastatic potential expressed more Tiam1 than\n\ndid the cell line with low metastatic potential. Overexpression of Tiam1 was suggested to be significantly correlated with HCC\n\nmetastasis. We stably upregulated Tiam1 expression in MHCC97L as well as knocked down Tiam1 expression in HCCLM6. We\n\nalso investigated the effects of Tiam1 overexpression and knockdown on HCC cells proliferation, migration and invasion\n\nin vitro and on tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo. Overexpression of Tiam1 increased proliferation, migration and invasion\n\nof MHCC97L cells, while knockdown of Tiam1 in HCCLM6 cells resulted in the reverse. In vivo functional studies showed\n\nupregulation of Tiam1 expression led to an enhancement of tumorigenicity and metastatic potential in mice. However,\n\nknockdown of Tiam1 expression exhibited nearly 2.2-fold retardation in tumor growth and great inhibition on tumor\n\nmetastases. Our results indicate that Tiam1, as a metastasis-related gene, may contribute to HCC invasion and metastasis,\n\nand consequently, it may be a useful biomarker for therapeutic strategy and control in HCC treatment.\n\nIt is of great importance to elucidate the molecular mecha-\nnisms that control hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metasta-\nsis for a successful treatment. Previous investigations have\nimplicated several genes associated with HCC metastasis,\nincluding ephrinA2,1 chemokine receptor CXCR7,2 CLU3 and\nCHD1L.4 However, there is little research on the association\n\nof T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) with\nHCC.\n\nTiam1, a member of the Dbl gene family of guanine nu-\ncleotide exchange factors (GEFs), was first identified by pro-\nviral tagging in combination with in vitro selection for inva-\nsiveness from murine leukemia cells.5 It mediates a broad\nrange of cellular processes, including cellular migration and\nadhesion. Alterations in Tiam1 expression/function may con-\ntribute to tumorigenesis and carcinoma progression of com-\nmon types of human cancer.6–8 Tiam1 overexpressed in can-\ncers is considered to be a new potential or even an\nindependent predictor of poor prognosis for clinical patients.\nMany recent reports support that Tiam1 is a metastasis-\nrelated gene of a variety of cancers, such as breast cancer,9,10\n\ncolorectal cancer (CRC),11,12 prostate cancer,13 lung cancer,14\n\nRas-induced skin tumors15 and renal cell carcinoma.16 How-\never, we failed to observe the link between Tiam1 and HCC\nmetastasis. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the\nTiam1 functions in HCC.\n\nIn our previous study,17 we noticed overexpression of\nTiam1 in HCC cell lines as well as in HCC tissues both at\ntranscriptional and translational levels. The overall survival of\nour study cohort was significantly poorer in cases with\nTiam1 high expression than in low expression cases, indicat-\ning Tiam1 expression is a significant and independent prog-\nnostic parameter for HCC patients. Tiam1 was considered to\nbe related to many cancer metastases.

In our\nstudy, to further investigate whether Tiam1 may be correlated\nwith HCC metastasis or not, we enlarged our study cohort\nby collecting another 61 tissue samples from randomized\nHCC patients who had been followed up for >5 years. With\ngreat interest, we found Tiam1 was significantly associated\nwith HCC metastasis after an increase in clinical tissue sam-\nples. To further confirm our finding, we identified the biolog-\nical functions of Tiam1 in HCC by a comprehensive range of\nfunctional experiments.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nPatients and tissue samples\n\nWe extended our analysis to a larger sample set. In addition\nto the cohort of our previous study whose clinical data were\nonce again used for our study, another 61 primary HCC tis-\nsue samples were taken randomly from patients who had not\nbeen pretreated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy prior to\nhepatectomy at General Hospital of Guangzhou Military\nCommand of PLA, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China between\n1999 and 2002. All the tissue samples were fixed in 10% for-\nmalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned consecutively at 4 lm\nand stained by hematoxylin and eosin. The histological types\nwere assigned according to the criteria of the World Health\nOrganization Classification.\n\nCell lines and culture conditions\n\nThe two human HCC cell lines, MHCC97L and HCCLM6 were\nobtained from Liver Cancer Institute and Zhongshan Hospital\nof Fudan University, Shanghai, China. These two clonal cell\nstrains were derived from the same parent cell MHCC97 to\nensure a similar genetic background and yet dramatic differen-\nces in spontaneous metastatic behavior. Compared with\nMHCC97L, which was not metastatic via subcutaneous inocu-\nlation but exhibited a metastatic rate of 40% via orthotopic\ninoculation, HCCLM6 featured more overt multidirectional\nmetastasis.18 An immortalized normal hepatocyte cell line, HL-\n7702, was purchased from Cell Bank of Shanghai Institute of\nBiochemistry & Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences\n(Shanghai, China). All cells were maintained in high glucose\nDMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum\n(Hyclone). All the media were supplemented with 100 U/ml\npenicillin and 100 lg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and incu-\nbated at 37�C in a humidified chamber containing 5% CO2.\n\nImmunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence assay\n\nImmunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to study altered\nprotein expression in the additional 61 human HCC tissues.\nThe sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated after being\ndried at 65�C for 2–4 hr. Heated-induced epitope retrieval\nwas carried out in 0.01 M, pH 6.0 sodium citrate buffer in a\nmicrowave oven for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase activity\n\nwas blocked with 0.3% H2O2 methanol while nonspecific\nbinding with 5% normal goat serum. Incubation with pri-\nmary antibody (rabbit anti-Tiam1, Santa Cruz) (1:100) was\nperformed at 4�C overnight. Following incubation with bio-\ntinylated secondary antisera, the streptavidin-biotin complex/\nhorseradish peroxidase was applied. Finally, the slide-\nmounted sections were stained with 3,30-diaminobenzidine\ntetrahydrochloride and counterstained with hematoxylin.\n\nFor immunofluorescence assay, cultured cells were grown\non polylysine-treated slides overnight at 37�C. The cells were\nfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, blocked with PBS\nbuffer containing 5% BSA, and then incubated with rabbit\nanti-Tiam1 (1:100) at 4�C overnight followed by a FITC-con-\njugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz,\n1:100 dilution) and a nuclear counterstain DAPI. After being\nrinsed, the stained cells were analyzed using immunofluores-\ncence microscopy.\n\nEvaluation of immunohistochemical staining\n\nStaining for Tiam1 protein in tumor tissues was scored by a\nsemiquantitative analysis as described previously.17 Briefly,\nthe staining intensity was scored as ‘‘0’’ (not stained), ‘‘1’’\n(weakly stained), ‘‘2’’ (moderately stained) or ‘‘3’’ (strongly\nstained). The staining extent was scored as ‘‘0’’ (0%), ‘‘1’’ (1–\n10%), ‘‘2’’ (11–50%), ‘‘3’’ (51–80%) or ‘‘4’’ (81–100%). Immu-\nnoreactive scores were calculated by multiplying staining in-\ntensity score � staining extent score and divided into four\ndifferent stages, ranging from 0 to 12.\n\nEstablishment of Tiam1 overexpressed cells\n\nHA (hemagglutinin)-tagged C1199-Tiam1 was a kind gift\nfrom John G. Collard. It encodes for the C-terminal 1,199\namino acids of the Tiam1 protein, while the endogenous pro-\ntein is 1,591 amino acids.19 Previous results have demon-\nstrated that this truncated construct does not inhibit growth\nand contains the majority of the domains of the full-length\nconstruct. The HA-Tiam1-1199 cDNA was cloned into the\npCDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen) and amplified. DNA\nsequencing and restriction enzyme digestion were used to\nconfirm the sequence was correct. pCDF1-Tiam1þ-copGFP\nwas generated by inserting the cloned C1199-Tiam1 into\npCDF1-MCS2-EF1-copGFP vector (System Bioscience). The\nregenerated expression plasmids were transfected into 293FT\ncells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated in a 5%\nCO2 humidified atmosphere at 37\n\n�C for one night, and\nchanged for fresh 10% fetal bovine serum. Viral supernatant\nwas harvested 48 hr after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-\nlm cellulose acetate filter, and frozen at �80�C. The lentivi-\nrus containing the C1199-Tiam1 cDNA was used as a positive\ncontrol, while the lentivirus-only-containing pCDF1-MCS2-\nEF1-copGFP mock vector was used as a negative control.\n\nMHCC97L cells were seeded in 24-well plates to 30–40%\nconfluence and transfected with viral supernatant containing\nexogenous Tiam1 cDNA and negative control lentivirus,\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\no\nn\nan\n\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\no\nsi\ns\n\nHuang et al. 91\n\nInt.

The\nexpression of report gene copGFP was examined after 3–4\ndays transfection. Flow cytometry assays were applied to sort\nthe cells expressing copGFP and their corresponding negative\ncontrol. These two groups of cells were purified with limited\ndilution cloning, identified by real-time PCR, Western blot\nand immunofluorescence confocal analysis. The clone\nexpressing the highest level of Tiam1 was termed\n97L/Tiam1þ, while its negative one termed 97L/mock.\n\nEstablishment of Tiam1 knockdown cells\n\nBased on Genbank information of Tiam1, four different RNA\ninterfering sequences were designed (http://ranidesigner.invitro-\ngen.com/sirna) and chemically synthesized (GeneChem, Shang-\nhai, China). The oligoduplexes were inserted into the pGCSIL-\nGFP vector. A total of 293FT cells were co-transfected with the\npGCSIL-GFP-Tiam1 expression vector, pHelper1.0 and\npHelper2.0 to produce virus particles. The viral supernatant was\nharvested 48 hr after transfection, filtered through a 0.45-lm\nfilter, before the viral titer was determined. The lentivirus\ncontaining shRNA-expressing cassette (sequence 50-\nTTCTCGAACGTGTCACGT-30) was used as a negative control.\n\nHCCLM6/EGFP cells were transduced with specific or\nnegative control lentiviral vectors and selected for stable inte-\ngrant by limited dilution cloning. Identified by real-time\nPCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence confocal analy-\nsis, the clone with the lowest Tiam1 expression was termed\nM6/Tiam1þ, while its negative one termed M6/mock.\n\nRNA extraction and reverse transcription PCR\n\nTotal RNA was extracted using TRIzol Reagent (Takara,\nDalian, China). cDNA was synthesized by oligo dT primed\nreverse transcription from 1 lg of total RNA using a reverse\ntranscriptase cDNA synthesis kit (Takara, Dalian, China). For\nqPCR analysis, aliquots of double-stranded cDNA were\namplified using a SYBR Green PCR Kit (Takara, Dalian,\nChina) and 7500 real-time PCR system (AB Applied Biosys-\ntems). In brief, the reaction mixture (total volume 20 ll)\ncontaining 500 ng cDNA, the forward primer 50-AAGACG-\nTACTCAGGCCATGTCC-30, and the reverse primer 50-\nGACCCAAAT GTCGCAGTCAG-30 was used to amplify a\n252-bp PCR product for human Tiam1 (GeneBank,\nNM_003253). The cycling parameters were 94�C for 40 s,\n58�C for 40 s and 72�C for 34 s for 40 cycles. Experiments\nwere repeated at least three times to ensure the reproducibil-\nity of the results. Human b-actin gene was amplified as an\nendogenous control. The PCR products were observed by\nelectrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized after stain-\ning with ethidium bromide. Comparative quantification was\ndetermined using the 2�DDCt method.20\n\nWestern blot\n\nWestern blot analysis was performed as previously\ndescribed.17 Data were presented as mean 6 SD (n ¼ 3).\n\nMTT assay\n\nCells were plated in 96-well plates at 5 � 103 cells per well. After\nincubation for one day, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphe-\nnyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was performed by adding\n20 ll of MTT (5 mg/ml, Promega) to the medium. The medium\nwere removed 4 hr later when MTT incubation had been com-\npleted and 150 ll of dimethyl sulfoxide (Sigma) was added into\neach well, rocking for 10 min. The absorbance of each well was\nmeasured using a microplate reader set at 570 nm. All experi-\nments were performed in triplicate.\n\nClone formation\n\nTarget HCC cells, as well as their control cells, were added to\ndifferent wells of a six-well culture plate at a final density of 1\n� 102 cells. After incubation for 2 weeks at 37�C, plated cells\nwere washed twice with PBS and stained with Giemsa solu-\ntion. Colonies (�50 cells as a clone) were counted under a\ndissecting microscope [plate clone formation efficiency ¼\n(number of colonies/number of cells inoculated) � 100%]. All\nexperiments were independently repeated at least three times.\n\nCell cycle analysis\n\nCells were harvested at logarithmic growth phase, fixed with\n75% ice-cold ethanol for overnight and washed twice with\nPBS. After centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 min, 100 ll PBS\nwith 0.1% RNase and 500 ll PI (10 lg/ml) were added to\nstain the cells at dark condition, 37�C for 30 min. The fluo-\nrescence of DNA-bound PI in cells was measured with a\nFACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Ger-\nmany). Each staining experiment was repeated three times.\nThe results were analyzed with DNA MultiCycle software.\n\nWound healing and invasion assay\n\nCell migration ability was assessed by measuring the move-\nment of cells into a scraped cellular area created by a 10 ll\npipette tube when cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in\nsix-well culture plates. The phase contrast images of the\nwounds were recorded of 0, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 108 hr and\nthree separate experiments were performed. Cells transfected\nwith empty vector and the parental cells were served as con-\ntrols. Cell invasion assays were performed in 24-well trans-\nwells (8-lm pore size; Chemicon). The cell invasion chamber\ncontains a thin layer of ECMatrix, which occludes membrane\npores, blocking noninvasive cells from migrating. First, se-\nrum-free medium was added to the top chamber to rehydrate\nthe ECM layer for 2 hr at 37�C. A total of 1 � 105 cells sus-\npended in a serum-free medium were then added to the\nupper chamber, while 10% FBS was placed in the lower\nchamber as chemoattractant. After 24 hr of incubation, non-\ninvasive cells remaining in the upper chamber were removed\nby cotton swabs. Cells on the lower surface of the membrane\nwere fixed with methanol and stained with hematoxylin. Cells\nwere counted and photographed in at least six random\nmicroscopic fields. All experiments were repeated three times.\n\nE\nar\nly\n\nD\net\nec\nti\no\nn\nan\n\nd\nD\nia\ngn\n\no\nsi\ns\n\n92 The role of Tiam1 in HCC metastasis\n\nInt. J. Cancer: 132, 90–100 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nIn vivo tumorigenicity\n\nFemale/male athymic BALB/c nu/nu mice of 4- to 6-week-\nold were purchased from the Central Laboratory of Animal\nScience at Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China)\nand maintained in laminar-flow cabinets under specific\npathogen-free conditions. To confirm mock virus-transducing\nwould not affect tumorigenicity, 5 � 106 targeted parental\nHCC cells and mock virus-transduced cells were injected sub-\ncutaneously into both flanks of nude mice first. For evalua-\ntion of the in vivo tumor growth, a total of 5 � 106 targeted\ncells, showing either knockdown or overexpression of Tiam1,\nwere then inoculated subcutaneously into both flanks of nude\nmice. Tumor sizes were measured every 5 days by a digital\ncaliper to calculate the tumor volume using the formula V ¼\nL � W � H/2 (V, volume; L, length; W, width; H, height).\nFluorescence emitted by cells was collected and imaged\nthrough a whole-body green fluorescence protein (GFP)\nimaging system (Lighttools, Encinitas, CA). Real-time tumor\ngrowth was visualized for at least 30 days using IPP5.0 soft-\nware. The experiments were performed in three mice in each\ntreatment group.\n\nIn vivo metastasis\n\nWe employed the tail vein injection assay to assess the effect\nof Tiam1 on tumor metastasis. Cells were harvested by tryp-\nsinization, washed thrice with serum-free medium and resus-\npended in serum-free medium. A total of 5 � 106 97L/\nTiam1þ, M6/Tiam1� and their mock cells were injected into\nthe tail veins of nude mice respectively. Each treatment group\ncontained six mice. Whole-body optical imaging observed\nreal-time primary tumor growth and long-distance metasta-\nsis. Two months later, the mice were euthanized. The tumors\nwere excised and checked by hematoxylin–eosin (H&E)\nstaining.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nBased on the clinic data of the 152 HCC samples in our pre-\nvious study and the additional 61 HCC ones in our study (a\ntotal of 213 samples), the correlations of Tiam1 expression to\nvarious clinicopathological parameters were evaluated with v2\n\ntest. SPSS 16.0 software was used for statistical analysis. RT-\nPCR, clone formation, cell cycle analysis and in vitro invasion\nassay were examined using one-way ANOVA. To test statisti-\ncal differences between in vitro cell proliferation and in vivo\ntumorigenicity, multiple-factor repetitive measurement and\nanalysis of variance were performed. A p value less than 0.05\nwas considered statistically significant.\n\nResults\nTiam1 expression in HCC tissues and\n\nclinicopathologic variables\n\nOf 213 HCC tissue samples, 122 (57.3%) had a high expres-\nsion of Tiam1 (Tiam1 2þ to 3þ) and 91 (42.7%) a low\nexpression (Tiam1 0 to 1þ). Patients with metastasis had a\n\nhigher likelihood of high Tiam1 expression (43 of 63, 68.3%)\ncompared with those without metastasis (79 of 150, 52.7%).\nNo significant correlations were found between Tiam1\nexpression level and any of the clinicopathologic variables\nexcept for metastasis (p ¼ 0.036) (Table 1).\n\nTiam1 expression pattern in metastatic HCC cells\n\nWe first examined the expression of Tiam1 in HL-7702,\nMHCC97L and HCCLM6 to investigate whether there was\nany correlation between Tiam1 expression and the metastasis\npotential in HCC. As presented in Figure 1a, the level of\nTiam1 mRNA in HCCLM6 was much higher than that in\nMHCC97L and HL-7702. No statistically significant\n\nTable 1.

The\nWestern blot analysis had a result similar to that of RT-PCR.\nTiam1 was distributed predominantly in the cytoplasm of\ncells. As expected, the highly metastatic cell line (HCCLM6)\nexhibited stronger signals of Tiam1 than the lowly metastatic\ncell line (MHCC97L). In HL-7702 cells, Tiam1 was almost\nundetectable (Fig. 1b). The Tiam1 expression pattern in the\ncell lines, as in the clinical samples, suggested its relationship\nwith the invasion and metastasis nature of HCC.\n\nAlteration of Tiam1 expression regulated proliferation,\n\nmigration and invasion capabilities of HCC cells in vitro\n\nWe successfully constructed three stable clones overexpress-\ning Tiam1 from MHCC97L cells. Since the second clone\n(97L/T2, termed 97L/Tiam1þ) was validated to exhibit the\nhighest expression level of Tiam1 as measured by qRT-PCR,\nwestern blot and immunofluorescence (Figs. 1c and 1d), it\nwas selected for further studies. We employed MTT assay to\ndetect the effect of Tiam1 on cell growth. By comparing the\n\nFigure 1. Tiam1 expression on mRNA and protein levels in normal hepatocyte line and metastatic HCC cell lines.

Similarly, Tiam1 overexpression\npromoted colony formation of MHCC97L cells relative to pa-\nrental cells and cells transfected with empty vector (p < 0.05;\nFig. 2b, left). Flow cytometry revealed that exogenous Tiam1\nintroduction stimulated cell proliferation by accelerating cell\ncourse from G1 to S, which increased the proportion of S phase\n(p < 0.05, Fig. 2c). 97L parental cells showed cell cycle distribu-\ntion similar to that of 97L/mock cells. In a wound-healing\nassay, an evident acceleration in the wound closure rate was\nobserved in 97L/Tiam1þ cells at 72 hr compared with the con-\ntrols (Fig. 3a, left). In the Matrigel invasion assay (Fig. 3b, left),\nthe number of cells that passed through Matrigel were as two-\nfold higher than in the mock and parental cells (p < 0.05). As\nexpected, Tiam1 overexpression was accompanied by the\nenhanced invasiveness of MHCC97L cells.\n\nThe endogenous Tiam1 level in HCCLM6 was stably\nknocked down by transfecting small interfering RNA (Figs. 1e\nand 1f). Contrary to the effect of Tiam1 overexpression, down-\nregulation of endogenous Tiam1 in HCCLM6 cells suppressed\nthe growth and colony formation compared with their controls\n(Figs. 2a and 2b, right).

Furthermore, obvious\ndelay in wound closure and reduction of invasion were\nobserved in HCCLM6 cells with Tiam1 knockdown (Fig. 3,\nright).\n\nTiam1 enhanced tumorigenicity and metastasis in vivo\n\nAs we expected, no significant difference was found in tumor\ngrowth between the parental cells and the ones transfected\nwith empty vector, which indicated that mock virus-transduc-\ning had little effect on cells tumorigenicity (data not shown).\nWe subsequently observed that injection of 97L/Tiam1þ with a\n\nFigure 2.

In contrast, downregulation of\nendogenous Tiam1 in HCCLM6 resulted in inhibition of\ndistant organs metastasis. All of the mice injected with M6/\nmock cells (all of 6) developed lung and bone metastasis,\nwhile 83.3% (5 of 6) developed liver metastasis (Figs. 5b\nand 5c). In the knockdown group, however, no visible met-\nastatic lesion was observed other than a smaller, less visible\nlung tumor and a case of bone metastasis which were found\nin one of the six mice (16.7%, 1 of 6). All these results\nindicate the metastatic ability was significantly suppressed\nby silencing Tiam1 expression.\n\nDiscussion\nThe long-term survival of HCC patients remains unsatisfac-\ntory because of its high incidence of recurrence and metasta-\nsis after hepatic resection.21 Thus, identification of effective\nbiomarkers for HCC patients is certainly a great concern of\nmedical researchers.\n\nAs an intense interest of current research, Tiam1 has been\nproposed as a potentially effective biomarker for a variety of\ncancers. Many researchers concluded that Tiam1 might be a\nmetastasis-related gene, and consequently in clinic, it can\nserve as a predictor for therapeutic outcome or prognosis of\nthe tumor patients. In our previous study, Tiam1 expression\nwas concluded to be a novel and independent predictor of\nprognosis of HCC patients. This conclusion is in accordance\nwith other Tiam1 investigations in patients with a variety of\ncancers. However, contrary to many other studies, we failed\n\nFigure 4.

J. Cancer: 132, 90–100 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\noverall survival in HCC patients. These suggest that Tiam1\noverexpression may be associated with metastasis of HCC.\n\nTo confirm this finding, we compared Tiam1 expression in\ntwo HCC cell lines of different metastatic potential (see ‘‘Mate-\nrial and Methods’’ section). As shown in the Results section,\nthe cell line with high metastatic potential contained more\nTiam1 mRNA/protein than did the cell line with low metastatic\npotential. This also means that cells with higher metastatic\npotential express more Tiam1, which is consistent with the\nfindings in colon,22,23 breast10 and nasopharyngeal carcinoma24\n\ncell lines. Tiam1 is considered to play various roles in regulating\ncellular functions depending on specific cell type, substratum\nand other factors. It has been shown to promote motility in\nsome neuronal cells,25 to increase cellular migration in fibro-\nblasts26 and to increase invasion in T-lymphoma cells,5 but to\ninduce cellular adhesion (as opposed to cellular migration) in\nsome epithelial cell populations.27 In addition, Tiam1 expres-\nsion was found, in renal cell carcinoma cell lines, to be inversely\ncorrelated with invasive potential, although downregulation of\nTiam1 alone was not sufficient to confer an invasive pheno-\ntype.28 Although many studies have been performed to deter-\nmine the functional features of Tiam1 in different tumors, little\nattention has been paid to the regulation of Tiam1 in HCC. To\nfurther testify the role of Tiam1 in HCC, a series of relevant\nfunctional experiments, from positive to negative, as well as\nfrom in vitro to in vivo, were performed in our study.\n\nA previous study demonstrated that the two cell lines\nderived from the same host cell line, MHCC97L and\nHCCLM6, could provide an ideal cell model system for the\nstudy of HCC metastasis.29 By using retroviral gene transfer\nmethod, a means that can not only stably integrate the gene\nof interest into the target cell genome but also provide a\nlong-term gene expression, we constructed two target cell\nlines: HCCLM6 silencing Tiam1 and MHCC97L overexpress-\ning Tiam1. We thus observed an association of upregulation\nof Tiam1 with promotion of cell proliferation, migration and\ninvasion in vitro, as well as an association of knockdown of\nTiam1 with the reverse. Upregulation of Tiam1 expression in\nMHCC97L cells led to an enhancement of tumorigenicity\nand metastatic potential in mice, while downregulation of\n\nTiam1 expression in HCCLM6 cells was related to suppres-\nsion of tumorigenicity and tumor metastases in vivo. A simi-\nlar relationship between Tiam1 knockdown and metastasis\nwas reported in CRC cell line.22 All the results of the func-\ntional experiments are in agreement with the finding derived\nfrom our statistical analyses. By demonstrating the potential\nrole of Tiam1 in HCC cell lines, we hope our study will pro-\nvide a new insight into Tiam1 in HCC metastasis.\n\nIn our study, although we found a definite association\nbetween overexpression of Tiam1 and metastasis of HCC, the\nunderlying mechanisms are unclear. Engers et al.28 ever stud-\nied the mutation status of Tiam1 in renal cell carcinoma.\nUnfortunately, only a low frequency of point mutation was\nfound in their study, which cannot fully explain the abnor-\nmal expression of Tiam1 in the cancer. Aberrant DNA meth-\nylation frequently occurs in initiation and development of\nhuman cancer. Ding et al.,11 another team investigating\nTiam1 in our laboratory, tried to elucidate the mechanisms\nfrom the epigenetic modification and demonstrated that over-\nexpression of Tiam1 was associated with hypomethylation\nstatus of Tiam1 promoter region in CRC tissues, though no\nstatistical relationship between Tiam1 methylation and cancer\nmetastasis could be found. Specific hypomethylation of pro-\nmoters of cancer-related genes was recently shown in HCC\nin genomewide/candidate gene studies and some meaningful\nresults were obtained.30,31 All these attempts addressing the\nmechanisms that may regulate expression of Tiam1 in carci-\nnomas require further in depth research in the future.\n\nIn summary, our study modified a doubtful result of our\nprevious study by demonstrating a significant association\nbetween metastasis and Tiam1 overexpression in HCC. All of\nour functional experiments confirmed a metastasis-promoting\nfunction of Tiam1 in HCC. The preferential overexpression\nof Tiam1 in HCC patients with metastasis suggests that\nTiam1 may be a significant biomarker of HCC progression.\nInhibitors targeting Tiam1 would give considerable therapeu-\ntic potentials in the treatment of HCC. Thus, future experi-\nments on Tiam1 are certainly required to better understand\nthe progression and metastasis of HCC as well as to confirm\nthe pharmaceutical significance of Tiam1.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
