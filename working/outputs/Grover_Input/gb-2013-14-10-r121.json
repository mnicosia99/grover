Despite\nthe development of protocols and techniques that have enabled us to map nucleosome occupancy genome-wide,\nthe dynamic properties of nucleosomes remain poorly understood, particularly in mammalian cells. The histone\nvariant H3.3 is incorporated into chromatin independently of DNA replication and requires displacement of existing\nnucleosomes for its deposition. Here, we measure H3.3 turnover at high resolution in the mammalian genome in\norder to present a genome-wide characterization of replication-independent H3.3-nucleosome dynamics.\n\nResults: We developed a system to study the DNA replication-independent turnover of nucleosomes containing the\nhistone variant H3.3 in mammalian cells. By measuring the genome-wide incorporation of H3.3 at different time points\nfollowing epitope-tagged H3.3 expression, we find three categories of H3.3-nucleosome turnover in vivo: rapid turnover,\nintermediate turnover and, specifically at telomeres, slow turnover. Our data indicate that H3.3-containing nucleosomes\nat enhancers and promoters undergo rapid turnover that is associated with active histone modification marks including\nH3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variant H2A.Z. The rate of turnover is negatively correlated with\nH3K27me3 at regulatory regions and with H3K36me3 at gene bodies.\n\nConclusions: We have established a reliable approach to measure turnover rates of H3.3-containing nucleosomes on a\ngenome-wide level in mammalian cells. Our results suggest that distinct mechanisms control the dynamics of H3.3\nincorporation at functionally different genomic regions.\nBackground\nIncorporation of histone variants into chromatin critic-\nally influences the properties of nucleosomes that play\nimportant roles in regulating transcription and epigenetic\nmemories [1-6]. The histone variant H3.3 differs from\ncanonical H3 by a few amino acids and is ubiquitously\nexpressed in eukaryotes. Different from canonical histone\nH3, which is expressed in S phase and is incorporated into\nchromatin during DNA replication, H3.3 can be incorpo-\nrated into chromatin independent of DNA replication\n[7,8]. The incorporation of histone variants is tightly regu-\nlated by histone chaperones. The H3.3-specific chaperones\n* Correspondence: zhaok@nhlbi.nih.gov\n†Equal contributors\n1Systems Biology Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH,\nBethesda, MD, 20892, USA\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\n\n© 2013 Kraushaar et al.; licensee BioMed Cent\nCommons Attribution License (http://creativec\nreproduction in any medium, provided the or\nAtrx-Daxx and HIRA deposit H3.3 primarily at telomeres\nand non-heterochromatic regions, respectively [9-12]. Des-\npite small differences in amino acid sequence between\nH3.1, H3.2 and H3.3, each is distributed differentially across\nthe genome and carries its own characteristic histone modi-\nfication signature, strongly suggesting distinct functional\nroles for each H3 variant [9]. Histone marks that are\nassociated with gene activation, such as acetylation marks\nand H3K4me3, are typically found on H3.3 whereas\nH3K27me2 and H3K9me3 are found on H3.2 [13]. Marks\nassociated with gene silencing are predominantly found\non H3.1. However, the precise relationship between H3.3\ndeposition and transcription are not well understood. In\nDrosophila, H3.3 replaces H3 during gene activation and\nbecomes deposited in active chromatin and especially very\nhighly expressed ribosomal DNA [14,15].

Nucleosome occupancy and positioning are\ncritical to regulating gene transcription and epigenome\nmaintenance [18,19]. In mammalian cells, although nu-\ncleosomes are present at promoters and enhancers, they\nmust be dynamically regulated to accommodate binding\nof transcription factors and RNA polymerase machineries\nby various mechanisms [20-23].\nIntrinsic nucleosome characteristics such as inclusion\n\nof histone variants as well as extrinsic factors such as\nATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling, the transcriptional\nmachinery and various other factors shape the dynamic\nprofile of nucleosomes [24,25]. Despite the development\nof protocols and techniques that have enabled us to\nmap the genome-wide nucleosome occupancy, their dy-\nnamic properties are only poorly understood. Our current\nunderstanding of the dynamics of nucleosomes comes\nfrom studies performed in yeast and Drosophila. Trans-\ngenic epitope-tagged histones can be inducibly expressed\nto estimate nucleosome turnover and allow detection of\nspecific histone incorporation [26-28]. Alternatively, newly\nsynthesized, native histones can be metabolically labeled\nwith an amino acid analogue that is coupled to an affinity\ntag (CATCH-IT), which allows for detection of H3/H4\ntetramers [29]. Using these strategies, it has been shown\nthat nucleosome exchange is rapid at promoters and\ncoding regions, and relatively slower at heterochromatic\nregions. Furthermore, differential turnover can be quite\nlocalized. For instance, faster nucleosome turnover has\nbeen detected at Trithorax-group binding sites than at\npolycomb group protein binding sites [26,30].\nApart from the measurement of turnover, inducible\n\nexpression systems with tagged histones have also con-\ntributed to our understanding of mechanistic aspects that\npertain to histone deposition. For instance, studies from\nyeast have shown that Asf1 is required for the deposition\nof H3 and that the amino termini of both H2B and H3\nare not required for their incorporation into nucleo-\nsomes [27,28].\nWhile these techniques measure average histone\n\ndeposition rates across cell populations, alternative tech-\nniques such as FRAP and SNAP-tag have allowed the\ndeposition of histones in individual cells to be visual-\nized [31-33].\nThe genome-wide turnover of the histone variant H3.3\n\nin mammals has not been studied up until now. Global\nFRAP studies in HeLa cells with green fluorescent protein\n(GFP)-tagged histones revealed only cycling of H2B.\nCanonical H3 and H4, in contrast, exhibited very slow\ncycling, and the majority of H3 remained permanently\nbound outside S phase [33]. Slow turnover of core his-\ntones may be a feature of somatic cells since core histone\nexchange is substantially more rapid in pluripotent ESCs\nthan in differentiated cell types [34]. Hence, fast turnover\nmay be inherently linked to cell plasticity.\nIn this study, we developed a versatile technique to\n\nmap the dynamics of histone variant incorporation into\nchromatin in mammalian cells. Using this technique, we\nmapped the replication-independent incorporation of the\nhistone variant H3.3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts\n(MEFs). We were able to track H3.3 incorporation across\na relatively short time window of several hours after\ninduction of H3.3 as well as over a longer time frame\nof up to 72 hours. By combining our chromatin immuno-\nprecipitation (ChIP)-based technique with high-throughput\nsequencing, we measured the H3.3-nucleosome turnover\nkinetics at the genome-wide level. Our results reveal three\nmajor categories of H3.3 nucleosome turnover: (1) rapid\nturnover at enhancers and promoters; (2) intermediate\nturnover at gene bodies; and (3) slow turnover at hetero-\nchromatic regions. We find faster H3.3 turnover at en-\nhancers and promoters is positively correlated with active\nhistone modifications, including H3K4me1, H3K4me3,\nH3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variant H2A.Z, whereas\nslower turnover is negatively correlated with H3K27me3\nand H3K36me3 modifications. These results show that\ndistinct mechanisms of histone deposition and eviction\npertain to the dynamics of nucleosomes at different func-\ntional chromatin regions. We also show that turnover is\nrelated to the presence of specific histone marks, strongly\nsuggesting that histone modifications are important deter-\nminants of nucleosome stability.\n\nResults\nAn ectopic expression system to measure turnover of H3.3\nIn order to track histone incorporation and thereby assay\nthe genome-wide dynamics of the histone variant H3.3, we\ngenerated MEFs that carry a cytomegalovirus-controlled\ntetracycline (TET) transactivator and hemagglutinin (HA)/\nFLAG-tagged H3.3 expression cassette controlled by tetra-\ncycline response elements. This TET-ON expression system\nallowed us to induce the expression of a HA/FLAG-tagged\nversion of H3.3 by addition of the tetracycline analog doxy-\ncycline (DOX) (Figure 1A). In our tetracycline inducible-\nHA/FLAG-H3.3 MEF cell line, we detected robust H3.3\nexpression as early as 2 hours after DOX addition that\ncontinued to increase until 48 hours after DOX addition.\nNo tagged H3.3 expression was detected in the absence of\nDOX (Figure 1B). Immunoblotting against H3.3 revealed\nthat transgenic H3.3 expression levels were only a small\nfraction of those of endogenous H3.3. Furthermore we\n\n\n\nFigure 1 A versatile system to study replication-independent nucleosome dynamics in mammals. (A) Schematic of TET-inducible expression\nsystem to study H3.3 turnover.

After 18 hours\nof aphidicolin treatment (time point 0) and across the\ntime course of HA/FLAG-H3.3 induction, the MEF cell\npopulation was essentially devoid of cells in S phase\nand arrested at the G1/S phase boundary, as indicated\n\n\n\nFigure 2 (See legend on next page.)\n\nKraushaar et al.

Thus, to monitor the genome-wide dy-\nnamics of replication-independent H3.3 incorporation,\nwe induced HA/FLAG-H3.3 expression in cells arrested\nby aphidicolin, followed by ChIP-Seq analysis using the\nHA antibody at various time points. We took a ‘high-\nresolution’ approach by tracking histone incorporation\nacross hourly time points of early protein expression\nand across a longer time frame of up to 48 hours.\n\nGenome-wide characterization of H3.3 incorporation\nIn order to characterize the genome-wide deposition of\nHA-H3.3, we sought to map the H3.3 distribution 72 hours\npost-induction. Consistent with previous reports from\nHeLa and mouse ESCs [1,9], we found that H3.3 is\nstrongly enriched in promoters, 5’ UTRs, as well as the\n3’ ends of genes (Figure 2A,B,F). In terms of read density,\npromoters and TES regions were overrepresented in the\nH3.3-enriched genomic regions (Figure 2A). The majority\nof H3.3 peaks were detected at introns followed by peaks\nin intergenic regions (Figure 2B). In line with the idea that\nH3.3 carries primarily active histone modifications [13],\nwe found strong overlap of H3.3 with the distribution\nprofiles of histone modifications such as H3K4me1,\nH3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K27ac. In contrast we detected\nsubstantially fewer regions of H3.3 incorporation at sites\nenriched with H3K27me3 (Figure 2D, 2E). Since the vast\nmajority of sharp H3.3 peaks in introns and intergenic\nregions were associated with enhancer marks, including\nH3K4me1, H3K27ac and H2A.Z, we considered them as\nputative enhancers in the following analyses.\nAlthough most of the repetitive elements showed obvious\n\ndepletion of H3.3, high levels of H3.3 were detected at\ntelomeres, rRNA and tRNA repeats (Figure 2C). H3.3\nco-localizes with pericentromeres in several differentiated\ncell types [10]. We, however, did not find significant\ndeposition of HA-H3.3 at pericentromeric regions. This\nstrongly suggests that H3.3 deposition in these regions\nis a strictly replication-coupled process as we profiled\nthe distribution of HA-H3.3 from cell cycle arrested and\nnon-dividing cells.\nTo test the relationship between H3.3 incorporation\n\nand gene expression, we plotted the average profiles of\nH3.3 across several groups of genes sorted according to\ntheir expression levels (Figure 2F). Unlike in mouse ESCs,\nwe found that H3.3 is associated mostly with active genes\nand not inactive genes.\nEnrichment levels of H3.3 at TSSs, gene bodies and\n\nTESs were positively correlated with the transcription\nlevel of the associated genes (Figure 2F). Interestingly,\nwe find that the relation between HA-H3.3 enrichment\nand gene expression follows a bimodal distribution at\npromoters. Only promoters of expressed genes carry\nsubstantial amounts of H3.3, and H3.3 enrichment levels\ndo not increase further at even higher expression levels.\nIn contrast, HA-H3.3 enrichment in gene body and TES\nregions was strongly positively correlated with gene ex-\npression levels. This indicates that H3.3 in gene bodies\nmay be directly transcription coupled, whereas other\nmechanisms of H3.3 deposition may exist upstream of\nTSSs. As a control alongside H3.3, we generated a MEF\ncell line that expressed canonical HA-H3.1 instead of\nHA-H3.3, which differs in five amino acids from H3.3,\nand mapped its replication-coupled deposition. Changing\nH3.3 to H3.1 abolished the defined enrichment of H3.3\nto a homogenous distribution similar to reads mapped\nfrom input samples, confirming its universal deposition\nthroughout the mammalian genome (Figure 2E). Fur-\nthermore, the pronounced pattern of H3.3 enrichment\naround the TSS, gene body and TES was lost. Slightly\nhigher levels of H3.1 were detected around the TSSs\nof inactive and low-expressed promoters, indicating\nprevalence of H3.1 at inactive genes (Figure 2G). Simi-\nlar genome-wide ChIP-Seq profiles were obtained by\nGoldberg et al. [9] with zinc finger-targeted, heterozy-\ngously tagged H3.3B in ESCs: mutating HA-H3.3 to\nHA-H3.2 or to a HA-H3.1S31 hybrid altered the H3\ndistribution to a genome-wide pattern similar to that\nof input samples or ChIP-Seq profiles obtained with\nantibodies against general H3.\n\nH3.3 displays early and late chromatin incorporation\nThe above results indicated the steady-state enrichment\nof H3.3 across the genome. In order to measure turn-\nover rates of H3.3, we profiled the dynamics of HA-H3.3\nincorporation after 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 18, 24 and\n48 hours of DOX treatment (Figure 3A).

A substantial number of sharp peaks\nappeared within 2 to 3 hours of DOX induction and\nreached their maximum enrichment well before the end\npoint of the induction (Figure 3A,C). The subsequent\ndecline in read numbers that was observed at peaks with\nrapid H3.3 deposition may be a result of ‘read shifting’.\n\n\n\nKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 7 of 15\nhttp://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121\nAs the total read coverage becomes saturated, more\nreads may shift to peaks, which appear at later stages of\ninduction. Importantly, this way, sites of enrichment\nmay be identified, which would otherwise go undetected\nin a steady state. Meanwhile, we also observed many\nbroad peaks, mainly in transcribed gene body regions,\nwhich took 12 to 24 hours to be detected (Figure 3A,C).\nPlotting the distribution of turnover rates revealed the\nexistence of two populations of H3.3 peaks with slow\nturnover and fast turnover, respectively (Figure 3D).\nFigure 4 Promoters and enhancers are associated with fast H3.3 nucl\nregions are associated with slow H3.3 nucleosome turnover.

The analysis re-\nvealed that 5’ UTR and promoter regions generally have\nthe highest turnover indices; enhancers have the second\nhighest, and 3’ UTR and TES regions have the lowest\nturnover indices (Figure 4A).

Notable\nincorporation of HA-H3.3 was detected at the promoter\nregion within 3 hours. Further increases in deposition of\nHA-H3.3 were observed within 6 hours at the TSS and\nthe majority of genes reached their maximum by 12 hours\nbefore starting to decline (Figure 4B,D). Remarkably,\nthe onset of HA-H3.3 deposition at gene bodies was\nnot detected any time before the 6-hour time point\n(Figure 4C,E). H3.3 deposition at gene bodies continued\nto increase from 12 hours to 72 hours of induction,\nwhen it reached the steady-state level. It is interesting\nto note that the signal of HA-H3.3 at the TSS exhibited\ndecreases from 12 hours to 72 hours.\nHigh turnover of H3.3 in promoter regions of active\n\ngenes suggests that nucleosome turnover may be corre-\nlated with transcriptional activation. Further examination\nof turnover rates at promoters indeed showed a modest\nbut positive correlation with gene expression levels\n(Figure 4F). The relationship between promoter turnover\nand gene transcription suggests additional mechanisms by\nwhich nucleosome exchange facilitates and/or is facilitated\nby gene activation.\nTo further examine variation of the H3.3 turnover rates\n\nwithin each genomic category, we plotted the distribution\nof turnover indices separated into these categories\n(Figure 4G). The analysis revealed a relatively narrow\nrange for the high turnover at promoters and 5’ UTRs\nand slow turnover at gene bodies and 3’ UTRs, respect-\nively, suggesting that the H3.3 nucleosome exchange in\nthese regions are controlled by distinct mechanisms at\nthese respective sites (Figure 4G). Interestingly, enhancer\nregions exhibited broad variability with regards to their\nturnover rates, indicating that not all regulatory regions\nare marked by high nucleosome turnover. Instead add-\nitional factors such as histone variants or histone modi-\nfications may contribute to nucleosome stability and\nturnover.\n\nRapid H3.3 nucleosome turnover is associated with active\nhistone marks at promoters and enhancers\nSeveral studies have shown that H3.3 is enriched in tran-\nscriptional regulatory regions such as promoters and\nenhancers [1,9,15]. Consistent with these observations,\nwe found that many H3.3 peaks are co-localized with\nactive histone modification marks, including H3K4me1,\nH3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and the histone variant\nH2A.Z, that are often associated with promoters and\nenhancers (Figure 2D,E) [1,35,36]. To elucidate the\nrelationship between H3.3 nucleosome turnover and\nhistone modifications, we sorted all H3.3 peaks based\non their turnover rates and displayed histone modifi-\ncation signals using heatmaps. The analysis indicated\nthat faster turnover rates are generally associated with\nhigher levels of H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac\nand H2A.Z, whereas slower turnover is associated with\nhigher levels of H3K27me3 (Figure 5A). More quantitative\nanalyses confirmed that indeed H3.3 peaks with higher\nlevels of active modifications are turned over faster. In\ncontrast, H3.3 peaks associated with heterochromatic\nmarks such as H3K9me2 and repressive marks such as\nH3K27me3 are turned over slower (Figure 5B).\nTo understand the differences between the enhancers\n\nwith fast H3.3 turnover and those with slow H3.3 turn-\nover (Figure 4G, black line), we compared the histone\nmodifications associated with these two groups of enhancers\n(Additional file 1). The analysis revealed that enhancers\nthat displayed high turnover carried significantly higher\nmedian levels of active chromatin marks whereas enhancers\nof low turnover carried higher levels of H3K27me3\n(Additional file 1). Unexpectedly, our data indicated a\nnegative correlation between H3.3 turnover and H3K36me3\nlevels (Figure 5A,B), in line with the idea that H3K36me3\nstabilizes nucleosomes in order to prevent cryptic tran-\nscription [37,38].\nTo evaluate the relative contribution of individual histone\n\nmodifications to turnover rates, we compared the group of\nenhancers associated with all five active modifications to\ngroups missing single histone marks. The results indicate\nthat the turnover rates decreased significantly by missing\nany of the active modifications (Figure 5C). Consistent with\nthis observation, association with only one of these\nmodifications increased the turnover rates compared to\nthe enhancers without these modifications (Figure 5D).\nIn contrast to these active modifications, inclusion of\neither H3K27me3 or H3K36me3 substantially decreased\nthe turnover index of H3.3 nucleosomes (Figure 5E).\nIn summary, we find that H3.3 exchange rate is posi-\n\ntively correlated with active chromatin modifications\n(H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H3K27ac and H2A.Z)\nand negatively correlated with repressive marks (H3K9me2\nand H3K27me3). While the steady-state level of H3.3 is\npositively correlated with H3K36me3, its turnover rate\nis negatively correlated with H3K36me3.\n\nThe kinetics of HA-H3.3 incorporation at tRNA and\nrRNAs genes\nWe found that HA-H3.3 is enriched in tRNAs and rRNA\ngenes (Figure 2C). The incorporation of HA-H3.3 was\napparent from 6 hours of induction and continued to\nincrease till 24 hours before it started to decline at\n48 hours (Figure 6A). The incorporation of HA-H3.3 at\nrRNA genes was apparent at 12 hours and reached its\nmaximum at 48 hours (Figure 6B). Both tRNA and rRNA\nexist as tandem repeat regions, are highly expressed and\nare transcribed by Pol III and Pol I, respectively. Pol III-\ntranscribed genes share many epigenetic characteristics\n\n\n\nFigure 5 Fast turnover rates are associated with active histone modifications.

The turnover indices are indicated on\nthe y-axis for H3.3 nucleosomes containing all five active modifications (only active) or five active modifications plus either H3K27me3 or\nH3K36me3 or both.\n\nKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 9 of 15\nhttp://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121\nwith Pol II transcribed genes, such as presence of\nH3K4me1/2/3 and absence of H3K27me3 [39]. Hence,\nhigh turnover at tRNA and rRNA repeats is consistent\nwith our previous result that demonstrated high H3.3-\nnucleosome turnover at sites marked with active histone\nmarks. High nucleosome exchange may directly facili-\ntate accessibility of Pol III-specific transcription factors\nTFIIIB and TFIIIC to provide functional promoters and\nassist in transcriptional initiation.\n\nSlow H3.3 replacement in telomeres\nCompared to promoters, enhancers, gene body regions,\ntRNAs and rRNAs, the incorporation of HA-H3.3 at\ntelomeres exhibited the slowest rate. It was detected at\n\n\n\nFigure 6 Different repetitive sequences display distinct H3.3\nturnover rates.

Heterochromatic regions are expected to have\nstable nucleosomes and most of their histone exchange is\nexpected to take place during S phase. Yet, we observed\nslow rates of HA-H3.3 replacement at telomeres outside\nS phase, indicating slow replication-independent histone\nexchange that may be necessary for maintenance of\ntelomeric stability. It is known that repetitive features of\ntelomeres and pericentromeres have a relatively low\naffinity for nucleosomes and this may contribute to his-\ntone displacement [40].\n\nDiscussion\nNucleosome dynamics and histone turnover are not well\nunderstood in mammals. In this report, we have devel-\noped a robust, TET-inducible system to study the kinetics\nof genome-wide deposition of the histone variant H3.3\nin MEF cells. Using this system, we were able to measure\nturnover rates of genome-wide H3.3 target sites and were\nable to infer important differences between turnover rates\nof various genomic regions. Several categories of H3.3\ndeposition kinetics were observed: invariably high turn-\nover at promoters, a broad range of turnover rates at\nenhancers, and slow turnover at gene bodies. In addition,\nrepeat elements displayed dramatically different turnover\nrates with relatively high turnover at tRNA and rRNA ele-\nments and very slow H3.3 exchange at telomeres. These\nresults provide novel insights into the genome-wide turn-\nover of H3.3-containing nucleosomes and suggest distinct\nmechanisms of nucleosome assembly, stability and eviction\nin order to fulfill their function in regulating transcription\nand maintaining chromatin stability and integrity.\n\nGenome-wide incorporation of H3.3\nUnlike canonical histones, the histone variant H3.3 can\nbe deposited onto chromatin in a replication-independent\nmanner [7,8]. It is enriched in transcriptionally active re-\ngions, such as gene bodies and promoters and enhancers\nof mammalian cells [1,9]. Incorporation of H3.3 into\nchromatin destabilizes the nucleosome structure and\nmay facilitate transcriptional activation by generating a\nmore accessible chromatin configuration [1,2]. Its de-\nposition at promoters as well as in gene bodies is asso-\nciated with epigenetic inheritance and may contribute\nto epigenetic memories [3,16].\nOur analysis of H3.3 distribution at the steady state\n\nrevealed its presence at intergenic regions that overlap\nwith histone modifications that typically mark enhancers,\nsuch has H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H2A.Z, in addition to\nthe enrichment at TSS regions. In coding regions, we\nfind that H3.3 is broadly distributed within the gene\nbody of actively transcribed genes as well as TESs and\nregions immediately after. This association is well corre-\nlated with gene expression levels as has been reported\nfrom other cell lines [1,9]. At promoter regions we find\nstrong differences in H3.3 enrichment between inactive\n\n\n\nKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 11 of 15\nhttp://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121\ngenes and active genes but relatively moderate differ-\nences between different expression groups, which follows\nan almost bimodal distribution. Based on H3.3 incorpor-\nation studies that followed H3.3 incorporation over time\nit was suggested that H3.3 incorporation at promoters\nwas constitutive as only minor increases in H3.3 enrichment\nwere observed upon interferon stimulation [16]. Our\ndata argue against a direct transcription-coupled mech-\nanism of incorporation at promoters as expression levels\nand enrichment levels are bimodal, which further suggests\nthat the H3.3 incorporation may function upstream of\nthe transcriptional activation. Enrichment of H3.3 within\ngene body regions and at the TES showed strong correla-\ntions with transcription levels, in line with the notion that\nH3.3 incorporation in gene bodies is directly coupled to\nelongation. The ChIP-Seq profiles between gene body\nH3.3 and Pol II are highly similar. Furthermore, a physical\ninteraction between HIRA and Pol II has been demon-\nstrated and provides further testament for a direct link\nbetween H3.3 deposition and transcriptional elong-\nation [32]. The role of H3.3 deposition in gene bodies\nremains unclear but may be implicated in conferring\nepigenetic inheritance in order to facilitate constitutive\ntranscription of genes after cell replication has taken\nplace.\n\nDynamics of H3.3 incorporation and differential turnover\nOur results on the dynamics of H3.3 incorporation revealed\nthree basic modes of H3.3 deposition kinetics. The most\ndynamic exchange of H3.3 was observed at promoters\nand enhancers. Robust signals of induced H3.3 were\ndetected within 2 to 3 hours of induction at these regula-\ntory regions, which is consistent with the rapid nucleo-\nsome turnover at chromatin boundaries observed in yeast\n[26]. The second category of intermediate-rate incorpor-\nation of newly induced H3.3 was found at gene body\nregions of active genes. The incorporation of H3.3 to\ngene bodies became apparent at 12 hours and reached\na maximum at 72 hours. The slowest incorporation of\nH3.3 was detected at telomeres, with detectable H3.3\ndeposition at around 24 to 48 hours post-induction. Such\ndifferential turnover suggests that multiple mechanisms\nof H3.3 deposition and displacement occur, which no\ndoubt will become subject to further investigation.\nThe fast turnover at enhancers and promoters may in-\n\nvolve histone chaperones such as HIRA and Atrx-Daxx\nand other chromatin remodeling enzymes as well as\nsequence-specific transcription factors. High turnover\nat promoters suggests that high nucleosome turnover is\na pre-requisite for binding of the transcriptional ma-\nchinery as well as transcription factors.\nThe concept of nucleosome versus transcription fac-\n\ntor competition has been well established from the\nPho5 promoter in yeast [19,23,41]. Without stimulation,\nnucleosomes are bound to the binding sites of the trans-\nactivator Pho4 and effectively repress expression of the\ngene. Only upon release of nucleosomes at the promoter\ncan Pho4 bind to its target site and gene activation ef-\nfectively occur [23]. Unlike in yeast, active promoters of\nmammalian cells are occupied by nucleosomes [20]. So\nwhat is the role of their turnover? It is attractive to\nspeculate that nucleosomes sterically compete with DNA\nbinding factors and that accessibility can only be granted\nwhen nucleosome turnover is high [26].\nAlthough simple nucleosome depletion could accom-\n\nplish accessibility, ‘transient’ nucleosome deposition may\nstabilize DNA integrity, which may be necessary for\naccurate transcription factor binding. Several families\nof transcription factors, so-called ‘pioneer factors’ [42],\nrequire the presence and ‘guidance’ of nucleosomes for\nproper binding and subsequent nucleosome remodeling\n[43]. Secondly, nucleosomes and their histone modifica-\ntions provide docking stations for a variety of transcription\nfactors and chromatin remodeling factors, which may\nrequire continuous recruitment for initiation of transcrip-\ntion. Continuous nucleosome turnover may allow for\naccessibility and nucleosome binding for chromatin fac-\ntors at the same time, which could be facilitated by the\npresence of multiple active modifications at enhancers\nor promoters. In contrast, repression of transcription\nand epigenetic inheritance may require greater stability\nof nucleosome organization and thus slower turnover\nat these sites, which, in turn, could be facilitated by associ-\nation with polycomb group proteins and H3K27me3\nmodification [30].\nThe modest rate of H3.3 incorporation in gene bodies\n\nand TES regions is closely related to active transcription,\nand the accumulative signals of H3.3 in these regions\nmay require multiple rounds of transcription of a gene\nunit. It is generally thought that RNA polymerase displaces\nnucleosomes during elongation, as it cannot pass by nucle-\nosomes ahead of it [44,45]. Nucleosomes must be replaced\nbehind passing RNA polymerase in order to maintain the\nfidelity of transcription and avoid cryptic transcription [46].\nUnlike other histone chaperones, HIRA possesses unique\nDNA binding properties that allow it to bind to naked\nDNA. Due to its physical association with Pol II, a ‘gap\nfilling’ mechanism has been proposed by which HIRA\nunder the guidance of PolII will fill protective H3.3-\nnucleosomes into spaces of naked DNA [32]. Our study\nreaffirms the continuous eviction and replacement of\nH3.3-containing nucleosomes during transcription. Slow\nexchange of these nucleosomes likely enhances chromatin\nstability before nucleosomes are evicted during a new\nround of transcription. H3K36me3 is placed by SET2-\nrelated enzymes following active transcription and plays\na role in facilitating nucleosome deacetylation [37,47].\nHistone deacetylation stabilizes nucleosomes and thus\n\n\n\nKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 12 of 15\nhttp://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121\nmay result in the observed negative correlation between\nH3K36me3 level and H3.3 turnover in gene body regions.\nOur analyses suggest that heterochromatic regions turn\n\nover more slowly than euchromatic regions. We observed\nvery slow turnover at telomeres and no turnover at all\nat pericentromeric regions, both of which are known to\nbe enriched in H3.3. This suggests that pericentromeric\nnucleosomes are replaced only during replication, whereas\ntelomeres undergo continuous exchange of their nucleo-\nsomes. Continuous exchange of nucleosomes at telomeres\nmay be necessary for telomeric maintenance, although\nbulk telomeric nucleosomes may be exchanged during\nreplication.\nIn summary, we have provided the basis for our under-\n\nstanding of nucleosome dynamics in mammals by pro-\nviding a detailed picture of genome-wide replacement of\nthe histone variant H3.3. This study will provide the\nplatform for further studies into the determinants and\nmechanisms of nucleosome exchange.\n\nConclusion\nIn this study, we mapped the genome-wide H3.3-specific\nnucleosome occupancy and the dynamic turnover of this\nhistone variant in mammalian cells. We found that H3.3\nturnover rates vary dramatically across functionally dis-\ntinct genomic regions: turnover was highest at promoters\nand enhancers, intermediate at gene bodies and slowest\nat telomeres. Furthermore, we delineated striking correla-\ntions between turnover rates, histone modifications and\nH2A.Z, suggesting that intrinsic nucleosome properties\nsuch as histone modifications and histone variant inclu-\nsions are important properties of nucleosome stability.\n\nMaterials and methods\nCell line derivation\ncDNA of human H3.3B or mouse H3.1 (Hist1h3h) was\nsubcloned in-frame with a HA and FLAG tag at the\ncarboxyl terminus and cloned into the lentiviral plvx-\nTight-Puro Vector (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA).\nLentiviral particles were packaged in 293 T cells with the\npsPAX2 packaging plasmid. Subsequently, we transduced\nNIH/3 T3 Tet-On® 3G cells (Clontech) and drug-selected\nwith puromycin for stable integration.\n\nWestern blotting\nCells were lysed with RIPA buffer, and whole-cell lysates\nwere resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellu-\nlose membranes, and blotted with anti-HA (Roche, Basel,\nSwitzerland), anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma, St. Louis, MO,\nUSA) antibodies at 1:1,000. For anti-H3.3 western blot-\nting, histones were isolated by acid extraction as described\nin [48] prior to immunoblotting with an anti-H3.3 anti-\nbody (Abcam, ab62642, Cambridge, UK). The anti-H3.3\nantibody recognizes serine 31 of H3.3, which is not\npresent on either H3.1 or H3.2, but cross-reactivity with\nother histone variants has not been tested experimen-\ntally (Abcam).\n\nCell cycle analysis\nCells were examined for BrdU incorporation with the\nBrdU Labeling and Detection kit (Roche). For further\ncell cycle and DNA content analysis, cells were fixed with\n70% ethanol, and subsequently stained with 50 μg/ml pro-\npidium iodide in 0.1% PBS-Triton-X with 0.2 mg/ml\nRNase A before analysis by flow cytometry.\n\nTime course induction and preparation of ChIP-Seq/RNA-Seq\nlibraries\nNIH/3 T3 MEFs were cultured in standard conditions with\nmedium containing TET-compatible fetal bovine serum.\nMEFs were grown to 100% confluence and treated with\n1 μg/ml aphidicolin for 18 hours. Adding 3 μg/ml doxy-\ncycline hyclate before crosslinking with formaldehyde\nat various time points induced HA/FLAG-H3.3 expres-\nsion. ChIP-Seq experiments were performed as described\npreviously [49] with an antibody against HA. In order to\ncorrelate HA/FLAG-H3.3 turnover with the presence of\nhistone modifications and/or gene expression levels, we\nprepared ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq from cells that were\ntreated with aphidicolin for 18 hours prior to crosslinking\nand cell lysis.\n\nData analysis\nChIP-Seq read mapping and peak calling\nChIP-Seq reads were mapped to the mouse genome\n(mm9, or NCBI 37) using Bowtie [50], only allowing\n‘one read per position’ matching. Redundant reads were\nremoved from each ChIP-Seq library. We identified ChIP-\nSeq tag-enriched peaks using SICER [51], which takes\nadvantage of the enrichment information from neigh-\nboring bins to identify spatial clusters of signals that are\nunlikely to appear by chance. In this way, we could iden-\ntify the dispersed epigenomic domains such as broad\nH3.3 domains on gene bodies. For calling of H3.3 peaks,\nwe set the window size to 200 bp and gap size to 600 bp.\nPeaks with a false discovery rate higher than 0.01 were\nexcluded from the analysis, compared with the input\ncontrol libraries.\n\nAnalysis of H3.3 enrichment in genic regions and repetitive\nelements\nThe RefSeq gene annotation (mm9 or NCBI37) was down-\nloaded from the UCSC browser. The mouse genome\nwas classified into 5’ UTR, exon, intron, 3’ UTR and\nintergenic based on the UCSC annotation. Then we de-\nfined another two categories: promoter (3 kb upstream\nof the TSS) and TES (from TES to 5 kb downstream).\nThe total mapped reads in each category were normalized\n\n\n\nKraushaar et al. Genome Biology 2013, 14:R121 Page 13 of 15\nhttp://genomebiology.com/2013/14/10/R121\nto its total length. All mouse consensus repetitive element\nsequences, including pericentromeric element, L1, SINE1\nand telomeric element, were obtained from Repbase Up-\ndate (RU) [52]. The relative enrichment of H3.3 in each\ncategory of repetitive element was calculated by the pro-\nportions of reads mapped to repetitive elements normal-\nized over input.\n\nH3.3 peak annotation and distribution profiling\nWe used the position of the center of each peak for peak\nannotation. Two peaks from different libraries were con-\nsidered as overlapping if the overlapped region accounts\nfor 10% of the length of one peak. We classified genes\nwith RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per million\nreads) <1 as lowest (inactive) genes and the other genes\nas active genes. We grouped genes into five categories\nwith equal numbers of genes (highest, high, intermediate,\nlow, lowest) based on their RPKM values. For each gene,\nreads falling in peaks were counted according to their\nshifted positions in 50 bp windows for the regions from\n3 kb upstream of the TSS to the TSS and from the TES\nto 5 kb downstream of the TES. Within gene bodies,\nreads falling in peaks were counted according to their\nshifted positions in windows equal to 1% length of each\ngene. The number of reads in each window was normal-\nized by the total number of bases within the window, and\nthe total number of peak-filtered reads in the correspond-\ning sample to obtain a normalized read-tag density.\n\nRNA-Seq data analysis\nThe reads from RNA-Seq libraries were mapped to the\nmouse genome (mm9, or NCBI37) using TopHat [53], a\nfast splice junction mapper. The gene expression level\nwas measured by RPKM.\n\nQuantifying peak dynamics\nThe total number of H3.3 peaks was identified by peak-\ncalling at the 72-hour time point when both early appear-\ning and late appearing peaks were readily detected. The\nnumber of reads in each of these peak regions was re-\ncorded and normalized over the total mapped reads for\neach ChIP-Seq library. The relative H3.3 enrichment of\neach peak was calculated by normalizing the normalized\nreads in the peak over the normalized reads in input. A\nlinear regression model was used to calculate turnover\nindices (TI) for each individual peak. Assuming that en-\nrichment of H3.3 at 0 hour is E0, then Et = TI × t + E0,\nwhere Et equals H3.3 enrichment at each time point (E1,\nE2, E3,…En), t = time point (1, 2, 3,…n). For peaks that\nreached their maximum enrichment before the end time\npoint of analysis (t = 72 h), multiple linear regression co-\nefficients were calculated by fitting the end time points\nfrom time point of maximum enrichment to 72 h and\nt was adjusted correspondingly. We adopted the regression\ncoefficient with the best fit (smallest P-value) as the\nturnover index of the peaks. The turnover index was\nscaled from 0 and 1 in order to compare the reproduci-\nbility between duplicate experiments.\n\nAccession numbers\nOur ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data sets have been deposited\nin the Gene Expression Omnibus data base with accession\nnumber GSE51505.\n\nAdditional file\n\nAdditional file 1: Figure S1. Fast turnover of enhancer H3.3\nnucleosomes are associated with higher active histone modification and\nlower repressive modification. The H3.3-containing nucleosomes at\nenhancers were separated into two groups (fast turnover and slow\nturnover) based on the distribution of turnover indices in Figure 4G. The\nhistone modification levels of the two groups are displayed and\ncompared using box plots.\n\nAbbreviations\nBP: Base pair; ChIP: Chromatin immunoprecipitation; DOX: Doxycycline;\nESC: Embryonic stem cell; HA: Hemagglutinin; MEF: Mouse embryonic\nfibroblast; Pol: Polymerase; RPKM: Reads per kilobase of exon model per\nmillion reads; TES: Transcription end site; TET: Tetracycline; TSS: Transcription\nstart site; UTR: Untranslated region.\n\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\n\nAuthors’ contributions\nDK participated in the design of the study, carried out experiments and\ndrafted the manuscript.
