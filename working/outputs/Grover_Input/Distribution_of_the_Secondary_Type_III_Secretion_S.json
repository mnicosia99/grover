This locus was designated ETT2 (E. coli type III secretion 2) and\nconsisted of the epr, epa, and eiv genes. ETT2 was found in enteropathogenic E. coli strains and also in some\nnon-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains, but most of them contained a truncated portion of\nETT2. Most O157 isolates had a complete collection of toxin-encoding genes eae and hlyA and the ETT2 locus,\nwhile most O26 strains had toxin-encoding genes eae and hlyA genes but an incomplete ETT2 locus. Thus, an\nintact copy of ETT2 might mark a pathogenic distinction for particular STEC strains. Therefore, the presence\nof the ETT2 locus can be used for identification of truly pathogenic STEC strains and for molecular finger-\nprinting of the epidemic strains in humans and animals.\n\nEnterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Shiga tox-\nin-producing E. coli (STEC) are the most common causes of\nhemorrhagic colitis, bloody diarrhea, and hemolytic-uremic\nsyndrome and also cause food-borne epidemics in humans\n(19). STEC is distributed widely in the environment (1, 2). It\nproduces cytotoxin as the main virulence factor but can have a\nhistopathologic effect on intestinal epithelial cells, causing at-\ntaching-and-effacing (A/E) lesions. Enteropathogenic E. coli\n(EPEC), which is a major cause of infant diarrhea in develop-\ning countries, has the same ability to cause A/E lesions. These\nlesions are characterized by localized destruction of brush bor-\nder microvilli, intimate attachment of the organism to the host\ncell membrane, and formation of an actin-rich underlying\nstructure in the host cells (5). All genes necessary for the\nformation of A/E lesions are located in a pathogenicity island\ntermed the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE) (18). This\nlocus contains genes for structural components of a secretion\napparatus that belongs to the type III secretion system, that is,\ngenes for the adhesin intimin and its translocated receptor, Tir\n(7).\n\nThe type III secretion system, which is found in many gram-\nnegative pathogens, is responsible for secretion and injection\nof virulence-associated factors into the cytosol of host cells.\nThe type III apparatus comprises approximately 20 proteins,\nwith most of them located in the inner membrane (6, 24). Most\ninner membrane proteins are homologous to components of\n\nthe flagellar biosynthesis apparatuses of both gram-negative\nand gram-positive bacteria (10). In Salmonella enterica serovar\nTyphimurium, two independent type III secretion systems en-\ncoded by separate chromosomal loci, SPI-1 and SPI-2, have\nbeen found (8, 22). SPI-1 is required for the invasion of mam-\nmalian cells, and SPI-2 is required for replication in macro-\nphages and for survival in mice.\n\nThe release of the complete genome sequence of EHEC\nO157:H7 (9) provided us with an opportunity to identify se-\nquences specific for STEC strains. In this study, we report on\na type III secretion locus in the STEC chromosome similar to\nthe SPI-1 system. To estimate the roles of this locus in viru-\nlence expression in STEC, we show the distribution of this\nnovel locus among various STEC strains, and we also discuss\nthe transmission of STEC from animals to humans.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial strains and media. Table 1 lists all STEC strains used in the study.\nEHEC O157:H7 strain RIMD 0509952 (referred to here as EHEC O157 Sakai)\nwas originally isolated from a patient in an outbreak in Sakai, Japan, in 1996 (14).\nFour EPEC isolates from humans were used in this study: B171-8 (O111:NM,\nwhere NM indicates nonmotile) (20), E2348/69 (O127:H7), 4394-57 (O114:NM),\nand 1929-55(O126:NM). Some STEC strains were isolated from deer (1), sheep\n(2), seagulls (2), houseflies (11), and salmon roe (15). Other STEC and EPEC\nstrains are the stock isolates in our laboratory. Bacteria were cultured in Tryp-\nticase soy broth (BBL/Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md.) or on Trypticase soy\nagar (BBL/Becton Dickinson).\n\nSouthern hybridization. Chromosomal DNA was extracted from EHEC,\nEPEC, and E. coli K-12 strains as described previously (17) and digested with\nEcoRI. The DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose\ngels and were transferred to Hybond-N� positively charged nylon membranes\n(Amersham, Little Chalfont, England). DNA fragments corresponding to three\nseparate regions in ETT2 of EHEC O157:H7 (region A, eprH-eprK; region B,\n\n* Corresponding author.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\nRESULTS\n\nStructure of a new locus that encodes a second type III\nsecretion system. Based on the DNA sequence of the EHEC\nO157 Sakai chromosome, we searched for a DNA sequence\nunique to EHEC O157 which was not present in the E. coli\nK-12 genome. One such sequence consisted of a 17-kb region\ninserted between the sequences homologous to those at min 64\nand 65 of the E. coli K-12 chromosome (Fig. 1). The 17-kb\n\ninsert showed no significant homology with the E. coli K-12\nchromosome and contained 21 open reading frames (ORFs)\n(Table 4; Fig. 1). The G�C content of this region was 36.9%.\n\nThe deduced amino acid sequences of ORF2 to ORF5 and\nORF7 to ORF20 were similar to those of proteins of the type\nIII secretion system, which are required for the export of vir-\nulence determinants in a variety of bacterial pathogens of\nplants and animals. The predicted proteins of ORF2 to ORF5\nare similar in organization and sequences to the products of\nthe prgH to prgK genes of Salmonella SPI-1. The predicted\nproteins of ORF7 to ORF20 are similar in organization and\nsequences to the products of the inv and spa genes of Salmo-\nnella SPI-1 but not to those of invB. They are also homologous\nto the mxi genes of Shigella flexneri (data not shown). For\nexample, the predicted amino acid sequence of ORF2 is 53%\nidentical to that of PrgK of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium\nand 44% identical to that of MxiJ of S. flexneri 2a. The amino\nacid sequences of ORF3 to ORF5 are similar to those of PrgJ\n(31% identical), PrgI (64%), and PrgH (31%), respectively, of\nS. enterica serovar Typhimurium and to those of MxiI (32%),\nMxiH (58%), and MxiG (25%), respectively, of S. flexneri 2a.\nThe entire organization and amino acid sequences of the\nORFs in this 17-kb region are closely related to those of SPI-1\nof S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (Fig. 1). In addition to\nthese ORFs, the predicted protein of ORF1, which is located\ndownstream of ORF2 and extends to the homologous se-\nquence in E. coli K-12, showed significant similarity to the\n\nTABLE 2.

J. CLIN. MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\nORF5 showed a high degree of similarity to that of the se-\nquence upstream of the prgH gene in S. enterica serovar Ty-\nphimurium. Because of the high degree of similarity of each\nORF to the genes in SPI-1 of Salmonella spp., the region from\nORF5 to ORF2 was designated eprH to eprK, the region from\nORF12 to ORF7 was designated epaO to epaS, and the region\nfrom ORF19 to ORF13 was designated eivF to eivJ (Fig. 1).\n\nIn SPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the DNA be-\ntween spaS and prgH encodes secreted proteins, chaperones,\nand transcriptional regulatory proteins; but the region between\nepaS and eprH of EHEC O157 Sakai contains no ORF similar\nto these genes. Instead, ORF6 had a low, but significant degree\nof similarity to several transcriptional regulatory proteins, in-\ncluding NtrC of Herbaspirillum seropedicae (25% identity and\n40% similarity in a 107-amino-acid overlap) and UhpA of S.\nenterica serovar Typhimurium (29% identity and 49% similar-\nity in a 68-amino-acid overlap). Consequently, the 17-kb region\nencodes the complete set of proteins for the type III secretion\nsystem apparatus but does not include the target or chaperone\nproteins. This locus contains a set of genes for the type III\nsecretion system. Therefore, to distinguish this locus from a set\nof genes for type III secretion in LEE, we designated this locus\nETT2, for E. coli type III secretion locus 2.\n\nConservation of ETT2 sequences among STEC strains. To\nexamine the degree of conservation of the ETT2 sequence\namong pathogenic E. coli isolates from humans, Southern hy-\nbridization was performed with probes derived from the DNA\ncorresponding to eprH to eprK (probe A in Fig. 1; Table 2), epaO\nto epaS (probe B), and eivF to eivA (probe C). All seven EHEC\nO157 strains had DNA sequences homologous to the sequence\nof the ETT2 locus (Table 5). However, EHEC O26 strains from\nhumans contained DNA sequences homologous to probes A\nand B, but not to probe C (Table 5). The same pattern of hy-\nbridization observed with O26 was observed with four EPEC\nstrains, but the DNA sequence that hybridized with ETT2-\nspecific probes was not found in nonpathogenic strain E. coli\nHB101. To survey the distribution of the ETT2 locus among\nvarious STEC isolates, a PCR was performed by using three\nprimer sets specific for regions L, C, and D in the ETT2 locus\n(Fig. 1; Table 2). It was found that the results of the PCR co-\nincided with those of Southern hybridization (Tables 1 and 5).\n\nThus, a PCR survey was undertaken to determine the dis-\ntribution of the ETT2 locus among 56 STEC isolates of various\norigins (Table 1). Sixteen STEC isolates had a complete ETT2\nlocus of L, D, and C regions (Table 1); 15 isolates were sero-\ntype O157, and one isolate, from a deer, was Out:H25 (where\nOut represents all O antiserum negative). Although four\nEPEC isolates and two O26 isolates had only an L region,\naccording to PCR (Table 5), eight other STEC isolates were\nalso of this type (Table 1): four were O26 and four were O119\nONT:H� (where ONT means some O antiserum positive but\nnot identified), O153:H�, and Out:H�. Eight STEC strains,\nincluding five O157 strains, had a complete L region and either\na C region or a D region. However, among these eight strains,\nSTEC HI-7 and HI-N had complete L and C regions and a D\nregion with a short insertion (Table 1). Six other STEC strains\nhad complete L and D regions but no C region (Table 1). The\nETT2 locus was identified in O157 Sakai, and all O157 isolates\nof human origin had a complete ETT2 locus. Each of the O157\nstrains originating from a housefly, salmon roe, and six cattle\nalso had a complete ETT2 locus (Table 1; Fig. 2). However,\n\nFIG. 2.

In the present\nstudy, the eae gene was classified by PCR and production of\nintimin was determined by Western blotting analysis with anti-\nintimin antibody. O157 STEC isolates commonly had eae-� and\nproduced intimin, regardless of their origins (Table 1; Fig. 3).\nIn addition, all O157 STEC isolates except MB1, of cattle ori-\ngin, had the hlyA gene. Among the other serotypes tested, O119\nand O26 isolates commonly had the eae-� gene and produced\nintimin (Table 1; Fig. 3). Among them, eight isolates had the\nhlyA gene; among them, five isolates had the complete L re-\ngion, eae, and hlyA. Most other STEC isolates had no eae gene\nand did not produce intimin (Table 1). STEC strains isolated\nfrom seagulls, deer, and sheep belonged to this group (Table\n1).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA secondary type III secretion system, which was designated\nETT2 (E. coli type III secretion system 2), was found in EHEC\nserotype O157:H7 isolates, in addition to the first system en-\ncoded by the LEE locus. This ETT2 locus contains 19 ORFs\nhighly homologous with the SPI-1 type III secretion system of\nS. enterica serovar Typhimurium; the organization of those\nORFs was also similar to that of SPI-1. However, slight differ-\nences from SPI-1 were found: (i) SpaR was separated into two\nORFs, epaR1 and epaR2, in the ETT2 locus, and (ii) InvB and\nInvH were absent from the ETT2 locus (Table 1). In the\nSalmonella SPI-1 system, InvH is necessary for localization of\nInvG onto the outer membrane, but it is not a component of\nthe type III secretion apparatus (4), while the function of InvB\nremains unknown (6). Therefore, the ETT2 locus seems to\nencode a complete set of the type III secretion machinery.\nIndeed, the complete cloned sequence of ETT2 confers upon\nE. coli K-12 strain DH5-� the ability to secrete the EspB\nprotein (T. Tobe, unpublished data).\n\nIn SPI-1, genes coding secreted (effector) proteins such as\nsipBCDA, the chaperon sicP, and the regulator hilA were found\nin the region between the spa and prg operons. Instead of these\ngenes, ORF6, which had 40% similarity to the NtrC transcrip-\ntional regulator (23) of H. seropedicae, was found in ETT2\n(Fig. 1), consistent with the ORF6 product also being a tran-\nscriptional regulator. Genes encoding target secreted proteins\n\nof the ETT2 locus may exist elsewhere on the O157 chromo-\nsome, but we could not identify them. However, a search for\nother sequences unique to O157 would provide the informa-\ntion needed to identify those genes.\n\nIn EPEC and O26 strains, the ETT2 locus was found on the\nchromosome, but the chromosomes of EHEC O157 strains\ncontained only half of the ETT2 locus. Therefore, the ETT2\nDNA segment of EPEC B171-8 (O111:NM) was isolated and\nits DNA sequence was determined (GenBank accession no.\nAB052736); it was also inserted at min 64.5 of the E. coli K-12\nchromosome and was highly homologous with the L region of\nthe ETT2 sequence in EHEC O157 Sakai (Fig. 1). The se-\nquence corresponding to the eiv genes was absent from the\nETT2 loci in EPEC and EHEC O26 strains (Fig. 1). All human\nSTEC isolates had a complete or partial ETT2 locus, and\nnotably, all O157 isolates had a complete ETT2 locus. Inter-\nestingly, those STEC and EPEC strains commonly had the L\nregion with the epr and epa genes, suggesting that the ETT2\nlocus, especially the L-region locus, might be essential for the\npathogenicity of O157 STEC isolates, as might the other\nknown virulence factors encoded by the eae and hlyA genes.\nAlthough the association of the ETT2 locus with virulence in\nSTEC was not clear, the pathogenicity of STEC might be\nestimated by PCR with the primer sets described in this study.\nFor example, although non-O157 STEC strain S-8 had the\ncomplete ETT2 locus but not stx, eae, and hlyA, it might be\npathogenic for humans. As O26 STEC strains AS1 and AS15\nwere isolated from humans, only the L region might be essen-\ntial for pathogenicity. In this sense, strains KR1, H8-55, and\nIK2 from cattle would be virulent strains. Also, O157 strains\nlacking only the C region from five cattle also would be virulent\nfor humans. As an hlyA gene associated with pathogenicity was\nencoded by a large plasmid, this gene would easily be lost.\nTherefore, as the hlyA gene would not be a good marker for\nthe estimation of virulence (21), O157 strains MB1, H5-26, and\nH8-87 might have originally been virulent. Finally, cattle\nshould be one of the main sources of infection for the trans-\nmission of STEC to humans. In this study, O157 isolates from\na fly and salmon roe were closely similar to O157 isolates of\nhuman origin. However, as the salmon roe was the food that\ncaused the O157 outbreak in Japan (15) and the fly was caught\non cow manure on a cattle farm (11), these results were not\nunexpected.\n\nThe G�C content of the ETT2 sequence was very low\n(36.9%) compared with that of the E. coli chromosome\n(50.8%) (3), suggesting that the ETT2 locus has been acquired\nlaterally. Furthermore, the high degree of similarity of ETT2 to\n\nFIG. 3. Western blotting analysis of intimin proteins from different STEC isolates.

MICROBIOL.\n\n\n\nSPI-1 of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium suggests that ETT2\nand SPI-1 may have originated from the same organism. How-\never, the biological function of the ETT2 locus in the patho-\ngenicity of STEC is not clear. The ETT2 locus might partici-\npate in the pathogenicity of these bacteria in a manner other\nthan adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. Finally, as the\nETT2 locus is common in human STEC isolates, it would be a\ngood marker for molecular epidemiological surveys of STEC\nstrains pathogenic for humans.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Ben Adler for critical suggestions on the manuscript.\nThis work was supported in part by grants from the Ministry of\n\nHealth, Labour and Welfare (Research on Emerging and Re-Emerg-\ning Infectious Diseases), by a Grant-in Aid for Scientific Research from\nthe Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (grant 12575029),\nand by a grant from The 21st Century COE Program (A-1), Ministry\nof Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
