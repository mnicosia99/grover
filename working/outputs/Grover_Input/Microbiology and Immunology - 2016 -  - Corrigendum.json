However, unexpected rectangular patterns observed in the background of this panel.\nTherefore, the authors drawn a boundary and separated the figure. A clearer Figure 1 is presented below.\n\nMicrobiol Immunol 2016; 60: 132–133\ndoi: 10.1111/1348-0421.12351\n\n132 © 2015 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd\n\n\n\nAlso, several lanes of theWestern blots in Figure 2, C lane of C3716 and C lane of V1771 were incorrectly presented.\n\nThe correct lanes were replaced and the correct figure is now shown below. In addition, each lane was not always the\nsame gel sample. The authors have lined up and compiled the lanes that showed good band.\n\nThe authors apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\n\n.\n\nCorrigendum\n\n© 2015 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd 133\n\n\n'}
