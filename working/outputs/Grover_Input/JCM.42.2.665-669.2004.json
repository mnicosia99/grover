In the absence of radiologically visible mycetoma, the cause of hemoptysis in these two\ngroups of patients is largely unknown. A 17-month prospective study was carried out to compare the prevalence\nof Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus antibodies in hemoptysis patients with old tuberculosis or\nbronchiectasis but no radiologically visible mycetoma (cases, n � 38), hemoptysis patients with other diagnosis\n(control group 1, n � 29), and patients with old tuberculosis or bronchiectasis but no hemoptysis (control\ngroup 2, n � 47) by a recently developed sensitive and specific A. fumigatus and A. flavus antibody assay. There\nwere a significantly larger number of patients with antibody against A. fumigatus or A. flavus among the cases\nthan among the patients in control groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.05 in both comparisons). Molds were not recovered\nfrom any of the patients. Among the 10 cases with Aspergillus antibody, eight and two had antibody against A. flavus\nand A. fumigatus, respectively. We conclude that there was an association between the presence of Aspergillus\nantibodies and hemoptysis in patients with old tuberculosis or bronchiectasis, suggesting that these patients\nprobably had occult infections caused by the corresponding fungi. Development of serological tests against other\nAspergillus species as well as other causes of mycetoma will probably increase the detection of occult mold infections\nin patients with existing parenchymal lung diseases, and treatment of fungal microinvasion may help to alleviate\nhemoptysis in these patients with bronchiectasis or old tuberculosis who have Aspergillus antibodies.\n\nHemoptysis is one of the frequent complications in patients\nwith old tuberculosis or bronchiectasis. It is well known that\nmolds will colonize and proliferate in the lung parenchymal\ncavities of patients with old tuberculosis, leading to mycetoma\nformation. Fungal species that have been implicated as caus-\native agents of mycetoma include Aspergillus species, Pseudall-\nescheria boydii, Coccidioides species, Penicillium species, Cla-\ndosporium cladosporioides, and Schizophyllum commune, of\nwhich the most common are Aspergillus species (4, 9, 11, 13–15,\n20). The true incidence of aspergillous mycetoma, or aspergil-\nloma, is unknown, but it has been estimated that it occurs in 11\nto 17% of patients with tuberculous cavities (1). The most\nfrequent symptom associated with mycetoma is hemoptysis,\nwhich occurs in about 74% of these patients, and the hemop-\ntysis may occasionally be massive and life-threatening. How-\never, the causes of hemoptysis in most cases of hemoptysis\ncomplicating old tuberculosis without mycetoma formation are\nstill unknown. As for bronchiectasis, although bronchial artery\nproliferation has been shown to be associated with hemoptysis,\nthe role of molds in causing hemoptysis in these patients is\nlargely unknown (12).\n\nRecently, we cloned the AFMP1 and AFLMP1 genes, which\nencode the first antigenic cell wall secretory galactomannopro-\nteins Afmp1p and Aflmp1p, respectively, in Aspergillus fumiga-\n\ntus and Aspergillus flavus, respectively (18, 21). Furthermore,\nwe have shown that serological assays with recombinant Afmp1p\nare sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of aspergilloma (3,\n17). Clinical evaluation revealed that the assay was 100% sen-\nsitive for patients with aspergilloma caused by A. fumigatus,\nand no false-positive results were found for serum samples\nfrom 80 healthy blood donors, six patients with typhoid fever,\nfour patients with melioidosis, 20 patients with penicilliosis\nmarneffei, five patients with candidiasis, and four patients with\ncryptococcosis, indicating a high specificity of the test.\n\nIn this study, with the help of these antibody assays and mold\ncultures of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, we compared\nthe prevalence of A. fumigatus and A. flavus antibodies in pa-\ntients with hemoptysis complicating old tuberculosis or bron-\nchiectasis but no radiologically apparent mycetoma formation\non high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, those\nwith hemoptysis due to other causes, and those with old tuber-\nculosis or bronchiectasis but without hemoptysis. The role of\nmolds in causing occult microinvasion and hemoptysis in pa-\ntients with existing structural abnormalities of the lung paren-\nchyma is also discussed.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nPatients, study design, and inclusion criteria. The study protocol was reviewed\nand approved by the Hospital Ethics Committee. Patients presenting to the\nDepartment of Medicine & Geriatrics of the United Christian Hospital in Hong\nKong with hemoptysis as the predominant symptom in a 17-month period (June\n2001 to October 2002) were recruited to the study. Clinical details were recorded\non a standard form. Complete blood counts, liver and renal function tests, and\ncoagulation studies were performed.

Sputum specimens were collected for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial\ncultures and cytological examination for malignant cells. Chest radiographs were\ntaken and examined by a thoracic radiologist. Patients who had an obvious\ndiagnosis at this stage (e.g., active tuberculosis) without further need for bron-\nchoscopy and HRCT of the thorax were excluded from the study.\n\nAll patients finally included in the study were subject to fiber optic broncho-\nscopic examination and HRCT of the thorax. Bronchial washes were obtained\nfrom the segment corresponding to the abnormal areas on radiographs and were\nsent for bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures. Bronchial and transbron-\nchial biopsy specimens were obtained as appropriate. HRCT of the thorax was\nexamined by a thoracic radiologist, and the presence of bronchiectasis and\nlesions suggestive of mycetoma were noted. Blood was collected for A. fumigatus\nand A. flavus antibody detection.\n\nThe final diagnosis was reached after analysis of the clinical, laboratory, and\nradiological findings. Patients with a final diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary\naspergillosis and mycetoma were excluded from the final statistical analysis.\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is defined by a history of asthma, cir-\nculating blood eosinophilia of more than 1,000 eosinophils/ml, immediate cuta-\nneous reactivity to Aspergillus skin test antigen, precipitating antibodies against\nAspergillus antigen, elevated total serum immunoglobulin E concentration, history of\nrecurrent pulmonary infiltrates, and central bronchiectasis. Mycetoma is defined by\nthe presence of a mobile mass within an existing cavity (air crescent sign) on HRCT,\nwith or without culture of mold from respiratory tract specimens.\n\nThe patients with a final diagnosis of hemoptysis complicating bronchiectasis\nor old tuberculosis were considered cases, and those with any other diagnosis for\ntheir hemoptysis were considered controls (control group 1). A case of old\ntuberculosis was defined by a history of tuberculosis with a documented completed\ncourse of antituberculous treatment and a documented bacteriological cure and/or\na chest radiograph or HRCT of the thorax showing fibrocalcified or cavitary lesions\nthat had been stable over time. A case of bronchiectasis was defined by compatible\nclinical features with HRCT showing bronchial dilation, bronchial wall thickening,\nlack of normal bronchial tapering, or air-fluid levels in distended bronchi.\n\nDuring the same study period, another group of patients followed up in the\nsame department for old tuberculosis or bronchiectasis but without a history of\nhemoptysis were also recruited (control group 2). Blood was collected for A.\nfumigatus and A. flavus antibody detection, but bronchoscopic examinations were\nnot performed with these patients as they did not have hemoptysis.\n\nDetection of antibody against A. fumigatus and A. flavus. Detection of antibody\nagainst Afmp1p of A. fumigatus and Aflmp1p of A. flavus was performed by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), with positive results confirmed\nby Western blot assay (3, 17, 18). For the ELISA, each well of an immunoplate\n(Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) was coated with 0.5 ng of purified glutathione\nS-transferase (GST)-Afmp1p or GST-Aflmp1p protein for 12 h and then blocked\nin phosphate-buffered saline with 2% bovine serum albumin. One hundred\nmicroliters of patient serum at 1:3,000 dilution was added to the wells of the\nrecombinant protein-coated plates in a total volume of 100 �l and incubated at\n37°C for 2 h. After washing with washing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline with\n2% bovine serum albumin) three times, 100 �l of 1:10,000-diluted horseradish\nperoxidase-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Zymed, S. San Francisco,\nCalif.) was added to the wells and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. After washing\nwith washing buffer three times, 100 �l of 3,3�,5,5�-tetramethylbenzidine single\nsolution (Zymed) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature for\n15 min. One hundred microliters of 0.3 M H2SO4 was added, and the absorbance\nat 405 nm of each well was measured. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and\nthe mean absorbance for each serum was calculated.\n\nFor the Western blot assays, recombinant Afmp1p and Aflmp1p samples were\nrun on sodium dodecyl sulfate–10% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto\nnitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). The blots were cut into\nstrips and the strips were incubated with patient sera diluted 1:500. Antigen-\nantibody interaction was detected with the ECL fluorescence kit (Amersham\nLife Science, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom).\n\nStatistical analysis. Comparison was made between the characteristics of cases\nand those of control groups 1 and 2. Comparisons of continuous variables were\nperformed with a one-way analysis of variance test, and post hoc analyses were\nperformed with Bonferroni’s correction. A Mann-Whitney test and chi-square test\nwere used for nonparametric and categorical variables, respectively. Comparison\nwas also made between the characteristics of cases positive for antibody and those\nnegative for antibody against A. fumigatus or A. flavus. A P of �0.05 was considered\nstatistically significant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nA total of 125 patients were recruited into the study. One\npatient had allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and 10\nhad mycetoma and were therefore excluded, leaving 114 pa-\ntients in the final analysis (mean age � 63.5 years, male/female\nratio � 82:32). Thirty-eight patients (33.3%) were cases, with 9\n(7.9%) and 29 (25.4%) having final diagnoses of old tubercu-\nlosis and bronchiectasis, respectively. Twenty-nine patients\n(25.4%) were in control group 1, with the breakdown of their\ndiagnoses depicted in Table 1. Forty-seven patients (41.2%)\nwere in control group 2, with 17 (14.9%) bronchiectasis and 30\n(26.3%) old tuberculosis diagnoses.\n\nA comparison of the characteristics of patients with hemop-\ntysis who had bronchiectasis or old tuberculous cavities (cases)\nand the two control groups is shown in Table 2. Cases had\nsignificantly larger number of patients with histories of hemop-\ntysis, significantly larger hemoptysis blood volume, significantly\nlarger number of patients with positive bacterial growth in\ntheir bronchial washing specimens, and significantly larger\nnumber of patients with antibody against A. fumigatus or A. fla-\nvus than patients in control group 1 (P � 0.05 in all four com-\nparisons). Furthermore, cases also had a significantly larger\nnumber of patients with antibody against A. fumigatus or A.\nflavus than patients in control group 2 (P � 0.05). Molds were\nrecovered from none of the patients.\n\nSince positive bacterial growth could be a confounding fac-\ntor in the statistical analysis, further analysis was performed\nafter removal of data for cases and controls with positive bac-\nterial growth in their bronchial washing specimens (14 from\ncases and 4 from control group 1). In this subset analysis, 8 out\nof the 24 patients in the cases but only 1 out of the 25 patients\nin control group 1 had antibody against A. fumigatus or A.\nflavus (P � 0.01), indicating that the presence of Aspergillus\nantibodies is independently associated with bronchiectasis or\nold tuberculosis in patients with hemoptysis.\n\nThe characteristics of patients with hemoptysis who had\nbronchiectasis or old tuberculous cavities (cases) positive for\nantibodies against A. fumigatus or A. flavus are shown in Table\n3. The median age was 64.5 years (range, 46 to 78 years). The\nmale/female ratio was 6:4. The median number of hemoptysis\nepisodes in the past was one (range, 0 to 6). The median\n\nTABLE 1.

Since one of the most important causes of bronchiectasis in\nour locality is old tuberculosis, it is often difficult to distinguish\nbetween the two categories, and there is significant overlap\nbetween the two groups of patients. In this study, we demon-\nstrated that the prevalence of A. fumigatus and A. flavus anti-\nbodies in patients presenting with hemoptysis who had old\ntuberculosis or bronchiectasis without radiologically visible\nmycetoma formation was significantly higher than those with\nhemoptysis due to other causes. Because of the possibility that\nthe difference was due just to the association of Aspergillus\ninfections with old tuberculosis and bronchiectasis but was not\nrelated to hemoptysis, another group of controls, patients with\nold tuberculosis or bronchiectasis without hemoptysis (control\ngroup 2), was selected. It was also demonstrated that the pres-\nence of Aspergillus antibodies in patients with old tuberculosis\nor bronchiectasis with hemoptysis was significantly higher than\nin those without hemoptysis, indicating that the presence of\nAspergillus antibodies was associated with hemoptysis in pa-\ntients with old tuberculosis or bronchiectasis.\n\nAs for fungal culture, despite the presence of antibodies,\nAspergillus species were not recovered from any of the respi-\nratory tract specimens collected from the patients. In fact,\namong the 10 patients with mycetoma that we excluded from\nthe study, only three had positive mold cultures, one with A.\nfumigatus and two with A. flavus. This is in line with the low\nrate of positive culture of only about 40% in patients with\n\nmycetoma reported in another study (10). Due to the very\nsmall lesions of less than 5 mm that were not detected by\ncomputed tomography scans, a very small amount of fungal\nshedding, and the possibility of the presence of cells in a viable\nbut nonculturable state, it is not surprising that none of the\ncases yielded positive mold culture results.\n\nWe speculate that Aspergillus species causes hemoptysis in\npatients with old tuberculosis or bronchiectasis without myce-\ntoma formation through microinvasion of the damaged respi-\nratory epithelium. It has been demonstrated that A. fumigatus\nsecretes fumagillin, a chemical that inhibits angiogenesis (7).\nSimilarly, Aspergillus clavatus secretes cytochalasin E, which is\na potent and selective inhibitor of capillary endothelial cell\nproliferation in an experimental model (16). On the other\nhand, it has been shown that in patients with aspergillomas, the\nlevels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in serum\nwere raised, and the level was related to the area of lung\ninvolvement, PaO2 level, and the presence of hemoptysis (8).\nFurthermore, the expression of VEGF was high in alveolar\nmacrophages in the lesion of aspergillomas, and VEGF expres-\nsion in macrophages was induced by hypoxia and lactate and its\nexpression promoted angiogenesis and increased vascular per-\nmeability (5, 19).\n\nWe speculate that the immediate surrounding of an aspergil-\nloma is rendered ischemic by substances like fumagillin and\ncytochalasin E, enhancing necrosis and inflammation. Subse-\nquent recruitment of alveolar macrophages into this hypoxic\nenvironment induces the macrophage to express VEGF, which\nenhances angiogenesis around the aspergilloma. Thus, it is con-\n\nFIG. 1. Western blot analysis of purified Aflmp1p of A. flavus (A)\nand Afmp1p of A. fumigatus (B). The lane numbers correspond to the\npatient numbers in Table 3.

In the present study, the patients with con-\nfirmed diagnoses of bronchiectasis or old tuberculosis with\nAspergillus antibody tended to bleed significantly. The defini-\ntion of massive hemoptysis has ranged from 100 to 1,000 ml in\n24 h (6). If one takes 100 ml as the cutoff, 7 out of the 10\npatients with bronchiectasis or old tuberculosis and Aspergillus\nantibody had massive hemoptysis. This is also supported by the\nfact that the seropositive cases had significantly lower hemo-\nglobin levels, and they showed a trend to bleed more than the\nseronegative patients.\n\nIn Western countries, A. fumigatus is the most important\nAspergillus species that causes invasive aspergillosis and as-\npergilloma. On the other hand, A. flavus is the most common\none associated with human disease in our locality and in other\nAsian countries (2, 22). In our previous study, we demon-\nstrated that A. flavus is responsible for causing 38% whereas\nA. fumigatus is responsible for causing only 19% of invasive\nmold diseases in bone marrow transplant recipients. This is in\nline with the observation in the present study, in that 80% of\nthe seropositive patients had antibody against A. flavus, where-\nas only 20% of them had antibody against A. fumigatus. In fact,\nin the 10 patients with mycetoma diagnosed in the period of\nthe study, four of them were positive for A. flavus antibody, but\nonly two were positive for A. fumigatus antibody.\n\nDevelopment of serological tests against other Aspergillus\nspecies as well as other causes of mycetoma will probably\nincrease the detection of occult mold infections in patients with\npreexisting parenchymal lung diseases. We have demonstrated\nthat Aspergillus antibody assays are highly sensitive and specific\nfor the diagnosis of aspergilloma. However, only 6 of the 10\npatients with mycetoma diagnosed in the period of the study\nhad antibody against A. fumigatus or A. flavus. Furthermore,\nwe have also demonstrated that 28% of the invasive mold dis-\neases in our bone marrow transplant recipients were caused by\nAspergillus species other than A. fumigatus and A. flavus (22). It\nis therefore logical to assume that the remaining four patients\nwith mycetoma were infected by Aspergillus species other than\nA. fumigatus or A. flavus or other molds such as P. boydii and\nPenicillium species (4, 9, 11, 13-15, 20). We speculate that\nabout six to seven out of the 37 patients with bronchiectasis or\nold tuberculosis should be positive for antibody against other\nAspergillus species or other molds.\n\nTreatment of fungal microinvasion may help to alleviate the\nhemoptysis in these patients with bronchiectasis or old tuber-\nculosis who had Aspergillus antibody. Massive hemoptysis in\npatients with bronchiectasis or old tuberculosis can be life-\nthreatening and is a condition dreaded by patients and clini-\ncians alike. Due to their marginal respiratory functions, these\npatients are often poor surgical candidates for resection of the\ndiseased lung segments affected by bronchiectasis and inactive\ntuberculosis. Bronchial arterial embolization may afford palli-\nation in some patients, but new collateral formation and re-\nbleeding may occur in the long run (6). As mold microinvasion\nmay be the cause of hemoptysis in these patients, further stud-\nies with antifungal therapy may open up a new avenue of\n\ntreatment for some of these patients with hemoptysis compli-\ncating bronchiectasis or old tuberculosis.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was partly supported by Research Grant Council grant\nHKU 7388/00 M, AIDS Trust Fund (MSS 083), University Develop-\nment Fund, and Committee of Research and Conference Grant, Uni-\nversity of Hong Kong.\n\nWe thank King-man Chan and Andy S.
