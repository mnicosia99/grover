In\n\ntissue arrays of RMS tumor cores from 71 patients, 80% of RMS patients expressed high levels of Sp1 protein, whereas low\n\nexpression of Sp1 was detected in normal muscle tissue. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) tolfenamic acid (TA)\n\ninhibited growth and migration of RD and RH30 RMS cell lines and also inhibited tumor growth in vivo using a mouse xenograft\n\n(RH30 cells) model. The effects of TA were accompanied by downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes in RMS\n\ncells and tumors, and the role of Sp protein downregulation in mediating inhibition of RD and RH30 cell growth and migration\n\nwas confirmed by individual and combined knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins by RNA interference. TA treatment and Sp\n\nknockdown in RD and RH30 cells also showed that four genes that are emerging as individual drug targets for treating RMS,\n\nnamely c-MET, insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR), PDGFRa and CXCR4, are also Sp-regulated genes. These results\n\nsuggest that NSAIDs such as TA may have potential clinical efficacy in drug combinations for treating RMS patients.\n\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue\nsarcoma that is primarily observed in children and adoles-\ncents1 and accounts for approximately 5% of all pediatric\ncancers and 50% of soft-tissue sarcomas in children.2 The eti-\n\nology of this sporadic tumor is unclear; however, a few studies\nsuggest that parental occupations/exposure and the use of\nmarijuana and cocaine may increase the risk for RMS in off-\nspring.3,4 Embryonal RMS (ERMS) and alveolar RMS (ARMS)\nare the two major histologic classes of RMS in children and\nadolescents. Chromosomal analysis of these tumors has identi-\nfied two predominant translocations, namely t(2;13)(q35;q14)\nand t(1:13)(p36;q14), and these encode for the PAX3-FKHR\nand PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins, respectively.5,6 The fusion\nof PAX3 and PAX7 with the FOXO1 (Forkhead, FKHR) gene\nresults in expression of oncogenic chimeric gene products\nwhich in turn regulate expression of multiple genes contribut-\ning to the aggressive behavior of ARMS and the poor progno-\nsis of ARMS patients.7,8 The Children’s Oncology Group has\nreported that among a cohort of metastatic ARMS patients,\n55% expressed PAX3-FOXO1 and their overall 4-year survival\nrate was 8%; 22% of the patients expressed PAX7-FOXO1\nand their 4-year survival rate was 75%.9\n\nSeveral protocols for treatment of RMS have been developed\nand, in North America, these are dependent on criteria estab-\nlished by the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group\nwhich has developed clinical groupings for RMS patients.10,11\n\nTreatments include radiotherapy, surgery and chemotherapy\nwith cytotoxic drugs and/or drug combinations. Survival rates\nvary with the type (ARMS and ERMS) of RMS, and high risk\npatients with metastasis or recurrence have a poor prognosis.12\n\nImproved survival for RMS patients will depend on multiple fac-\ntors including the development and application of new mecha-\nnism-based drugs that target specific pro-oncogenic pathways\nbut exhibit tumor cell-specificity and decreased toxic side effects.\n\nKey words: tolfenamic acid, Sp proteins, downregulation, RMS cells\n\nAbbreviations: ARMS: alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma; BA: betulinic\n\nacid; CDODA-Me: methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18b-olean-1,12-dien-\n\n30-oate; c-MET: hepatocyte growth factor receptor; EGFR: epidermal\n\ngrowth factor receptor; ERMS: embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma; FBS:\n\nfetal bovine serum; FGFR4: fibroblast growth factor receptor 4;\n\nHSMM: human skeletal muscle myoblast; IGFR: insulin-like growth\n\nfactor receptor; NAC: N-acetylcysteine; NSAID: non-steroidal anti-\n\ninflammatory drug; PI: propidium iodide; RMS: rhabdomyosarcoma;\n\nROS: reactive oxygen species; Sp: specificity protein; TA: tolfenamic\n\nacid; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor\n\nAdditional Supporting Information may be found in the online\n\nversion of this article\n\n*G.C. and I.J. contributed equally to this work.\n\nThis work is dedicated to Val and Savannah.\n\nGrant sponsor: National Institutes of Health; Grant number:\n\nR01CA136571; Grant sponsor: Texas A&M AgriLife\n\nDOI: 10.1002/ijc.27730\n\nHistory: Received 20 Sep 2011; Accepted 8 Jun 2012; Online 19 Jul\n\n2012\n\nCorrespondence to: Stephen Safe, Distinguished Professor of\n\nToxicology, Department of Veterinary Physiology and\n\nPharmacology, Texas A&M University, 4466 TAMU, Vet.

Since some Sp-regulated\ngenes such as c-MET and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4\n(FGFR4) play a functional role in RMS and are potential ther-\napeutic targets,25,26 we investigated the expression of Sp1 in\ntumors from RMS patients and Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 and Sp-re-\ngulated gene products in RMS cells. Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and several\nSp-regulated genes are highly expressed in RMS cells, and Sp1\nis overexpressed in tumors from 80% of RMS patients. TA\ninhibited RMS cell and tumor growth in a xenograft model\nand this was accompanied by decreased expression of Sp1,\nSp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes, suggesting potential clinical\nefficacy for this NSAID for treating RMS patients.\n\nMaterial and Methods\nCell lines, human tissues, antibodies, chemicals and\n\nother materials\n\nRH30 and RD human RMS cells were obtained from the\nAmerican Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); geneti-\ncally modified RMS cell extracts were obtained as\ndescribed.25,27 TA was purchased from LKT Laboratories (St.\nPaul, MN). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and catalase were pur-\nchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MA). Lipofectamine\nand lipofectamine 2000 were purchased from Invitrogen. Sur-\nvivin antibody was purchased from R&D Systems (Minneap-\nolis, MN), and monoclonal b-actin and c-MET antibodies\nwere purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and the FOX01 antibody\nfrom Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Horseradish peroxidase\nsubstrate for Western blot analysis, Sp1 and CXCR4 antibody\nwere obtained from Millipore (Bellirica, MA), and all remain-\ning antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnol-\nogy (Santa Cruz, CA). Luciferase reagent was from Promega\n(Madison, WI), and b-galactosidase reagent was obtained\nfrom Tropix (Carlsbad, CA). The Cooperative Human Tissue\nNetwork provided the tissue arrays for Sp1 staining. The con-\nstructs containing promoter inserts from the Sp1 (�751 to\n\n�20), Sp3 (�417 to �38), c-MET (�703 to þ60), survivin\n(�264 toþ49) and VEGF (�2018 to þ50) genes have previ-\nously been reported.16,19–24\n\nCell proliferation assays\n\nRH30 and RD RMS cells (3 � 104 per well) were plated\nusing DMEM:Ham’s F-12 medium containing 2.5% charcoal-\nstripped fetal bovine serum (FBS) in 12-well plates and left\nto attach for 24 hr. Cells were then treated with either vehicle\n(DMSO) or TA at given concentrations 6 IGF (100 ng/ml)\nand then counted at the indicated times using a Coulter Z1\nparticle counter. Each experiment was done in triplicate, and\nresults are expressed as means 6 SE for each determination.\n\nWestern blot assays and Annexin V staining\n\nRH30 and RD cells were seeded in DMEM:Ham’s F-12 me-\ndium containing 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS. After 12 hr,\ncells were treated with either vehicle (DMSO) or the indi-\ncated compounds for 24 hr and Western blot analysis was\nperformed essentially as described.22–24 Annexin V staining\nwas determined using the Vybrant apoptosis assay kit (Mo-\nlecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described.22–24\n\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting and transfection assays\n\nBoth RH30 and RD cancer cells were treated with either the\nvehicle (DMSO) and TA for indicated time periods. Cells\nwere analyzed on an Accuri C6 FACS calibur flow cytometer\nusing CellQuest acquisition software (Accuri, Ann Arbor,\nMI). Propidium iodide (PI) fluorescence was collected\nthrough a 585/42 nm band pass filter, and list mode data\nwere acquired on a minimum of 20,000 single cells defined\nby a dot plot of PI width versus PI area. Data analysis was\nperformed using Cflow software (Accuri). siRNAs, antisense-\nmiRs and expression plasmids were transfected into RD\nand RH30 cells using LipofectAMINE essentially as\ndescribed.18,19,22–24 DAP1 and PI staining were used and the\nresults showed minimal (<5%) PI positive cells.\n\nTranswell migration and scratch assays\n\nRH30 and RD cells were added to the upper chamber of a\ntranswell chamber in duplicate and allowed to migrate into\nthe lower chamber containing Hams F12 media with 20%\nFBS by incubating for 12 hr at 5% CO2 at 37\n\n�C. The cells\nwere then treated with control or TA for the indicated time\nperiods, and the cells migrating to the outer side of the upper\nchamber were fixed, stained and counted. The effects of TA\n\nWhat’s new?\n\nRhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a soft tissue cancer that primarily affects children and adolescents. RMS cells overproduce\n\nspecificity protein transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4. The NSAID tolfenamic acid (TA) downregulates Sp in other cancers.\n\nThe authors tested TA on RMS cells, both in cell culture and in mice, and showed that it effects a drop in Sp gene expression\n\nand slows the growth of the cancer cells. TA, which is less toxic than the treatments currently used for RMS, could thus\n\nprovide a better treatment for the disease.\n\nC\nan\n\nce\nr\nC\nel\nl\nB\nio\nlo\ngy\n\n796 Sp proteins are drug targets in RMS\n\nInt.

The scratch assay was carried out as described.20\n\nXenograft and immunohistochemistry experiments\n\nFemale athymic nude mice, age 4–6 weeks, were purchased\nfrom Harlan-Sprague Dawley. RH30 cells (2 � 106) in 1:1\nratio of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were\ninjected into the either side of the flank area of nude mice.\nSix days after the tumor cell inoculation, mice were divided\ninto two groups of eight animals each. The first group received\n100 ll vehicle (corn oil) by oral gavage, and the second group\nof animals received 50 mg/kg/dose oral gavage of TA in 2.5%\nDMSO and 97.5% corn oil every second day for 20 d. The\nmice were weighed, and tumor areas were measured through-\nout the study. After 20 d, the animals were sacrificed; final\nbody and tumor weights were determined and plotted. Tissues\nwere processed for immunohistochemistry and Western blot-\nting as described above.19,23,24 A pilot xenograft study using\nRD cells (three animals/group) was also carried out.\n\nHuman tissue microarray and grading\n\nSlides were deparaffinized by heating at 60�C for 30 min and\nimmediately transferred to xylene (Safeclear, Fisher, Pitts-\nburgh, PA). Sections were rehydrated by treating with graded\nethanol (100%, 95%, 70% and 35%) and then with PBS. Sec-\ntions were incubated with sodium citrate for antigen retrieval\nas per manufacturer’s protocol (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA)\nand endogenous peroxides were quenched using 0.3% H2O2\nin methanol for 6 min. Tissue sections were processed,\nmounted using permount (Fisher) and visualized using a Carl\nZeiss Axiovert microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) as\ndescribed.23,24 A total of 77 tissue array samples were ana-\nlyzed for positive Sp1 staining (brown) in the nucleus by four\nindependent investigators on three consecutive days. The\narray core consisted of normal and RMS tissues interspersed\nrandomly. A standard semiquantitative grading system (1–4)\nof Sp1 nuclear staining intensity was applied and graded as\nfollows: 1, presence of <5% of Sp1 nuclear staining; 2, pres-\nence of 15–50% of positive staining; 3, presence of 50–75% of\npositive cells; and 4, presence of >75% positive staining\nnuclei. This immunohistological grading method has been\nestablished as a semiquantitative means for antigen detection\nand quantitation.28 Percent staining and number of patient\nsamples were plotted on the Y- and X-axes, respectively.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical significance of differences was determined by\nANOVA and Student’s t test, and the levels of probability\nwere noted. All statistical tests were two sided.\n\nResults\nExpression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in RMS cells and\n\neffects of TA\n\nSp1, Sp3 and Sp4 are overexpressed in multiple cancer cell\nlines and tumors,13–18 and results in Figure 1a show that\n\nthese transcription factors are also highly expressed in RH30\n(ARMS) and RD (ERMS) cells. TA decreased expression of\nSp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in RH30 and RD cells (Fig. 1a) and similar\nresults were observed after treatment with the triterpenoids\nbetulinic acid (BA) or methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18-olean-\n1,12-dien-30-oate (CDODA-Me) (Supporting Information\nFig. 1). Moreover, we surveyed expression of Sp1, Sp3 and\nSp4 in several other RMS cell lines and high levels were also\nobserved in these cells (Supporting Information Fig. 2). Stable\ntransduction of primary human skeletal muscle myoblasts\n(HSMMs) with viral vectors expressing PAX-3-FOXO1\n(HSMMPF), PAX3-FOXO1 plus the catalytic subunit of telo-\nmerase (hTERT) (HSMMPFþH), and PAX3-FOXO1 plus\nhTERT plus NMyc (HSMMPFþHþM) yielded cell lines in\nwhich only the HSMMPFþHþM cells were tumorigenic in\nSCID/beige mice.27,29,30 Figure 1b shows that Sp4 protein was\nexpressed in HSMM cells and the genetically transfected cell\nlines, whereas Sp1 and Sp3 levels were relatively low in mus-\ncle myoblasts transfected with PAX3-FOXO1 and PAX3-\nFOXO1 plus hTERT and were dramatically increased in cells\ntransfected with all three genes. The genetic model for ERMS\nwas developed in HSMMs transduced with SV40 large-T\nand small-t oncoproteins (T/t), telomerase and activated\nH-RasG12V and expressed comparable levels of Sp1, Sp3 and\nSp4 were observed in all the genetic models (Fig. 1b), and\nthis was due to expression of SV40 which induces Sp1.31 Fig-\nure 1b also compares expression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 and c-\nMET and survivin expression in HSMM and HSMMPFþHþM\n\nand shows that Sp-regulated c-MET and survivin are more\nhighly expressed in the transformed cell line compared to\nHSMM cells. Previous studies in this laboratory show two\nseparable forms of Sp3 (110–115 and 70–80 kDa) in cancer\ncell lines13–23; the low molecular weight band contains two\nforms and these results are consistent with previous studies\non characterization of Sp3 isoforms.32,33\n\nSp1 expression in RMS patients\n\nThe Cooperative Human Tissue Network provided us with\ntissue arrays of RMS tumor cores from 71 patients and six\nnormal muscle tissues, and these were stained for Sp1 protein\nand initially sub-divided into four groups (1–4; increasing\nSp1 staining) based on their Sp1 staining intensity. Muscle\ncell staining for Sp1 was �2 (low) for all six normal samples;\nin contrast, 80% of the RMS samples exhibited high (�3)\nstaining for Sp1, whereas 20% exhibited low staining (�2)\n(Fig. 1c). Figure 1d illustrates the typical high Sp1 staining in\nARMS and ERMS tumors compared to muscle tissue, and\nmagnification of these images indicates that Sp1 is primarily\nnuclear in the tumor samples.\n\nTA inhibits RMS cell growth and migration\n\nand induces apoptosis\n\nFigure 2a shows that TA decreased proliferation of both\nRH30 and RD cells, and the former cell line was more respon-\nsive to the growth inhibitory effects of TA.

FACS analysis of RH30 and RD cells\nafter treatment with TA for 24 or 48 hr showed that in RH30\ncells the percent of cells in S and G2/M phases increased and\ndecreased, respectively, whereas no changes were observed in\nRD cells (Fig. 2b). TA induced Annexin V staining (apoptosis)\nin both cell lines (Fig. 2c) and, in a scratch assay, treatment of\nRH30 cells with the solvent control (DMSO) resulted\nin extensive cell migration (Fig. 2d) after 48 hr, whereas in\ncells treated with 75 lM TA, cell migration was markedly\n\ninhibited. IGF also enhanced cell migration and this response\nwas inhibited by TA. Similar results were observed for RD\ncells; TA (100 lM) inhibited migration of RD cells (6 IGF)\nand there was also evidence for growth inhibition of these\ncells by TA (Fig. 2d).\n\nTA treatment and Sp knockdown in RMS cells induce\n\ncomparable effects\n\nThe linkage between the effects of TA and downregulation of\nSp proteins was investigated by comparing RNA interference\nand knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins alone and in\n\nFigure 1.

TA decreased expression\nof cyclin D1, survivin and VEGF in both cell lines as\ndescribed in previous studies13,15; however, TA also decreased\nPDGFRa, c-MET, IGFR and CXCR4 protein levels (Fig. 3c),\nand all three of these proteins are individually potential\n\nFigure 2.

For example, cyclin D1 was primarily regu-\nlated by Sp1 in RH30 cells but by Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in RD\ncells. c-MET, IGFR, CXCR4 and PDGFRa were also\ndecreased in RD and RH30 cells transfected with iSp1/3/4\n(combination), and the effects of individual Sp protein\nknockdown were variable and the most effective knockdown\n\nwas observed with iSp1/3/4. In a separate RNA interference\nstudy, we also showed that knockdown of Sp1 or combined\nknockdown of Sp1/3/4 (Supporting Information Fig. 3A)\ndecreased expression of a high molecular weight FOXO1\nband (using a FOXO1 antibody) that has previously been\nidentified as the chimeric PAX3-FOXO1 protein.27 Moreover,\nTA also decreased expression of this chimeric protein and it\nis possible that PAX3-FOXO1 downregulation may play a\nrole in the decreased expression of some of the other\nSp-regulated genes (Figs. 3c and 3d). The effects of TA on\nluciferase activity in RH30 and RD cells transfected with\nconstructs containing GC-rich promoter inserts from the Sp1\n(�751 to -20), Sp3 (�417 to �38), c-MET (�703 to þ60),\nsurvivin (�264 to þ49) and VEGF (�2018 to þ50) genes\nwas also determined. TA significantly decreased activity in\ncells transfected with all five constructs in both cell lines\n(Supporting Information Fig. 3B), indicating that loss of Sp\nproteins is also correlated with decreased Sp-dependent\ntransactivation.\n\nThe similarities between the effects of Sp knockdown and\nTA on cell migration was also investigated. TA significantly\ndecreased migration of RH30 (Fig. 4a) and RD (Fig. 4b) cells\nin a Boyden Chamber assay and TA also inhibited IGF (100\nng/ml)-induced migration. Knockdown of Sp1 alone (iSp1)\nalso decreased migration in both cell lines (Fig. 4c). iSp1,\niSp4 and iSp1/3/4 significantly decreased proliferation of both\ncell lines, whereas iSp3 significantly decreased growth of\nRH30 but not RD cells (Fig. 4d). These results also support\nthe role of TA-induced downregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4\n(Fig. 2a) in the growth inhibitory and antimigratory activities\nof TA (Figs. 2a, 2d and 4a, 4b). The effects of TA on growth\ninhibition may also be due, in part, to increased apoptosis.\n\nEffects of TA on proteasome-independent and dependent\n\nSp downregulation\n\nTA induces proteasome-dependent degradation of Sp1, Sp3\nand Sp413,20; however, in RH30 cells, the proteasome inhibi-\ntors MG132 and lactacystin did not block TA-dependent\ndownregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 (Fig. 5a). In RD cells,\nlactacystin only inhibited TA-induced degradation of Sp3 but\nnot Sp1 or Sp4 (Fig. 5b), and MG132 enhanced the effects of\nTA in this cell line. Another mechanism of drug-induced Sp\ndownregulation has been linked to induction of reactive oxy-\ngen species (ROS)19,23,24,37; however, the effects of ROS inhib-\nitors such as NAC and catalase did not affect TA-mediated\ndownregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 proteins in RH30 or RD\ncells (Supporting Information Fig. 4). ZBTB10 is an Sp\nrepressor that binds GC-rich sites and ZBTB10 expression in\ncancer cells is blocked by miR-27a and this interaction facili-\ntates the high expression of Sp proteins in cancer cells.17,18,23\n\nTA decreased miR-27a and induced expression of the Sp\nrepressor ZBTB10 in RH30 cells, whereas in RD cells, TA\ninduced ZBTB10 but this was not accompanied by decreased\nmiR-27a expression (Fig. 5c). Previous studies have demon-\nstrated the relationship between miR-27a and ZBTB10 in\n\nFigure 3. Effects of RNAi and TA on Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated\ngenes in RMS cells.

Cancer: 132, 795–806 (2013) VC 2012 UICC\n\n\n\nmodels,13–18 and epidemiology studies show that pancreatic\nand gastric cancer patients with tumors expressing high levels\nof Sp1 protein had significantly poorer prognosis than\npatients with tumors that express low levels of Sp1.43,44 Lou\net al.45 examined the role of Sp1 in carcinogen-induced\ntransformation of normal skin fibroblast that express low lev-\nels of Sp1; an 8- to 18-fold increase in Sp1 expression was\nobserved after transformation. Moreover, knockdown of Sp1\nin the transformed cells abrogated their ability to form\ntumors.\n\nPrevious studies have reported high expression of Sp-regu-\nlated genes such as FGFR4,26 c-MET,25 IGFR46 and VEGF47\n\nin RMS cells, and overexpression of PDGFRa in human\nARMS cells plays a functional role in tumor cell growth.34\n\nWestern blot analysis of RMS cell lines clearly demonstrated\nthat Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 were highly expressed in RH30 and\nRD cell lines derived from ARMS and ERMS patients, respec-\ntively. Moreover, in the genetically modified HSMMPFþHþM\n\ncell line that resembles ARMS cells, there was also high\nexpression of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 and the increase in Sp1 and\nSp3 was only observed after viral infection of HSMMPFþH\n\ncells with NMyc (Fig. 1b). Sp4, but not Sp1 or Sp3, was\nhighly expressed in HSMMs and enhanced expression of Sp1\nand Sp3 was only observed after three genetic modifications\n(PFþHþM) which were also necessary for transformation of\nthis cell line.27,29,30 Currently, we are further investigating\nthis ARMS-like cell model to determine the role of Sp1 and\nSp3 in the transformation process. Transformation of HSMM\ncells with SV40 T/t antigen, hTERT and Ras to give\nHSMMT/tþHþR (ERMS-like) was less informative with respect\nto the role of Sp transcription factors since Sp1 and Sp3 were\nhighly expressed in HSMMT/t cells and this was consistent\nwith a previous report showing that SV40 alone stimulates\nSp1 expression.31 Nevertheless, the high expression of Sp1\nand Sp3 in HSMMT/t cells which do not form tumors in\nmice indicates that in this model Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 expres-\nsion are not sufficient for transformation, and we are cur-\nrently investigating other factors required for transformation.\n\nThe Cooperative Human Tissue Network provided us\nwith several RMS patient samples and normal muscle tissue\nfor immunostaining for Sp1. Staining intensities were graded\nas non-detectable (1), low (2), medium (3) and high (4).\nOver 80% of the RMS tumors were highly stained for Sp1\n(�3), whereas in the small number of normal muscle tissue\nsamples, only low staining for Sp1 (�2) was observed (Figs.\n1c and 1d). The percent distribution of patients with high\nSp1 staining was similar to that observed in gastric cancer\npatients,44 whereas in pancreatic cancer patients, only 22%\nand 54% of female and male patients, respectively, were clas-\nsified as Sp1-positive.43 In RMS patients and RMS cells, Sp1\nis primarily nuclear and this may account for the high\nexpression of pro-oncogenic Sp-regulated genes.\n\nAnticancer agents that decrease expression of Sp1,\nSp3, Sp4 and Sp-regulated genes include arsenic trioxide,\nTA, curcumin, BA and synthetic triterpenoids such as\n\nCDODA-Me.13–17,20,21 TA is used in human and veterinary\nmedicine and is well tolerated in febrile children.48,49 TA\ninhibited RMS cell growth and downregulated Sp1, Sp3 and\nSp4 (Figs. 1 and 2) in RH30 and RD cells, and similar results\nwere also observed for BA and CDODA-Me (Supporting In-\nformation Fig. 1). TA also inhibited tumor growth in athymic\nnude mice bearing RH30 cells as xenografts and this was\naccompanied by decreased expression of Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and\nc-MET in tumors from TA-treated mice (Fig. 6). Although\nrelatively high concentrations of TA were required to inhibit\nRH30 and RD cell proliferation within 24–48 hr after treat-\nment, lower concentrations are growth inhibitory after pro-\nlonged treatment (up to 6 days) and this is consistent with\nthe 50 mg/kg dose every second day which significantly\ninhibited tumor growth (Fig. 6). These observations were\nsimilar to those previously observed for TA in other cancer\ncells and tumors.13,15,20 Other NSAIDs including sulindac\nand its derivatives also require higher (� 100 lM) concentra-\ntions in vitro than in vivo for their inhibition of cancer cell\nand tumor growth and effects on other pathways.50\n\nSince expression of many Sp-regulated genes may also be\ndependent on other transcription factors such as NFjB in\nsome cell lines,24 we used RNA interference to confirm that\nthe effects of TA on putative Sp-regulated genes were due to\ndownregulation of these transcription factors. However, these\nresults do not exclude coregulation of these genes by other\nfactors and the effects of TA may be due to both Sp down-\nregulation and other Sp-independent pathways. Results sum-\nmarized in Figures 3 and 4 clearly link the growth inhibitory\nand pro-apoptotic effects of TA on repression of Sp1, Sp3\nand Sp4 proteins. Simultaneous knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 and\nSp4 or treatment of RH30 and RD cells with TA decreased\ncell migration and expression of CD1, survivin, VEGF,\nc-MET, IGFR, PDGFRa and CXCR4 gene products. The rela-\ntive contributions of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 to expression of these\ngene products was both gene- and cell context-dependent\nand this was consistent with comparable RNA interference\nstudies in other cancer cell lines.20,21,23,24 For example, cyclin\nD1 expression in RH30 cells was primarily Sp1-dependent,\nwhereas in RD cells, knockdown of Sp1, Sp3 or Sp4 protein\ndecreased levels of CD1 protein (Fig. 3c). Thus, the effects of\nTA on VEGF, survivin, CD1, c-MET, PDGFRa, IGFR and\nCXCR4 expression on RMS cells (Fig. 3) and tumors (Fig. 6)\nare associated with downregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4\nproteins, and ongoing array studies have identified other\nSp-regulated genes that contribute to the effectiveness of\nagents that target Sp proteins. Sp-regulated gene products\nsuch as PDGFRa, IGFR, CXCR4 and c-MET are individual\ntargets for treatment of RMS and have been directly linked\nto growth survival and angiogenesis of RMS cells and/or\ntumors.25,34–36 Since TA or knockdown of Sp1 also decreased\nexpression of PAX3-FOXO1 in RH30 cells (Supporting Infor-\nmation Fig. 3A), this response may also be important for reg-\nulating other pro-oncogenic factors.

For example, TA induced proteasome-dependent\ndownregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in pancreatic cancer\ncells13 but in esophageal cancer cells, this same TA-induced\nresponse was proteasome-independent.15 We have previously\nidentified other pathways for drug-induced Sp downregula-\ntion; arsenic trioxide induces caspase- and ROS-dependent\ncleavage of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in bladder cancer cells19;\nCDDO-Me and a nitro-NSAID also induce ROS-dependent\ndownregulation of miR-27a and induction of ZBTB10, an Sp\nrepressor.23,37 Results in Figure 5 show that TA-induced\ndownregulation of Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4 in RH30 cells and Sp1\nand Sp4 in RD cells is proteasome-independent and Sp3 deg-\nradation in RD cells is proteasome-dependent. TA induced\nZBTB10 and downregulated miR-27a in RH30 cells, whereas\nin RD cells, TA induced ZBTB10 but did not affect expres-\nsion of miR-27a. However, since ROS and caspase inhibitors\ndid not block downregulation of Sp1, Sp3 or Sp4 in RH30 or\nRD cells treated with TA (Supporting Information Fig. 3),\n\nthe mechanisms associated with induction of the transcrip-\ntional repressor ZBTB10 and downregulation of miRs (and\ntheir identity) by TA is unknown and is currently being\ninvestigated.\n\nIn summary, results of this study show that Sp1 is overex-\npressed in approximately 80% of RMS patients, and Sp1, Sp3,\nSp4 and Sp-regulated gene products are also highly expressed\nin RMS cells. The effects of TA on Sp1, Sp3, Sp4 and Sp-regu-\nlated genes and responses were similar in the representative\nARMS (RH30) and ERMS (RD) cell lines, and future studies\nwill investigate TA-induced effects in the HSMM-derived cells.\nThe mechanisms associated with Sp downregulation are cell\ncontext-dependent and this has previously been observed in\nother cancer cell lines treated with TA and drugs that down-\nregulate Sp proteins.13–17,19–24 The NSAID TA decreased RMS\ncell and tumor growth, and results of RNA interference studies\n(Sp knockdown) suggest that the anticancer activity of TA is\ndue, in part, to targeting downregulation of Sp transcription\nfactors and Sp-regulated genes such as c-MET, IGFR,\nPDGFRa and CXCR4 (e.g., Figs. 3 and 6). This data suggest\nthat drugs, such as TA, are another option for clinical treat-\nment of RMS patients with these compounds alone or in com-\nbination with the currently used drug combinations.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
