Neovascularization and inflam-\nmation are independent biological processes that are linked in response to injury and ischemia.\nWhile clear that pro-inflammatory factors drive angiogenesis, the role of anti-inflammatory\ninterleukins in angiogenesis remains less defined. An interleukin with anti-inflammatory yet\npro-angiogenic effects would hold great promise as a therapeutic modality to treat many disease\nstates where inflammation needs to be limited, but revascularization and reperfusion still need to\nbe supported. As immune modulators, interleukins can polarize macrophages to a pro-angiogenic\nand reparative phenotype, which indirectly influences angiogenesis. Interleukins could also\npotentially directly induce angiogenesis by binding and activating its receptor on endothelial\ncells. Although a great deal of attention is given to the negative effects of pro-inflammatory\ninterleukins, less is described concerning the potential protective effects of anti-inflammatory\ninterleukins on various disease processes. To focus this review, we will consider IL-4, IL-10, IL-13,\nIL-19, and IL-33 to be anti-inflammatory interleukins, all of which have recognized immunomod-\nulatory effects. This review will summarize current research concerning anti-inflammatory\ninterleukins as potential drivers of direct and indirect angiogenesis, emphasizing their role in\nfuture therapeutics.\n\nKeywords: inflammation; hypoxia; cytokine; interleukin; angiogenesis; endothelial cell; macrophage;\npolarization\n\n1. Introduction\n\nSprouting angiogenesis is the expansion of new blood vessels from pre-existing vascu-\nlature where tip cells are stimulated to express proteases, migrate, proliferate, and form new\ntubes [1,2]. This is distinct from vasculogenesis which is the de novo formation of blood\nvessels via differentiation of circulating precursor cells, known as angioblasts, to endothe-\nlial cells [3,4]. In addition, intussusceptive angiogenesis is distinct from both sprouting\nangiogenesis and vasculogenesis. Intussusceptive angiogenesis occurs when the vascular\nwall of an existing blood vessel invaginates and forms a pillar, splitting one blood vessel\ninto two [5–7]. Regardless of the type of angiogenesis, the goal is to increase blood vessel\navailability to hypoxic or expanding tissue mass, ensuring the metabolic demands of the\ntissue are met. Due to the diffusion limit for oxygen, a cell is no further than 100–200 µm\nfrom a capillary [1,2].\n\nThroughout embryonic and postnatal development, the body size rapidly increases\nand inexorably experiences an immense amount of angiogenesis [1,8,9]. Physiological\nangiogenesis must also occur in healthy tissue throughout adult life to meet the basic func-\ntional demands of each tissue. For example, exercise stimulates angiogenesis in cardiac and\nskeletal muscle [10,11]. Neovascularization is also a necessary vascular expansion-based\n\nCells 2022, 11, 587. https://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030587 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030587\nhttps://creativecommons.org/\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttps://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nhttps://www.mdpi.com\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0002-5822-3480\nhttps://orcid.org/0000-0003-1039-7577\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/cells11030587\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/cells\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/cells11030587?type=check_update&version=2\n\n\nCells 2022, 11, 587 2 of 11\n\nrepair mechanism to preserve tissue viability in response to ischemic conditions. Repar-\native angiogenesis occurs as an attempt to restore tissue perfusion to salvage tissue after\nhypoxia, as seen in ischemic cardiomyopathy and peripheral arterial disease. On the other\nhand, pathological angiogenesis is often the target of anti-tumor therapy as it contributes to\ntumor growth and metastasis [1,12]. Tissue hypoxia initiates both inflammatory and angio-\ngenic factors to promote angiogenesis in an attempt to restore perfusion, and, as with any\ncomplex process, revascularization of ischemic tissue involves multiple cell types. While\nneovascularization and inflammation are independent biological processes, they are linked\nin response to injury and ischemia, and both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory\nprocesses participate in angiogenesis. Better identification of the soluble autocrine and\nparacrine factors which participate in these processes will increase our understanding of\nreparative angiogenesis and lead to more effective therapeutic modalities which resolve\ninflammation while maintaining tissue perfusion. The purpose of this review is to describe\nsuch soluble factors.\n\nIn terms of tissue repair, the paradigm of cytokine function in relation to angiogen-\nesis loosely adheres to the Janus Phenomenon first described by Epstein et al. in 2004.\nThis states that, in general, anti-inflammatory cytokines are anti-angiogenic while pro-\ninflammatory cytokines are pro-angiogenic [13,14]. While clear that pro-inflammatory\nfactors drive angiogenesis, the role of anti-inflammatory cytokines in angiogenesis\nremains uncertain. With these limitations in mind, we do recognize that some anti-\ninflammatory cytokines are indirectly pro-angiogenic through macrophage polarization\ntoward the alternative M2 phenotype, which secretes vascular endothelial growth fac-\ntors (VEGFs) [15]. While intuitive that the inflammatory state of ischemic tissue may\ndictate whether that tissue becomes neovascularized or necrotic, the participation of indi-\nrect effects of anti-inflammatory interleukins on the initiation of angiogenesis remains\nlargely uncharacterized.\n\nFor the purposes of this review, we will classify cytokine-mediated angiogenesis\nas “direct”, meaning, the response of endothelial cells to the cytokine results in new\nvessel formation via sprouting angiogenesis, or “indirect”, meaning cytokine-induced\nmacrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype and subsequent release of factors from that\nmacrophage induces endothelial cell angiogenesis (Figures 1 and 2).\n\n\n\nCells 2022, 11, 587 3 of 11\nCells\xa02022,\xa011,\xa0x\xa0FOR\xa0PEER\xa0REVIEW\xa0 3\xa0 of\xa0 12\xa0\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\n\xa0\n\nFigure\xa01.\xa0Direct\xa0versus\xa0Indirect\xa0Angiogenesis.\xa0Direct\xa0angiogenesis\xa0results\xa0from\xa0an\xa0interleukin\xa0bind‐\n\ning\xa0directly\xa0to\xa0its\xa0receptor\xa0present\xa0on\xa0an\xa0endothelial\xa0cell,\xa0leading\xa0to\xa0the\xa0induction\xa0of\xa0angiogenesis.\xa0\n\nIndirect\xa0angiogenesis\xa0results\xa0from\xa0an\xa0interleukin\xa0inducing\xa0macrophage\xa0polarization\xa0and\xa0subsequent\xa0\n\nVEGF\xa0secretion,\xa0leading\xa0to\xa0the\xa0same\xa0endpoint\xa0of\xa0angiogenesis.\xa0\n\nFigure 1.

Interleukin Initiation of Sprouting Angiogenesis. Interleukins are secreted from various\neffector cells in health and disease. They can either bind to their receptor directly on endothelial cells\n(1A) to induce expression of proteolytic and proliferative factors, or they can indirectly bind to their\nreceptor on macrophages (1B) to induce M2 family polarization and VEGF production. VEGF can\nthen bind to its receptor on endothelial cells to induce the expression of proteolytic and proliferative\nfactors. Both direct and indirect angiogenesis can lead to proliferation, migration, and tube formation\nseen in sprouting angiogenesis (3, 4).\n\n2. Direct Angiogenesis: Molecular Mechanisms of Endothelial-Induced Angiogenesis\n\nThe overarching mechanism which drives hypoxia-induced angiogenesis relies on the\nregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that induces angio-\ngenic gene expression [16]. HIF-1 is a heterodimer composed of HIF-1α and HIF-1β, with\ndimerization mediated by prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHDs) [16,17].\nUnder normoxic conditions, PHDs utilize oxygen and 2-oxoglutarate to hydroxylate cen-\ntral prolines within HIF-1α, which are then recognized by the von Hippel–Lindau tumor\nsuppressor protein (pVHL), leading to polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation\nof HIF-1α [18]. In this way, low levels of HIF-1α ensure minimal angiogenesis under\nnormoxic conditions. In hypoxic conditions, there is less oxygen co-substrate available\nfor PHDs, promoting HIF-1α stability and allowing dimerization with HIF-1β. The dimer\ntranslocates to the nucleus, where it transactivates the expression of numerous angiogenic\ngenes ranging from VEGFs to chemokines [16,18]. The endothelial cell (EC) response to\nhypoxia is loosely considered to a six-step process that leads to sprouting angiogenesis,\nbriefly outlined as follows: (1) HIF1α activation in response to hypoxia initiates expression\nof angiogenesis-related genes; (2) expression of proteases by capillary tip cells enables ECs\nto migrate through the basal lamina of the parent vein or capillary; (3) migration toward\nthe chemokine gradient which is greatest at the hypoxic region; (4) proliferation of ECs\nto generate sufficient cells to form a new conduit; (5) differentiation of the ECs to form a\ntube-like structure; (6) investment of pericytes around the newly formed vessel to stabilize\nit. As the new vessel forms, blood is brought to the tissue and oxygen concentration rises,\nleading to reduced HIF-1α stability and activity, thus ending the angiogenic process [10].\n\n\n\nCells 2022, 11, 587 5 of 11\n\n3. Indirect Angiogenesis: Macrophage Polarization-Induced Angiogenesis\n\nMacrophages exhibit functional plasticity in which they can alter their phenotype in\nresponse to environmental cues, allowing them to better modify their response to proximal\nstimuli and exert specific functions depending on the nearby signals. Monocytes differ-\nentiate into non-activated macrophages, which are then considered M0. Although less\nclearly delineated in humans, activated macrophages in mice are generally divided into\ntwo major populations: M1 or M2. Classically activated or M1 macrophages are induced\nby pro-inflammatory stimuli such as LPS and Th1 cytokines (IFNγ and TNFα) [19]. It was\nfound that macrophage activation by Th2 cytokines, such as IL-4 or IL-13, leads to an alter-\nnatively activated M2 macrophage [19]. M1 macrophages are associated with inflammation,\nwhile M2 macrophages are associated with wound healing and neovascularization [20].\n\nWithin M2 macrophages, subtypes of M2a, M2b, M2c, and M2d were identified.\nThese macrophage subtypes differ in various cell surface and genetic markers, which\nare used for classification purposes, but identification is not as clearly defined in vivo,\nwhich makes it difficult to study and translate to human disease. All M2 subtypes are\nstimulated by different factors, but for the purpose of this review, we will focus on the anti-\ninflammatory cytokines listed below and their ability to polarize macrophages toward a\ngiven subtype. Each M2 subtype also varies in its functionality. M2a macrophages function\nthrough reparative wound healing via tissue remodeling with anti-inflammatory and\npro-angiogenic effects [19]. M2b macrophages are immunomodulatory and secrete both\npro-inflammatory (IL-1β, TNFα, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-12) in\nresponse to immune complexes [19,21]. M2c macrophages perform immunologically silent\nphagocytosis known as efferocytosis and are major effectors in tissue remodeling, which is\nwhy they are often referred to as regulatory macrophages [19,22,23]. M2d macrophages, also\ncalled tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), contribute to tumor growth by promoting\nneovascularization and allowing the tumor to prosper [19,24].\n\nTo further confound classification, many in vivo studies point to the presence of\n“hybrid” macrophages that display more than one subtype marker [25]. With this in\nmind, it is important to scrupulously study and understand macrophage polarization\nand their subsequent contribution to disease promotion or resolution, as well as their\ncontribution to angiogenesis. Nevertheless, most investigations suggest a more prominent\nrole of M2 macrophages in angiogenesis by virtue of the repertoire of their pro-angiogenic\nsecretome [26]. M2 macrophages express a significant number of soluble angiogenic factors\nsuch as VEGF-A, TGFα, and PDGF-β, which act in a paracrine manner to promote wound\nrepair and neovascularization on local endothelial cells [20,22]. These macrophage-derived\ncytokines can elicit the pro-angiogenic processes on EC outlined in the previous section.\nThis is best illustrated by the observation that conditioned media from M2 macrophages\ninduce angiogenic responses in EC, while conditioned media from M0 and M1 macrophages\ninhibit angiogenic responses in EC [19,20]. Thus, cytokines that polarize macrophages to\nthe M2 phenotype can be considered indirectly angiogenic by virtue of their ability to elicit\nangiogenic cytokine synthesis from those macrophages.\n\n4. Anti-Inflammatory Cytokines\n\nThe molecular mechanisms of immune modulation by anti-inflammatory cytokines\nare numerous and diverse. Most studies of their effects are performed with immune cells.\nMany of these effects are mediated through signaling cascades involving the JAK and STAT\nsignaling proteins, synthesis of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family proteins,\nand modulation of NF-κB activity [27–29].\n\nA great deal of attention is given to the negative effects of pro-inflammatory in-\nterleukins in tissue ischemia, but far less is described concerning the capacity of anti-\ninflammatory interleukins to promote wound healing and angiogenesis. To focus this\nreview, we will consider IL-4, IL-10, IL-13, IL-19, and IL-33 as anti-inflammatory inter-\nleukins, and we will describe their effects on macrophage polarity and effects on endothelial\ncells, both contributing to their angiogenic potential. It is important to note that, although\n\n\n\nCells 2022, 11, 587 6 of 11\n\nthese interleukins have angiogenic properties, the literature is complex and, at times, con-\ntradictory. These contradictory conclusions are often drawn from studying an interleukin\nin a particular disease model before determining its basic effects on endothelial cells and\nits role in physiology. Therefore, future studies should focus on rigorous analysis of the\ndirect and indirect angiogenic effects both in vitro and in vivo prior to interpretation within\nthe context of a complex disease model. Our aim is to present a balanced picture of the\nangiogenic potential of these interleukins, including both pro- and anti-angiogenic reports.\n\nInterleukin-4 (IL-4) is an anti-inflammatory interleukin recognized to polarize T cells\nto their Th2 phenotype. IL-4 is secreted by CD4+ T-cells, NK T-cells, basophils, eosinophils,\nmast cells, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells [30]. Earlier studies by Volpert et al. indi-\ncated that IL-4 is an inhibitor of angiogenesis both in vitro and in vivo as an anti-tumor\nagent [31]. Although, at lower IL-4 treatment concentrations, neovascularization was\ninduced, indicating possible angiogenic potential that is concentration-dependent [31].\nIL-4 is characterized for its involvement in chronic inflammatory lung diseases such as\nasthma, and one study analyzed pulmonary angiogenesis under hypoxic conditions in an\nIL-4 knockout (KO) model [32]. This study concluded that, although VEGF-A was upreg-\nulated, pulmonary angiogenesis was diminished in the absence of IL-4, confounding the\nrole of IL-4 in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis from earlier reports [32]. Later studies have\nalso indicated that IL-4 promotes angiogenesis via direct effects on endothelial cells [33].\nOne such study focused on age-related macular degeneration and concluded that IL-4\npromoted choroidal neovascularization both by directly stimulating tube formation in\nendothelial progenitor cells and by inducing vasculogenesis through bone marrow-derived\nendothelial progenitor cells [33]. Another study in an atopic dermatitis model showed\nthat IL-4 dysregulates the expression of microRNAs involved in angiogenesis which may\ncontribute to the excessive angiogenesis seen in disease pathogenesis [34]. Other studies\nhave indicated IL-4 as a potent mitogen that induces tube formation directly in vitro and\nin vivo, again contradicting the earlier studies by Volpert et al. [35–37]. IL-4 also polarizes\nmacrophages toward the alternative M2a phenotype, increasing its angiogenic potential\nthrough indirect angiogenesis [19,20]. The summation of these studies points toward IL-4\nas a pro-angiogenic interleukin albeit with ill-defined mechanisms.\n\nInterleukin-10 (IL-10) is the archetypical anti-inflammatory interleukin and conse-\nquently the most studied. IL-10 is recognized to attenuate the expression of inflamma-\ntory transcripts in multiple cell types and inhibit antigen presentation and T-cell prolif-\neration [38]. IL-10 is produced by CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, NK T-cells, mast cells,\nneutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and under certain cir-\ncumstances, B-cells [39]. Typically, IL-10 is released in response to pathogen-associated\nmolecular patterns that are recognized by toll-like receptors in areas of inflammation [39].\nVery few studies have focused on the direct angiogenic potential IL-10 may have on endothe-\nlial cells. One study indicated that IL-10 had anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic effects [40].\nThey performed a dorsal air sac assay using human ovarian cell lines transferred with\nmurine IL-10 plasmid and revealed decreased microvessel formation in the presence of\nIL-10, although VEGF levels remained unaffected [40]. Another study indicated IL-10’s\nanti-angiogenic effect using the hind limb ischemia mouse model and revealed increased\nangiogenesis in an IL-10 KO mouse model with a subsequent decrease in angiogenesis\nwhen treated with murine IL-10 plasmid [41]. To date, no mechanistic studies were re-\nported to characterize the direct effect of IL-10 on endothelial cells in vitro. On the other\nhand, one study, which specifically focused on the regulation of IL-10 in B-cells, indicated\nthat HIF-1α has response elements in the IL-10 promoter, resulting in the expression of\nIL-10 under hypoxic conditions perhaps suggesting an indirect angiogenic function [42].\nIL-10 is a recognized M2 polarizing cytokine [19,20]. In an intraocular neovascularization\nmodel focusing on IL-10’s role in macrophage polarization, IL-10 was implicated as being\nindirectly angiogenic since ischemia-induced pathological angiogenesis in the retina was\npromoted in the presence of IL-10 [43]. Later studies determined that IL-10 specifically\npolarizes macrophage to the M2c phenotype, suggesting a role in wound healing and\n\n\n\nCells 2022, 11, 587 7 of 11\n\ntissue remodeling [19,20]. In addition, M2c transcriptomic analysis revealed IL-10 induced\nthe upregulation of angiogenic genes, corresponding to prior studies that indicated the\nangiogenic abilities of the M2c phenotype [44]. When taken together, these studies sug-\ngest that, while IL-10 has no direct angiogenic effects on EC to date, it does have the\npotential to be pro-angiogenic by virtue of its ability to modulate macrophages to the\nreparative phenotype.\n\nInterleukin-13 (IL-13) is closely related to IL-4 and is similarly secreted by CD4+\nT-cells, NK T-cells, basophils, eosinophils, mast cells, and type 2 innate lymphoid cells [30].\nHowever, IL-13 differs from IL-4 in its receptor specificity [30]. Interestingly, despite\nthis difference, IL-13 has many biological properties similar to IL-4, one example being\nthe polarization of macrophages to the M2a phenotype, with subsequent expression of\nangiogenic cytokines, providing IL-13 with indirect angiogenic potential [19,30]. The\ncombination of IL-13 with IL-4 potently polarizes macrophages to an anti-inflammatory\nphenotype [19,30]. That said, the effect of IL-13 on angiogenesis is controversial. Limited\nstudies suggest that IL-13 plays a role in direct angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell\nmigration [45]. Other studies also suggest it is pro-angiogenic via the induction of tube\nformation in vitro and neovascularization of rat corneas in vivo [37]. Like IL-4, there is\nconflicting data where studies also suggest IL-13 attenuates vascular tube formation [46].\nFor example, physiologic concentrations of IL-13 also demonstrate anti-lymphangiogenic\neffects and potently impair lymphatic endothelial survival, proliferation, migration, and\ntube formation [47]. Inhibition of IL-13 activity by neutralizing antibodies also promotes\nlymphangiogenesis [47]. Clearly, a more thorough analysis of angiogenic assays both on\ncultured EC and mouse models are required to make a definitive statement on IL-13’s\nassociation with angiogenesis.\n\nInterleukin-19 (IL-19) was originally placed in an IL-10 sub-family where the original\n“IL-10-related” cytokines (IL-20, IL-22, IL-24, IL-26, IL-29, as well as IL-19) were grouped\ntogether without any knowledge of their biological function but based solely on their amino\nacid similarly [48]. IL-19 is now considered to be in a sub-family that includes IL-20, IL-22,\nand IL-24. IL-19 is functionally distinct from the other sub-family members in terms of\ncell-specific expression, receptor usage, and function [49–52]. IL-19 is immunomodula-\ntory, more specifically, anti-inflammatory [53–55]. Basal levels of IL-19 are shown to be\nsecreted by keratinocytes, epithelial cells, macrophages, and to a lesser extent by activated\nB-cells [56]. However, unlike other family members, IL-19 expression can be induced by\npro-inflammatory stimuli in ECs and macrophages [57,58]. Serum IL-19 levels have been\nshown to increase in various inflammatory disorders, such as psoriasis and inflammatory\nbowel disease, in both humans and mice, likely as a compensatory event to resolve inflam-\nmation [59–61]. Although retrospective in design, one human study examined the levels of\nHIF-1α and IL-19 in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease progression and identified an\nincrease in the levels of both factors that were associated with disease progression [62]. IL-\n19 expression is induced in hind limb ischemia models [63]. Injection of recombinant mouse\nIL-19 increased hind limb perfusion and capillary density through directly increasing angio-\ngenic gene expression in ECs as well as indirectly through macrophage polarization toward\nthe M2 phenotype [57,63,64]. The absence of IL-19 by genetic deletion decreased perfusion\nand capillary density in the hind limb, though the effects could not be determined to be by\ndeletion in macrophages or endothelial cells [63]. In cultured EC, IL-19 increases prolifera-\ntion, migration, and tube formation. Mechanistically, at least in cultured EC, IL-19 induces\nangiogenesis by induction of RNA-binding protein ILF3, which increases mRNA stability\nof angiogenic cytokines [63,65]. When taken together, IL-19 may be the prime example\nof an exception to the Janus phenomenon, having anti-inflammatory, yet pro-angiogenic\nproperties, by both direct effects on EC and indirect effects by macrophage polarization.\n\nInterleukin-33 (IL-33) is an IL-1 family member and is expressed by macrophages,\ndendritic cells, mast cells, fibroblasts, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and damaged epithelial\ncells [66,67]. It polarizes leukocytes to Th2 and macrophage to the M2 phenotype by induction\nof IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 while also decreasing expression of IFNγ [68]. Its expression in human\n\n\n\nCells 2022, 11, 587 8 of 11\n\nrheumatoid arthritis patients determined the presence of a regulatory circuit consisting of\nHIF-1α and IL-33, leading to the preservation of disease pathogenesis and indicating that\nIL-33 expression is induced by hypoxia to maintain hypoxic gene activation [69]. A more\ncausal role of this cytokine during inflammation is complicated, and it depends on the\ndisease process as well as the specific tissues involved. One review summarized IL-33 as\nbeing either pro- or anti-inflammatory, which varied by disease model [70]. For example,\nIL-33 exacerbated a murine model of collagen-induced arthritis and increased the generation\nof pro-inflammatory cytokines [71]. IL-33 is also implicated in the disease phenotypes of\nasthma, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis [70]. Anti-IL-33 antibody treatment was shown to\nprevent the negative histological adaptations commonly associated with asthma in an OVA-\ninduced asthma mouse model [72]. On the other hand, IL-33 is proposed to be protective\nagainst obesity and type 2 diabetes by increasing Th2 cytokines and inducing M2 macrophage\npolarization [70]. This divergence of IL-33’s actions further emphasizes the importance of\ncritically analyzing each cytokine’s possible mechanisms of action on a tissue of interest\nbefore introducing it to a disease model. That said, the IL-33 receptor and its cognate receptor\nST2 are expressed on EC, and studies in cultured EC have shown that IL-33 increases direct\nangiogenesis via EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation, which was prevented by\nknockdown of ST2 [73]. IL-33 also polarizes macrophages toward the alternatively activated\nM2 phenotype, and limited studies suggest M2a subtype involvement [74].\n\nIn summary, analysis of the expression of anti-inflammatory interleukins and their\neffects on both endothelial cells and macrophages are vital to the true understanding of\ntheir role in direct and indirect angiogenesis, respectively. At present, this is challenging, as\nmost studies focus on disease processes in vivo without performing classical sprouting an-\ngiogenesis assays such as proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro on cultured\nendothelial cells, making it difficult to distinguish direct from indirect angiogenic effects.\nAdditional limitations include the type of angiogenesis being analyzed. As mentioned in\nthe introduction, there are multiple ways a blood vessel can be formed which includes, but\nis not limited to, sprouting angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and intussusceptive angiogenesis.\nFor the sake of simplicity, this review focused on sprouting angiogenesis, but studies should\nalso include analysis of the effects on vasculogenesis and intussusceptive angiogenesis.\nThis would require a more thorough analysis of emerging in vitro and in vivo assays [6,75].\nFuture studies should begin in vitro, determining the binding and activation of endothelial\ncells by cytokines. Further in vitro experiments can determine macrophage activation by\ncytokines and subsequent secretion of VEGFs. Then, transitioning to in vivo experiments\nwould elucidate the functionality in a dynamic system. Finally, the introduction of disease\nmodels can be introduced to determine if perturbations are seen.\n\nFurther clarification of the molecular mechanisms of these angiogenic effects is needed\nto identify protein participants of these angiogenic pathways, as each represents a target of\nrational drug therapy. What is recognized, however, is the promise that anti-inflammatory\ninterleukins hold as effectors of wound healing. A greater understanding of these inter-\nleukins, their angiogenic effects, and the molecular mechanisms behind them will bolster\ntheir use in multiple diseases and emphasize their role in translational medicine. Table 1\nprovides a review of the above information, organized by cytokine.\n\nTable 1.
