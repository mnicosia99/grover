In Gentiana lutea, gentiopicroside is the most abundant active\n\ncompound followed by loganic acid, swertiamarin and the xanthone glycosides\n\n[1]. Gentiopicroside and swertiamarin are secoiridoid glycosides, which are\n\nreported to have antimicrobial [2], antifungal [3], hepatoprotective [4], and\n\nantilipidaemic activities [5, 6]. Although numerous studies have been performed\n\non the anti-inflammatory effects of gentian root extracts [7, 8], most investiga-\n\ntions did not provide any data on the underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nOxidative stress and inflammation are crucial for defense against infections, but\n\nthey can initiate a number of deleterious effects, such as impairment of\n\nintracellular calcium transport and production of cytokines. In chronic\n\ninflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, overexpression of the pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) is thought to play an\n\nimportant role in disease progression [9, 10]. Inducible nitric oxide synthase\n\n(iNOS) is a pro-inflammatory enzyme that is involved in the production of nitric\n\noxide (NO). In chronic kidney disease, oxidative stress has been found to increase\n\nin parallel with diseases progression [11]. The pro-inflammatory enzyme\n\ncyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is induced mainly at sites of inflammation in response\n\nto inflammatory stimuli including TNF-a. Elevated Cox-2 expression has been\n\nfound in approximately 50% of adenomas and 85% of adenocarcinomas [12].\n\nMembers of the Rel/NF-kB family of transcription factors are key regulators of\n\ninnate and adaptive immune responses and several cellular processes, including\n\nsurvival, growth, and proliferation [13, 14]. In mammals, the Rel family consists\n\nof five members, c-Rel, p65 (RelA), RelB, NF-kB1 (p50/p105), and NF-kB2 (p52/\n\np100), that bind DNA as homodimers and heterodimers through a conserved N-\n\nterminal Rel homology region (RHR) [15]. Rel dimers are often maintained in an\n\ninactive state by cytoplasmic association with IkB proteins [16]. Cell activation\n\nleads to signal transduction cascades that result in the phosphorylation and\n\ndegradation of the IkBs, allowing rapid nuclear translocation and DNA binding of\n\nthe Rel dimers.\n\nThe present study was aimed at elucidating the molecular basis of the anti-\n\ninflammatory effect of roots of the Japanese gentian, G. triflora. We found that a\n\nmethanol extract of G. triflora roots inhibited LPS-induced expression of TNF-a,\n\niNOS, and Cox-2 in RAW264.7 cells. Furthermore, activity-guided fractionation\n\nof root extracts identified gentiolactone as the active compound: TNF-a\n\nexpression was inhibited by gentiolactone but not by gentiopicroside or\n\nswertiamarin. These results indicate that inhibition of TNF-a, iNOS, and Cox-2\n\nexpression by gentiolactone is one of the mechanisms involved in the anti-\n\ninflammatory properties of G. triflora roots.\n\nGentiolactone Inhibits Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Expression\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0113834 November 25, 2014 2 / 14\n\n\n\nResults\n\nTo examine the anti-inflammatory activity of gentian root extracts, we\n\ninvestigated their ability to inhibit LPS-induced expression of TNF-a in\n\nRAW264.7 cells. TNF-a mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated at\n\n4 hours after treating the cells with LPS. This upregulation was inhibited in a\n\nconcentration-dependent manner by the root extracts (Fig. 1A).\n\nGentiopicroside and swertiamarin have been reported to be the major active\n\ncompounds of gentian roots. We measured the concentrations of gentiopicroside\n\nand swertiamarin in 12.5 mg/mL MeOH extracts using LC/TOFMS and found\n\n1.41 mM and 0.16 mM, respectively. On the basis of these concentrations, we set\n\nthe highest concentration of gentiopicroside and swertiamarin to be tested at\n\n1.5 mM and examined the inhibitory effects on LPS-induced TNF-a expression.\n\nNeither compound showed any inhibitory effect (Fig. 1B).\n\nWe purified the active compound that inhibited LPS-induced TNF-a mRNA\n\nexpression from gentian root extracts using the inhibitory activity-guided\n\nfractionation method (Fig. S1). The major compound in the most active fraction\n\nwas identified by LC-TOFMS and NMR as gentiolactone (Fig. 2A). To examine its\n\ncytotoxicity, we cultured RAW264.7 cells with gentiolactone for 24 hours and\n\nfound no effects on cell viability or growth (Fig. 2B). Gentiolactone significantly\n\nsuppressed the expression of TNF-a (Tnf) and iNOS (Nos2), and Cox-2 (Ptgs2) at\n\nconcentrations of 100 mM, 100 mM and 500 mM, respectively (Fig. 3A-C).\n\nMoreover, gentiolactone inhibited the LPS-induced accumulation of TNF-a\n\nprotein (Fig. 3D). Kwak et al. reported that gentianine, an anti-inflammatory\n\ncompound contained in G. macrophylla radix, inhibited an LPS-induced increase\n\nin IL-6 and TNF-a in rat sera [8]. We used LC-TOFMS to analyze the root\n\nextracts of G. triflora for gentianine, but did not detect this compound in the most\n\nactive purified fraction (data not shown). Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect\n\nobserved in gentian roots was due to the effect of gentiolactone and not\n\ngentianine.\n\nWe hypothesized that gentiolactone might interfere with the transcriptional\n\nactivity of NF-kB. To test this hypothesis, we investigated NF-kB transcriptional\n\nactivity using the renilla luciferase reporter (hRLuc) gene driven by an NF-kB\n\ndependent promoter. We transfected the pNF-kB RE-TK hRluc(F) vector into\n\nRAW264.7 cells. At 24 hours after transfection, we added LPS (1 mg/mL) and\n\ngentiolactone (500 mM) and measured hRluc activity. The hRluc activity induced\n\nby LPS was significantly decreased in the presence of gentiolactone (Fig. 4).\n\nWe examined the effects of gentiolactone on the NF-kB signaling pathway\n\nactivated by LPS stimulation. LPS stimulation leads to the degradation of the IkB\n\nproteins that regulate nuclear NF-kB. The p65:p50 dimer is a member of the NF-\n\nkB family and is considered to be part of the canonical pathway. This classic NF-\n\nkB dimer is activated by IkB degradation and then translocates to the nucleus and\n\nbinds to DNA. Gentiolactone did not inhibit IkBa protein degradation (Fig. 5),\n\nnuclear translocation of p65/NF-kB protein (Fig. 6), or binding of NF-kB protein\n\nto DNA (Fig. 7).\n\nGentiolactone Inhibits Pro-Inflammatory Cytokine Expression\n\nPLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0113834 November 25, 2014 3 / 14\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nGentian roots and rhizomes have traditionally been used in Europe and western\n\nAsia as herbal medicines because of their anti-inflammatory effects. Most studies\n\nof these properties have therefore been performed using European and Chinese\n\ngentian roots [7, 19]. In this study, we demonstrated for first time that roots of the\n\nJapanese gentian, G. triflora (which was first isolated from G. purpurea in 1978;\n\n[17]), also have anti-inflammatory activity. We identified gentiolactone as the\n\nFigure 1. MeOH extract from gentian roots inhibits LPS-induced TNF-a production.

Iridoids\n\nare naturally occurring substances and are found in many medicinal herbs. They\n\nexist mostly as glycosides. Iridoid glycosides seem to be inactive but activated by\n\nconversion into hydrolyzed-iridoids by enzymatic hydrolysis of the glycosidic\n\nbond. H-aucubin, H-catalpol, H-loganin and H-geniposide have inhibitory effect\n\non LPS-induced TNF-a production, but H-swertiamarin and H-gentiopicroside\n\ndo not [21]. Previous reports showed that aucubin and geniposide suppress TNF-\n\na production via inhibition of IkB-a degradation [22, 23]. However,\n\ngentiolactone suppressed TNF-a production without inhibition of IkB-a\n\ndegradation or NF-kB nuclear import, suggesting that gentiolactone inhibited\n\nTNF-a production in a completely different manner from aucubin and\n\ngeniposide. As another way of inhibiting TNF-a production, several studies have\n\nshown that sesquiterpene, helenaline and parthenolide lactones interact directly\n\nwith NF-kB to inhibit DNA binding to NF-kB [24]. Anti-inflammatory activity of\n\nsesquiterpene lactones are mediated chemically by a,b-unsaturated carbonyl\n\nstructures, such as a-methylene-c-lactone or an a,b-unsubstituted\n\nFigure 6. Gentiolactone does not inhibit nuclear transport of NF-kB. RAW264.7 cells were cultured for 1 hour with LPS (1 mg/mL) and gentiolactone\n(500 mM). The cytoplasmic or nuclear extracts were examined by immunoblotting analysis using anti-p65/NF-kB, anti-a-Tubulin or anti-Lamin B1 antibodies.\nPlotted values represent the mean value ¡ SD from four independent cultures.

Helenaline and parthenolide lactones also inhibit IkB-a\n\nprotein degradation [24]. Sesquiterpene lactones potently inhibit NF-kB, but have\n\ntoxicity because of their inhibitory effect on DNA and protein synthesis as well as\n\nhexokinase activity [26]. In the present study, helenalin was observed to have a\n\ncytotoxic effect in RAW264.7 cells: in cultures exposed to 20 mM helenalin for\n\n24 hours, .99.5% of the cells died (Fig. 2B). By contrast, gentiolactone did not\n\nhave a cytotoxic effect even at concentrations as high as 500 mM. Gentiolactone\n\nshowed a weaker ability to inhibit LPS-induced TNF-a production than helenalin,\n\nbut it could suppress TNF-a, iNOS and Cox-2 expression without any cytotoxic\n\neffects. Additionally, gentiolactone inhibited NF-kB transcriptional activity but\n\ndid not inhibit the DNA-binding of NF-kB. These findings indicated that\n\nFigure 7. Gentiolactone does not inhibit DNA binding of NF-kB. RAW264.7 cells were cultured for 1 hour with LPS (1 mg/mL) and gentiolactone (250,\n500, 1000 mM). Nuclear proteins were extracted and incubated with biotinylated oligonucleotides containing a binding site for NF-kB. Resultant complexes\nwere analyzed by EMSA. The bands indicated by the arrow were quantified. Plotted values represent the mean value ¡ SD from three independent\ncultures.

As the inhibitory effect of gentiolactone on TNF-a\n\nexpression was only evident at 100 mM (21.2 mg/ml), the use of the intact\n\ncompound as an anti-inflammatory drug might be difficult. However, by\n\ndetermining the active center of gentiolactone, it should be feasible to design\n\nderivatives with usable anti-inflammatory activities.\n\nChronic inflammation is a hallmark of rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis\n\n[27, 28]. As NF-kB activates expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and pro-\n\ninflammatory enzymes, so inhibitors of NF-kB are lead compounds for the\n\ndevelopment of anti-inflammatory drugs. The most common mechanism for NF-\n\nkB inhibition is through prevention of IkB-a degradation [29]. However,\n\ngentiolactone appeared to inhibit TNF-a expression in a different manner.\n\nIdentification of the molecular target of gentiolactone and characterization of the\n\nmechanism for blocking NF-kB promoter activity will provide new insights for\n\ndesigning novel NF-kB inhibitors.\n\nMaterial and Methods\n\nPlant materials\n\nThe roots and rhizomes of G. triflora cv. ‘September Blue’ were collected from the\n\nfield of Iwate Biotechnology Research Center, Iwate, Japan, in June 2012, and were\n\nauthenticated by Dr. Hideyuki Takahashi, Iwate Biotechnology Research Center.\n\nA voucher specimen (GR-Spb-120615) was deposited in the Iwate Biotechnology\n\nResearch Center.\n\nExtraction and isolation\n\nThe roots were harvested and dried naturally at room temperature.

A biotin-\n\nlabeled oligonucleotide (59 -AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC- 39) was incu-\n\nbated with 20 mg of nuclear extract at room temperature for 30 min. We used the\n\nLightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit (Thermo) and followed the manufac-\n\nturers’ recommendations.\n\nStatistical analysis\n\nStatistical differences among experimental groups were evaluated by one-way\n\nANOVA and Tukey’s post-hoc test. Values are expressed as the mean ¡ S.D.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1. Purification of gentiolactone from MeOH extract of G. triflora. A,\nThe extract (20 mg of the extract in 2 mL 10% MeOH) was separated by\n\nInertSustain ODS3 column, and 5 main peaks were found. Peak 1 was collected\n\nand identified by LC-TOFMS and NMR as gentiolactone. B, Chromatogram of\n\ngentiolactone (60 mg of gentiolactone) purified from G. triflora.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0113834.s001 (TIFF)\n\nTable S1.
