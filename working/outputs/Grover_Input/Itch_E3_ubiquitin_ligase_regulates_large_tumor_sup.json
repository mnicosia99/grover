E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates large tumor\nsuppressor 1 stability\nKing Ching Hoa,1, Zhonghua Zhoua,1, Yi-Min Sheb, Alex Chuna, Terry D.

Brugge, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, and approved February 16, 2011 (received for review January 25, 2011)\n\nThe large tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) is a serine/threonine kinase\nand tumor suppressor found down-regulated in a broad spectrum\nof human cancers. LATS1 is a central player of the emerging Hippo-\nLATS suppressor pathway, which plays important roles in cell\nproliferation, apoptosis, and stem cell differentiation. Despite the\nample data supporting a role for LATS1 in tumor suppression, how\nLATS1 is regulated at the molecular level remains largely un-\nknown. In this study, we have identified Itch, a HECT class E3\nubiquitin ligase, as a unique binding partner of LATS1. Itch can\ncomplex with LATS1 both in vitro and in vivo through the PPxY\nmotifs of LATS1 and the WW domains of Itch. Significantly, we\nfound that overexpression of Itch promoted LATS1 degradation by\npolyubiquitination through the 26S proteasome pathway. On the\nother hand, knockdown of endogenous Itch by shRNAs provoked\nstabilization of endogenous LATS1 proteins. Finally, through\nseveral functional assays, we also revealed that change of Itch\nabundance alone is sufficient for altering LATS1-mediated down-\nstream signaling, negative regulation of cell proliferation, and\ninduction of apoptosis. Taking these data together, our study\nidentifies E3 ubiquitin ligase Itch as a unique negative regulator of\nLATS1 and presents a possibility of targeting LATS1/Itch interac-\ntion as a therapeutic strategy in cancer.\n\nproteomics | protein stability | protein ubiquitination\n\nLarge tumor suppressor 1 (LATS1) is a serine/threonine kinaseoriginally identified as a homolog ofDrosophila tumor-suppressor\nLATS (1–4). Although mice deficient for LATS1 develop soft-\ntissue sarcomas, ovarian cancer, and pituitary dysfunction (5), over-\nexpression of human LATS1 dramatically suppresses tumor cell\ngrowth by either inducing G2/M cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis\n(6, 7). In addition, we previously found that inactivation of LATS1\ncaused cytokinesis defects, genetic instability, and polyploidy, all\nof which are hallmarks of cancer (8). Moreover, reduced expres-\nsion and promoter methylation of LATS1 are also found in various\ncancers, including leukemia, breast cancer, astrocytoma, and soft-\ntissue sarcoma (9–11). Given such critical role in cancer, studies of\nLATS1 may therefore greatly facilitate our understanding of the\nmolecular mechanism that leads to tumorigenesis.\nRecently, Drosophila LATS has been identified as a major\n\ncomponent of an emerging tumor suppressor pathway known as\nthe Hippo-LATS pathway (12–14). In this pathway, LATS func-\ntions as a central player, transmitting signals from upstream tumor\nsuppressors (FAT, Merlin, Expanded, Salvador, RASSF, Hippo,\nand MATS) to inhibit tumor growth by phosphorylating and\nsuppressing the oncoprotein and transcriptional coactivator\nYorkie (12–14). Apart from its tumor-suppressor function, the\nHippo-LATS pathway is also implicated in a number of funda-\nmental biological processes, such as animal organ size control,\nstem cell differentiation, color recognition in the eye, cell-cell\ncompetition, and neural dendrite formation andmaintenance (12,\n13). Significantly, mammalian homologs of each component of the\nDrosophila Hippo-LATS pathway have been identified [Fat4 for\nFat, Merlin for Merlin, Ex for Ex, RASSF1A for dRASSF,\nhWW45 for Sav, Mst1 and Mst2 for Hippo, LATS1 and LATS2\nfor LATS, MOB1 (Msp1 one binder) for Mats, and YAP (Yes-\n\nassociated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional coactivator with\nPDZ-binding motif) for Yorkie] (12). We and others recently\nshowed that part of theHippo-LATS signaling pathway discovered\nin Drosophila are conserved in mammals and that many members\nof the pathway could be confirmed as either tumor suppressors\n(Fat4, Merlin, RASSF1A, Mst1/2, LATS1/2, MOB1) or onco-\ngenes (YAP and TAZ) in human cancers (15–19). Therefore,\nfurther characterization of Hippo-LATS pathway and its regu-\nlators in mammals will have great implication for not only our\nunderstanding the molecular mechanism of tumorigenesis, but\nalso for future targeting of this pathway for cancer therapies.\nDespite the critical role of LATS in tumorigenesis, little is\n\nknown regarding LATS regulation at the molecular level. In\nparticular, although many upstream activators of LATS, such as\nHippo/MST and Mats/MOB1, have been reported (20–22), di-\nrect negative regulators of LATS are yet to be identified. In this\nstudy, we have provided convincing evidence that Itch E3 ubiq-\nuitin ligase is a bona fide binding partner and negative regulator\nof LATS1.\n\nResults\nIdentification of Itch as a LATS1-Interacting Protein by Proteomics.\nPrevious work from our laboratory demonstarted that LATS1\ncan interact with other proteins through PPxY559, one of its two\nPPxY motifs (PPxY376 and PPxY559) (19). Therefore, we used\na recently developed SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino\nacids in cell culture) method and LATS1 deletion (amino acids\n526–655) GST fusion proteins containing either wild-type\n(PPxY559) or mutant (PPxF559, negative control) motif as bait to\nscreen for unique LATS1-interacting proteins. In this SILAC\nanalysis, proteins in HEK293T human embryonic kidney cells\nwere metabolically labeled, respectively, by either heavy (H)\n[13C6-Argeine (Arg) and\n\n13C6-Lysine (Lys)] or light (L) (\n12C-Arg\n\nand 12C-Lys) amino acids. The resulting “heavy” and “light”\nSILAC lysates were then incubated, respectively, with PPxY-WT\nGST and PPxY-Mut-GST fusion proteins, followed by GST pull-\ndown and LC MS/MS analysis. Our LC MS/MS analysis identi-\nfied 118 proteins, of which only two proteins, YAP (gi5174751)\nand Itch (gi27477109), are specific LATS1-binding proteins with\nH/L ratios of >1.5. Significantly, peptides from both Itch and\nYAP are labeled only by the heavy isotope (Fig. 1A), suggesting\nthat they specifically bind to wild-type rather than mutant PPxY\nGST fusion proteins. On the other hand, peptides from a non-\nspecific protein cytoplasmic Actin (gi4501885) were equally la-\nbeled with both heavy and light isotopes and have a H/L ratio of\n\nAuthor contributions: T.D.C. and X.Y. designed research; K.C.H., Z.Z., Y.-M.S., and A.C.\nperformed research; K.C.H., Z.Z., and Y.-M.S. analyzed data; and K.C.H. and X.Y. wrote\nthe paper.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\n1K.C.H. and Z.Z. contributed equally to this work.\n2To whom correspondence should be addressed: E-mail: yang@cliff.path.queensu.ca.\n\nThis article contains supporting information online at www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.\n1073/pnas.1101273108/-/DCSupplemental.\n\n4870–4875 | PNAS | March 22, 2011 | vol. 108 | no. 12 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1101273108\n\nmailto:yang@cliff.path.queensu.ca\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1101273108/-/DCSupplemental\nhttp://www.pnas.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1073/pnas.1101273108/-/DCSupplemental\n\n\n1.05 (Fig. 1A). YAP is a WW domain-containing protein and\na known LATS1 binding partner (19), whereas Itch is a WW-\ndomain–containing protein and an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to\npromote protein ubiquitination and degradation (23). To further\nconfirm endogenous Itch is pulled down by PPxY-WT-GST\nrather than PPxY-Mut-GST of LATS1, we performed a GST\npull-down assay using the same conditions as those used for\nSILAC screening. Importantly, our result showed that endoge-\nnous Itch from HEK293T cell lysates specifically bind to PPxY-\nWT-GST (Fig. 1B), suggesting that Itch may be a strong binding\npartner of LATS1.\n\nInteraction of LATS1 and Itch in Vitro and in Vivo. To further verify\nItch as a bona fide binding partner of LATS1, we did the fol-\nlowing experiments: First, we did coimmunoprecipitation (Co-\nIP) experiments to confirm whether or not LATS1 and Itch\nphysically interact with each other in vivo. As expected, LATS1\ncoimmunoprecipitates with Itch in cell lysates overexpressing\nboth LATS1 and Itch (Fig. 2A). In addition, Co-IP analysis using\nMDA-MB-231 cells also demonstrates that endogenous LATS1\nrobustly coimmunoprecipitates endogenous Itch (Fig. 2B). Sec-\nond, to test if Itch is a physiologically relevant interacting partner\nof LATS1, subcellular localization of both Itch and LATS1 in\ncells were investigated by indirect immunostaining. Significantly,\na strong overlapping staining signal (yellow) for both LATS1\n(green) and Itch (red) was observed in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2C),\n\nsuggesting that LATS1 does colocalize with Itch in the same\nsubcellular compartment and that their interaction is physio-\nlogically significant. Third, we sought to determine the domains\non LATS1 and Itch that mediate their interaction. As mentioned\npreviously, one of the domains on LATS1 for protein–protein\ninteraction is its PPxY motifs (19), which have high affinities\ntoward Group I WW domains (24). Given that Itch contains four\nGroup I WW domains, we therefore tested if its WW domains\nare critical for LATS1–Itch interaction in a GST pull-down as-\nsay. For this assay, a series of Itch GST-fusion proteins were\nproduced (Fig. S1) and their abilities to interact with LATS1 in\nvitro were tested. As shown in Fig. 2D, wild-type LATS1 binds\nstrongly to the Itch-GST fusion protein, but not to GST, sug-\ngesting that LATS1 and Itch form a stable complex in vitro. No\nsignificant interaction was detected, however, between LATS1\nand Itch-WW-mut-GST, which has all its WW domains dis-\nrupted. This result implies that LATS1–Itch interaction requires\nintact WW domains of Itch. Consistent with this notion, the Itch\nWW domain alone (WW-GST) can bind to LATS1 with as\n\nFig. 1. Identification of LATS1-interacting proteins by SILAC. (A–C) Quan-\ntification of heavy and light peptides. A section of the mass spectrum of\npeptides from (A) Itch (NYEQEQLQR), (B) YAP (TANVPQTVPMR), and (C)\nActin (HQGVMVGMGQK) are shown. The pair of light (L) and heavy (H) la-\nbeled peptides were identified by MS/MS measurements, and their H/L ratios\nwere determined by the intensities of monoisotopic ions. The heavy 13C-\nisotope labeled peptides are labeled with solid dots, whereas the corre-\nsponding light peptides, which are 6 Da smaller, are labeled with unfilled\ndots. Note that because of the inability of binding to PPxY-Mut-GST, the\nlight peptides for both Itch and YAP were missing, whereas both heavy and\nlight peptides were detected for nonspecific binding protein Actin, with an\nH/L ratio of 1.05. (D) Confirmation of PPxY motif–Itch interaction by GST\npull-down assay. Lysate from HEK293T cell was pulled down by either PPXY-\nWT or PPXY-Mut GST fusion proteins, followed by Western blotting using\nanti-Itch antibody. Ponseau S was used to stain fusion proteins on the\nmembrane. Note that equal amounts of PPxY-WT and PPxY-Mut GST fusion\nproteins were used for the GST pull-down assays.\n\nFig. 2. Itch promotes polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of\nLATS1 by 26S proteasome. (A) In vitro ubiquitination of LATS1 by Itch.\nImmunoprecipitated LATS1-myc on beads was used as a substrate in an\nubiquitination assay with a ligase buffer containing E1, E2, Ubiquitin-FLAG,\nATP, and Itch-GST or Itch-C830A-GST. After reaction, the beads containing\nLATS1-myc were washed extensively with modified RIPA buffer, followed\nby Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG antibody. (B) In vivo ubiquitination\nof LATS1 by Itch. Ubiquitin-HA and different combination of Itch-Myc, Itch-\nligase-dead mutant (Itch-C830A-Myc), and LATS1-FLAG were transfected\ninto COS7 cells. Ubiquitinated LATS1 was detected by immunoprecipitation\nof LATS1 with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by detection of ubiquitin using\nanti-HA antibody. (C) Proteasome inhibitor blocks Itch-induced LATS1 deg-\nradation. COS7 cells transfected with either LATS1-FLAG alone or LATS1-\nFLAG together with Itch-Myc were treated with either DMSO (control) or\nproteasome inhbitor (MG132). (D) Lysosome inhibitor fails to block Itch-\ninduced LATS1 degradation. COS7 cells transfected with either LATS1-FLAG\nalone or LATS1-FLAG together with Itch-Myc were treated with either DMSO\n(control) or lysosome inhibitor (Baf A1).\n\nHo et al.

Finally, to test\nwhich PPxY motifs of LATS1 are essential for interacting with\nItch, additional GST pull-down assays were performed with\nlysates expressing either a single or double PPxY mutant of\nLATS1. Importantly, although mutation of a single PPxY motif\nin LATS1 (LATS1-Y376A or LATS1-Y559A) reduces its bind-\ning to Itch-GST, mutation of both PPxY motifs (LATS1-Y376-\nY559) completely abolishes its binding to Itch-GST (Fig. 2D),\ndemonstrating that both PPxY motifs of LATS1 are important\nfor its interacting with Itch WW domains.\n\nDose-Dependent Degradation of LATS1 by Itch. Itch is an E3 ubiq-\nuitin ligase known to target multiple tumor-suppressor substrates\nfor ubiquitination and degradation (23). Because LATS1 is\na binding partner of Itch, we asked if LATS1 may also be an Itch-\nubiquitin substrate. To answer this question, we first tested if\noverexpression of increasing amounts of Itch can affect LATS1’s\nprotein abundance. Importantly, our results show that over-\nexpression of Itch induces significant down-regulation of LATS1\nin a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). On the other hand,\n\ncotransfection of LATS1 with increasing amounts of a ligase-\ndead Itch (Itch-C830A-Myc; C, cysteine; A, alanine) has no ef-\nfect on LATS1 (Fig. 3 B and C), suggesting that Itch ubiquitin\nligase activity is essential for its degradation of LATS1. However,\nno LATS1 degradation was observed when increasing Itch-WW-\nmut was used (Fig. 3C). In addition, increasing levels of Itch\nwere unable to degrade the LATS1-Y376A-Y559A mutant (Fig.\n3D). These results indicate that the interaction of LATS1 and\nItch is important for Itch-induced LATS1 degradation. To ex-\nclude the possibility that reduced degradation of LATS1 by Itch-\nC630A ligase dead mutant is because of reduced binding affinity\nto LATS1, we performed a Co-IP experiment with LATS1 and\nItch-C830A. As shown in Fig. 2A, similar to Itch-LATS1 in-\nteraction, LATS1 is strongly coimmunopreciptated by Itch-C830,\nsuggesting that the single-point mutation of Itch did not disrupt\nnormal LATS1–Itch interaction, but affected Itch’s function. To\nconfirm that Itch-mediated degradation of LATS1 is specific, we\nconducted two further experiments. First, we tested whether or\nnot Itch can degrade Ndr1, a LATS1 homolog that lacks a PPxY\nmotif for interaction with Itch (21). As expected, Itch was unable\nto degrade Ndr1 (Fig. S2). Next, we tested whether or not an-\nother E3 ubiquitin ligase β-TrCP, which lacks WW domains and\ntargets oncogene products rather than tumor suppressors for\ndegradation (25), can also degrade LATS1. As expected, β-TrCP\nubiquitin ligase was unable to affect stability of LATS1 (Fig. S3).\nTogether, these experiments strongly suggest that the destabi-\nlizing effect of Itch on LATS1 is specific. Additionally, to de-\ntermine if Itch directly promotes down-regulation of LATS1 at\nthe protein rather than mRNA levels, we performed a cyclohex-\nimide chase experiment in which protein synthesis is blocked and\nthe steady-state levels of LATS1 is measured in the presence or\nabsence of Itch. As shown in Fig. 3 E and F, although over-\nexpression of Itch efficiently facilitates LATS1 turnover, knock-\ndown of Itch inhibits LATS1 degradation upon inhibition of\nprotein synthesis. This finding suggests that Itch induces down-\nregulation of LATS1 directly at the protein level.\nMoreover, to further confirm our results from transfection ex-\n\nperiments, we used a lentiviral system and stably overexpressed\nItch in three different human cancer cell lines (MCF10A, HeLa,\nand MCF7). Importantly, in all of the three cell lines tested, a\nmarked decrease in endogenous LATS1 proteins was detected\nupon overexpression of Itch but not the lentiviral vector WPI\n(Fig. 3G). This finding suggests that the effect of Itch on LATS1\nis physiologically significant. Finally, to examine whether or not\nendogenous Itch can directly modulate the stability of endoge-\nnous LATS1, we stably knocked down Itch by two shItch con-\nstructs in MDA-MB-231 cells, which express high levels of endo-\ngenous Itch. Significantly, endogenous LATS1 is up-regulated\nupon knockdown of Itch with either one of the two shItch con-\nstructs (Fig. 4B), indicating Itch is oneof themajor ubiquitin ligases\nnegatively regulating LATS1 stability in physiological conditions.\n\nDegradation of LATS1 by Itch Through Polyubiquitination. Next, we\nsought to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Itch\ndegrades LATS1. Given that a key biochemical function of Itch\nis the ubiquitination of its interacting proteins, we first per-\nformed an in vitro ubiquitination assays using purified E1, E2, E3\n(Itch-GST), FLAG-tagged ubiquitin, and immunoprecipitated\nLATS1-myc. Our results show that Itch-GST rather than ligase-\ndead Itch-C830A-GST causes ubiquitination of LATS1 in vitro\n(Fig. 5A). In addition, we also carried out an in vivo ubiquiti-\nnation assay examining if Itch can catalyze ubiqutination of\nLATS1 in cells. As shown in Fig. 5B and Fig. S4, high molecular-\nweight polyubiquitinated forms of LATS1 were detected only\nupon addition of wild-type but not ligase-dead (C830A) or WW\ndomain mutant (WW-mut) Itch. This finding suggests that Itch,\nwith its ligase activity, directly catalyzes in vivo polyubiquitina-\ntion of LATS1. In general, polyubiqitinated proteins can be pro-\n\nFig. 3.

To determine which proteolysis system is responsible for\nLATS1 degradation by Itch, we tested the stability of LATS1\nupon treatment with either a proteasome inhbitor (MG132) or\nlysosome inhibitor (Bafamycin A1). Interestingly, although Itch\npromotes down-regulation of LATS1 under control conditions,\nthe LATS1 level is strongly stabilized upon addition of the pro-\nteasome inhibitor MG132 (Fig. 5C), but not the lysosome inhibitor\nBafamycin A1 (Fig. 5D). This finding suggests that Itch-mediated\ndegradation of LATS1 requires an intact 26S proteasome. Taken\ntogether, our results provide convincing evidence that Itch pro-\nmotes degradation of LATS1 by catalyzing its polyubiquitination\nand its subsequent proteolysis by the 26S proteasome.\n\nRegulation of LATS1 Downstream Signaling by Itch. Because LATS1\nis the central player of the Hippo-LATS signaling pathway, we\nwant to see whether down-regulation of LATS1 by Itch could\naffect components of the Hippo-LATS signaling. To date, the\nYAP and TAZ transcription coactivators are the only well-\nestablished kinase substrates of LATS1 (15, 19). Phosphorylation\nof YAP or TAZ oncoproteins by LATS1 is known to inhibit their\nactivities, thereby suppressing their transcriptional activation of\nvarious downstream oncogenes, such as Cyr61 and CTGF (Fig.\nS5) (19, 26, 27). Importantly, we found that upon stable over-\nexpression of Itch in HeLa cells, which express low levels of Itch\nand high levels of LATS1, not only is endogenous LATS1 effi-\nciently down-regulated, but phosphorylated levels of YAP and\nTAZ are also significantly reduced (pYAP and pTAZ) (Fig. 4A).\n\nThis finding suggests that overexpression of Itch strongly sup-\npresses LATS1’s kinase activity. Furthermore, we also found that\nItch overexpression promoted up-regulation of endogenous\nCyr61 and CTGF (Fig. 4A). Moreover, the effect of Itch on\nLATS1 and its downstream signaling is dependent of its ligase\nactivity and its interaction with LATS1, because stable over-\nexpression of Itch-C830A or Itch-WW-mut mutants in HeLa cells\nhas no effect on levels of LATS1, pYAP, pTAZ, Cyr61, and\nCTGF (Fig. 4A). In addition, in contrast to Itch overexpression,\nknockdown of Itch by two Itch shRNAs (shItch-1 and shItch-2) in\nMDA-MB231 cells (high Itch) has the opposite effect on LATS1\nand its downstream signaling (Fig. 4B). Finally, because we pre-\nviously showed that LATS1 inhibits YAP by phosphorylating and\nsequestering YAP in the cytoplasm, and loss of LATS1 causes\nenhanced nuclear translocation of YAP (19), we further exam-\nined whether overexpression of Itch affects subcellular localiza-\ntion of YAP. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type Itch,\nwhich leads to reduced LATS1, rather than its mutants (Itch-\nC830A or Itch-WW-mut) (Fig. 4A), induced enhanced nuclear\nlocalization of endogenous YAP in HeLa cells (Fig. 4C).\n\nFig. 4. Itch inhibits LATS1-mediated signaling. (A) Western blot analysis of\nLATS1 and its downstream signaling proteins after Itch over-expression.\nHeLa cells were stably infected with lentivirus expressing WPI (vector), Itch,\nItch-C830A, or Itch-WW-mut. (B) Western Blot analysis of endogenous LATS1\ncells upon shRNA knockdown of Itch.

Ponceau S staining of antibody heavy chain indicates\nequal amounts of anti-Myc antibody were used. (B) Interaction of endoge-\nnous LATS1 and Itch.

The key tumor-\nsuppressor functions of LATS1 are its ability to inhibit cell\nproliferation (such as in HeLa cells) or induce apoptosis (such as\nin MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 cells) (6, 7). Using established Itch-\noverexpressing HeLa cells (Fig. 4A), we found that overexpres-\nsion of wild-type rather than ligase-dead (Itch-C830A) or WW\ndomain mutant (Itch-WW-mut) Itch caused enhanced cell pro-\nliferation and colony formation in culture (Fig. 6 A and B),\nsuggesting that interaction and ubiquitination/degradation of\nLATS1 is essential for Itch-induced phenotype. In addition, by\ntransient overexpression of LATS1 alone or together with Itch in\nMCF7 breast cancer, we also found that overexpression of wild-\ntype Itch rather than its mutants dramatically inhibits LATS1-\ninduced cell death in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6C). In\ncontrast, knockdown of endogenous Itch using two different Itch\nshRNA constructs significantly enhanced LATS1-mediated cell\ndeath (Fig. 6D). Most significantly, knockdown of endogenous\nItch by two different shRNAs targeting Itch (shItch-1 or shItch-\n2) in MDA-MB231 cells caused enhanced endogenous LATS1\n\nand pYAP and reduced number of colony formation (repre-\nsenting survival tumor cells) in culture. Significantly, this phe-\nnotype can be reversed by knocking down LATS1 back to its\noriginal levels using shLATS1, suggesting that activation of\nLATS1 is responsible for Itch knockdown-induced apoptosis.\nTogether, these results provide convincing evidence that Itch is\nindeed a potent negative regulator of LATS1 in cancers.\n\nDiscussion\nLATS1 is a potent tumor suppressor found down-regulated in\nmany cancers. Although many studies have elucidated how\nLATS1 signals and functions in a cell, little is known regarding its\nmechanisms of regulation. Through an unbiased proteomics\nscreen, we identified Itch, a HECT class E3 ubiquitin ligase, as\na unique binding partner and negative regulator of LATS1. We\nfound that Itch promotes polyubiquitination and down-regula-\ntion of LATS1 by the 26S proteasome. Most significantly, by\ndestabilizing LATS1, Itch demonstrated strong inhibitory effects\non LATS1 downstream signaling and cell proliferation and ap-\noptotic function in various cancer cell lines.\nOur finding that Itch is the first negative regulator of LATS1\n\nhas several important implications. First, because LATS1 is\na central player of the Hippo-LATS1 pathway and can simulta-\nneously regulate various biological processes, such as tumori-\ngenesis, metastasis, organ size control, stem cell differentiation,\nand neural dendrite growth (12–14), our study is unique in\npresenting a potential for Itch in the regulation of all these\nfundamental biological processes. Second, because both LATS1\nand Itch are found expressed in a wide variety of human cell\ntypes (2, 23), our results suggest that, in addition to mRNA\ndown-regulation by promoter hypermethylation (10, 11), down-\nregulation of LATS1 at the protein level through protein ubiq-\nuitination may be a unique mechanism by which LATS1 is down-\nregulated in multiple cancer types. Future studies comparing the\nprotein expression profiles of LATS1 and Itch in human cancer\nmay therefore provide further insight as to how Itch negatively\nregulates LATS1 in cancer development. Last but not least,\nbecause Itch belongs to the Group I WW domain proteins, which\ninclude other WW domain-containing ubiquitin ligases, such as\noncoproteins NEDD4 and WWP1 (29), it is possible that they\nmay also bind to the PPxY motifs and cause degradation of\nLATS1. Therefore, it is very compelling to further examine how\nthese ubiquitin ligases coordinate with Itch in regulating LATS1\nstability and Hippo-LATS signaling during tumorigenesis.\nThrough this study, we verified that the LATS1-Itch binding is\n\nmediated through PPxY motifs of LATS1 and WW domains of\nItch. Importantly, PPxY motifs of LATS1 are well known as\na binding module for the LATS1 kinase substrates (19). YAP, for\ninstance, is a direct kinase substrate of LATS1, and it possesses\nWW domains that strongly recognize LATS1’s PPxY motifs (19).\nIt is therefore possible that Itch, with four WW domains, may\ncompete with YAP for LATS1 binding, as been recently described\nbetween YAP and Itch for binding to p73, another PPxY-motif\ncontaining tumor suppressor degraded by Itch (20). Because an\nincreased binding to Itch by LATS1 promotes oncogenesis and a\ndecreased binding to Itch suppresses oncogenic events, our find-\nings suggest that Itch may play a role in defining the fine balance\nbetween cell death and cell survival in human cancers. Hence,\ndevelopment of strategies that specifically disrupt LATS1 and\nItch interaction may be useful for driving tumor suppression\nin cancers.\nFinally, although our study demonstrated a role for Itch\n\nin negative regulation of LATS1, it is possible that LATS1 may\nalso negatively regulate Itch’s activity by phosphorylating Itch.\nThrough a sequence analysis on Itch, we found that Itch contains\na potential phosphorylate site, HFRVWS85 (H, Histidine; F,\nPhenylalanine; R, Arginine; V, Valine; W, Tryptophan; S, Ser-\nine,), which is consistent with the consensus phosphorylation\n\nFig. 6. Itch negatively regulates LATS1’s function. (A and B) Increased cell\nproliferation and colony formation after Itch over-expression. Cell pro-\nliferation (A) or colony formation (B) was analyzed using HeLa cells stably\nexpressing WPI, Itch-WT, Itch-C830, and Itch-WW-mut. (C) Inhibition of\nLATS1-mediated apoptosis by Itch overexpression. MCF7 cells were infected\nwith lentivirus expressing LATS1 alone or together with increasing amount\nof Itch, Itch-C830A, or Itch-WW-mut. Percent of cell death were measured at\n4 d postinfection using Trypan blue exclusion assay. (D) Enhancement of\nLATS1-mediated apoptosis by Itch knockdown. MDA-MB-231 cells expressing\nthe pGIPZ vector control or shItch-1 or shItch-2 were infected with LATS1\nlentivirus. Percent of cell death (Upper) were measured at 4 d postinfection\nusing the trypan blue exclusion assay. Expression of LATS1, Itch, and YAP/\npYAP (Lower) was examined by Western blot. (E) Knockdown of endoge-\nnous Itch inhibits colony formation through up-regulation of LATS1. MDA-\nMB231 cells were transiently infected with lentivirus expressing pGIPZ vector\n(control), shItch-1, or shItch-2 alone or together with shLATS1, followed by\nWestern blot analysis of protein expression (Lower) and colony formation\nassay (Upper). All numbers are mean and SD of three independent experi-\nments. *Statistically significant difference (P < 0.05).\n\n4874 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1101273108 Ho et al.\n\n\n\nmotif for LATS1 substrates, HxR/K/HxxS/T (K, Lysine; T,\nThreonine) (19). Because phosphorylation of substrates by\nLATS1 normally inhibit their function and Itch displayed onco-\ngenic function by degrading a variety of tumor suppressors,\nLATS1 may involve in the activation of multiple tumor sup-\npressors, such as p73, by phosphorylating and inactivating Itch.\nIndeed, several recent studies also described a role for serine/\nthreonine or tyrosine kinases in modulating Itch E3 ubiquitin\nligase activity through phosphorylation (31–33). Therefore, it will\nbe very interesting to further explore whether LATS1 regulates\nother suppressor pathways through phosphorylation and nega-\ntive regulation of Itch.\nIn conclusion, our study has identified Itch as a unique neg-\n\native regulator of suppressor LATS1. Further characterization of\ntheir functional interactions in mice and in clinical cancer\npatients will have great implication for the diagnosis, prognosis,\nand therapy of human cancers.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nPlasmid Construction. The LATS1-PPxY-WT (amino acids 526–655) and LATS1-\nPPxY-Mut (amino acids 526–655) plasmids were constructed as described\npreviously (1). For lentivirus production, Itch cDNA was first amplified by\nPCR using Itch-myc plasmid as a template, digested by PmeI, and sub-\nsequently cloned into the PmeI site of WPI lentiviral vector. The following\nprimers were used for PCR: Itch, sense primer (5′-GCGGAT CCGGTGGTAT-\nGTCTGACAGTGGATCACAAC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GTAACAATGCGG-\nCCG CTTACTACTCTTGTCCAAATCCTTCTGTTTCTTC-3′).\n\nIn Vivo Ubiquitination Assay. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with\nplasmids expressing ubiquitin-HA and LATS1-FLAG alone or together with\nItch-Myc using Lipofetamine 2000. At 24-h posttransfection, cells were\n\ntreated with 5 μM MG132 for an additional 24 before being lysed with\na modified RIPA buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5; 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl,\n1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.025% SDS). Twenty microliters\nof Protein A beads and 1 mg of each lysate sample was precleared, and then\nimmunoprecipitated by mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody. The\nubiquitin conjugates of LATS1 were detected by Western blotting using\nrabbit anti-HA (Y11) polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz).\n\nApoptosis and Cell Viability Assays. For functional analysis of LATS1 upon Itch\noverexpression, triplicates of 4 × 104 MCF7 cells were seeded to each well of\na 24-well plate 1 d before lentiviral infection. Before infection, cell numbers\nwere counted. Cells were infected with WPI, LATS1, LATS1 together with\nincreasing multiplicity of infection (4 or 6) of Itch. Four days postinfection,\ndetached and adherent cells were collected, and the percentage of cell\ndeath was measured using a Trypan blue exclusion assay, as previously de-\nscribed (27). For functional analysis of LATS1 upon Itch knockdown, tripli-\ncates of 4 × 104 MDA-MB-231 cells stably expressing either pGIPZ, shItch-1, or\nshItch-2 were seeded to each well of a 24-well plate 1 d before lentiviral\ninfection. Before infection, cell numbers were counted. WPI or LATS1were\ninfected at multiplicity of infection of 2. Four days postinfection, detached\nand adherent cells were collected, and the percentage of cell death was\nmeasured as described above.\n\nDetailed materials and method for SILAC screening, cell culture, lentiviral\nproduction, Co-IP, GST-pulldown, in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays,\nand colony formation assay can be found in SI Materials and Methods.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
