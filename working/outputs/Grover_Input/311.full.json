Janus-kinase and\nsignal transducer and activator of transcription\n( JAK-STAT) signalling pathway is implicated in the\npathogenesis of PsA.\nObjectives To examine the effect of tofacitinib\n( JAK inhibitor) on proinflammatory mechanisms in PsA.\nMethods Primary PsA synovial fibroblasts (PsAFLS)\nand ex vivo PsA synovial explants were cultured with\ntofacitinib (1 mM). PhosphoSTAT3 (pSTAT3),\nphosphoSTAT1 (pSTAT1), suppressor of cytokine\nsignaling-3 (SOCS3), protein inhibitor of activated Stat3\n(PIAS3) and nuclear factor kappa B cells (NFκBp65)\nwere quantified by western blot. The effect of tofacitinib\non PsAFLS migration, invasion, Matrigel network\nformation and matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)2/9 was\nquantified by invasion/migration assays and zymography.\nInterleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma-inducible protein 10\n(IP-10) monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, IL-\n17, IL-10, MMP3 and tissue inhibitor of\nmetalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) were assessed by ELISA.\nResults Tofacitinib significantly decreased pSTAT3,\npSTAT1, NFκBp65 and induced SOCS3 and PIAS3\nexpression in PsAFLS and synovial explant cultures\n(p<0.05). Functionally, PsAFLS invasion, network\nformation and migration were inhibited by tofacitinib\n(all p<0.05). In PsA explant, tofacitinib significantly\ndecreased spontaneous secretion of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1,\nMMP9/MMP2, MMP3 (all p<0.05) and decreased the\nMMP3/TIMP3 ratio (p<0.05), with no effect observed\nfor IP-10 or IL-10.\nConclusions This study further supports JAK-STAT\ninhibition as a therapeutic target for the treatment\nof PsA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nPsoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory\narthritis associated with psoriasis (Ps) and charac-\nterised by synovitis and progressive destruction of\narticular cartilage and bone. One of the earliest\nevents is new vessel formation and invasion result-\ning in a self-perpetuating and persistent infiltration\nof leucocytes, transforming the synovium into an\naggressive tumour-like ‘pannus’. Previous studies\nhave demonstrated distinct macroscopic vascularity\nin the PsA joint characterised by elongated, tortu-\nous vessels which is associated with increased\nexpression of cytokines, angiogenic growth factors\nand decreased cell apoptosis.1 2 This facilitates PsA\n\nsynovial fibroblasts (FLS) to invade adjacent cartil-\nage and bone resulting in joint destruction.\nPsA synovium is the target of interplay for many\n\nproinflammatory cytokines and growth factors,\nwith key circulating mediators controlling cell\ntraffic from the blood stream into the underlying\ntissue. Recently developed agents for PsA target\nIL12p40, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-17,3–5 several of\nwhich signal through the Janus-Kinase ( JAK)\nfamily of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases.\nActivated JAKs recruit and activate signal trans-\nducer and activator of transcription (STATs), which\nin turn drive gene transcription.6 The specific\nJAK-STAT activated depends on the cytokine signal\nwhich includes the interferons (IFNs) and\nIFN-related cytokines, the common γ-chain cyto-\nkines, and the IL-6-type cytokines. Several studies\nhave demonstrated a key role for JAK-STAT signal-\nling in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis\n(RA).7 8 Previous studies have shown increased\npSTAT3 and phosphoSTAT1 (pSTAT1) expression\nin Ps lesional skin9 and shown that IFNγ, IL-6 and\nIL-22 can induce pSTAT1 or pSTAT3 in keratino-\ncytes;10 however, no study to date has examined\ntheir expression or regulation in PsA synovium or\nfibroblasts. Tofacitinib is a drug of the JAK inhibitor\nclass and is currently approved for the treatment of\nRA in 27 countries. A recent study in patients with\nRA demonstrated that tofacitinib downregulated\ninflammatory pathways in RA synovial tissue;11\n\nhowever, a direct effect of tofacitinib on PsA syn-\novial inflammation has not been shown to date.\n\nMETHODS\nPatient demographics, arthroscopy and culture\nof synovial fibroblasts\nSee online supplementary file 1.\n\nSynovial tissue explant culture ex vivo\nTo investigate the effect of tofacitinib (Selleck\nChemicals LLC; Houston, Texas, USA) on cytokine\nproduction in the arthritic joint, an ex vivo PsA syn-\novial explant model was established. This system\nmaintains the synovial architecture and cell–cell\ncontact and spontaneously releases proinflammatory\nmediators. PsA synovial biopsies were sectioned and\ncultured immediately following arthroscopy (to\nmaintain maximal activity of the inflamed syno-\nvium) in 96-well plates (Falcon, Franklin Lakes,\nNew Jersey, USA) in RPMI-1640 supplemented\nwith streptomycin (100 units/mL) and penicillin\n(100 units/mL) for 24 h at 37°C in 5% CO2.\n\nOpen Access\nScan to access more\n\nfree content\n\nGao W, et al.

Tofacitinib inhibited pSTAT3 and\npSTAT1 expression in PsAFLS when compared with vehicle\ncontrol (figure 1B, D). In parallel, tofacitinib induced negative\ninhibitors of STATs, SOCS3 and PIAS3 compared with vehicle\ncontrol (figure 1C, D).\n\nTofacitinib inhibited PsAFLS invasion and migration\nFigure 2A shows representative images, demonstrating the\ninhibitory effect of tofacitinib on PsAFLS migration, in compari-\nson with DMSO control where repopulation of wound margins\nwas observed. Representative images of decreased PsAFLS inva-\nsion following culture with tofacitinib are shown in figure 2B,\nan effect that was significant compared with vehicle control\n(p<0.05; figure 2C). Furthermore, tofacitinib significantly\ninhibited PsAFLS network formation (figure 2D, E; p<0.05).\n\nTofacitinib regulates STAT signalling in whole tissue PsA\nsynovial explant cultures\nTo further examine the effect of tofacitinib, PsA synovial\nexplants were cultured with tofacitinib for 72 h. Figure 3A(i–ii)\ndemonstrates intact tissue morphology and cell–cell contact fol-\nlowing culture, with lining-layer, blood vessels and synovial infil-\ntrate clearly visible.

In contrast, tofacitinib induced expression of\nSOCS3 and PIAS3 (figure 3C, D).\n\nInhibition of proinflammatory mediators from\nPsA explant cultures\nTofacitinib significantly inhibited spontaneous secretion of IL-6,\nIL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) from PsA\nexplant cultures (*p<0.05; figure 3E) with no effect observed for\nIFN-gamma-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) or IL-10 (figure 3E).\nIL-17 levels were undetectable. Furthermore, tofacitinib inhibited\nNFκBp65 in PsA explants and PsAFLS, a key transcriptional\nfactor in the inflamed joint (figure 3E). Tofacitinib significantly\ninhibited matrix metallopeptidase (MMP)3 expression from PsA\nsynovial explants (p<0.05; figure 3F), had no effect on tissue\ninhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) (figure 3F) and inhib-\nited the MMP3/TIMP3 ratio (figure 3F). Finally tofacitinib inhib-\nited MMP2 and MMP9 activity as observed by gelatine\nzymography (figure 3F).\n\nDISCUSSION\nTo date, no study has examined JAK-STAT or the effect of tofa-\ncitinib in primary cells isolated from PsA synovial biopsies. In\nthis study, tofacitinib significantly decreased pSTAT1, pSTAT3 in\nPsAFLS and PsA synovial explant cultures ex vivo. In parallel,\ntofacitinib increased SOCS3 and PIAS3 expression\n\ndemonstrating negative feedback inhibition. Functionally, tofaci-\ntinib significantly decreased PsAFLS invasion, migration and\nnetwork formation. Finally, tofacitinib significantly decreased\nspontaneous secretion of key proinflammatory cytokines, the\nMMP/TIMP ratio and NFκBp65 expression. Thus tofacitinib\ninhibits proinflammatory and invasive mechanisms which are\ncritically involved in the pathogenesis of PsA.\n\nThis is the first study to demonstrate regulation of pSTAT3 and\npSTAT1 in primary PsAFLS and PsA synovial tissue. Only one\nprevious study in PsA has examined STATsignalling, and this was\nin synovial fluid (SF) T cells where increased expression of JAK1,\npSTAT3 and pSTAT1 was demonstrated compared with periph-\neral blood (PB) of healthy controls (HC), suggesting activation of\nJAK-STATsignalling at the site of inflammation.12 Ps studies have\nshown that increased pSTATexpression is associated with epider-\nmal hyper-proliferation, expression of which was modulated by\nIFNγ, IL-6 and IL-22.9 10 This is consistent with RA studies,\nshowing that pSTAT3 is associated with synovial inflammation,\nlining-layer hyperplasia and synovial pO2 levels,\n\n13 14 and that\nSTAT3 modulates Th17 differentiation in RA SF and induces\nRAFLS survival.13\n\nIn this study, tofacitinib inhibited pSTAT1, pSTAT3 and\nNFκBp65 in PsAFLS and PsA explants, an effect that was paral-\nleled by induction of both SOCS3 and PIAS3. SOCS inhibits\ncytokine signalling by acting as kinase inhibitors to JAKs or\ncompetitive binding for docking sites with STAT. PIAS3 binds to\n\nFigure 2 Tofacitinib inhibited PsAFLS invasion.

In parallel, tofacitinib inhibited PsAFLS invasion, migra-\ntion and network formation, all associated with progressive and\ndestructive joint disease. While the precise mechanisms by\nwhich tofacitinib inhibits invasion/migration is unclear, it may\ninvolve (i) inhibition of key cytokines such as IL-6 which results\nin negative feedback inhibition, (ii) blockade of RhoGTPases\n(cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA) or growth factors such as platelet-\nderived growth factor (PDGF), which are critical for cell move-\nment, migration and invasion or (iii) through the observed\neffects of STAT signalling on NFκB which is known in other cell\ntypes to mediate proliferation and invasive mechanisms via\nphosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase or\nprotein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway.15\n\nTofacitinib significantly inhibited IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MMP3\nand MMP2/9 spontaneous secretion from PsA explants, with no\n\nsignificant effect on IP-10 or IL-10.
