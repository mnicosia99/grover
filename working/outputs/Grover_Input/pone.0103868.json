Phosphorylation of Profilin 1 Is an Important\nSignaling Event in Breast Cancer Progression\nWasia Rizwani*, Aneesa Fasim¤, Deepshikha Sharma, Divya J. Reddy, Nabil A. M. Bin Omar,\n\nSurya S. Singh*\n\nDepartment of Biochemistry, Osmania University, Hyderabad, A.P., India\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Profilins are actin-modulating proteins regulating many intracellular functions based on their multiple and\ndiverse ligand interactions. They have been implicated to play a role in many pathological conditions such as allergies,\ncardiovascular diseases, muscular atrophy, diabetes, dementia and cancer. Post-translational modifications of profilin 1 can\nalter its properties and subsequently its function in a cell. In the present study, we identify the importance of\nphosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 (S137) residue in breast cancer progression.\n\nMethods/Principal Findings: We found elevated profilin 1 (PFN) in human breast cancer tissues when compared to\nadjacent normal tissues. Overexpression of wild-type profilin 1 (PFN-WT) in breast cancer MCF7 cells made them more\nmigratory, invasive and adherent independent in comparison to empty vector transfected cells. Mutation in serine\nphosphorylation site (S137) of profilin 1 (PFN-S137A) significantly abrogated these properties. Mutation affecting actin-\nbinding ability (PFN-R74E) of profilin 1 enhanced its tumorigenic function whereas mutation affecting its poly-L-proline\nbinding function (PFN-H133S) alleviated these mechanisms in breast cancer cells. PFN-WT was found to activate matrix\nmetalloproteinases by zymography, MMP2 and MMP9 in presence of PDBu (phorbol 12, 13 dibutyrate, PI3K agonist) to\nenhance migration and invasion in MCF7 cells while PFN-S137A did not. Phosphorylation increased migration and invasion\nin other mutants of profilin 1. Nuclear profilin levels also increased in the presence of PDBu.\n\nConclusions: Previous studies show that profilin could be executing a dual role in cancer by either suppressing or\npromoting tumorigenesis in a context dependent manner. In this study we demonstrate for the first time that\nphosphorylation of profilin 1 at serine 137 enhances oncogenic properties in breast cancer cells. Inhibitors targeting profilin\n1 phosphorylation directly or indirectly through inhibition of kinases that phosphorylate profilin could be valuable\ntherapeutic agents that can alter its activity and thereby control the progression of cancer.\n\nCitation: Rizwani W, Fasim A, Sharma D, Reddy DJ, Bin Omar NAM, et al.

Early detection and treatment is\n\nprolonging life expectancy in breast cancer patients. Mortality due\n\nto breast cancer has decreased significantly in the past decade;\n\nhowever, many patients die due to disease relapse and metastasis.\n\nWhile many nonmetastatic breast tumors are initially hormone\n\ndependent, most acquire hormonal autonomy at later stages to\n\nbecome metastatic [2]. Cell migration and invasion are important\n\nsteps towards breast cancer progression and metastasis that require\n\ndynamic cytoskeletal and cell membrane rearrangement for cell\n\nmotility. Profilin (PFN), an actin modulating protein, is an\n\nabundant cytoskeletal protein and widely distributed in eukaryotic\n\ncells [3]. Profilin and its isoforms are considered to be important\n\nregulators of the actin-based cytoskeleton. Under in vitro condi-\ntions, profilin in high amounts inhibits actin polymerization by\n\nsequestering actin monomer from F-actin or, inversely when\n\npresent in low amounts promotes actin polymerization in\n\nappropriate circumstances [4–6]. It has been shown that profilin\n\n1 promotes membrane protrusion, cell migration and invasion\n\nwhile profilin 2 suppresses these processes in breast cancer [7]. Its\n\ninteraction with PI(4,5)P2 (Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate),\n\na component of the phosphatidylinositol cycle, serves as a link\n\nthrough which the signaling pathways communicate with the\n\ndynamics of the actin cytoskeleton [8,9]. Post-translational\n\nmodifications (PTM), such as nitration and phosphorylation, of\n\nprofilin 1 have biological implications [10–12]. Phosphorylation at\n\nserine residue (S137) allows it to interact with greater affinity to\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nwww.cdc.gov\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0103868&domain=pdf\n\n\nactin and proline rich proteins such as p85a, the regulatory\nsubunit of PI3K (Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase), a lipid kinase with\n\ntumor promoting activity [12]. It is increasingly evident that\n\nprofilin is associated with important signaling proteins known to be\n\ninvolved in transformation, such as PI3K (apoptosis) and Protein\n\nKinase C (PKC) (tumorigenicity) [13,14]. However, the role of\n\nserine phosphorylation of profilin in cancer remains to be\n\nexplored.\n\nProfilin 1 has been extensively studied in breast cancer cell lines\n\nand mouse models for breast cancer [14–16]. Immunohistochem-\n\nical analysis of human breast cancers revealed intermediate to low\n\nlevels of profilin 1 expression [16]. Differential expression of\n\nprofilin was reported in different cancers suggesting the complexity\n\nin the role of profilin in cancer [17,18]. Studies supporting its role\n\nin cellular proliferation, migration and invasion in breast cancer\n\ndiffered suggesting a dichotomous role for profilin 1 in breast\n\ncancer progression thereby necessitating further studies in this\n\narea. Among its different ligands, it is reported that profilin’s\n\nfunction as a tumor suppressor depends on its actin binding ability\n\n[17]. Our present data on human breast cancer tissues from\n\nIndian population revealed enhanced expression of profilin 1\n\nwhen compared to adjacent normal tissues of the breast. Previous\n\ndata from our lab demonstrated that phosphoprofilin (S137) binds\n\nto actin monomers with higher affinity and therefore might alter\n\nactin polymerization. Any change in actin polymerization affects\n\ncell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. A recent study\n\ndemonstrated similar effects due to phosphorylation of profilin at\n\ntyrosine Y129 and its potential role in facilitating adult angiogen-\n\nesis in tissue wound healing [10]. Phosphoprofilin (pY129) also\n\nfacilitated glioblastoma progression by endothelial secretion of\n\nangiocrine factors that induced hypoxia inducible factor 1a\n(HIF1a) stabilization and accumulation in normoxic conditions\n[19]. We hypothesized that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137\n\ncould be crucial in breast cancer progression. Studies presented\n\nhere demonstrate that S137 phosphorylation of profilin 1 not only\n\naugment migration and invasion in breast cancer cells (MCF7) but\n\nalso enable them to become anchorage independent. Other\n\nmutations in profilin 1 that hinder profilin’s interactions with actin\n\nor poly-L-proline (PLP) containing proteins demonstrated en-\n\nhanced tumorigenic properties indicating the significance of\n\nserine phosphorylation of profilin in cancer progression and the\n\npotential in making pS137 a chemotherapeutic target to curb\n\nbreast cancer.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nSubjects\nPrimary, non-invasive and invasive breast carcinomas following\n\nradical mastectomy at different tumor stages (T1-4N0-1M0) of\n\nfemale human subjects (27 ductal carcinoma and 3 lobular\n\ncarcinoma cases) belonging to varying age groups from 40–70\n\nyears were used for the study. Normal tissue adjacent to the tumor\n\nfrom the same breast was used as control. The nature of the tissue\n\nwas confirmed by histopathological studies. Prior written consent\n\nfrom patients was obtained before tissue samples were collected\n\nfollowing mastectomy and the samples were not exclusively used\n\nfor this study and not meant for commercial use. The study and\n\nthe method of tissue collection were approved by the ‘‘Institutional\n\nEthics Committee for Biomedical Research’’, Hyderabad, India\n\nand Osmania University.\n\nCollection and processing of breast tissue samples\nAfter surgical resection (mastectomy), samples were collected in\n\nice-cold Tris- buffered saline (10 mM Tris, pH 7.2 and 0.9%\n\nNaCl) and immediately processed for future analysis. Tissues were\n\nground in Remi homogenizer on ice in tissue lysis buffer (40 mM\n\nTris buffer, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mM b-\nME, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 130 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF,\n\n1 mM Na3VO4 and protease inhibitor cocktail) and centrifuged at\n\n160006g for 20 min at 4uC. The supernatant obtained was used\nfor western blotting analyses.\n\nIsolation of primary epithelial cells from breast tissue\n1 g of breast tissue (tumor and normal) derived after mastec-\n\ntomy was cut up manually into small pieces, approximately 0.5 cm\n\ncubed, collected and washed in ice-cold Kreb’s Ringer buffer\n\n(116 mM NaCl, 4.2 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.6 mM\n\nNaH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, 22 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose,\n\npH 7.4). The tissue was digested overnight at 37uC in a shaking\nincubator at 50 rpm with 0.5 mg/ml collagenase (Type IV, sigma)\n\nin 5 ml RPMI medium (RPMI 1640 media containing 2 mM L-\n\nglutamine, 100U of penicillin/ml, 100 mg streptomycin/ml and\n10% fetal calf serum). Following enzyme digestion, the fat layer\n\nwas decanted by centrifuging at 10006g for 5 min at room\ntemperature (RT) and washed several times with the buffer. The\n\ncell-rich supernatant was backflushed through 60 m and 50 m\nmeshes to isolate breast organoids from red blood cells, fibroblasts\n\nand endothelial cells. The cells were disaggregated by pipetting in\n\nmedia containing 0.25% trypsin-EDTA followed by filtration\n\nthrough 40 m meshes. The cell pellet was collected and washed\nthree more times to yield a predominantly single cell suspension\n\n[20]. The final pellet was resuspended in 1 ml media and the\n\ncells were counted on cytometer after trypan blue staining. The\n\ncells were lysed in M2 lysis buffer (20 mM tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% NP-\n\n40, 250 mM NaCl, 3 mM EGTA, 3 mM EDTA, 5 mM NaF,\n\n5 mM Na3VO4 and 5 mg/ml protease inhibitor cocktail) and\nthe lysate was cleared by centrifuging at 120006g for 15 min at\n4uC.\n\nCell Culture\nMCF7 cells were purchased from NCCS (National Center for\n\nCell Science), Pune, India (previously published in [21]). MCF7\n\ncells were grown in MEM supplemented with 0.01 mg/ml Insulin,\n\n10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution.\n\nMCF7 cells transfected with profilin 1 and mutants were\n\nmaintained in the above media supplemented with 800 mg/ml\nG418. Insulin and G418 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,\n\nUSA.\n\nWestern blot analyses\nTotal protein in clear supernatants obtained from breast tissue\n\nand cell lysates was estimated by Bradford’s method according to\n\nthe manufacturer’s protocol (Sigma-Aldrich). 50 mg protein from\ntissue lysates and cell lysates was subjected to 10% tricine SDS-\n\nPAGE [22] and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The\n\nmembrane was blocked with 3% gelatin in TTBS buffer (10 mM\n\nTris, 154 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5) for 1 hr, then\n\nwashed with TTBS (4610 ml) and incubated with rabbit anti-\nprofilin 1 antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Novus biologicals) or rabbit\n\nanti-PKCf antibodies (1:500, in-house) and anti-actin antibodies\n(1:3000, Sigma) for 2 hr. After washings with TTBS, the blot was\n\nincubated with horse radish peroxidase conjugated secondary anti-\n\nrabbit/anti-mouse goat IgG for 2 hr. The blot was then\n\ncolorimetrically developed using NBT/BCIP (Amersham Phar-\n\nmacia Biotech).\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

MTT reagent (diluted from a 4 mg/ml solution in PBS) was\n\nadded to all the wells at a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml and\n\nthe cells were further incubated for 4 hr at 37uC. The reaction was\nterminated by adding 200 ml/well dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and\nabsorbance was read at 570 nm in an ELISA plate reader. Wells\n\ncontaining complete media alone was used as blank and the\n\naverage values subtracted from the average values of all clones.\n\nThe assay was repeated three times and analyzed using two-sided\n\nStudent’s t test. Data points represent the mean6s.d and p,0.005\nwas considered significant.\n\nSoft agar growth assay\nAnchorage independent growth was assayed by the soft agar\n\ngrowth assay as described elsewhere [27]. The first step involved\n\nplating a bottom layer of 0.6% agar in serum-free media in 12-well\n\nplates. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min\n\nto solidify the agar. Cells were harvested by trypsinization and\n\n16104 cells were mixed with 0.3% agarose (made in complete\nmedia) and layered carefully on the top of existing 0.6% agarose.\n\nThe plates were covered with 1 ml of medium supplemented with\n\n10% FBS and incubated at 37uC in a 5% CO2 incubator for\n10days. Complete media was added every 2 days to the test wells.\n\nAt the end of 10days, cell colonies with .100 mm in diameter\nwere imaged and counted under a microscopic field at 2.56\nmagnification. Mean colony count was based on numbers from 5\n\ndifferent fields imaged under 2.56 magnification from two\nindependent experiments done in duplicate for each treatment\n\ncondition and was analyzed using two-sided Student’s t test.\n\nWound healing assay\n56104 cells were plated in a 6-well plate in triplicate and\n\nallowed to grow to confluency. Cells were washed and left in\n\nserum-free media for 5 hr. A scratch was made and media was\n\nadded that was either only serum-free or with 200 nM PDBu\n\n(phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate) or with 20 mM LY294002/200 nM\nPDBu. Images were captured at 106 magnification using Leica\nMicroscope at zero hour and again at 24 hr. The scratch area at\n\nzero hour and empty area not covered by migrated cells after\n\n24 hr was analyzed with ImagePro software. The assay was\n\nrepeated three times. Data points represent the mean6s.d. from\n\nfive fields of uncovered scratch area from three independent\n\nexperiments and p,0.05 was considered significant.\n\nCell Invasion assay\nInvasion assay was performed as per the protocol published by\n\nDasgupta et al [27]. MCF7 overexpressing profilin 1 and its\n\nmutant clones were harvested by trypsinization and 16105 cells\nwere placed in the top chamber of boyden filters as untreated/\n\ntreated with 200 nM PDBu or a combination of 20 mM LY294002\nand 200 nM PDBu in serum-free media. The filters were pre-\n\ncoated with 100 mg/ml ECM (BD Biosciences) and incubated for\n4 hr at 37uC before adding cells and the assay was performed\naccording to the protocol [27]. Invaded cells were stained with\n\nhematoxylin and images for 6 different fields per treatment were\n\ncaptured using 406magnification using a Leica microscope. The\nassay was repeated twice in duplicate and analyzed using two-\n\nsided Student’s t test. Data points represent the mean6s.d. and\np,0.05 was considered significant.\n\nFlow cytometry\nAsynchronously growing MCF7 clones overexpressing profilin\n\nand its mutants were treated with hypotonic buffer (1 mg/ml\n\nsodium citrate and 0.3% Igepal) for 20 min. The buffer digests the\n\ncytoplasm and nuclei detach from the plate. Nuclei are gently\n\npipetted a few times and collected in an eppendorf for Green\n\nFluorescence acquisition [28]. Similarly, 10\n5\n\ncells of each clone\n\nwere plated and serum starved for 24 hr. Cells were then treated\n\nwith DMSO control/200 nM PDBu/a combination of 20 mM\nLY294002 and 200 nM PDBu for 24 hr. Nuclei were harvested\n\nand subjected to flow cytometry for Green Fluorescence acquisi-\n\ntion. The data was acquired with flowcytometer (Millipore Guava\n\n8 HT easycyte). 50000 events were acquired with flow rate of\n\nFigure 2.

Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged to\n\nremove debris. Samples were concentrated 10times using a\n\ncentricon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) from 2 ml to 0.2 ml.\n\nZymography was performed as described previously by Toth M\n\net al., [30] with a little modification. Samples were loaded on a\n\n10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel incorporated with 0.1% gelatin\n\n(Sigma) for electrophoresis. MMP2 and MMP9 zymographic\n\nstandards were used as positive controls (Chemicon). After\n\nelectrophoresis, MMPs were allowed to renature by washing the\n\ngel twice in 50 ml of 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min, incubated for\n\n18 hr at 37uC in developing buffer, and stained for 1 hr with 0.5%\nCoomassie brilliant blue G250. After destaining gelatinolytic activity\n\nwas visualized as a transparent band against a blue background. Gels\n\nwere imaged using a digital imaging analysis system (Bio-Rad). The\n\nassays were repeated three independent times.\n\nStatistical Analysis\nAll data was analyzed statistically by two sided student’s t test in\n\nMicrosoft Office 2007 and statistical significance was estimated.\n\nDensitometric analysis of western blots was carried out with\n\nImageJ software. Flow cytometry data was analyzed using FlowJo\n\nsoftware.\n\nResults\n\nHuman breast cancer tissues and primary cells derived\nfrom them express high levels of profilin 1\n\nPublished results on levels of profilin in different cancer tissues/cell\n\nlines are contradictory. Western blotting analyses was performed on\n\nlysates prepared from patient samples for breast cancer and adjacent\n\nnormal breast tissues. Profilin 1 levels were significantly higher in\n\nbreast cancer tissues compared to their adjacent normal counterparts\n\n(Figure 1A). Densitometric analysis of the western blots revealed\n\nprofilin 1 was 3.662.5-fold (*p,0.01) elevated in cancer tissues\n\n(Figure 1B). Simultaneously, primary epithelial cells were isolated\n\nfrom the same patient samples and lysates were subjected to western\n\nblot analysis for profilin 1. A representative western blot is presented\n\nin Figure 1D and densitometric analysis of the western blots show a\n\n1.660.3- fold (*p,0.03) increase in profilin 1 levels in cells isolated\n\ndirectly from the breast cancer tissues when compared to adjacent\n\nnormal tissues (Figure 1E).\n\nPost-translational modification such as phosphorylation can\n\nalter the function of cytoskeletal-associated proteins in tumorigen-\n\nesis; since profilin 1 is known to undergo phosphorylation at\n\nSer137 preferentially by PKCf, an enzyme with potential role in\nbreast cancer cell chemotaxis and tumor invasion [31–33]; we also\n\nexamined PKCf levels by western blotting in breast cancer and\nadjacent normal tissues (Figure 1A, middle panel). Figure 1C is a\n\ndensitometric representation of increased PKCf expression\n(1.660.5-fold, *p,0.05) in breast cancer tissues. Elevated protein\n\nlevels of PKCf in breast cancer tissues were indicative of a\nphosphorylation event targeting profilin 1 too. Therefore, we\n\nstudied the probable role of profilin 1 phosphorylation at serine\n\nresidue (S137) in breast cancer.\n\nOverexpression of profilin 1-wild type and profilin 1\nmutants in breast cancer cell line, MCF7\n\nSince profilin 1 levels were high in patients with breast cancer,\n\nwe overexpressed profilin 1 and some of its mutants in MCF7 cells\n\nto study their effect on cancer progression. MCF7 cells were\n\ntransfected with each of the following vectors individually: EGFP-\n\nN1 (Empty Vector, designated as EV), GFP-Profilin 1-wild type\n\n(PFN-WT), GFP-Profilin 1-S137A (mutant for serine 137 phos-\n\nphorylation site; PFN-S137A), GFP-Profilin 1-R74E (mutant for\n\nactin-binding site, PFN-R74E) and GFP-Profilin 1-H133S (mutant\n\nfor poly-L-proline (PLP) sequence binding, PFN-H133S). Expres-\n\nsion of profilin clones was studied by confocal microscopy. Left\n\npanel depicts images of GFP-Profilin and its mutants, middle panel\n\nshows DAPI images and right panel shows merged images for each\n\nclone (Figure 2). Each clone showed varying localization of GFP-\n\nProfilin. EV expression was observed in the nucleus and\n\ncytoplasm. PFN-WT, PFN-S137A and PFN-H133S showed\n\ncytoplasmic and nuclear expression. Of these, PFN-H133S was\n\npredominantly cytoplasmic and PFN-R74E was mostly nuclear\n\nwith little cytoplasmic expression. These results indicate that\n\ninteraction of profilin with actin is essential to maintain profilin in\n\nthe cytoplasm. PFN-H133S showed the least expression of nuclear\n\nprofilin suggesting that interaction with PLP-containing proteins\n\ncould be essential for its nuclear translocation. Simultaneously,\n\nlysates were prepared from MCF7 cells expressing different clones\n\nof profilin and subjected to western blotting with anti-profilin\n\nantibodies. EV did not show over-expressed profilin whereas all\n\nthe clones showed a band corresponding to GFP-profilin (41 kDa).\n\nEndogenous cellular profilin 1 (14 kDa) was observed in all the\n\nlanes including EV and actin was used as loading control (42 kDa)\n\n(Figure 3A). Next, we determined the nuclear expression alone of\n\nGFP-profilin and mutants in asynchronously growing MCF7 cells\n\nby subjecting them to hypotonic solution that bursts the cytoplasm\n\nbut leaves the nuclei intact and detached from the plate. The\n\nnuclei are collected as a single cell suspension and subjected to flow\n\ncytometric analysis (Figure 3B). Untransfected MCF7 cells were\n\nused to gate the positive nuclei from the clones. All the clones\n\nshowed similar numbers of nuclei that were positive for profilin 1.\n\nFigure 3C–3G show the flow cytometry dot plots of GFP-positive\n\nnuclei from asynchronously growing EV (96.1%), PFN-WT\n\n(85.9%), PFN-S137A (92.8%), PFN-R74E (94.6%) and PFN-\n\nH133S (91.3%) respectively. These clones were then selected in\n\nneomycin (G418) to obtain a 100% positive polyclonal population\n\noverexpressing profilin 1 and its mutants respectively.\n\nOverexpression of profilin 1 facilitates cell growth and\nanchorage independent growth that is further enhanced\nby its phosphorylation at Serine137\n\nWe first assessed the growth ability of transfected cells in culture\n\nat 24 hr, 48 hr, 72 hr and 7days of plating in complete media by\n\nMTT assay (Figure 4A). PFN-WT demonstrated the highest\n\nviability at all time points studied followed by PFN-R74E and\n\nPFN-H133S. PFN-S137A showed the least growth rate and was\n\ncomparable to EV transfected MCF7 cells (***p,0.005). Anchor-\n\nage independency is one of the hallmarks of cancer and this\n\nfeature allows tumor cells to invade adjacent tissues and lead to\n\nmetastasis [34]. To determine which of the profilin 1 mutants\n\nmight interfere with the tumorigenic property of MCF7 cells, soft\n\nagar assay was performed and colonies above 100 mm where\ncounted and plotted. Figure 4B shows representative images of\n\ncolonies in soft agar of different mutants of profilin 1 and\n\nfigure 4C is a graphic representation of the average number of\n\ncolonies for each clone from 5 different fields under 2.56\nmagnification. We observed that MCF7 cells expressing PFN-\n\nWT formed significantly more and larger colonies in soft agar\n\ncompared to EV-expressing MCF7 cells (**p,0.01). PFN-S137A\n\nformed smaller and less number of colonies than EV and 42\n\npercent less number of colonies (***p,0.005) than PFN-WT,\n\nthereby indicating that (S137) phosphorylation of profilin 1\n\nfacilitates anchorage independency in breast cancer cells. Actin\n\nmutant (PFN-R74E) formed 70 percent more colonies (**p,0.01)\n\nthan PFN-WT, consistent with previous reports demonstrating\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\nFigure 4.

Defect in PLP binding ability of PFN (PFN-\n\nH133S) did not allow any colony formation in soft agar, though\n\nthe viability of these cells in monolayer cultures was fairly\n\ncomparable to PFN-R74E till 72 hr and decreasing by 7days.\n\nThese results were in corroboration with Wittenmeyer’s study [17]\n\nreporting the inability of PFN-H133S to form tumors in mice.\n\nPhosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 leads to enhanced\nmigration and invasion\n\nWhether phosphorylation of profilin 1 affects migration and\n\ninvasion of breast cancer cells expressing various profilin 1 mutants\n\nwas next assessed by wound healing assays and boyden chamber\n\nassays respectively. PKCf activity can be reduced by the\npharmacological inhibitors of PI3K. Previous in vivo studies from\nour lab have demonstrated that phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu),\n\na protein kinase C activator (PKC), phosphorylates profilin 1 at\n\nSerine 137 and the effect is reversed by LY294002, an inhibitor of\n\nPI3K and subsequently PKCf [12,35]. We studied their effect on\nprofilin 1 mediated migration and invasion. MCF7 cells overex-\n\npressing profilin 1 and its mutants were grown to confluency and a\n\nscratch was made with a pipet tip. Images were captured at 206\nmagnification of the scratch at zero hour for each treatment. After\n\n24 hr following treatments, images were captured and non-\n\nmigrated area was analyzed. Figure 5 shows representative images\n\nof the wound and migrated cells into the wound for all the clones.\n\nAll clones migrated to some extent into the wound at 24 hr in\n\nserum-free media. PDBu induced significant migration in all\n\nclones but not in the PFN-S137A mutant clone, therefore\n\ndemonstrating that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at Serine 137 is\n\nan important event in promoting migration of MCF7 cells. PFN-\n\nWT and PFN-R74E expressing cells migrate more than EV\n\nexpressing cells upon treatment with PDBu (**p,0.05). Pre-\n\ntreatment of cells with LY294002 significantly abrogated migra-\n\ntion of MCF7 cells overexpressing PFN-WT, PFN-R74E and\n\nPFN-H133S (**p,0.05). PFN-S137A did not show much change\n\nin migration at 24 hr in either serum-free media or PDBu or LY/\n\nPDBu treated cells (***p,0.005) (Figure 6A). This result reinforces\n\nthe fact that serine phosphorylation of profilin 1 facilitates\n\nmigration of breast cancer cells.\n\nSimilarly, invasion assays using ECM (extracellular matrix)\n\ncoated boyden chamber filters revealed that PFN-WT and PFN-\n\nR74E cells invade more than EV cells in the presence and absence\n\nof PDBu. PFN-R74E showed more invasiveness than PFN-WT\n\n(**p,0.05). PFN-H133S invades the least (**p,0.05). However,\n\nPDBu- treated PFN-H133S showed 3 times more invasion when\n\ncompared to serum-free media, indicating that though PFN-\n\nH133S is defective in binding to any PLP containing proteins,\n\nphosphorylation at Ser137 made it more aggressive. Pre-treatment\n\nwith LY249002 inhibits invasion of all clones and in fact the\n\ninvasiveness is reduced further than serum-free media. PFN-\n\nS137A demonstrates significantly reduced invasion even in the\n\npresence of PDBu (**p,0.05) (Figure 6B).\n\nFigure 5.

Studies have also been\n\nreported showing colocalization of profilin with MT1-MMP\n\n(MMP14) at the leading edges of activated monocytes migrating\n\non a layer of activated endothelial cells [37]. MT1-MMP14, in\n\nturn, activates MMP2 and MMP9. In the present study, we make\n\nevident that phosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 plays a crucial\n\nrole in promoting migration and invasion by activating MMP2\n\nand MMP9. Conditioned media from clones growing in serum-\n\nfree media or 200 nM PDBu containing media were subjected to\n\nzymography to analyze MMP2 and MMP9 activity. We found\n\nthat serum-free clones produce very low MMP2 only, whereas\n\nPDBu-treated cells produced significant amounts of MMP9 and to\n\na certain extent MMP2 also. Among the clones, PFN-WT showed\n\nmaximum MMP2/9 activity. PFN-R74E also expressed increased\n\nMMP9 activity comparable to PFN-WT. PFN-H133S by itself was\n\nnot very migratory and invasive in nature but PDBu-treatment\n\nmakes this clone sufficiently pro-invasive. Consistent with that\n\ndata, we found MMP2/9 activity increasing in this clone in\n\nresponse to PDBu. PFN-S137A had the least MMP2 activity and\n\nremained same under all conditions tested. MMP9 activity in\n\nPFN-S137A was comparable to EV and considerably less than\n\nPFN-WT (Figure 7A).\n\nPhosphorylation increases translocation of a subset of\nprofilin 1 to the nucleus\n\nThough profilin 1 has been shown to be localized partially in\n\nthe nucleus, very few studies are available on its role in the\n\nnucleus. Recent studies carried out in dipteran Chironomas tentans\nhave shown that a fraction of profilin in located in the nucleus; is\n\nhighly concentrated in the nucleoplasm and nuclear periphery. It\n\nassociates with protein-coding transcriptionally active genes and is\n\nindependent of actin [38]. Similarly, we observed PFN-WT and its\n\nmutants to be localized in the nucleus, especially PFN-R74E,\n\nmutant for actin-binding was predominantly nuclear. We also find\n\nthat increasing amounts of profilin localizes to the nucleus upon\n\nphosphorylation by PDBu as early as 5 min and upto 18 hr when\n\nFigure 8. Schematic showing various pathways that triggers PI3K activity in breast cancer. These pathways can potentially lead to\nphosphorylation of profilin 1: (1) Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), (2) Insulin (Ins) and Insulin-like growth factors, (3) Estrogen receptor/Estrogen\ncomplex (ER/E), (4) Growth factors (GF) and (5) Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF-A) are well known pathways that activate PI3K\n(Phosphoinositide-3-Kinase) and most common to hormone-dependent and hormone-independent breast cancers. PI3K can in turn activate PKC’s\n(Protein Kinase C and its isoforms) including PKCf. Among all PKC isoforms, PKCf preferentially phosphorylates profilin 1 on Serine (S137) residue that\nleads to enhanced tumorigenic properties in breast cancer cells. VEGF-A can also lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of profilin 1 and increases\nangiogenic activity. It can be hypothesized that together these post-translational modifications could be instrumental in breast cancer progression.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0103868.g008\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\ncompared to serum starved cells (Figure 7B). PFN-WT showed the\n\nmost nuclear concentrations of profilin 1 when compared to serum\n\nstarved cells. However, PFN-S137A, mutant for phosphorylation\n\nat serine 137, did not show any change in profilin localization with\n\nor without PDBu (Figure 7B). These results suggest that\n\nphosphorylation of profilin is importing profilin into the nucleus\n\nand probably facilitating in the binding of profilin to transcrip-\n\ntionally active genes relative to promoting tumorigenesis. This\n\nobservation will need more confirmatory studies and identification\n\nof nuclear proteins or genes regulated by profilin.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present study, we report elevated profilin 1 expression in\n\nnon-metastatic, primary breast carcinoma tissues from Indian\n\npopulation. Profilin levels have been found to be elevated in some\n\npathological states such as adipose tissue inflammation, liver and\n\nkidney diseases [39–41] though in cancers the reports have been\n\nambiguous. Profilin 1 was found to be downregulated in breast\n\ncancer cells CAL51 [16], in pancreatic cancer [42], and in\n\nhepatocarcinoma tissues [43] and upregulated in gastric cancer\n\n[44]. Analysis of N1E-115 neuroblastoma cell line for differenti-\n\nation related cytoskeletal proteins also indicated profilin 2 to be\n\nelevated in expression [45]. Profilin 1 was identified as a secreted\n\nprotein from tumor masses at progressive stage in skin fibromas\n\n[46], in oral cancer saliva proteome [47] and also in pancreatic\n\ncancer secretome [42]. Whether elevated profilin 1 levels alone are\n\nindicative of increased motility and aggressive cancers is debatable.\n\nVarious cell lines from different cancers behaved differently with\n\noverexpression or abrogation of profilin 1 with respect to cell\n\nmigration, invasion and proliferation [16,18,48,49]. Recent studies\n\nreport that profilin 1 is a potential biomarker for bladder cancer\n\naggressiveness and suppressing its expression in T24 bladder\n\ncancer cell line decreased their motility with a concomitant\n\ndecrease in actin polymerization [18]. Breast cancer MDA-MB-\n\n231 cells showed reduced migration upon overexpression of\n\nprofilin 1 [48], however, an in depth analysis carried out by\n\nsilencing profilin 1 showed suppressed endothelial cell prolifera-\n\ntion, migration and cord morphogenesis [50]. Likewise studies\n\ninvolving upregulation of profilin showed increased invasiveness\n\nand growth of smooth muscle cells [51] and also resulted in\n\nglomerular cell proliferation [41]. These observations support the\n\nnotion that profilin is directly associated with cell motility,\n\nmigration and proliferation. Hence the need to investigate the\n\ndifferent aspects that regulate profilin’s function in breast\n\ntumorigenesis and cancer progression.\n\nEarlier studies indicate profilin 19s involvement in cell motility\n\nin the intracellular movement of pathogenic organisms [52] and\n\nmigration of lower eukaryotic organisms such as Dictyostelium and\nListeria [53,54]. It is known that the profilin-actin complex is\nrecruited at the barbed end of actin filaments at the protruding\n\nend of lamellipodia in migrating cells where actin polymerization\n\nis initiated. Impaired motility of intracellular pathogens was\n\nobserved in profilin-deletion experiments and revealed the\n\nimportance of profilin in bacterial motility [52], in migration\n\nand proliferation of lower eukaryotes [53]. Profilin-deficient mice\n\nwere embryonically lethal and profilin 1 null mice embryos did not\n\nsurvive indicating its necessity in cell division and survival during\n\nembryogenesis [55]. Profilins assist F-actin elongation at the\n\nleading edge of migrating cells through their interactions with a\n\nhost of actin-binding proteins like Ena (enabled)/VASP (vasodi-\n\nlator stimulated phosphoprotein) [56,57]. Profilin 1 and profilin 2\n\nprotein ratios in a cell can also determine the extent of actin\n\npolymerization and cellular motility [7]. Previously known facts\n\ninclude that both actin and polyproline interactions of profilin 1\n\nare essential for tumorigenesis and enhanced migration/invasion\n\n[17,36]. Studies published recently report that phosphorylation of\n\nprofilin at tyrosine 129 in endothelial cells facilitates secretion of\n\nangiocrine factors. These, in turn, stabilize HIF-1a in a hypoxia-\nindependent manner to promote glioblastoma progression [19].\n\nThrough our studies, we add a new dimension to the role of\n\nprofilin in cell motility, invasion and aggressiveness. Phosphory-\n\nlation at Ser137 of profilin 1 confers enhanced motility to MCF7\n\ncells by itself irrespective of its actin binding or (PLP) protein\n\nbinding capabilities.\n\nDynamics of profilin’s interactions with its ligands, including\n\nactin polymerization changes upon PTM such as nitration and\n\nphosphorylation [12,58]. A number of signaling pathways\n\ntriggered by external factors such as hormones (estrogen) (reviewed\n\nin [59]), growth factors (Insulin, Insulin-like growth factors) [60],\n\nradiation [61] activate PI3K which is known to activate PKC’s\n\nincluding the atypical PKCf and therefore could possibly lead to\nphosphorylation of profilin 1 at S137 (Figure 8). Whether all these\n\npathways eventually culminate to phosphorylate profilin 1 needs\n\nfurther investigation but a probable regulatory loop might be\n\nexisting wherein profilin 1 activates PI3K [62] through its\n\nassociation with p85a subunit [63] which in turn increases the\nproduction of D3 phosphoinositides like PI(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3) known\n\nto activate PKC’s and Akt pathway. PKC’s trigger survival,\n\nmotility and breast cancer progression (reviewed in [64]). We\n\nfound PKC elevated in the breast cancer samples and another\n\nstudy found increased PI3K levels in breast cancers [65] indicating\n\nthat profilin 1 phosphorylation could be an obligatory signaling\n\nevent in promoting breast tumorigenesis. ROCK (Rho-associated\n\nKinase) and PP1 (Protein phosphatase 1) are also known to\n\nregulate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of profilin 1 at\n\nSer137 [25]. Multiple kinases affect profilin phosphorylation\n\nthereby increasing the complexity in the nature of profilin 19s\n\nfunction; its interactions with its many isoforms and oligomers\n\n[35]. These in turn will affect the cascade of protein\n\ninteractions further and the biological consequences thereafter.\n\nFrom our studies in breast cancer cells using serine phosphor-\n\nylation mutant of profilin (PFN-S137A), it is evident that\n\nprofilin phosphorylation is crucial in promoting tumorigenesis.\n\nPFN-S137A overexpressing cells also showed significantly\n\nreduced growth, migration, invasion and colony formation\n\ncompared to PFN-WT.\n\nMMP9-mediated gelatin matrix degradation showed substan-\n\ntially higher expression in PDBu-stimulated breast cancer cells\n\nexpressing PFN and its mutants studied. MMP2-mediated gelatin\n\ndegradation was relatively lower than MMP9 in PDBu-stimulated\n\ncells. MT1-MMP (MMP14) has been shown to colocalize with\n\nprofilin in monocytes at leading edges [37]. It is well known that\n\nMT1-MMP self-activates and in turn activates MMP2 and MMP9\n\nalso. Together these are involved in degrading extracellular matrix\n\nand making cells more motile and invasive. PFN-S137A express-\n\ning cells demonstrated least activity of MMP9 and MMP2 thereby\n\nsuggesting that profilin phosphorylation is in part associated with\n\nactivating MMPs, consecutively facilitating cellular mobility.\n\nPDBu can stimulate MMP14 and inhibiting PKCf could reduce\nrecruitment of MMP9 to podosomes and its release and activation\n\n[66]. The coordinated action of PI3K, PKC and profilin\n\nphosphorylation to induce MMPs needs further investigation to\n\ncharacterize the sequence of events in breast cancer progression.\n\nAnother interesting finding was phosphoprofilin’s translocation to\n\nthe nucleus that requires in-depth analysis focusing on the function\n\nof profilin in the nucleus and subsequent role in breast cancer\n\nprogression. Very little information is available on nuclear\n\nPhosphoprofilin Promotes Breast Cancer Progression\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 August 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 8 | e103868\n\n\n\nprofilin’s role in mammalian cells. Both cytoplasmic and nuclear\n\ndistribution of profilin has been observed in cultured mammalian\n\ncells [67,68]. Recent evidence from Skare et al. [69] suggests that\nprofilin-actin complexes may play a role in pre-mRNA processing\n\nwithin the nucleus, due to extensive co-localization of profilin with\n\nthe small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)-associated Sm\n\nproteins and Cajal bodies. It is believed that mammalian\n\nembryogenesis requires nuclear and cytoplasmic profilin to\n\nmaintain normal embryo development by interacting with actin-\n\nrelated proteins such as Arp 3, VASP, Dia1 and p80 coilin [70]. It\n\nwould be interesting to demonstrate the importance of nuclear\n\nprofilin and nuclear phosphoprofilin in breast cancer progression\n\nand targeting profilin 1 phosphorylation for cancer therapy could\n\nbe a prudent option.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Dr. Jieya Shao, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri for\n\nthe generous gift of pcDNA3.PFN.S137A vector and Dr. Partha Roy,\n\nUniversity of Pittsburg, PA for gifting actin and PLP mutants of profilin.\n\nWe appreciate the help of technical staff, Central Facilities for Research\n\nand Development, Osmania University, Hyderabad, India.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: WR SSS.
