JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  1263-1270,  2013\n\nAbstract. Zoledronic acid (ZA) is the most widely used bisphos-\nphonate to treat cancer-induced bone disease. There is evidence \nthat bisphosphonates have direct antitumor activity and that \ntheir combination with anticancer agents can significantly \nenhance the effect of treatment. We evaluated whether the \ncombination of ZA with different platinum compounds exerts a \nsynergistic effect in breast cancer cell lines and we investigated \nthe mechanisms of action involved. This study was performed \non four breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7, SKBR3, MDA-MB-231 \nand BRC-230, and confirmed on a primary culture obtained \nfrom a breast cancer bone metastasis specimen. ZA (50 µM) \nwas administered for 72 h alone or in combination with \ncisplatin (Cis) or carboplatin. Drug-induced growth inhibition \nwas detected by sulforhodamine B assay, apoptosis and cell \ncycle regulation were detected by flow cytometry, and protein \nexpression was evaluated by western blot analysis. MCF-7 and \nSKBR3 showed very low sensitivity to the three drugs tested. \nThe ZA + Cis combination exerted a high antitumor activity in \nthe two triple-negative lines MDA-MB-231 and BRC-230. An \nimportant synergistic effect was obtained in MDA-MB-231 and \nan additive effect was observed in BRC-230. The p21, pMAPK \nand m-TOR pathways were regulated by this combined treat-\nment, particularly at lower Cis doses. Carboplatin did not show \nantitumor activity either alone or in combination with ZA. In \nconclusion, the potential novel treatment schedule identified for \ntriple-negative breast cancer could prove beneficial in view of \nthe limited therapeutic options available for patients and also \nsince the synergism with ZA would enable lower Cis doses to \nbe used, thus reducing toxicity. Although further research in a \n\nclinical setting is warranted, our results on cell lines has been \nconfirmed on a human primary bone metastasis culture.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and \nthe leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women, \naccounting for 23% of all new cancer cases and 14% of cancer \ndeaths (1). Bone is one of the most preferential target sites of \nmetastasis for breast cancer and up to 70% of women with \nadvanced disease develop bone metastases (2). Such lesions \nhave devastating effects, including pain, pathologic fractures, \nspinal compression and hypercalcemia, all of which greatly \ncompromise the quality of life and outcome (3).\n\nSince results from large randomized controlled trials were \npublished in the late 1990s, bisphosphonates have become the \nstandard of care for the prevention and treatment of skeletal \ncomplications associated with bone metastases in breast \ncancer (4). The third generation nitrogen-containing bisphos-\nphonate, zoledronic acid (ZA), is the only bisphosphonate \nlicensed for the treatment of bone disease originating from a \nvariety of solid tumors and multiple myeloma (5). ZA reduces \nosteoclastic bone resorption by inhibiting key enzymes of \nthe mevalonate pathway (6), including farnesyl pyrophosphate \nsynthase (7) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase \n(8), leading to incomplete post translational prenylation of \nsignaling GTPases, including Ras, Rho and Rac (9), which \nultimately causes osteoclasts to undergo apoptosis (10).\n\nIn addition to their inhibitory effect on osteoclasts, there \nis increasing preclinical evidence to suggest that bisphospho-\nnates exert a direct antitumor activity comprising inhibition of \ntumor cell growth, induction of cancer cell apoptosis (11-15), \ninhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion (16-18) and anti-\nangiogenic activity (19). Furthermore, bisphosphonates used \nin combination with anticancer agents appear to significantly \nenhance the effect of treatment. In fact, ZA has been shown \nto synergistically increase breast cancer cell death when \ncombined with doxorubicin, paclitaxel, or cyclophosphamide \n(20-22).\n\nSeveral dosing schedules of ZA for the treatment of bone \nmetastases have been proposed; a recent study suggested that \nmetronomic weekly low-dose of ZA could be more effec-\ntive than the conventional ZA given every 4 weeks (23).

Triple-negative \nbreast cancer (TNBC), which accounts for approximately \n15% of all breast malignancies, is used to define tumors \nthat lack estrogen and progesterone receptor expression and \nHER-2 amplification. It is often an aggressive disease charac-\nterized by frequent and early relapse, a propensity for visceral \ninvolvement and shorter periods of disease-free and overall \nsurvival with respect to other breast cancer subgroups. The \nunfavorable prognosis associated with TNBC and the lack of \neffective targeted therapy has made it the subject of intensive \nresearch in recent years (24). TNBC exhibits an abundance \nof DNA aberrations, suggesting that DNA repair mechanisms \nare defective. Consequently, these tumors may have increased \nsensitivity to agents, such as platins, which cause interstrand \nDNA breaks. The sensitivity of TNBC to platinum-based \nchemotherapy has thus been the focus of several recent \nclinical trials in neoadjuvant, adjuvant and advanced disease \nsettings (25).\n\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the activity \nof ZA in combination with different platinum compounds \nin four breast cancer cell lines and to explore the molecular \nmechanisms of action of the drugs.\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nCell culture. The experiments were performed on four human \nbreast cancer cell lines. MCF-7, SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 \nwere obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, \n(Rockville, MD, USA), while BRC-230 was stabilized and \ncharacterized in our laboratory (26). Hormone receptor and \nHER2 status of the four cell lines are shown in Table I. Cells \nwere cultured as a monolayer in 75-cm2 flasks at 37˚C in TF \nmedium (45% HAM F12 and 45% DMEM) supplemented \nwith 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine and 1% insulin \n(Mascia Brunelli S.p.a., Milan, Italy) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. \nCells were cultured to the exponential growth phase and then \ntreated with ZA alone or in combination with carboplatin or \ncisplatin (Cis).\n\nIsolation of primary cells from a breast cancer bone metas-\ntasis. The tumor material tissue was obtained from a patient \nundergoing surgery for a bone metastasis of breast carcinoma. \nThe protocol was reviewed and approved by the Local Ethics \nCommittee and performed according to Good Clinical Practice \nand the Helsinki declaration. The patient provided written \ninformed consent to participate in the study.\n\nThe tumor tissue was washed twice in sterile PBS 1X supple-\nmented with 10% penicillin/streptomycin and 5% amphotericin. \nThe biopsy was then disaggregated by cutting the sample with \nsterile surgical blades. The obtained fragments were incubated \nwith collagenase type I (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA, USA) \nat 37˚C in stirring conditions. The enzymatic digestion was \nstopped after 3-4 h by adding IMDM medium supplemented \nwith 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 10% penicillin/\nstreptomycin and 5% amphotericin and L-glutamine. The \nsamples were allowed to settle on the bottom of the tube to \n\nseparate tissue fragments from collagenase-released cells. \nThe cells were counted and seeded at a density of 10,000/cm2. \nHormone receptor and HER2 status of the primary tumor \nare shown in Table I. Pan cytokeratin immunocytochemistry \nanalysis was performed according to the manufacturer's instruc-\ntions (Epithelial Detection kit, As-Diagnostik, Hueckeswagen, \nGermany) to detect the percentage of tumor cells of the sample.\n\nDrugs. Cis (Bristol-Myers Squibb S.p.A, Rome, Italy) was \nstored at room temperature, carboplatin (Bristol-Myers Squibb \nS.p.A) at 4˚C, and both drugs were diluted in medium prior to \nuse. ZA (Zometa®), kindly provided by Novartis (East Hanover, \nNJ, USA), was solubilized, stored at -20˚C at a concentration \nof 50 mM in sterile water and diluted in medium prior to use.\n\nTreatment schedules. The four cell lines were exposed to ZA \nand either platin, singly or in combination, for 72 h. ZA was \ntested at a concentration of 50 µM for 72 h, while Cis and \ncarboplatin were tested at concentrations of 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 \nand 10 µM and 1, 11 and 110 µM, respectively, for 6 h followed \nby a 72-h washout. For the combination assays, cell lines were \nexposed to different concentrations of Cis or carboplatin in \ncombination with ZA (50 µM) for 6 h, washed out and then \nexposed to ZA (50 µM) for a further 72 h (Fig. 1).\n\nChemosensitivity assay. The sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay \nwas used according to the method by Skehan et al to evaluate \nthe cytotoxic activity of the drugs (27). Briefly, cells were \ncollected by trypsinization, counted and plated at a density \nof 3,000 cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates. \nAfter 24 h, cells were treated with the different schedules. The \noptical density (OD) of cells was determined at a wavelength \nof 540 nm by a colorimetric plate reader. Growth inhibition \nand cytocidal effects of the drugs were calculated according \nto the formula reported by Monks et al (28): (OD treated/OD \ncontrol) x 100% where the OD treated reflects the cell number \nin treated wells and the OD control reflects the cell number \nin untreated wells on the day of the assay. If the resulting \npercentage ratio is above zero, a cytostatic effect has been \ninduced, whereas if it is below zero, cell killing has occurred. \nThe interaction between drugs was evaluated with the method \nby Kern et al (29), subsequently modified by Romanelli et al \n(30).

Four biological independent replicates of \neach experiment were performed.\n\nWestern blot analysis. Proteins were isolated by cell lysis \nwith a lysis buffer composed of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), \n150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% SDS, supplemented \nwith 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1:100 protease \ninhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). The protein content was quantified \nusing the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, \nWaltman, MA, USA). An equal amount of protein from each \nsample was separated on Criterion™ Precast Gel Tris-HCl \n(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) and transferred to polyvi-\nnylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes \nwere blocked for 2 h in 5% non-fat dry milk PBS with 0.1% \nTween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) at room \ntemperature and incubated overnight at 4˚C with primary \nantibody. After washing, the membranes were incubated for \n1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conju-\ngated secondary antibody. The following primary antibodies \nwere used: anti-RAS (polyclonal, 1:1000) (Stressgen, Brussels, \nBelgium), anti-p-MAPK (polyclonal, 1:1000), anti pM-TOR \n(1:1000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA), \nanti-caspase-3 (polyclonal, 1:500), anti-caspase-8 (mono-\nclonal, 1:500) (Alexis Biochemicals, Farmingdale, NY, USA), \nanti-caspase-9 (polyclonal, 1:500), anti-Mcl-1 (monoclonal \n1:100) (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-bcl-2 \n(monoclonal, 1:100) (Dako Corp., Glostrup, Denmark), anti-\np21 (monoclonal, 1:100) (BioOptica, Milan, Italy), anti-Rho \n(monoclonal 1:1000) (Millipore), and anti-actin (polyclonal, \n1:5000) (Sigma-Aldrich).\n\nTUNEL assay. Fragmented DNA generated in response to \napoptotic signals was detected by the terminal deoxynucleo-\ntidyl transferase (TdT) nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. \nAfter each treatment schedule, 106 cells were washed twice \nwith PBS, fixed by incubation in 1% formaldehyde on ice \nfor 15 min, resuspended in 70% ice cold ethanol and stored \novernight. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and resus-\npended in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at \n48˚C. Thereafter, samples were incubated in 50 ml of solution \ncontaining TdT and FITC conjugated dUTP deoxynucleotides \n1:1 (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) in a \nhumidified atmosphere for 90 min at 37˚C in the dark, washed \nin PBS, counterstained with propidium iodide (2.5 mg/ml, MP \nBiomedicals, Verona, Italy) and RNAse (10 kU/ml, Sigma-\nAldrich) for 30 min at 48˚C in the dark and analyzed by flow \ncytometry.\n\nCell cycle analysis. After all the treatment schedules, cells \nwere fixed in ethanol (70%), stained in a solution containing \npropidium iodide (10 mg/ml, MP Biomedicals), RNAse \n(10 kU/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) and NP40 (0.01%, Sigma-Aldrich) \novernight at 48˚C in dark conditions and analyzed by flow \ncytometry. Data were expressed as fractions of cells in the \ndifferent cell cycle phases.\n\nScratch wound assay. We used a scratch wound assay to evaluate \nthe migration ability of the four cell lines after treatment. Cells \nwere cultured in 75-cm2 flasks, as previously described, and \nwere exposed to the different treatment schedules. Twenty-four \nhours before the end of treatment, a uniform cell-free area was \ncreated by scratching a confluent monolayer with a scraper. The \nmigration rate of the cell lines was determined by observing \nthe wound closure at the end of the experiments (31).\n\nStatistical analysis. Differences between treatments in terms \nof dose-response, apoptosis and cell cycle block were deter-\nmined using the Student's t-test for unpaired observations. \nP<0.05 was considered to indicate statistically significant \ndifferences. In each experiment the standard deviation did not \nexceed 10%.\n\nResults\n\nDrug sensitivity. Drug combination experiments were \nperformed using one dose of ZA (50 µM) for 72 h and five doses \nof Cis (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10 µM) or three doses of carbo-\nplatin (1, 11 and 110 µM). The hormone receptor-positive line \nMCF-7 and HER-2 expressing line SKBR3 showed very low \nsensitivity to all the drugs tested, whether alone or in combina-\ntion (data not shown). Conversely, the Cis and ZA combination \nshowed a high anti-proliferative effect in the triple-negative cell \nlines BRC-230 and MDA-MB-231, the latter proving the most \nsensitive to treatment. IG50 was reached at <0.001 µM with the \ncombination, whereas it was not reached with Cis alone, even \nat the highest concentration (Fig. 2A). BRC-230 cells were \nmore sensitive than MDA-MB-231 to Cis alone, with an IG50 \nof 4.6 µM. However, the increase in growth inhibition obtained \nwith the drug combination was lower than that observed for \nMDA-MB-231, with an IG50 of 0.005 µM (Fig. 2B). Both triple-\nnegative lines proved insensitive to carboplatin treatment, alone \nor in combination with ZA (data not shown). No synergistic or \nadditive effects were observed when carboplatin or Cis were \ncombined with ZA in MCF-7 or SKBR3. In MDA-MB-231, the \ncombination of ZA and Cis produced an important synergistic \neffect which yielded an R index >1.5 for all but the 10-µM Cis \nconcentration. The synergism was particularly evident at lower \nconcentrations of the platin (0.001 and 0.01 µM) (Fig. 2C). \nAn additive effect was reached when combining Cis and ZA \nin BRC-230 for all Cis concentrations, and the interaction was \nonce again higher at lower concentrations of the drug (Fig. D). \nConversely, the combination of carboplatin and ZA did not \nproduce either additive or synergistic effects and the increase \nin growth inhibition obtained with the drug combination was \nsimilar to that obtained with ZA alone (data not shown). Based \non these results, we performed subsequent experiments using \nthe Cis and ZA combination in the triple-negative cell lines \nBRC-230 and MDA-MB-231.\n\nFigure 1. Drug combination schedule.\n\n\n\nIBRAHIM et al:  CISPLATIN AND ZOLEDRONIC ACID IN TRIPLE-NEGATIVE BREAST CANCER1266\n\nIsolation of primary cancer cells from breast bone metastasis \nbiopsy. The primary culture obtained from the surgical material \nwas stable for 4-5 subcultures. In order to verify the presence \nof tumor cells in the surgical material, the cytospin sections \nwere stained for pan cytokeratin immuno cytochemistry assay. \nThe percentage of cells expressing an epithelial phenotype \nwas ~20% of the whole culture (Fig. 3).\n\nDrug sensitivity of primary culture. The drug sensitivity \ndata of Cis and ZA were compared with the values obtained \nfor the cells isolated from the bone metastasis biopsy. The \nIG50 obtained for the primary culture was similar to the one \nobtained for MCF-7, the cell line that presents the same HER-2 \nand hormone receptor pattern. The primary culture proved to \nbe more sensitive to Cis alone with respect to MCF-7, IG50 of \n8.0 µM for the primary culture whereas not reached for MCF-7. \nHowever, the two cultures showed similar sensitivity for ZA, \nIG50 not reached for both cell lines, and for the combination of \nCis and ZA with an IG50 of 6.6 µM for MCF-7 and 6.9 µM for \nthe primary culture.\n\nEffect on proliferation pathways. A strong reduction in \npMAPK levels was observed in BRC-230 after the Cis and \nZA combination with respect to control cells, especially at the \nlowest Cis dose (0.001 µm). Such a reduction did not occur in \nsingle treatments. Furthermore, MCL-1 expression was down-\nregulated in the MDA-MB-231 cell line after the combined \ntreatment but not after single drug exposure. Finally, pM-TOR \nwas markedly downregulated in the MDA-MB-231 cell line \nfollowing exposure to ZA alone and especially after combined \ntreatment with any of the Cis concentrations (Fig. 4).\n\nApoptosis induction. Assessment of apoptosis by TUNEL \nassay showed that both single drug exposure and the ZA and \nCis combination induced a small, not statistically significant \nincrease in apoptotic cell percentage with respect to control in \nboth cell lines. In MDA-MB-231, the apoptotic cell percentage \ndid not exceed 5% in any of the Cis concentrations used alone or \nin combination with ZA (Fig. 5A). In BRC-230 the percentage \nof apoptosis reached 7.7 and 6.3% after the combination of ZA \nand Cis 0.01 or 0.1 µM, respectively (Fig. 5B). These data are \nin agreement with western blot analysis of caspase-3, -8 and -9. \nWe did not observe a substantial increase in the cleaved form \nof the three caspases or a decrease in pro-caspase levels after \nany of the treatments (Fig. 5C).\n\nCell cycle perturbation. The combination of ZA and Cis did \nnot produce a significant block of the cell cycle in the G0-G1 or \nG2 phases in either triple-negative cell line. A slight increment \nwith respect to control was observed in the percentage of cells \nin G0-G1 after treatment with ZA alone and also in combina-\ntion with all Cis concentrations in MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 6A) \nand with Cis 0.001 and 0.01 µm in BRC-230 (Fig. 6B). These \nfindings were confirmed by western blot analysis of p-21 in \nwhich the protein was found to be upregulated with respect to \ncontrol after treatment with ZA and Cis at any tested dose in \nthe MDA-MB-231 cell line, but only at the lowest Cis doses for \nBRC-230 (Fig. 6C).\n\nEffect on migration ability. Treatment of cells with the combi-\nnation of ZA and Cis resulted in a decreased migration rate with \nrespect to control cells. Such a reduction was detected using the \nscratch assay in both triple-negative cell lines. Untreated cells \n\nFigure 2.

ZA was found to have a direct antitumor activity on \nbreast cancer cells, which is in agreement with results from \nprevious studies (12,16,18). Drug concentrations and exposure \ntimes used in our study were chosen on the basis of both litera-\nture data (32-34) and results from a preclinical investigation \ncarried out in our laboratory (35), which highlighted that ZA \nis more effective in triple-negative lines and that a cytocidal \neffect is reached only in these cells.\n\nWe chose platinum compounds to evaluate the poten-\ntial synergic effect of ZA and chemotherapeutic agents as \nconventional chemotherapy for breast cancer often uses \nDNA-damaging drugs to prevent proliferation and stimulate \napoptosis of cancer cells, especially in TNBC (36). Initially \nwe performed parallel experiments with carboplatin (1, 10 \nand 100 µM) and Cis (0.1, 1 and 10 µM). As the combination \nof ZA and carboplatin did not produce additive or synergic \neffects, we decided to focus on the Cis combination. In the \ntriple-negative cell lines, Cis produced a synergistic effect \nwith ZA in MDA-MB-231, whereas an additive effect was \nreached in BRC-230. No activity was observed in the other \ntwo lines, possibly due to their low sensitivity to these drugs. \nThis finding confirms the results of our previous study which \n\nFigure 6.

Effect of single and combined treatments on the migration ability \ndetected by wound healing assay.\n\n\n\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY  42:  1263-1270,  2013 1269\n\nhighlighted the greater sensitivity of triple-negative cells to \nZA. Such sensitivity can be attributed to genetic alterations \nof oncogenic pathways. K-Ras and BRAF are mutated in the \nMDA-MB-231 cell line and consequently the K-Ras pathway \nis constitutively active. BRC-230 has a genetic amplifica-\ntion of EGFR that leads to an overexpression of the protein. \nWe hypothesized that these triple-negative cells are more \nsensitive to ZA because this drug, inhibiting the mevalonate \npathway, may produce a block in the K-Ras pathway which \nis overactivated in these cells. The hormone receptor-positive \n(MCF-7) and HER2-expressing (SKBR3) lines, not presenting \nalterations in BRAF, K-Ras or EGFR genes, are less sensitive. \nFurthermore, we observed that the two triple-negative lines \nshowed different sensitivity to ZA and Cis, in agreement with \na previous study characterizing a cohort of triple-negative \nbreast cancer subtypes with different drug sensitivity (37). \nLehmann et al (37) identified 6 subtypes distinguishable by \ntheir molecular profiles. The MDA-MB-231 cell line is a \nmesenchymal stem-like subtype enriched in genes involved \nin EMT transition and growth pathways, resistant to Cis and \nsensitive to NVP-BEZ235 and dasatinib. Notably, our results \nsuggest that ZA sensitizes MDA-MB-231 to Cis, in contrast to \nCis alone, which did not exert any effect on cell proliferation \nor survival. We do not have any information on the BRC-230 \nsubtype as this cell line was isolated in our laboratory. Further \nmolecular characterizations are ongoing.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to describe a syner-\ngistic effect of ZA in association with Cis in breast cancer cell \nlines, whereas the combination of these two drugs has already \nbeen studied in osteosarcoma (38) and lung cancer cells (39).\n\nWe also observed a high inhibition of cell proliferation \nin MDA-MB-231 when exposed to ZA in association with \nlow concentrations of Cis. Based on these results, we further \nevaluated two lower concentrations (0.001 and 0.01 µM) \nof Cis, both of which produced a greater synergistic effect. \nFinally, we investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in \nthe synergistic/additive effects observed. Assessment of apop-\ntosis showed that the combination of ZA and Cis induced a \nsmall, not statistically significant increase in the percentage of \napoptotic cells in both cell lines. Furthermore, we performed \nchemosensitivity analyses on a primary culture from a bone \nmetastasis specimen as well and the obtained results were \nconcordant with data of a cell line, MCF-7, that has the same \npattern of HER-2 and hormonal receptor status of the primary \ntumor of the bone metastasis specimen. This is a key finding \nfor the confirmation of our in vitro experiments. Further evalu-\nation on a primary culture obtained from a triple negative bone \nlesion is warranted.\n\nThe principal molecular mechanism involved appears to be \nthat of proliferation control. Although only a slight increment \nin the percentage of cells in the G1 phase was detected, an \nimportant decrease in p-MAPK, Mcl-1 and p-mTOR expression \nand an increase in p21 were observed. P-MAPK is part of the \nmevalonate pathway and our results thus support previous find-\nings that ZA exerts its effect by modulating this pathway (6). In \naddition to its anti-apoptotic effect, Mcl-1 has been found to be \ninvolved in cell cycle and proliferation regulation (40) and has \nalso been reported to be modulated by ZA in prostate cancer \ncell lines (35). mTOR is critically involved in the mediation of \ncell survival and proliferation, and a number of clinical trials \n\nhave been conducted on everolimus, a new mTOR inhibitor, \nin metastatic breast cancer (41). Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt/\nmTOR pathway is involved in chemotherapeutic drug resis-\ntance and response to radiation in breast cancer cells (42). \nA previous study highlighted that mTOR inhibitors have the \npotential to overcome drug resistance from topoisomerase II \nin solid tumors (43) and ZA is capable of enhancing mTOR \ninhibition in osteosarcoma cells (44). Finally, we know that \nMDA-MB-231 is a mesenchymal stem-like subtype cell line \nthat is responsive to mTOR inhibitors but resistant to Cis (37). \nTaking all these facts into consideration, we can hypothesize \nthat mTOR pathway inhibition plays an important role in ZA \nanticancer activity and in its ability to overcome MDA-MB-231 \nresistance to Cis. Further research is warranted to identify new \nmolecular targets to use in preclinical and clinical trials, partic-\nularly in TNBC where such targeted therapies are lacking.\n\nIn conclusion, our results confirm that ZA exerts a direct \nantitumor activity on human breast cancer cell lines, as previ-\nously described in vitro (12,16,18) in mouse models (45) and \nas reported in postmenopausal women of the Azure clinical \ntrial (46). Furthermore, we observed that ZA produced a \nsynergistic/additive effect on Cis in triple-negative cell lines, \nwhereas no effect was exerted on the hormone receptor-positive \nor HER2-expressing lines. Investigating the molecular mecha-\nnisms involved, it was concluded that control of proliferation \npathways is possibly the key to the action of the drug combi-\nnation. p21, pMAPK and mTOR pathways were found to be \nregulated, especially at lower doses of Cis. Although further \nresearch is required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms \nin question, several new potential targets have come to light. \nFinally, it would be interesting to test the study schedules, \nfirst on xenograft models and then in a clinical setting, in an \nattempt to increase the currently limited options available for \ntriple-negative breast cancer patients. In fact, the synergistic \neffect exerted by the combination could enable Cis dosages to \nbe reduced, thus minimizing side-effects associated with this \nchemotherapeutic agent.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe authors thank Gráinne Tierney and Ursula Elbling for \nediting the manuscript.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.
