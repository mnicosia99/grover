In general, however, these assays do\nnot have adequate specificity for use in countries in which other soil-transmitted helminths are endemic. The\nuse of recombinant antigens in these assays, however, is promising for improving the specificity of the diagnosis\nof toxocariasis. Toward this goal, we developed an IgG4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) involv-\ning three recombinant antigens: rTES-30USM (previously produced), rTES-26, and rTES-120. The latter two\nantigens were produced by reverse transcription-PCR cloning; subcloned into glutathione S-transferase (GST)-\ntagged and His-tagged prokaryotic expression vectors, respectively; and expressed in Escherichia coli. The\nrecombinant proteins were subsequently purified by affinity chromatography using GST and His-Trap resins.\nThe diagnostic potential of each purified recombinant antigen was tested with various immunoglobulin classes\n(IgG, IgM, and IgE) and IgG subclasses. The IgG4 ELISA was determined to have the highest specificity and\nwas further evaluated using a panel of serum samples. The rTES-26 IgG4 ELISA showed 80.0% (24/30 samples\npositive) sensitivity, and both the rTES-30USM IgG4 ELISA and rTES-120 IgG4 ELISA had 93.0% (28/30)\nsensitivity. Combined use of rTES-120 and rTES-30 IgG4 ELISA for the diagnosis of toxocariasis provided\n100% sensitivity. The specificities of rTES-26, rTES-30USM, and rTES-120 antigens were 96.2%, 93.9%, and\n92.0%, respectively. These results indicate that the development of a diagnostic test using the three recombi-\nnant antigens will allow for more-accurate detection of toxocariasis.\n\nHuman toxocariasis is a worldwide parasitic zoonosis, caused\nmost commonly by the intestinal parasites the dog roundworm\n(Toxocara canis) and also the cat roundworm (Toxocara cati)\n(2). It commonly manifests as visceral larva migrans, ocular\nlarva migrans, and covert toxocariasis. Toxocariasis is probably\none of the most common zoonotic helminthiases in temperate\nclimates and developed countries (20). In Malaysia, the sero-\nprevalence rate is approximately 20% (6).\n\nDefinitive diagnosis of toxocariasis is based on the detection\nof Toxocara larvae from biopsy tissues, but this test is time-\nconsuming and difficult to perform. Therefore, diagnosis is\ncommonly based on clinical and serologic diagnosis. Currently,\ncommon routine serology tests are applied for detection, such\nas commercial immunoglobulin G (IgG) enzyme-linked immu-\nnosorbent assay (ELISA) kits in which Toxocara excretory-\nsecretory (TES) antigens obtained from culture of T. canis\nsecond-stage (L2) larvae are used (22). The use of the native\nTES antigen for serodiagnosis of human toxocariasis is a labo-\nrious and time-consuming technique, and the production ca-\npacity is limited by the culture volume (22). Further, the spec-\nificity is often low, especially in developing countries, where\ninfections with helminths that cause cross-reactions, particu-\nlarly soil-transmitted helminths, are prevalent (10, 15).\n\nThe use of recombinant antigens offers significant benefits\n\nfor detection because their production is basically limitless,\nand assays using recombinant antigens have increased sensitiv-\nity and specificity compared to those of assays using native TES\nantigens. Several investigators have reported recombinant an-\ntigens that are potentially useful for the serodiagnosis of toxo-\ncariasis, namely, TES-30 (16, 27, 28) and TES-120 (3, 4), but\nmore validation studies are needed to establish their specificity\nand sensitivity for use as diagnostic reagents.\n\nAccurate diagnosis is important for patient management,\nunderstanding the epidemiology of toxocariasis, and establish-\ning preventive measures. Thus, the aim of this study was to\ndevelop a robust diagnostic test for human toxocariasis based\non three recombinant antigens, rTES-30USM (previously pro-\nduced), rTES-26, and rTES-120.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nIsolation and cultivation of T. canis eggs. Live adult female T. canis worms\nwere obtained postmortem from the small intestinal tracts of naturally in-\nfected puppies and dogs. The adult worms were washed in normal saline\nsolution, the uteri of gravid female worms were dissected, and fertile eggs\nwere collected.\n\nThe in vitro cultivation of the L2 larvae was performed according to the\nmethod described previously (1, 13) with some modifications. Briefly, eggs were\ndigested in acid-pepsin solution for 30 min and then incubated in 2% neutral\nformalin in a sterile 250-ml flask for 14 days at 30°C with occasional inspection.\nTo the 10% egg suspension, an equal volume of �4% sodium hypochlorite\nsolution (Sigma-Aldrich; ready solution) was added for 30 min until the eggs lost\ntheir outer pitted shells. A hand tissue homogenizer (B. Braun) was used to\ndisrupt the decoated eggs. The egg suspension was then placed in RPMI 1640\nmedium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 �g/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 �g/ml\namphotericin B (Fungizone). The suspension was then incubated in a 37°C CO2\nincubator with a mixture of 5% CO2 and 95% N2 bubbled through the suspen-\nsion. After 1 h, the mixture was transferred onto two layers of gauze in a modified\n\n* Corresponding author.

The live L2 larvae were collected from the bottom of the\napparatus after approximately 8 h. The larvae were then homogenized in lysis\nbuffer. The mRNA was extracted from T. canis L2 larvae using the Straight A’s\nmRNA isolation system in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions (No-\nvagen, Germany). The yield/concentration and purity of the mRNA sample were\nthen quantified by spectrophotometry (Eppendorf) at wavelengths of 260 and\n280 nm.\n\nHuman serum samples. A total of 242 serum samples, collected after obtain-\ning informed consent from the subjects and approval from the institutional ethics\nreview board, were used in this study. Thirty serum samples were obtained from\npatients with clinical and hematologic evidence of toxocariasis and were sero-\npositive by a commercial IgG ELISA kit (Cypress Toxocara IgG; Cypress, Bel-\ngium); 28 samples came from patients with soil-transmitted helminth infections,\nnamely, Ascaris worms, Trichuris worms, and/or hookworm (STH); 30 samples\ncame from patients with serologic diagnosis of extraintestinal amoebiasis; 20\nsamples came from patients with a serologic diagnosis of toxoplasmosis; 28\nsamples came from patients with Brugia malayi microfilaremia; five samples came\nfrom patients with Strongyloides stercoralis in their stool; one sample came from\na patient with Gnathostoma spinigerum in the eye; and 100 serum samples came\nfrom healthy individuals.\n\nOligonucleotide design. The complete coding sequences (open reading\nframes) of the TES-26 and TES-120 genes were obtained from GenBank (ac-\ncession numbers U29761 and U39815, respectively). Primers were designed and\nanalyzed for high-efficiency amplification with OligoPerfect Primer Designer and\nVector NTi version 6.0 software (Informac Inc., Invitrogen).\n\nRT-PCR. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed by using the\ncommercial StrataScript One-Tube RT-PCR System with the Easy-A high-fidel-\nity PCR cloning enzyme kit (Stratagene), following the manufacturer’s instruc-\ntions. The specific primers for each DNA sequence were as follows: TES26F,\n5�-CACCATGTCAGTTGTACACAAAGCTTGC-3�; TES26R, 5�-TTAGGCC\nTGCGATCGATAGA-3�; TES120F, 5�-ATGCACGTCCTTACCGTCGCT-3�;\nTES120R, 5�-ACAGAAGCCGCACGTCAGTGG-3�. The PCR mixture com-\nprised 39.5 �l RNase-free water, 5 �l of 10� RT-PCR buffer, 1 �l of forward and\nreverse primers (20 pmol/�l each), 1 �l of 40 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate\nmix, 1 �l of mRNA sample, 1 �l of diluted StrataScript reverse transcriptase (2.5\nU/�l), and 0.5 �l of Easy-A HiFi PCR cloning enzyme. These were added\nsequentially to an 0.2-ml PCR tube in a total reaction volume of 50 �l. The\namplification process was then performed as follows: first-strand synthesis at\n42°C for 15 min; StrataScript reverse transcriptase inactivation at 95°C for 1 min;\n40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, template-primer annealing at 60°C for\n30 s, and extension at 68°C for 2 min; and final extension at 68°C for 5 min.\n\nCloning of genes encoding TES-26 and TES-120. The A-tailed freshly purified\nRT-PCR products were cloned into a TOPO TA cloning vector (PCR2.1 TOPO\nTA; Invitrogen), followed by transformation into the TOP10 Escherichia coli host\n(Invitrogen). The orientation of the recombinant plasmids was confirmed by\nPCR screening using both gene-specific primers (TES26F and TES26R or\nTES120F and TES120R) in tandem with a vector-specific primer (M13R) and a\ngene-specific primer (TES26R or TES120R), followed by DNA sequencing.\nSequences of the engineered genes were then compared with the appropriate\npublished sequences using Vector NTi software version 6.0.\n\nRepair of base mutations. Four DNA base errors were detected in TES-26/\nTOPO, and no base errors were detected in TES-120/TOPO. Thus, in vitro\nPCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was performed to correct the four base\nerrors (124, 502, 613, and 768 bp) in TES-26/TOPO by using a commercially\navailable kit (QuikChange XL; Stratagene). Four specific forward and reverse\nprimers (Table 1) at the particular regions were designed according to the kit\nmanufacturer’s instructions. Plasmid DNA template (4 �l) was added to a PCR\nmixture consisting of 5 �l of 10� mutagenesis buffer, 2 �l each of 1 �M forward\n\nand reverse mutagenic primers, 1 �l of 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 1\n�l of Pfu DNA polymerase (2.5 U/�l), and water (DNase and RNase free;\nSigma) to a final volume of 50 �l. PCR was performed using the following\nparameters: one cycle at 95°C (5 min); 12 cycles at 95°C (30 s), 60°C (1 min), and\n72°C (5 min); and finally one cycle at 4°C (5 min). The PCR product was then\ndigested with 1 �l of 10 U/�l DpnI enzyme (Fermentas) at 37°C for 1 h, followed\nby transformation into the TOP10 E. coli host (Invitrogen). The corrected DNA\nsequences of the recombinant plasmids were then verified by sequencing.\n\nSubcloning into bacterial expression vectors. All recombinant plasmids and\nexpression vectors were digested with EcoRI enzyme (Fermentas). After diges-\ntion, TES-26 and TES-120 recombinant plasmids were subcloned into pET42\nversion b (Novagen, Germany) and pPROExHT version a (Life Technologies),\nrespectively, using a T4 rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche Diagnostics). After the\nconstruct was verified by sequencing, the recombinant plasmids were trans-\nformed into an expression host, BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Germany).\n\nExpression and purification of TES-26 and TES-120 recombinant proteins.\nEach of the recombinant bacteria was cultured in Terrific broth containing 30\n�g/ml kanamycin (for rTES-26) or 50 �g/ml ampicillin (for rTES-120) and\nincubated at 37°C until the optical density (OD) at 600 nm reached mid-log\nphase (OD at 600 nm of 0.5). The expression was then induced with isopropyl-\n�-D-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mM at 30°C in an incu-\nbator shaker. The culture was harvested after 3 h (for rTES-26) or 5 h (for\nrTES-120). The affinity purification of TES-26 glutathione S-transferase (GST)-\ntagged and TES-120 histidine-tagged recombinant proteins was performed under\nnative conditions, as described by the manufacturer, because both recombinant\nproteins were present in sufficient amounts in soluble form. The cells of rTES-26\nwere lysed in buffer (pH 7.3) containing 43 mM NaH2PO4, 14.7 mM KH2PO4,\n1.37 M NaCl, and 27 mM KCl by using a French press (Thermo Spectronic) and\npurified using GST resin (Novagen, Germany). The cells of rTES-120 were lysed\nin buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, and 10 mM\nimidazole using the same method as that described above. rTES-120 was then\npurified with a His-Trap column (GE Healthcare) using an AKTAprime machine\n(GE Healthcare). A restriction-grade site-specific protease, factor Xa enzyme,\nwas used for specific cleavage/removal of the GST tag in TES-26 GST-tagged\nrecombinant protein by using a commercial kit (factor Xa cleavage capture kit;\nNovagen, Germany). After cleavage of the target protein, factor Xa was removed\nby affinity chromatography using Xarrest agarose (Novagen, Germany). The\nsizes of the expressed target proteins were determined by sodium dodecyl sul-\nfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, and the immuno-\nreactivities of these recombinant proteins were analyzed by Western blotting\nusing serum samples and IgG4 antibody detection.\n\nWestern blotting. The rTES-26 and rTES-120 antigens (20 �g/ml) were sep-\narated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane\n(Osmonic) by using a semidry transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membrane\nwas cut into strips and blocked with 1% casein blocking solution (Roche Diag-\nnostics) for 1 h. The strips were then incubated with serum samples (diluted\n1:100 in 0.5% blocking solution) at 4°C overnight, followed by monoclonal\nanti-human IgG4-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed) at 1:2,000 (in 0.5% blocking\nsolution) for 30 min. BM chemiluminescence blotting reagent (Roche Diagnos-\ntics) and X-ray films (Kodak) were used to develop the blots.\n\nELISA. ELISAs based on rTES-26 and rTES-120 and the previously produced\nrTES-30USM recombinant antigens were developed, and the diagnostic value of\nthe assays was evaluated using monoclonal anti-human IgG subclasses (IgG1,\nIgG2, IgG3, and IgG4), IgE, and IgM. The final assay was then evaluated using\na panel of sera from patients with positive Toxocara serology results or other\nhelminth-related infections and from healthy individuals to determine its sensi-\ntivity and specificity. Each well of the 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plate\n(Nunc Immuno Maxisorp) was coated with 100 �l of each recombinant antigen\nat the optimum concentration for each antigen in 0.02 M bicarbonate buffer, pH\n9.6 (Table 2). The plate was then covered and incubated in a humid chamber at\n4°C overnight followed by 2 h at 37°C. The plate was washed in phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS), pH 7.2, containing 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20, pH 7.2, to\nremove unadsorbed antigen. After a washing step of five washes for 5 min each\nwith PBS with Tween 20, each well was blocked with 1.0% blocking reagent\n(Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at 37°C. The plate was again washed as previously\ndescribed, followed by the addition of serum samples (100 �l, 1:50 in PBS,\nduplicate wells), and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. After the excess serum samples\nwere washed off, mouse monoclonal anti-human IgG1- to IgG4-, IgE-, and\nIgM-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed) were added at an optimized dilution in\nPBS (Table 2) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Following a final washing step,\n2,2�-azinobis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid-diammonium salt) substrate\n(Roche Diagnostics) was added and the ODs were measured after 30 min as\nabsorbance at 405 nm (reference, 490 nm) using an ELISA spectrophotometer\n\nTABLE 1.

All four mutations that occurred at 124, 502,\n613, and 789 bp in TES-26/TOPO were successfully corrected\n(data not shown).\n\nThe SDS-PAGE profiles of the purified TES-26 GST fusion\nand TES-120 His-tagged proteins showed distinctive and thick\nbands at molecular masses of approximately 72 kDa and 26\n\nkDa, respectively (Fig. 2). The histidine tag is a very small\npeptide (approximately 0.8 kDa), is not immunogenic, and is\nrarely disruptive to the properties of the proteins on which it is\nattached. Therefore, the His tag was not removed. The TES-\n120 His-tagged protein was thus used directly for developing\nthe immunoassay to detect Toxocara infection. The GST tag,\non the other hand, is a large molecule (approximately 26 kDa)\nthat affects the immunogenicity of the protein; thus, the GST\ntag was removed prior to developing the immunoassay. After\nremoval of the GST tag, the molecular mass of the TES-26\nrecombinant protein was approximately 31 kDa.\n\nThe antigenicity study by Western blot analysis of the cleaved\nTES-26 and TES-120 recombinant proteins showed reactivity\nwith serum samples from only toxocariasis patients, as indicated\nby the presence of bands with molecular masses of approximately\n31 and 26 kDa, respectively. Sera from healthy individuals and\npatients with other helminthic infections showed no reactivity\n(Fig. 3a and b).\n\nThe sensitivity and cross-reactions of sera from patients with\nother helminthic infections in rTES-ELISA with IgG sub-\nclasses (IgG1 to IgG4), IgE, and IgM are shown in Table 3.\nThe IgG4 ELISA demonstrated the least cross-reactivity, and\nhence the highest specificity, whereas the IgG1 ELISA dem-\nonstrated the lowest specificity. The decreasing order of the\nassay specificities was as follows: IgG4 � IgG3 � IgG2 �\nIgG1. The greatest assay sensitivity was also demonstrated by\nIgG4, and the decreasing order of the assay sensitivities was as\nfollows: IgG4 � IgG2 � IgG1 � IgG3.\n\nThe sensitivity evaluation results of the final developed IgG4\nELISA are shown in Table 4. Of 30 positive human serum\nsamples examined, 28 (93.3%) were reactive for anti-Toxocara\nIgG4 antibodies with rTES-30USM and rTES-120; the IgG4\nELISA using rTES-26 antigen gave 80.0% (24/30) sensitivity.\nThe increased level of sensitivity of rTES-30USM and rTES-\n120 IgG4 ELISA was significant in comparison with the\nrTES-26 IgG4 ELISA (P � 0.001, as determined by Pearson\nchi-square test). However, there was no significant difference\nin mean ODs obtained with 30 Toxocara-infected serum sam-\nples among the three tests (P \t 0.76; determined by one-way\nanalysis of variance).\n\nThe specificity evaluation of each of the assays is shown in\nTable 5. The specificity values obtained were as follows: 96.2%\nby rTES-26, 93.9% by rTES-30USM, and 92.0% by rTES-120.\nAt an alpha level of 0.05, there was no significant difference\n\nTABLE 2.

TES antigen derived from T. canis L2 maintained in\ndefined medium in vitro has been extensively used for the\nimmunodiagnosis of human toxocariasis. Serum samples from\npatients with filariasis and with STH infections such as ascar-\niasis and strongyloidiasis, however, cross-react with the native\nTES antigen in immunoassays (10, 12, 15, 16, 27, 28). This may\nnot be a major problem in developed countries where STH in-\nfections are not prevalent, but it is a significant problem in trop-\nical countries where STH infections are endemic (7, 10). Thus,\nnative TES antigen is useful only for differential diagnosis, and\ntest interpretation is problematic when the result is positive (15).\n\nThe diagnosis of human toxocariasis is currently performed\nby detecting IgG in an ELISA format. The IgG assay, however,\nprovides false-positive reactions with other parasitic helminths,\nwhereas the IgG4 antibody greatly increased the specificity of\nthe assay for toxocariasis (15, 16, 26). Similarly, in the diagnosis\nof lymphatic filariasis, antifilarial IgG4 is often used as a\nmarker of active infection (8, 9, 19, 25), but to date, there is no\ncommercially available IgG4 test for the detection of Toxocara\ninfection.\n\nPreviously rTES-30USM has been successfully cloned by\nassembly PCR and expressed in the prokaryotic expression\nvector by our group (16). rTES-120 has been cloned and ex-\npressed as insoluble protein in the pTrcHis2 prokaryotic vector\nand yeast expression vectors (3, 4). Both of these recombinant\nantigens have potential in the diagnosis of toxocariasis in an\nIgG ELISA (3, 4, 28). Evaluation of the diagnostic values of\nboth recombinant antigens, however, requires further validation.\nIn addition, previous studies indicate that TES-30 recombinant\nantigens demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the de-\ntection of anti-Toxocara IgG4 subclass antibodies (16).\n\nA 26-kDa antigen is being used as one of six serodiagnostic\nmarkers for confirmation of toxocariasis in a commercial West-\nern blot IgG kit that uses native TES antigen (Testline,\nFrance). Furthermore previous studies have shown that low-\nmolecular-mass bands (24 to 35 kDa) of native TES antigen\nwere more specific for toxocariasis, while the high-molecular-\nweight TES antigen bands showed reactivity with sera from\nvarious helminth infections (11, 17). Therefore, we hypothe-\n\nsized that rTES-26 might be useful as a serodiagnostic marker\nfor toxocariasis. However, it is interesting that previously\nrTES-26 was reported to be of poor diagnostic value when\ntested with serum from toxocariasis patients (18/118; 11.5%)\n(5). The investigators themselves thought the low reactivity was\nunexpected since the gene selection was based on reactivity to\nantisera from TES antigen-immunized mice. Their results are\nin apparent contradiction to the results of the present study;\nthe reasons could be due to differences in expression vectors,\npurification methods, and the secondary antibodies employed.\n\nIn this study, the genes encoding TES-26 and TES-120 were\nsuccessfully cloned via RT-PCR and expressed in the appro-\npriate prokaryotic expression vectors for the expression of the\nrecombinant proteins. The target proteins proved to be immu-\nnologically reactive. Because both recombinant proteins were\nwell expressed in soluble form, the proteins were purified un-\nder native conditions. The predicted molecular masses of\nrTES-26 and rTES-120 recombinant proteins were 70 and 26\nkDa, respectively. These values corresponded with the sizes of\nthe proteins observed using SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. The\npurified recombinant proteins were then used to develop an\nELISA for the detection of specific antibody in sera from\npatients infected with T. canis by using various antibody classes\nand subclasses.\n\nIncreased levels of total IgE in many cases of toxocariasis\nindicated that IgE specific for TES antigen was present. High\nlevels of IgE specific for TES antigen are also observed in the\nserum of patients with clinical signs suggestive of Toxocara\ninfection (22, 23). Not all patients with elevated total IgE\nlevels, however, demonstrated specific anti-Toxocara IgE.\nPawlowski (18) reported that Toxocara-specific IgE was\npresent in half of the patients in that study, a finding consistent\nwith the results in the present study, where only half of the\npatients with toxocariasis had increased IgE levels.\n\nThe demonstration of increased Toxocara-specific IgM has\nbeen considered indicative of acute infection (21). In our study,\nhowever, IgM was not a good marker for Toxocara infection\nbecause only 1 of 30 samples was positive by the assay. This result\nis not surprising, because toxocariasis is often not an acute dis-\nease.\n\nWhen the three recombinant antigens were tested in ELISAs\nusing all the IgG subclasses (IgG1 to IgG4), the results clearly\nindicated that only the IgG4 assay displayed good specificity.\nThus, IgG4 ELISA was employed in the final development of\nthe diagnostic assay for toxocariasis. The use of rTES-26 IgG4\nELISA alone gave a sensitivity of 80.0%, and rTES-30USM\nand rTES-120 IgG4 ELISA gave similar sensitivities of 93.3%.\nWhen both rTES-30USM and rTES-120 were used in separate\nwells, 100% sensitivity was obtained. The three recombinant\nantigens were found not to be different in terms of the mean\nODs of 30 samples from patients with toxocariasis.\n\nThe results obtained differed from those obtained in a study\nby Watthanakulpanich et al. (24). They reported that with\nnative TES antigen, anti-Toxocara IgG2 gave the greatest sen-\nsitivity (98%) (IgG2 � IgG3 � IgG4 � IgG1 � IgG) whereas\nanti-Toxocara IgG3 gave the greatest specificity (81%) (IgG3 �\nIgG1 � IgG � IgG2 and IgG4). These differences may be due\nto the fact that native antigen was employed in their study\nwhereas recombinant antigens were used in our study. The\nresult of the present study, however, is in agreement with other\n\nTABLE 5.

Some of the false-positive cases re-\ncorded in the present study may have been due to coinfections\nwith Toxocara. The high specificities obtained can be explained\nby the fact that the recombinant antigens (unlike native TES\nantigen) are single or homogenous molecules. In addition, the\nrecombinant antigens are not glycosylated because they are\nexpressed by bacteria, which reduces the cross-reactivities with\nantibodies that recognize sugar moieties (14).\n\nPrevious reports showed that the low-molecular-mass bands\n(24 to 35 kDa) were more specific for toxocariasis, while\nhigher-molecular-mass bands showed reactivity with sera\nfrom patients with various helminth infections (11, 17).\nThese findings are thus consistent with the pattern of spec-\nificities obtained in the present study, namely, rTES-26 �\nrTES-30USM � rTES-120.\n\nAlthough the sensitivity of rTES-26 was lower than that of\nrTES-30USM/rTES-120, it is still important to include it in the\npanel of recombinant antigens in the final assay because\nTES-26 displayed a very high specificity of 96.2%. Further-\nmore, the additional infection marker will increase the robust-\nness of the assay, as the final assay remains to be tested with a\nlarger number of samples and in different settings where the\norganism is endemic.\n\nWhen a patient’s sample is tested using the final assay de-\nveloped in this study, the results can be interpreted as follows.\nWhen all three recombinant antigen IgG4 ELISAs are positive\nand the clinical symptoms are consistent with Toxocara infec-\ntion, there is high likelihood that it is a true-positive case. The\nsame applies for when rTES-26 and rTES-120 or rTES-26 and\nrTES-30USM ELISAs are positive. When only the rTES-\n30USM or rTES-120 IgG4 ELISA is positive, there is good\nevidence that the patient is infected.\n\nConclusion. A sensitive and specific IgG4 ELISA for detect-\ning toxocariasis was successfully developed using three recom-\nbinant antigens: rTES-26, rTES-30USM, and rTES-120 IgG4\nELISA antigens. The assay enabled serodiagnosis of human\ntoxocariasis with high sensitivity and specificity. The use of\nthree recombinant antigens instead of a single recombinant\nantigen will provide a more robust assay for use in different\nparts of the world.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was funded by a research grant from the Malaysian\nMinistry of Science and Innovation (06-02-05-4261 EA019).\n\nWe thank the USM Health Center, Penang; Department of Micro-\nbiology and Parasitology, School of Medical Sciences, USM; and R.
