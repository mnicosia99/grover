There\nhave been few studies on these effects in vitro. In this paper, radioactive glucose uptake assay was implemented in order to assess\nimprovements in insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 cells by elevation of glucose uptake following treatment with stevioside. Oil Red-\nO staining and MTT assay were utilized to confirm adipocyte differentiation and cell viability, respectively. Findings from this\nresearch showed a significant increase in absorbance values in mature adipocytes following Oil Red-O staining, confirming the\ndifferentiation process. Stevioside was noncytotoxic to 3T3-L1 cells as cell viability was reduced by a maximum of 17%, making\nit impossible to determine its IC\n\n50\n. Stevioside increased glucose uptake activities by 2.1 times (ùëù < 0.001) in normal conditions\n\nand up to 4.4 times (ùëù < 0.001) in insulin-resistant states. At times, this increase was higher than that seen in positive control\ngroup treated with rosiglitazone maleate, an antidiabetic agent. Expressions of pY20 and p-IRS1 which were measured via Western\nblot were improved by stevioside treatment. In conclusion, stevioside has direct effects on 3T3-L1 insulin sensitivity via increase in\nglucose uptake and enhanced expression of proteins involved in insulin-signalling pathway.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nEpidemic-level emergence of many noncommunicable dis-\neases as a result of modern lifestyle and dietary habits is\nworrying. Insulin resistance has commonly been linked to\nmetabolic syndromes resulting in type 2 diabetes mellitus,\nas well as obesity. In fact, it is purported to underlie the\nprogression of type 2 diabetes [1] and in cases of burn trauma,\nhyperlipidaemia and cancer cachexia [2]. It is important to\nnote that insulin resistance occurs in an impaired insulin-\nsignalling pathway, indicative of patients with type 2 dia-\nbetes. In normal individuals with fully functioning insulin-\nsignalling activities, insulin will be secreted once blood\nglucose levels are increased following intake of food, and will\nsubsequently bind to its receptor.This binding actionwill lead\nto several stages of signalling and phosphorylation cascades,\nresulting in migration of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)\nfrom cytoplasm to cellular membrane to take up extracellular\n\nglucose. However, in a state of insulin resistance, these\nsignalling activities and cascades are interrupted, blocking\nsaid migration of GLUT4, if not disrupting the protein‚Äôs\nexpression altogether [3]. Hence, a better understanding of\nthese mechanisms will possibly lead to breakthroughs in\nunravelling the secrets of both insulin resistance and diabetes.\n\nAs is often the case, traditional communities use local\nherbs in their folk and traditional medicines for treating\nhyperglycaemia and diabetes. Among these is Stevia rebau-\ndiana Bertoni, a perennial herb commonly grown in tropical\nand subtropical regions, specifically in South America and\nAsia. In recent years, Malaysians too have taken a particular\ninterest in this herb as it has been promoted as a sweetening\nalternative to sucrose, beneficial specifically for those with\nobesity and diabetes. Stevia rebaudiana has little to no caloric\nvalue despite its sweetening abilities, thus will not jeopardise\npatients‚Äô blood glucose levels, while fulfilling their cravings\nfor sweet food and drinks [4]. Stevia rebaudiana is sweet\n\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\ndue to its constituents of steviol glycosides including stevio-\nside, rebaudioside A and rebaudioside C [5]. Furthermore,\nprevious reports showed this plant has antioxidant [6] and\nantihyperglycaemic [7] properties, increasing its potential for\nuse in adjuvant management of diabetes mellitus and asso-\nciated conditions.There has been little investigation into such\nassertions which has prompted this study to evaluate how\nstevioside can affect insulin sensitivity, particularly through\nobservation of glucose uptake, and expression of proteins\ninvolved in insulin-signalling pathway at a cellular level\nthrough use of 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\n\n2. Methods\n\n2.1. Materials. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were commercially\nacquired from ATCC (American Type Culture Collections,\nUSA). Chemicals, including stevioside, cell supplements, and\nmedia, weremostly purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (Ger-\nmany) and Lonza (USA). UltimaGold LLT scintillation cock-\ntail and 2-deoxy-[1-3H]-glucose were commercially obtained\nfrom Perkin Elmer (USA). The antidiabetic drug rosiglita-\nzonemaleate (AVANDIA)was bought from a local drugstore.\nùõΩ-Actin, p-IRS1, and pY20 primary antibodies, and donkey\nanti-goat and goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)\nconjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa\nCruz (USA).\n\n2.2. Cell Culture and Differentiation. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes\nwere cultured in Dulbecco‚Äôs Modified Eagle‚Äôs Media\n(DMEM). Cells were later differentiated with supplements\nof insulin, dexamethasone (DMX), and 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-\nxanthine (IBMX) following the procedures described by\nAhn et al. [8] and Ismail et al. [9]. In order to induce insulin\nresistance, cells were treated with tumour necrosis factor-ùõº\n(TNF-ùõº) at 1.0 ng/mL for 4 days prior to treatment.\n\n2.3. Oil Red-O Staining. 3T3-L1 cells were washed with\nphosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before being fixed with\na solution of 10% formaldehyde in PBS. After overnight\nincubation, the solution was discarded and Oil Red-O dye\nwas introduced to cells for 10 minutes at room temperature.\nSubsequently, excess dye was washed with de-ionised water.\nThe stain was later eluted out with 100% isopropanol and\nmeasured spectrophotomerically at 520 nm.\n\n2.4. Cell Viability Test. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured\nin 96-well plates and were pretreated with stevioside (25‚Äì\n300 ùúáM) for 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours. After pretreatment,\nthe cells received 5mg/mL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-\ndiphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and were further incu-\nbated for 4 hours. The purple formazan crystals were then\ndissolved with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) before their\nabsorbance values were read on a microplate reader at\n590 nm.\n\n2.5. Glucose Uptake Assay. Glucose uptake levels by differ-\nentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were analysed using a method\npreviously described by Adam et al. [10], with minor modifi-\ncations. Briefly, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were differentiated on 12-\nwell plates. For insulin-resistance studies, cells were initially\n\ninduced to insulin resistance with TNF-ùõº treatment, as\nmentioned earlier. Cells were serum-starved for 2 hours.\nNext, they were washed with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate\n(KRB) buffer and preincubated with a range of stevioside\nconcentrations (30‚Äì150ùúáM and 30‚Äì120 ùúáM) for half an hour,\nwith or without insulin addition, with rosiglitazone as a\npositive control. 2-Deoxy-[1-3H]-glucose (1 ùúáCi/mL) was\nthen added to each well to initiate glucose uptake, and\nincubated for a further hour. Cells were then washed with\nice-cold KRB buffer and solubilised by 0.1% sodium dodecyl\nsulphate (SDS). Finally, samples were collected and mixed\nwith 15mL of Ultima Gold LLT scintillation cocktail before\nbeing measured in a liquid scintillation counter.\n\n2.6. Western Blotting. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured and differ-\nentiated in 6-well plates. Cells were given TNF-ùõº to induce\ninsulin resistance, as described earlier, prior to treatmentwith\nstevioside. Treatments of stevioside and rosiglitazonemaleate\nwere given, in 60 and 90ùúáM concentrations, for 24 hours.\nCells were stimulated with insulin for 5 minutes prior to\nharvesting. From the preparation of cell lysates and loading\nof samples to Western blot analysis, procedures described by\nIsmail et al. [9] were followed, with minor modifications.\n\n2.7. Statistical Analysis. Data were presented as mean ¬±\nstandard error mean (SEM) for a given number of tests.\nThe results were processed statistically by one-way analysis\nof variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett‚Äôs post-hoc tests,\nusing the Sigma Plot version 12 software. Statistically different\nmeans were recognised at ùëù < 0.05.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Oil Red-O Staining. Effects of the supplements (insulin,\nDMX, and IBMX) on adipocyte differentiation are presented\nin Figure 1. In order to proceed with further experiments,\nadipocyte differentiation was confirmed by conducting the\nOil Red-O staining procedure. Lipid stain from fully differen-\ntiated adipocytes was eluted out and measured quantitatively\nin a spectrophotometer, where the readings were found to be\nsignificantly increased when compared to control group.\n\n3.2. MTT Cytotoxicity Test. Cells were previously differenti-\nated to mature adipocytes before treatment with stevioside\n(25‚Äì300 ùúáM) for 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours. Cell viability\nwas determined from absorbance readings at 590 nm, corre-\nsponding to formazan crystals formed by living cells (Figure\n2). There were no significant differences in cell viabilities\nin any of the stevioside treatment groups, at any treatment\nperiod, with the exception of those treated for a period of\n72 hours. Viability of cells treated with 250 ùúáM of stevioside\nfor 72 hours was reduced by 17% at most. No half-maximal\ninhibitory concentration (IC\n\n50\n) was found, as cell viability did\n\nnot fall lower than the 80% benchmark.\n\n3.3. Glucose Uptake Assay\n\n3.3.1. Optimum Insulin Concentration. Prior to investigating\neffects of stevioside on glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes,\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\nAdipogenesis stage\n\nPreadipocytes Control Mature\nadipocytes\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n‚àó\n\nA\nbs\n\nor\nba\n\nnc\ne,\n\nO\nD\n\n52\n0\n\nnm\n\nFigure 1: Effect of induction of differentiation on lipid accumulation\nin 3T3-L1 cells, presented by Oil Red-O staining. To quantify lipid\naccumulation in cells as a result of differentiation, the stain was\nelutedwith 100% isopropanol andmeasured spectrophotometrically\nat 520 nm.Mean¬± SEM(ùëõ = 3). ‚àóSignificantly different fromcontrol\n(ùëù < 0.05, ANOVA & Dunnett‚Äôs test).\n\nseparate assays were conducted to find the optimum con-\ncentrations of insulin and TNF-ùõº to be used. From Figure\n3(a), it can be observed that starting from 100 nM of insulin,\nthere was a highly significant increase in glucose uptake,\nwith maximum uptake at 125 nM. There was no significant\ndifference between these two groups. Therefore, 100 nM\ninsulin was selected as the optimum concentration to be used\nfor further experiments.\n\nA separate glucose uptake assay was conducted to find\nthe optimum TNF-ùõº concentration for inducing an insulin-\nresistant state in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. TNF-ùõº reduced glucose\nuptake in the cells up to a concentration of 1.0 ng/mL, beyond\nwhich there was an increase in glucose uptake at 2.5 ng/mL\n(Figure 3(b)). Since glucose uptake went down furthest\nat 1.0 ng/mL, this concentration was selected as the opti-\nmum TNF-ùõº concentration to induce insulin resistance in\ncells.\n\n3.3.2. Glucose Uptake in Normal 3T3-L1 Adipocytes. Glu-\ncose uptake assay was next conducted on normal, non-\ninsulin-resistant adipocytes to study effects of stevioside.\nGlucose uptake by adipocytes was increased by treatment\nwith stevioside or with rosiglitazone (Figure 4). Stevioside\n(30 ùúáM) elicited significant increase in glucose uptake, in\nboth insulin-stimulated and non-insulin-stimulated groups.\nHowever, glucose uptakewas higher in the insulin-stimulated\ngroup, by 2.1 times (ùëù < 0.001) compared to control.This was\nbetter than what was observed in cells that were treated with\nrosiglitazone maleate, where glucose uptake in presence of\ninsulin was increased by 1.7 times (ùëù < 0.001) at a far higher\nconcentration of 120ùúáM.\n\n3.3.3. Glucose Uptake in TNF-ùõº Induced Adipocytes. 3T3-\nL1 cells were induced to insulin resistance using TNF-ùõº, to\ntest whether stevioside could exert similar effects on these\ncells as on normal adipocytes in terms of enhancing glucose\nuptake. Cells were pretreated with TNF-ùõº prior to stevio-\nside treatment and their glucose uptake was measured. In\ninsulin-resistant adipocytes, stevioside was still able to stim-\nulate glucose uptake although at a higher concentration of\n90 ùúáM compared to the previous 30 ùúáM observed in normal\nadipocytes (Figure 5). Maximum increase in glucose uptake\nwas observed in rosiglitazone-treated group (90ùúáM)without\ninsulin stimulation, with an elevation of up to 4.6 times\n(ùëù < 0.001) when compared to control. This was followed by\ntreatment with stevioside (90ùúáM) with insulin stimulation,\nwhich elevated glucose uptake by 4.4-times (ùëù < 0.001).\n\n3.3.4. Western Blotting. In this study, expressions of two\nproteins (p-IRS1 and pY20) that are essential to the insulin-\nsignalling pathway were measured by Western blotting tech-\nnique. Both proteins were poorly expressed or not expressed\nat all in the insulin-resistant control group (Figure 6). Treat-\nment with stevioside led to expression of both proteins while\ntreatmentwith rosiglitazone elicited an increase in expression\nof pY20, though the effects of both treatments were hardly\ndistinguishable from those observed in normal, non-insulin-\nresistant cells.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nAim of this study was to investigate effects of stevioside\non insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1 cells. Oil Red-O is a com-\nmon lipid stain used to colour lipid droplets in vitro, for\nquantification and for microscopic and imaging purposes.\nThis specific staining method was used here to determine\nthe degree to which adipocyte differentiation process (also\ncalled adipogenesis) had progressed since droplets secreted\nby adipocytes upon full differentiation to mature adipocytes\nwill be stained (also referred to as lipid positive) [11].\nMicroscopic observation also revealed that lipid droplets\nwere present in cytoplasm of fully differentiated adipocytes\nin abundance, compared to their absence in preadipocytes\nbefore the differentiation process.\n\nAs confirmation, there was a significant increase in\nabsorbance values of eluted Oil Red-O stains from mature\ndifferentiated adipocytes (Figure 1). The stains from mature\nadipocytes were increased by 2.4 times (ùëù < 0.05) when\ncompared to control, which was the stain from empty wells;\nand were 4.2 times (ùëù < 0.001) higher when compared\nto preadipocytes. This showed that the insulin-DMX-IBMX\nsupplements combination was successful at hormonally trig-\ngering adipocyte differentiation in cells, most possibly via\nactivation of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor ùõæ\n(PPARùõæ) andCCAAT/enhancer binding proteinùõº (C/EBPùõº),\nas reported by Jin et al. [12].\n\nFully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were then sub-\njected to MTT assay to determine effect of stevioside on\ncell morphology and viability. 3T3-L1 Cells were treated with\nstevioside at concentrations ranging from 25 to 300ùúáM, for\nseveral different treatment periods: 14, 24, 48, and 72 hours.\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nStevioside concentration (ùúáM)\n0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nC\nel\n\nl v\nia\n\nbi\nlit\n\ny \n(%\n\n)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n(a)\n\nStevioside concentration (ùúáM)\n0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nC\nel\n\nl v\nia\n\nbi\nlit\n\ny \n(%\n\n)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n(b)\n\nStevioside concentration (ùúáM)\n0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\nC\nel\n\nl v\nia\n\nbi\nlit\n\ny \n(%\n\n)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n(c)\n\n‚àó\n‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó‚àó‚àó\n\nStevioside concentration (ùúáM)\n0 25 50 100 150 200 250 300\n\n‚àó‚àó‚àó\nC\n\nel\nl v\n\nia\nbi\n\nlit\ny \n\n(%\n)\n\n120\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 2: Viability of 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with stevioside for (a) 14 hours, (b) 24 hours, (c) 48 hours, and (d) 72 hours.

Mean ¬± SEM (ùëõ = 3). Statistically significant compared to control (‚àó‚àó‚àóùëù < 0.001, ANOVA & Dunnett‚Äôs test).\n\nTreatment for 14 hours was done as it was the stipulated\ndoubling time for 3T3-L1 adipocytes [13]. Viability of cells\nwas not markedly altered by exposure to stevioside except\nat concentrations greater than 100ùúáM following incubation\nfor 72 hours. Even then cell viability was still higher than\n80% with a maximum decrease of only 17%. Thus, median\ninhibitory concentration (IC\n\n50\n) could not be estimated from\n\nthis study. Some slight, nonsignificant increase in cell viability\nof 3T3-L1 adipocytes was observed as has been previously\nreported [11, 14, 15]. It can be surmised that stevioside did not\nexert cytotoxicity on 3T3-L1 adipocytes.\n\nTo test effects of stevioside on insulin-sensitivity of 3T3-\nL1 adipocytes, its effects on glucose uptake by the adipocytes\nwas determined. Radioactively labelled glucose uptake assays\n\nwere conducted with use of antidiabetic agent, rosiglitazone\nas a positive control, as previously reported [10].\n\nPrior to subjecting 3T3-L1 adipocytes to stevioside,\nresponse of the cells to insulin and toTNF-ùõºwere determined\nin separate assays to estimate optimum concentrations.These\nstudies showed that glucose uptakewas elevatedwith increase\nin insulin concentration in concentration-dependentmanner\nreaching a plateau at 100 nM of insulin. This insulin con-\ncentration was taken as the optimum concentration for use\nin further glucose uptake assays using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as\npreviously reported [16].\n\nTNF-ùõº has been implicated in the progression of\ninsulin resistance; it disrupts phosphorylation of several pro-\nteins involved in insulin-signalling pathway, including IRS1,\n\n\n\n6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nTreatment concentration (ùúáM)\n\n‚àó\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\nControl 0 30 60 90 120\n\nRM + insulin\nSvs + insulin\n100nM insulin\n\n‚àó‚àó‚àó\n2\n\n-d\neo\n\nxy\n-[\n1\n\n-3\nH\n\n]-\ngl\n\nuc\nos\n\ne\nup\n\nta\nke\n\nre\nla\n\ntiv\ne \n\nto\n c\n\non\ntr\n\nol\n (%\n\n)\n\n(a)\n\n‚àó‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó‚àó ‚àó\n\nRM\nSvs\n\nTreatment concentration (ùúáM)\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\nControl 0 30 60 90 120\n\n2\n-d\n\neo\nxy\n\n-[\n1\n\n-3\nH\n\n]-\ngl\n\nuc\nos\n\ne\nup\n\nta\nke\n\nre\nla\n\ntiv\ne \n\nto\n c\n\non\ntr\n\nol\n (%\n\n)\n\n(b)\n\n‚àó‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\n‚àó\n\nRM + insulin\nRM\n100nM insulin\n\nTreatment concentration (ùúáM)\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\nControl 0 30 60 90 120\n\n2\n-d\n\neo\nxy\n\n-[\n1\n\n-3\nH\n\n]-\ngl\n\nuc\nos\n\ne\nup\n\nta\nke\n\nre\nla\n\ntiv\ne \n\nto\n c\n\non\ntr\n\nol\n (%\n\n)\n\n(c)\n\n‚àó‚àó‚àó\n\n‚àó‚àó\n\nStevioside concentration (ùúáM)\n\nSvs + insulin\nSvs\n100nM insulin\n\n600\n\n500\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n0\nControl 0 30 60 90 120\n\n2\n-d\n\neo\nxy\n\n-[\n1\n\n-3\nH\n\n]-\ngl\n\nuc\nos\n\ne\nup\n\nta\nke\n\nre\nla\n\ntiv\ne \n\nto\n c\n\non\ntr\n\nol\n (%\n\n)\n\n(d)\n\nFigure 5: Effect of stevioside and rosiglitazone maleate on glucose uptake in TNF-ùõº induced insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

TNF-ùõº is also implicated\nin a number of catabolic states linked to insulin resistance\nsuch as sepsis and cancer even though its exact mechanism\nof actions remains unclear [18].\n\nTNF-ùõº caused a maximal decrease in glucose uptake\nat 1 ng/mL, beyond which glucose uptake was increased\nwhen compared to control. This observation contradicted\ninitial expectation of a concentration-dependent decrease in\nglucose uptake by TNF-ùõº, as was previously reported [19].\n\nNormally differentiated, mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes which\nwere not exposed to TNF-ùõº were used to evaluate effect\nof stevioside on insulin sensitivity in normal, non-insulin-\nresistant state to ascertain effects of its usage in health. Our\ndata showed that stevioside was better than the positive\n\ncontrol, rosiglitazone, at increasing glucose uptake in normal\nadipocytes. Glucose uptake was maximally increased by\n30 ùúáMof stevioside, both in presence or in absence of insulin\nstimulation, surpassing that of rosiglitazone at 120 ùúáM.\n\nIn TNF-ùõº induced insulin resistance, glucose uptake was\nmaximally increased by rosiglitazone or insulin at 90 ùúáM\neither in presence or absence of insulin. Since effect of rosig-\nlitazone on glucose uptake was not different from that of\nstevioside, it may be concluded that both treaments were\nequally effective at enhancing glucose uptake in insulin-\nresistant cells.\n\nThere appeared to be interaction between rosiglitazone\nand insulin in the insulin-resistant state with regards to glu-\ncose-uptake, which was lower in presence of 100 nM insulin\ncompared to in its absence. This observation was not seen\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7\n\nNormal IRRM\n60ùúáM\n\npIRS1\n\npY20\n\n90ùúáM\nRMSvs\n\n60ùúáM 90ùúáM\nSvs\n\nùõΩ-Actin\n\nFigure 6: Band intensities observed via Western blotting, showing\nthe different expression levels of phosphorylated insulin receptor\nsubstrate 1 (p-IRS1) and phosphorylated tyrosine (pY20), in groups\ntreated with stevioside (Svs) and rosiglitazone maleate (RM) in\ncomparison to the normal and insulin-resistant (IR) groups. ùõΩ-actin\nwas used as a loading control. The experiment was repeated thrice.\n\nwith stevioside as presence of insulin further elevated glucose\nuptake compared to its absence. A similar trend of enhanced\nglucose uptake by stevioside and rosiglitazone was observed\nin normal adipocytes. It may be assumed that stevioside‚Äôs\ninteraction with insulin was unaffected by insulin resistance\nunlike that of rosiglitazone except higher concentration of\nstevioside was needed to elicit significant increase in glucose\nuptake during insulin-resistant state compared to normal\nstate. The different behaviour of insulin-stimulated versus\nnon-insulin stimulated cells to rosiglitazone has important\nbearing in hyperinsulinaemic states which often occur in\ninsulin resistance, though not always. It is possible that\nstevioside is suitable for use in hyperinsulinaemic states,\nwhich, besides diabetes, often occur in certain cancers [20].\n\nThis study investigated two proteins‚Äîthe phosphory-\nlated insulin receptor substrate 1 (p-IRS1), and phospho-\nrylated tyrosine (pY20) that act upstream of the insulin-\nsignalling pathway. Our data showed both proteins were\npoorly expressed or not expressed at all in insulin-resistant\ncontrol group, which imply disruptions in the insulin-\nsignalling pathway as previously reported by Solomon et\nal. [17]. Such disruptions were successfully counteracted by\nstevioside which restored expression of both proteins, while\nrosiglitazone was also seen to increased expression of pY20\nin insulin-resistant cells. Expression of pY20 was elevated by\ntreatment with rosiglitazone or stevioside (60ùúáM & 90ùúáM)\nwhich provided support for potential ability of stevioside at\nsensitising cells to insulin signalling. p-IRS1 expression was\nobserved in normal cells and in those treated with stevioside,\nalthough the bands were of low resolutions and intensities.\nNo p-IRS1 bands were observed in insulin-resistant cells,\nincluding those treated with rosiglitazone. This showed that\nstevioside was able to restore p-IRS1 expressions, similar to\nthose observed in normal group. Stevioside possibly have an\neffect upstreamof the insulin-signalling pathway, by elevating\nlevels of pY20 and probably p-IRS1 as well, which will result\nin GLUT4 translocation to increase uptake of extracellu-\nlar glucose. Antihyperglycemic effects of stevioside on cell\nmetabolism as a whole has also been previously reported [21].\n\n5. Conclusion\n\nStevioside proved to be as effective as the antidiabetic agent,\nrosiglitazone, at enhancing glucose uptake in normal 3T3-L1\nadipocytes or in cells induced to insulin resistance via\nexposure to TNF-ùõº. In normal adipocytes, stevioside at a\nconcentration that was a quarter that of rosiglitazone pro-\nduced greater increase in glucose uptake than the antidiabetic\nagent, both in absence or presence of insulin-stimulation. In\ninsulin-resistant cells, stevioside was as effective as rosiglita-\nzone as similar concentrations of both produced comparable\nstimulation of glucose uptake in absence or presence of\ninsulin. Enhancement of glucose uptake by stevioside was\naccompanied by increased expression of p-IRS1 and pY20,\ndenoting involvement of GLUT-4 translocation. Further\nstudies are needed to unravel mechanisms underlying use of\nstevioside in adjuvant management of diabetes mellitus and\nits associated complications.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis researchwas funded by the Fundamental ResearchGrant\nScheme (FRGS) 600-RMI/ST/FRGS 5/3 Fst (52/2011) under\nUniversiti Teknologi MARA and provided by the Ministry of\nHigher Education, Malaysia.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] J.-P.
