RAS promotes tumorigenesis through genomic instability induced by imbalanced expression of Aurora-A and BRCA2 in midbody during cytokinesis. Int J Cancer. 2013 July 15;133(2):275-285 doi: 10.1002/ijc.28032. Epub 2013 Feb 12.  The image of BRCA2 staining (Figure 2b upper right) indicated from the tumor with KRAS mutation was erroneously taken from that with BRAF mutation during final figure preparation. The corrected Figure 2b showing BRCA2 staining (Figure 2b upper right) from the tumor with KRAS mutation is now provided, while the figure legend remains unchanged. The corrected figure is shown below. The authors apologize for the error.  DOI: 10.1002/ijc.29553  E rr  at u  m  Int. J.
