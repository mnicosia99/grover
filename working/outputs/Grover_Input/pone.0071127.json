Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play a key role in cellular stress. We\nhypothesized that placental expression of the small HSP 27 would be altered during labor and expression would vary in\ndifferent regions of the placenta. Six women in labor who delivered vaginally and 6 women not in labor, who were delivered\nby Cesarean section, were recruited. Four equally spaced pieces were sampled from the inner, middle and outer regions of\neach placenta (total 12 samples per placenta). HSP 27 expression was investigated by Western blot analysis and RT-PCR. For\nnon-labor, there was less HSP 27 protein in the inner placenta region compared with both the middle region (p,0.05) and\nouter region (p,0.05). For labor, there was also less HSP 27 protein in the inner region compared with both the middle\n(p,0.02) and outer region (p,0.01). When the 3 regions of the placenta were compared for non-labor versus labor there\nwas less HSP 27 in the labor group at both the inner (p,0.05) and middle regions (p,0.005) compared to non-labor. Similar\nto HSP 27 protein, there was less HSP 27 mRNA in the labor group in both the inner region (p,0.05) and middle region\n(p,0.02) compared to non-labor. This study suggests that placental HSP 27 may play a role in labor and is spatially\ncontrolled. The results have important implications for how data obtained from studies in the placenta can be influenced by\nsampling methods.\n\nCitation: Abdulsid A, Fletcher A, Lyall F (2013) Heat Shock Protein 27 Is Spatially Distributed in the Human Placenta and Decreased during Labor.

It can induce\n\na range of cellular responses depending upon how severe the insult\n\nis and the cellular compartment in which reactive oxidative species\n\nare generated [4,5].\n\nThe contractions that occur during labor are associated with\n\nintermittent utero-placental perfusion and could lead to an\n\nischemia-reperfusion type injury to the placenta. Indeed Doppler\n\nultrasound studies have demonstrated a linear inverse relationship\n\nbetween uterine artery resistance and the intensity of the uterine\n\ncontractions during labor [6]. Labor is also associated with placental\n\nalterations in several pathways linked to oxidative stress [7].\n\nHeat-shock proteins (HSPs) are a family of proteins expressed\n\nby all cells. They have many important physiological functions,\n\none of the most important being to help cells to cope with stressful\n\nsituations. Some HSPs are expressed constitutively while others\n\nare induced by a range of damaging insults including heat shock,\n\nischemia, hypoxia, oxidative stress and physical injury [8]. HSPs\n\nare named according to their molecular weight. HSP 27 belongs to\n\nthe family of small heat shock proteins (15–30 kDa). In response to\n\nstress, changes in expression of HSP 27 occurs and, like many\n\nproteins, HSP 27 function can also be regulated by at the post-\n\ntranslational level [9]. The functions of HSP 27 include protein\n\nchaperone, control of apoptosis, regulation of cell glutathione\n\nlevels, inhibition of actin polymerisation as well as protection\n\nagainst heat shock, oxidative stress and mechanical stress [9]. HSP\n\n27 also plays a role in atherosclerosis [10], in regulation of cytokine\n\nproduction from monocytes as well as expression of toll-like\n\nreceptors [11].\n\nSince HSP 27 plays a role in oxidative stress and inflammation,\n\nboth features of labor, we hypothesised that HSP 27 expression\n\nwould alter during labor in the placenta. Thus the aim of this study\n\nwas to examine the spatial expression of HSP 27 in placentae\n\nobtained from women who delivered by cesarean section and were\n\nnot in labor and secondly to compare the expression of each zone\n\nwith the equivalent zone of placentas obtained from women who\n\ndelivered vaginally following an uncomplicated labor.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nSubjects\nHuman term placentae were collected from pregnant women at\n\nthe Southern General Hospital, Glasgow. All ethics protocols were\n\nfollowed as per Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by\n\n‘‘Yorkhill ethics committee’’. Signed patient consent was obtained\n\nprior to delivery. Patients were handed an information sheet telling\n\nthem about the study before being handed the consent sheet. The\n\ninformation and consent sheets were also approved by the ethics\n\ncommittee. All signed consent sheets were stored incase of the need\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 August 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e71127\n\n\n\nfor audit. Placentae were collected from: (i) women who had\n\nuncomplicated pregnancies and delivered at term either vaginally\n\n(labor group, n = 6) or by caesarean section (non-labor group, n = 6).\n\nThe labor group were all spontaneous labor and were a tight group\n\n(labor time minimum 3 hours maximum 8 hours). All placentae\n\nwere free of infection, confirmed by the pathology report of every\n\nplacenta. The non-labor were group were all definitely without\n\nlabor. All were planned Caesarean sections performed for obstetric\n\nreasons: breach presentation (2) previous caesarean section (2) or\n\nmaternal request (2). The groups studied had no underlying\n\nmaternal conditions such as hypertension, preeclampsia, diabetes\n\nor gestational diabetes or any other medical disorders. There was no\n\nfetal pathology such as fetal growth restriction. The details of\n\npatients recruited are shown in Table 1.\n\nSample Collection\nFor each patient (6 patients per group), placental samples\n\n(,1 cm3) were obtained from three sites by taking measurements\nfrom the cord insertion point: inner third closest to cord insertion\n\npoint (inner zone), middle of placenta (middle zone) and outer third\n\nof placenta (outer zone) of placenta. Within each zone four separate\n\nsamples were obtained representing the four quadrants (Figure 1).\n\nPlacentae had a central cord insertion. Samples were rinsed and\n\nimmediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For this study we had\n\nperformed a power analysis using G*Power 3.1 for Macintosh and\n\nbased the numbers on our previous published work [12].\n\nChemicals\nAll chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (U.K.) unless\n\nstated otherwise.\n\nTissue Homogenizing For Western Blot\nSamples were recovered from storage at 270uC and ground in\n\nliquid nitrogen to a fine powder using a mortar and pestle. Tissues\n\nwas homogenised in the presence of protease inhibitors as\n\ndescribed previously [12]. Placenta homogenates were spun at\n\n5000 g for 10 minutes at 4uC to remove debris then supernatants\nwere collected and divided into aliquots and stored at 270uC.\nProtein concentrations were determined by Bradford analysis\n\nusing bovine serum albumin as a standard.\n\nWestern Blotting\nWestern blotting was performed as described previously [12] with\n\nsome modifications. A volume corresponding to 50 mg of each\nsample was separated by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis on 10%\n\nsodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide resolving gels. Pre-stained\n\nlow range molecular weight markers (BioRad) were loaded onto\n\neach gel. Transfer of proteins to Hybond ECL nitrocellulose\n\nmembranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was carried out at 22V\n\nand 200 mA for 30 min. Membranes were blocked in 5% donkey\n\nserum (Serotec) in TBSTB buffer (20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 0.5 M\n\nNaCl, 0.4% Tween and 0.25% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h at\n\nroom temperature (RT). Primary antibodies were pre-absorbed in\n\n5% human serum in TBSTB at RT during the blocking process.\n\nMembranes were incubated for 1 h at RT with primary antibody\n\nsolution. The HSP 27 (mouse monoclonal antibody) was obtained\n\nfrom Cell Signalling TechnologyH (number 2402) and used at\nconcentration of 1:1000. Membranes were washed and then\n\nincubated for 1 h at RT with horseradish peroxidase conjugated\n\ndonkey anti-mouse secondary antibody (Abcam (ab6820) diluted\n\n1:1000 in TBSTB. Membranes were rinsed with TBSTB (265 min)\nand once with distilled water. The same samples were exposed to ab-\nactin antibody (Sigma) to confirm even protein loading as shown\n\npreviously [12]. Immunologically reactive proteins were visualised\n\nand quantified as described previously [12]. A standard curve was\n\nperformed for different blot exposures and densitometry was\n\nperformed when bands were on the linear part of the loading graph\n\nas described previously [12]. For each group of experiments the\n\nsame loading control placenta sample was added to every gel and the\n\ndensitometry units were normalized to that. We previously\n\nconfirmed that this method of analysis gives similar findings to\n\nother quantitative methods of densitometry [12]. Statistical analysis\n\nwas performed using MiniTab on a PC using analysis of variance.\n\nComparison of groups was performed by the Mann Whitney test.\n\nGraphs show median values along with mean absolute deviation\n\nrange, a robust measure of the variability of the data.\n\nQuantitative Rt-Pcr\nTotal RNA was isolated using the RNeasyH Midi Kit (Qiagen,\n\n75142). RNA (100ng) was reverse transcribed into cDNA. Buffers\n\nand primers were obtained from the QuantiTectH Kit (Qiagen,\n205310) and GoScript\n\nTM\nreverse transcriptase from Promega\n\n(A501C). HSP 27 expression was analyzed by RT-PCR using\n\nvalidated TaqManH Gene Expression assays with StepOnePlus\n(Applied Biosystems). b-actin was used as an endogenous control.\nA positive control human placenta cDNA (Primer design) was\n\nTable 1.

The relative target gene levels were calculated by\n\ncomparative CT (DDCT). Statistical analysis was performed as\ndescribed above.\n\nResults\n\nTable 1 shows the demographics of the patients.\n\nWestern Blotting\nThe first set of experiments was designed to test whether there\n\nwas a difference in HSP 27 expression within an individual\n\nplacenta in either labor or non-labor. Figure 2 shows HSP 27\n\nexpression in the four zones of the inner, middle and outer area\n\nsampled from the cord insertion point. The upper panel shows a\n\nplacenta obtained from a non-laboring caesarean section delivery.\n\nThe bottom panel shows a placenta obtained from a women who\n\nwas in labor and delivered vaginally. Figure 3 shows the combined\n\nanalysis of all the placentae for either non-labor (upper graph) or\n\nlabor (lower graph). Overall there was a significant difference\n\nbetween the 3 areas of the placenta for both the non-labor group\n\nand labor group (ANOVA p,0.05). For the non-labor group there\n\nwas less HSP 27 in the inner compared with both the middle\n\n(p,0.05) and outer area (p,0.05). For the labor group there was\n\nalso less HSP 27 in both the inner compared with the middle\n\n(p,0.02) and outer area (p,0.01). Thus HSP 27 is expressed in a\n\nspatial manner within the placenta and the distribution patterns\n\nare similar in labor and non-labor.\n\nThe next set of experiments was designed to test whether there\n\nwas a difference in HSP 27 expression between labor and non-\n\nlabor groups for each of the three sites. Figure 4 shows one\n\nrepresentative blot of non-labor versus labor for each of the three\n\ndifferent areas of the placenta (upper panel; inner, middle panel;\n\nmiddle and lower panel; outer). Each of the 3 blots were\n\nperformed on separate days so only labor with non-labor can be\n\ncompared for this. Figure 5 shows the combined analysis for each\n\nof the three groups. Overall there was a significant difference\n\nbetween the 3 areas of the placenta when comparing each non-\n\nlabor group and labor group in each zone (ANOVA p,0.05).\n\nWhen individual zones were compared there was less HSP 27 in\n\nthe labor group at both the inner (p,0.05) and middle zones\n\n(p,0.005).\n\nThe final set of experiments was to determine whether the\n\nprotein changes found in Figure 5 were reflected by changes at the\n\nmRNA level. The results are shown in Figure 6. As for HSP 27\n\nprotein there was less HSP 27 mRNA in the labor group in both\n\nthe inner zone (p,0.05) and middle zone (p,0.02).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study shows for the first time that HSP 27 is expressed in a\n\nspatial manner in the placenta with the highest expression being in\n\nthe 2–4 cm (middle) area in both labour and non-labour groups.

Most previous reports of placental protein\n\nexpression do not take this into account. Taking a single or a few\n\nsamples or averaging protein expression of several samples may\n\nwell mask possible changes in expression. The study also shows\n\nthat HSP 27 protein and mRNA are reduced during labor at\n\ndefined zones. Apart from the reported changes and their link to\n\nplacental pathology the results have important implications for\n\nhow results in placental disease (and perhaps other organs) can be\n\ninfluenced by sampling methods.\n\nThe key finding of this study was the fall in both HSP 27 mRNA\n\nand protein at the inner and middle zones of the placenta during\n\nlabor and which was particularly striking in the middle zone.\n\nMany HSPs are increased to protect against stress in disease states\n\n[13] however in the present study HSP 27 was reduced. One\n\nreason for this may be that a fall in HSP 27 may be necessary to\n\nfacilitate the inflammatory steps of labor which is, after all, a\n\nnormal physiological process, not a disease. HSP27 protects\n\nagainst apoptosis, decreases oxidative stress, reduces the pro-\n\ninflammatory cytokine balance, stabilizes actin, and inhibits NFkB\nactivation [13] but during labor the opposite effect of these events\n\nneeds to occur.\n\nPrevious publications of HSP 27 expression in the placenta are\n\nfew. One study examined the expression of HSP 27 in placenta in\n\nlabor and non-labor [7]. A different approach was taken: since\n\ndifferent regions of the placenta were not compared, it is\n\nimpossible to directly compare the present study with that one.\n\nIn another study HSP 27 was reported to be unaltered in the\n\nplacenta in samples from labor and non-labor. However only one\n\nbiopsy was taken from each placenta and no quantification\n\nanalysis was performed or presented [14].\n\nFigure 5.

HSP27 can be\n\nphosphorylated at serine 15, 78 and 82 by MAPKAPK-2 and 3\n\n[13]. Phosphorylation favours small oligomers to form whereas de-\n\nphosphorylation favours formation of large oligomer [13]. Small\n\nand large forms may have different functions for example larger\n\nforms are important in chaperone and anti-oxidant roles whereas\n\nsmaller forms are important in actin regulation [13]. The HSP 27\n\ngene contains two functional HSE binding sites, a cAMP response\n\nelement as well as HSF-1 and 2 binding sites [13]. In view of the\n\nfindings of this study future studies will be directed to understand\n\nwhether any changes in phosphorylation of HSP 27 or\n\nMAPKAPK-2 or 3 occurs at defined zones during labor.\n\nWe have previously examined the expression of HSP 70 in the\n\nplacenta [12]. In non-labor HSP 70 was reduced in the outer area\n\nof the placenta compared with the middle area. In contrast in the\n\npresent study HSP 27 was reduced in the inner and middle areas\n\ncompared with the outer area. With regard to labor our previous\n\nstudy showed that HSP 70 was increased in the inner and middle\n\nareas, the opposite of the findings for HSP 27. At this stage it is\n\nonly possible to speculate why such zonal differences exist but may\n\nrelate to the functions of HSP 27 and 70, some of which differ and\n\nsome overlap. Placental separation is an important part of labor.\n\nHerman et al [15] showed that the process of placental separation\n\nfrom the uterine wall can be divided into three distinct phases i.e\n\nlatent, contraction/detachment and expulsion. They showed that\n\nplacental separation is accomplished by means of an orderly\n\nmultiphasic process with a definite direction and sequence. They\n\nfound in most cases the placenta separated from the uterine wall in\n\na ‘‘down-up’’ separation i.e initiating from the lower pole.\n\nInterestingly cases with a previous Cesarean section had a higher\n\nrate of up-down separation. In contrast in the case of ‘‘fundal\n\nplacentae’’ separation started at the placental poles (bipolar\n\nseparation) and the central area of the placenta was the last to\n\nseparate. It would be therefore of interest in a future study to\n\ninvestigate whether there was a link between the zonal distribution\n\nof HSP 27 or HSP 70 and the method of placental separation.\n\nPlacentas collected at term by cesarean section are not subjected\n\nto the stress of labor however one possibility is that zonal\n\ndifferences in HSPs might reflect the fact that labor is not far off\n\nand that the molecular steps to allow labor to proceed have\n\nstarted. Thus it would be interesting to compare placentas from\n\nthe second trimester where labor is not close to determine if such\n\nzonal differences still exist. In contrast at labor zonal differences in\n\nHSPs may be linked to the response to the stress of labor, extent of\n\nexposure to hypoxia or may contribute to the process that allows\n\nthe placenta to separate at delivery.\n\nWataba et al [16] showed that HSP 27 and 70 were increased in\n\nsyncytial knots, avascular villi and the presence of thrombus\n\nwhereas both were reduced in the presence of infarction suggesting\n\ndifferent stresses evoke different responses in HSPs in the placenta\n\nand the response may very depending on the area of the placenta\n\nexposed to the stress. It has been shown that HSP 27 regulates\n\napoptosis through key components of the apoptotic signalling\n\npathway, in particular, those involved in caspase activation and\n\napoptosis [17]. HSP 70 can also inhibit caspase 3 and 9 [18]. HSP\n\n70, via the TLR-2 receptor, can increase IL-10 production; IL-10\n\ncan be pro-inflammatory at labor which may accelerate parturi-\n\ntion [19]. This may also explain why HSP 70 increases at labor\n\nwhen HSP 27 decreases. Of interest is the observation that\n\nreduced matrix metalloproteinase 2 activity has been shown to be\n\nlinked to reduced HSP 27 [20]. Whether this is linked to the zonal\n\ndistribution requires further investigation. The expression of HSP\n\n27 was also reported to be reduced in placentae from SGA\n\nneonates although zonal distribution was not investigated [21].\n\nSmall HSPs have been studied in myometrium during labor.\n\nThe myometrium undergoes substantial remodeling at the time of\n\nlabor including rearrangement of the cellular contractile machin-\n\nery. Since HSP 27 can modulate actin polymerisation one study\n\ninvestigated changes in small HSPs in the myometrium at labor\n\n[22]. A 69% decrease in the small HSP aB-crystallin was found in\nthe myometrium at labor plus multiple isoforms of HSP 27.\n\nImmunoblotting using phosphospecific HSP 27 antibodies (HSP\n\n27-serine15, 278, and 282) detected marked changes in HSP 27\n\nphosphorylation at labor. HSP 27-Ser15 was 3.0-fold higher in\n\nlaboring myometrium. In contrast, levels of HSP 27-Ser82 were\n\n85% less in laboring myometrium. There was no significant\n\nchange in HSP 27-Ser78. It was proposed that decreased\n\nexpression of aB-crystallin at the time of labor liberates HSP 27\nenabling it to participate in other cellular events such as\n\ncytoskeletal remodeling. Clearly the functions and structure of\n\nthe myometrium and placenta are different, however since both\n\nplay a role in labor future work should investigate the expression of\n\naB-crystallin within the placenta during labor. Also that particular\nstudy highlights how different changes in HSP 27 can occur\n\ndepending on the cellular event to be targeted. In summary HSP\n\n27 is expressed in a spatial manner in the human placenta and\n\nchanges in expression occur during labor suggest that HSP 27 may\n\nbe part of the signaling process of labor and thus warrants further\n\ninvestigation particularly with regard to a role on pre-term labor.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Dr Kevin Hanretty for support during patient\n\nrecruitment and to the Libyan Government for funding A.
