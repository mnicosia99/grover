In the present study, we amplified and cloned the sequence (582 bp) encoding full-length bovine\nIL-18 from PBMC stimulated with PHA. The nucleotide and the deduced amino acid sequence of Bos\nindicus IL-18 showed an identity of 86–98% compared with IL-18 sequences of other ruminants. The\ninsert was subcloned into a pET 32a vector and expressed in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein and the\nmatured protein was obtained by caspase I treatment. The specificity of these proteins was confirmed\nby western blotting. The biological activity of the purified protein was analyzed by its ability to induce\nIFN-γ production in PBMC measured by ELISA and qPCR.\n\nKey words biological activity, Bos indicus, expression, interleukin (IL-18).\n\nIL-18, an enhancer of IL-12-driven Th1 immune response\nin hosts, is important in developing immunity against in-\ntracellular pathogens. IL-18 was originally termed IFN-γ-\ninducing factor because of its ability to induce IFN-γ pro-\nduction by Th1 cells and NK. Besides its IFN-γ-inducing\nactivity, IL-18 has been found to have other biological\nfunctions, such as stimulation of Th1 cell development,\nupregulation of GM-CSF and IL-2Rα, decreased IL-10 ex-\npression in T cells and the modulation of immunoglobulin\nsecretion by B cells (1–5). The pro-inflammatory activity\nof IL-18 is mediated by the production of nitric oxide,\nprostaglandins (6, 7) and inflammatory cytokines, such as\nTNF-α and IL-1β. IL-18 induces chemokines (IL-8, MIP-\n1, MCP-1) and recruits monocytes and macrophages to\nthe site of infection (2, 8). IL-18 is secreted as a precursor\nmolecule of 24 kDa which gets cleaved into an 18-kDa\nmature molecule which is mediated by caspase I (6).

In the present communication, we report\nthe cloning and expression of the full-length bovine (Bos\nindicus) IL-18 cDNA in the prokaryotic system and its\nbiological activity in vitro.\n\nPBMC (5 × 106 cells) isolated from cattle (Indian\nlocal Hallikar breed, Bos indicus) by density gradient\ncentrifugation using Histopaque 1.077 (Sigma India,\nBangalore, India) grown in RPMI-1640 medium were\nstimulated with PHA (10 μg/ml) for 16 hr. Total RNA\nwas extracted from stimulated cells using TRIZOL reagent\n(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reverse transcription was\ncarried out using an oligo dT primer. cDNA was used\nto amplify the bovine IL-18 sequence using IL-18L (5′\n\nGGCGGAATTCATGGCTGCAGAACAAGT AGA 3′) and\nreverse IL-18-R (5′ GGCGGCG GCCGCCTAGTTCTG-\nGTTTTGAACAGT 3′) primers designed using the IL-18\nsequence of Bos taurus (Accession No. EU276078). The\n\n564 c© 2010 The Societies and Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd\n\n\n\nExpression of bovine IL-18 in E. coliNOTE\n\npurified PCR product was digested with EcoRI and NotI\nand ligated to EcoRI- and NotI-digested pBSSK+ vector.\nThe cloned insert was subjected for sequencing in an auto-\nmated DNA sequencer and the sequence data submitted to\nGen Bank (Accession No. FJ985771). The nucleotide and\nthe deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned gene was\naligned with the sequences of different species of domes-\ntic animals and humans (available in the public database)\nusing the Meg Align (DNASTAR version 1.82) program\nand phylogenetic analysis was carried out using MEGA\nversion 2.1 (13).\n\nThe IL-18 sequence was subcloned into a pET 32a vec-\ntor (Novagen USA) at EcoRI and NotI sites (pET-bo-IL18).\nThe pET-IL18 plasmid was transformed into E. coli strain\nBL-21(DE3) PLys for protein expression. Cells were grown\n37◦C to OD600 = 0.8 and the expression was induced with\n1 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for\n4 hr at 30◦C. Bacterial lysate was used for SDS-PAGE anal-\nysis under denaturing conditions to visualize the protein\nband. Histidine-tagged fusion protein was purified on a\nnickel-chelating agarose affinity column according to the\nmanufacturer’s instructions under denaturing conditions\n(Invitrogen). Purified IL-18 was renatured by dialysis and\nthe endotoxin was removed by treating with Triton X 114\nusing a two-phase extraction method (14) and the endo-\ntoxin quantity was measured by Limulus amebocyte lysate\nassay kit (LAL; Biocompare, Kidlington, UK). The puri-\nfied proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western\nblotting using anti-human mAb (2 μg/ml; R&D Systems,\nMinneapolis, MN). The purified protein was treated with\n1 U/20 ng protein human recombinant caspase I (Biovi-\nsion, Mountain View, CA). The digested protein was used\nfor measurement of biological activity.\n\nThe induction of IFN-γ from PBMC by IL-18 protein\nwas used as an assay for IL-18 biological activity. Ini-\ntially, the dose of IL-18 required for optimal stimulation\nof PBMC was determined by using various doses (50–\n400 ng) and the 200 ng dose was found to be optimal.\nPBMC isolated from cattle were stimulated with recombi-\nnant IL-18 protein (200 ng/ml) and IFN-γ gene expression\nin PBMC was then measured by real-time PCR. Total RNA\nextracted from PBMC using TRIZOL was used to synthe-\nsize cDNA using an oligo dT primer. PCR reaction mixture\ncontained 1× SYBR green reaction mix (Applied Biosys-\ntems Carlsbad, CA) and 300 nm of both IFN-γ-specific\nprimers IFN-L (5′ tggatatcatcaagcaagacatgtt 3′) and IFN-\nR (5′ aggtcattcatcactttgatgagttcat 3′). Real-time PCR was\ncarried out using the ABI prism 7300 (Applied Biosys-\ntems) with conditions consisting of an initial step at 50◦C\nfor 2 min and 95◦C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles at 95◦C\nfor 15 s and at 60◦C for 1 min. The transcribed RNA from\nthe plasmid pcDNA-IFN-γ (containing full sequence of\nbovine IFN-γ) was used in the standard curve. The IFN-\n\nγ-RNA copy number was calculated from the quantified\nRNA (optic density at 260 nm) and serial dilutions of RNA\n(with 1 × 102 to 1 × 107 copies of RNA) were used for\nstandard curve preparation.\n\nProduction of IFN-γ by bovine whole blood stimu-\nlated with bovine recombinant IL-18 was carried out us-\ning a bovine IFN-γ ELISA kit (Mabtech, Nacka Strand,\nSweden) according to the manufacturer’s instructions\n(15). Heparinized whole blood was incubated with\n200 ng/ml purified IL18 in a six-well plate for 24 hr at 37◦C\nin a CO2 incubator. The plate was centrifuged at 800 ×g\nfor 10 min at 4◦C. Supernatant (100 μl) was pipetted out\nfrom each well into a new 96-well plate. IFN-γ standard\nknown amounts in duplicate were included and the quan-\ntity of IFN-γ in the unknown samples was estimated from\nthe standard curve obtained from the known standards.\nData are expressed as mean ± SEM.\n\nBovine IL-18 has an open reading frame of 582 bp\nencoding a protein of 193 amino acids with a predicted\nmolecular weight of 24 kDa. The sequence alignment\nshowed that bovine precursor IL-18 also has a signal pep-\ntide of 35 amino acids at the N-terminal followed by a ma-\nture peptide of 157 amino acids. Bovine IL-18 has high se-\nquence homology with that of other ruminants, as it shares\n94% and 92% amino acid identity with IL-18 of bubaline\nand nilgai, respectively (AC NO-AY401033, AY842499). It\nwas shown to have 91%, 90%, 85% and 82% amino acid\nidentity with carpine, ovine, porcine and equine IL-18 se-\nquences, respectively (AY605263, AJ401033, U68701.1).\nHowever, it shares approximately 76–78% amino acid\nidentity with human, fox, feline, and canine proteins\n(BC007461, EF581884, AB056857, Y11133). Phylogenetic\nanalysis of the nucleotide sequences of IL-18 of different\nspecies of domestic animals is presented as an unrooted\ntree (Fig. 1). As is evident from the tree, IL-18 sequences\nof ovine, nilgai and buffalo are clustered together and are\ndistinct from other species, including humans. Sequence\ncomparison of IL-18 of Bos indicus with that of other\nspecies showed that Glu42 and Lys89 are conserved in\nall the species in which sequences were compared. These\nconserved amino acids are shown to be critical to binding\n\nFig. 1.

Siva Reddy et al.\n\nnot only the IL-18 receptor molecule, but also the IL-18\nbinding protein, a naturally occurring protein which binds\nand neutralizes the biological activity of IL-18. Deletion\nmutants of IL-18 at Glu42 and Lys89 have lost their bi-\nological activity (16). Structure analysis of human IL-18\nhas revealed that three sites are important for receptor\nbinding. From the aligned sequences, it was observed that\nthe residues forming these critical sites were nearly well\nconserved in all the domestic animals. They include R49,\nD53, M69, D71 and D168, which form site I; K40, L41,\nK44, R94 and R140, which form site II; and 115K, 120K\nand D134, which form site III.\n\nBovine IL-18 insert was subcloned into a pET 32a vec-\ntor, transformed into BL-21 (DE3) PLys cells and the\nexpression of the gene was induced by IPTG. An addi-\ntional band of 42 kDa was observed in cases where lysate\nfrom induced bacteria corresponded to the IL-18 fusion\nprotein. Histidine-tagged protein was purified from the\nlysates by a nickel column. Precursor IL-18 undergoes\nproteolytic cleavage by IL-1β converting enzyme to gener-\nate a mature bioactive 18 kDa molecule. We expressed the\nIL-18 in soluble form and purified the protein by a nickel-\nnitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) column. Purified IL-18 was\nrenatured by dialysis and the endotoxin was removed by\ntreating with Triton-X114 and the endotoxin content in\nthe purified product was found to be 0.09 EU/μg pro-\ntein (endotoxin unit). The fusion protein of 42 kDa was\nexpressed initially and the 18 kDa matured protein was\nobtained after caspase I. Fusion protein from the crude\nlysate, purified protein and the mature protein reacted\nwith IL-18 anti-human monoclonal antibodies in an im-\nmunoblot assay (Fig. 2a,b). As IL-18 is a potent inducer\nof IFN-γ, we studied the level of IFN-γ-specific mRNA\n\nFig. 2. (a) Immunoblotting of recombinant bovine precursor IL-\n18.

Recently, several researchers have\nused IL-18 as an effective vaccine adjuvant not only in\nmice, but also in non-human primates (4, 17). Biologically\nactive bovine recombinant IL-18 protein expressed in the\nprokaryotic system will be useful in investigating the role\nof this cytokine as a therapeutic agent or a vaccine adjuvant\nin bovines.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge the financial assistance of the\nDepartment of Biotechnology Government of India, and\nthe Director, IVRI Izatnagar, Joint Director Indian Veteri-\nnary Research Institute, Bangalore for providing facilities.\nThe author further acknowledges Dr P.
