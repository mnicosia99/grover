Hemin-Binding\nCapacity of Porphyromonas gingivalis Lipopolysaccharide\n\nCHRISTOPHER W.

ARNOLD5\n\nDepartment of Biomedical Sciences and Periodontics, Baylor College of Dentistry, Dallas, Texas1; Emory University2\n\nand Morehouse School of Medicine,3 Atlanta, Georgia; Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts4;\nand University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina5\n\nReceived 29 January 1996/Returned for modification 12 March 1996/Accepted 27 March 1996\n\nPrevious studies have shown that the physical, biochemical, and antigenic properties of the bacterial outer\nmembrane are profoundly influenced by the growth environment. In the present study, the effects of growth in\nhemin-replete (H1) and hemin-depleted (H2) media on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the oral pathogen\nPorphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. Our studies show that LPS from P. gingivalis cultured in H1media\n(H1LPS) expressed additional low-molecular-mass antigens, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-\nacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot (immunoblot) analysis. Particularly evident was a 26-kDa\nantigen (26 LPSC) that was lost from the LPS upon transfer of P. gingivalis into H2 media. The loss of the 26\nLPSC was accompanied by a marked reduction in the hemin-binding capacity of the LPS. The 26 LPSC was\nrefractory to Coomassie blue staining and proteinase K digestion. H1LPS from strain W50/BE1, a nonpig-\nmented pleiotropic strain, lacked the 26 LPSC and did not bind hemin. Polyclonal antiserum raised to\nwhole-cell antigens of P. gingivalis A7436, W83, and HG405 grown in H1 media, but not in H2 media,\nrecognized the 26 LPSC in the purified H1LPS from any of the three strains. The immunoreactivities of sera\nfrom humans with (n 5 24) or without (n 5 25) periodontitis to the 26 LPSC and other H1LPS determinants\nwere analyzed by Western blot. Overall, 75% of adult periodontitis patient sera reacted with multiple bands in\nthe H1LPS stepladder, particularly in the range of 14 to 27 kDa. In contrast, only 20% of control sera reacted\nfaintly with H1LPS bands in the range 27 to 34 kDa. The 26 LPSC was recognized by over 40% of sera from\nadult patients with periodontitis and none of the healthy control sera. Taken together, these results suggest\nthat the antigenicity and hemin-binding properties of P. gingivalis LPS can be modified by growth in H1media.\n\nLipopolysaccharides (LPS) are among the most potent cell\nagonists known: LPS can act at picomolar concentrations to\ntrigger host inflammatory cells to release toxic oxygen radicals,\narachidonic acid derivatives, and cytokines (20). These prod-\nucts can in turn initiate a cascade of pathophysiological events\nthat can culminate in septic shock and tissue destruction (30).\nThe LPS of Porphyromonas (formerly Bacteroides) gingivalis, an\nopportunistic oral pathogen, has relatively little proinflamma-\ntory activity according to some reports (for a review, see ref-\nerence 16), while other reports suggest that it has potent proin-\nflammatory activity (6). These contradictory reports may relate\nto different growth conditions and to different methods of LPS\npurification. P. gingivalis is subjected to many environmental\nchanges in the gingival crevice during periodontal disease ac-\ntivity, including a decrease in the redox potential (21), an\nincrease in gingival bleeding on mild stimulation (11), and an\nincrease in crevicular fluid iron (up to 170 mM iron) (22).\nMuch of the crevicular fluid iron is thought to be derived from\nthe hemin molecule (13). While the iron atom in the hemin\nmolecule is the critical constituent for growth, the protopor-\nphyrin IX ring has been suggested to play a role in the binding\nand transport of iron into the cell (13). Modifying the hemin\nconcentration in the growth medium has been shown to mod-\nulate the virulence of P. gingivalis, presumably through alter-\nations in outer membrane protein expression (3); however, the\neffects of hemin on P. gingivalis LPS have not been examined.\n\nInterestingly, the LPS of several bacterial species (2, 24), in-\ncluding P. gingivalis (13), can bind hemin and may play a role\nin hemin sequestration and storage (26).\nIn the present study, the effects of growth of P. gingivalis in\n\nhemin-replete (H1) media and hemin-depleted (H2) media\non specific physical, biochemical, and antigenic properties of\nP. gingivalis LPS were examined. Our results indicate that growth\nof P. gingivalis in H1 media results in the expression of an\nadditional 26-kDa moiety (the 26 LPSC). The 26 LPSC is re-\nfractory to Coomassie blue staining and proteinase K diges-\ntion, is immunogenic, and is recognized by serum antibodies\nfrom periodontitis patients but not healthy control subjects.\nThe 26 LPSC was lost upon transfer of P. gingivalis into H2\nmedia, which was accompanied by a decrease in the hemin-\nbinding capacity of the LPS.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial strains and culture conditions. P. gingivalis A7436, a clinical isolate\noriginally characterized by the late V. R. Dowell (Anaerobic Laboratory, Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga.), was the principal strain used\nin this study. Also employed in the LPS studies were strains W83, ATCC 33277\n(American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, Md.), W50, W50/BE1 (kindly\nprovided by A. S. McKee, PALS, Porton Down, United Kingdom), HG 405, HG\n864 (kindly provided by A. J. Van Winkelhoff, Academic Center for Dentistry,\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands), and the transpositional mutant strain MSM-3,\nwhich has a defect in the transport and utilization of heme (13). Stock cultures\nwere maintained on anaerobic blood agar plates (Remel, Lenexa, Kans.) in an\nanaerobic chamber (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc., Ann Arbor, Mich.) at 378C\nin an atmosphere of 85% N2–5% H2–10% CO2. The expression of LPS was\nexamined after P. gingivalis in was cultured in H1 medium or H2 medium, as\ndescribed previously (13). Briefly, late-exponential-phase cultures of P. gingivalis\ncultured in H1 media were initially transferred as a 10% (vol/vol) inoculum to\nanaerobically equilibrated H2 media and incubated at 378C in an anaerobic\natmosphere for 24 h. The 24-h P. gingivalis culture in H2 medium served as the\n\n* Corresponding author. Mailing address: Department of Periodon-\ntics and Biomedical Sciences, Baylor College of Dentistry, P.O.

Growth was monitored by A660 (Pharmacia\nLKB spectrophotometer) and by total viable cell counts determined by serial\ndilution on anaerobic blood agar plates. Late-exponential-phase cultures in ei-\nther H1 or H2 medium were used for LPS extraction. H1 medium contained\n1.5 mM hemin and consisted of either a complex, commercially available medium\n(2.8% Schaedler broth; Difco, Detroit, Mich.) or a less complex, basal medium\n(14). H2 medium contained no added hemin and consisted of either a complex,\ncommercially available medium (Trypticase soy broth; Difco) or basal medium\nwithout added hemin. Basal medium contains the following per liter: trypticase\npeptone, 10 g; tryptophan, 0.2 g; sodium sulfite, 0.1 g; and cysteine (14).\nLPS purification. LPS cultured in H1 medium (H1LPS) or H2 medium\n\n(H2LPS) were extracted from P. gingivalis by the hot-phenol-water technique\n(32) followed by cesium chloride gradient centrifugation (9). Briefly, approxi-\nmately 10 g (wet weight) of P. gingivalis was suspended in 35 ml of pyrogen-free\nwater–35 ml of 90% phenol at 658C added dropwise for 20 min and stirred\nconstantly. The aqueous phase was separated by centrifugation at 7,000 3 g for\n20 min and collected. This process was repeated, and the aqueous phase was\npooled and dialyzed extensively against deionized water for 3 days. The dialyzed\nLPS preparation was subjected to cesium chloride isopycnic density gradient\ncentrifugation (in 0.5837 g of CsCl2–4.4 ml of the LPS preparation) at 42,000 rpm\nfor 72 h in a Beckman (Palo Alto, Calif.) L-60 Ultracentrifuge. The refractive\nindices of the gradient fractions were determined with a refractometer, and\nvalues were converted to density (grams per milliliter). Fractions containing LPS\n(density fractions between 1.42 and 1.52 g/ml) were pooled, dialyzed against\ndistilled water for 3 days, lyophilized, and stored at room temperature. LPS was\nanalyzed for protein by the Pierce BCA protein assay. LPS samples were also\nseparated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-\nPAGE) and stained for protein with Coomassie blue. Selected LPS samples were\nalso subjected to proteinase K digestion, as described previously (4). Briefly, LPS\nsamples were incubated with proteinase K (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.)\n(100 mg per mg of LPS) for 1 h at 608C. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added\ndirectly to this preparation, which was heated at 1008C for 5 min and applied to\nthe gel (data not shown).\nSDS-PAGE analysis of LPS. H1LPS and H2LPS were subjected to SDS-\n\nPAGE with the Laemmli buffer system (19) using 12.5% gels or commercially\nprepared 10 to 20% gradient gels (Integrated Separation Systems, Hyde Park,\nMass.). LPS samples suspended in saline were sonicated for 5 s and heated in\nSDS sample buffer at 1008C for 5 min. Gel electrophoresis was carried out at 27\nmA per gel through the 4% stacking gel and 33 mA per gel through the resolving\ngel. The current was stopped when the dye front reached the bottom of the gel.\nOne gel was stained with 0.2% (wt/vol) Coomassie brilliant blue R250 (Fisher\nScientific Company, Fairlawn, N.J.) in 25% (vol/vol) isopropanol–7% (vol/vol)\nacetic acid, and the other gel was silver stained by using the Tsai and Frasch\ntechnique (29).\nElectroblotting and probing nitrocellulose. Electroblotting was performed by\n\nusing the buffer system of Towbin et al. (27) in the Protean 1 transfer cell\n(Bio-Rad, Richmond, Calif.) running at 40 V for 16 h and then 80 V for 30\nminutes. Briefly, blotted nitrocellulose was cut into 5 mm strips (see Fig. 3), and\nthe strips were placed in separate wells in an incubation tray (Bio-Rad). After\nbeing washed three times in washing buffer–Tween 20 (WBT), unreacted sites\nwere blocked with 100 mg of human serum albumin (Sigma) in WBT, washed\nthree times in WBT, and treated with a 1:50 dilution of patient serum in WBT\novernight (or a 1:200 dilution of polyclonal rabbit antiserum [see Fig. 2]) at 48C.\nAfter being washed three times in WBT, blots were probed with a 1:2,000\ndilution of rabbit anti-human immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase (or goat\nanti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-horseradish peroxidase for Fig. 2) for 30 min.\nAfter being washed three times in WBT and once in washing buffer, bands were\ndeveloped with 0.06% 4-chloro-1-naphthol in washing buffer and 30% H2O2.\nThe color reaction was stopped with washing buffer at the desired intensity.\nGeneration of rabbit antiserum. Antisera to P. gingivalis strains grown in H1\n\nmedium (Schaedler broth) were produced in New Zealand White female rabbits\n(3 to 4 kg) with the use of a procedure described by Parent et al. (23). Briefly, the\nrabbits received daily intravenous injections into the marginal ear vein with\nincreasing doses of a formalin-killed bacterial suspension (approximately 1.2 3\n109 cells per ml in saline) ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 ml for a total of 10 injections,\nand 1 week later they received a booster series of three daily injections with 1.5\nml of the antigen suspension. On day 27, 50 ml of blood was drawn from the\ncentral artery of the ear. A series of booster injections were repeated at biweekly\nintervals after this test bleeding, and peak antibody titers were detected by\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (10). The sera obtained were pooled to\nprepare antisera against the bacteria and frozen at 2708C.\nPatient selection. Sera were obtained from 24 patients with chronic adult\n\nperiodontitis (AP) and 25 healthy control subjects. The minimum clinical criteria\nfor acceptance into the study as an AP patient were (i) no previous periodontal\ntreatment, (ii) age of at least 30 years, and (iii) one or more periodontal pockets\nof at least 6 mm and at least 30% bone loss at those sites. AP patient sera were\nfurther segregated by patient age, sex, race, and disease severity. Five sera were\nobtained from patients with mild AP (American Academy of Periodontology\n[AAP] type II), 12 sera were from patients with moderate AP (AAP type III),\nand 7 sera were from patients with severe AP (AAP type IV). The guidelines for\nthese clinical criteria are described elsewhere (1). The 25 control patients were\nage, sex, and race matched and had no periodontal pockets greater than 4 mm\n\nand no detectable generalized or localized bone loss. Subjects with a history of\nsystemic disease or receiving antimicrobial therapy or other chemotherapeutic\nagents 4 weeks prior to participation in the study were not included. Approxi-\nmately 30 ml of blood was drawn from the antecubital vein of each patient, 20 ml\nwas allowed to clot, and the serum was drawn off and centrifuged to remove\nerythrocytes. Serum was aliquoted and frozen at 2708C. A complete battery of\nclinical laboratory tests, including SMA-22 and complete blood count, was per-\nformed on the remainder of the blood, and patients with significant deviations\nfrom the norm were excluded from the study and advised to seek medical\nconsultations.\nHemin binding assays. The binding of hemin to whole cells and LPS of P.\n\ngingivalis was analyzed spectrophotometrically, as previously described (14, 15).\nWhole-cell hemin binding was analyzed as follows. P. gingivalis grown in either\nH1 or H2 medium (basal medium) for 24 h was pelleted, washed in phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in PBS to an optical density at 660 nm\nof 1.5 (1010 CFU/ml). To this was added hemin to a final concentration of 30\nmg/ml (based on previous saturation studies [14]). A 1.0-ml sample was imme-\ndiately removed, cells were pelleted, and the supernatant was analyzed spectro-\nphotometrically for hemin (optical density at 400 nm). The remaining cells were\nincubated at 378C under anaerobic conditions and assayed at 5- to 15-min\nintervals for residual hemin in the supernatant. P. gingivalis cultures without\nadded hemin or hemin without added cells served as a control. The concentra-\ntion of hemin present in the supernatant fractions was calculated from a hemin\nstandard curve. Binding of hemin to whole cells was calculated as the difference\nbetween the total hemin added and the amount remaining in the supernatant at\neach time point compared with that at time zero (14). The binding of hemin to\nLPS was analyzed as follows: lyophilized H1LPS and H2LPS were reconstituted\nto 1 mg/ml in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.2. A 0.05-ml sample of each LPS was added\nto 0.60 ml of PBS containing a total of 30 mg of hemin, and the mixture was\nincubated for 4 h at 48C with shaking. LPS-hemin complexes were removed by\nhigh-speed centrifugation (30,000 3 g for 60 min) followed by ultrafiltration\n(membrane with an Mr cutoff of 10,000) (15), and the resulting supernatant\nfractions were assayed spectrophotometrically for residual hemin (optical density\nat 400 nm). Hemin binding was calculated as described above.\n\nRESULTS\n\nSDS-PAGE analysis of LPS from P. gingivalis cultured in\nH1 and H2 media. LPS from all P. gingivalis strains tested\n(except strain W50 BE1) separated into stepladder-like bands\nthat migrated at a molecular mass range (relative to the mi-\ngration of protein standards) of ca. 14 to 50 kDa. This migra-\ntion pattern was similar to that obtained with commercially\nprepared smooth-chemotype LPS from Escherichia coli O111:B4\n(Sigma Chemical Co.). Interestingly, growth ofP. gingivalis in H1\nmedium (Fig. 1) resulted in a shift in the electrophoretic mobility\npattern of the LPS, leading to the expression of a greater\nnumber of low-molecular-mass bands and the addition of a\nband at ca. 26 kDa, which we have designated the 26 LPSC.\nThe 26 LPSC was observed for P. gingivalis grown in either\ncomplex (Fig. 1A) or basal (Fig. 1B) H1 medium. The 26\nLPSC was refractory to Coomassie blue staining and protein-\nase K digestion (not shown). Interestingly, the 26 LPSC was\nlost, along with several other bands at ,26 kDa after passage\nof P. gingivalis in H2 medium, either complex (Fig. 1A) or\nbasal (Fig. 1B). The 26 LPSC was not observed in H1LPS or\nH2LPS from strain W50/BE1 (Fig. 1B). The LPS from W50/\nBE1 migrated like a rough-chemotype LPS, similarly to that of\nSalmonella typhimurium Rc, which is a complete core polysac-\ncharide but lacks O-specific antigen (17).\nWestern blot (immunoblot) analysis of H1LPS from P. gin-\n\ngivalis W83, A7436, and HG405. To determine if the hemin-\ninduced 26 LPSC was immunogenic, antiserum was raised to\nstrain A7436, W83, or HG405 cultured in H1medium (Schae-\ndler broth). As shown in Fig. 2, antisera raised to all three\nstrains recognized the 26 LPSC in H1LPS from all of three\nstrains but not H2LPS (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). Moreover,\nantibodies raised to whole-cell antigens of P. gingivalis strains\nA7436, W83, or HG405 cultured in H2 media did not recog-\nnize the 26 LPSC in H1LPS from strain A7436, W83, or\nHG405 (data not shown).\nWestern blot analysis of human serum reactivity to H1LPS\n\nfrom P. gingivalis A7436. Sera from patients with AP and from\n\nVOL. 64, 1996 EFFECTS OF HEMIN ON P. GINGIVALIS LPS 2283\n\n\n\nhealthy controls were reacted with nitrocellulose strips con-\ntaining Western-blotted P. gingivalis H1LPS. Periodontitis\nsera reacted with a maximum of 28 bands in the H1LPS, many\nof which may represent repeating subunits of the O antigen\n(17). These bands migrated with relative molecular masses of\napproximately 14 to 50 kDa (Fig. 3A). The reactivity pattern\nachieved with serum pooled from the 24 AP patients is shown\nschematically in Fig. 3C. Most of the variability in reactivity\npatterns, however, was observed towards the lower-molecular-\nmass moieties (,27 kDa), such as the 26 LPSC. For example,\npatient 4 serum reacted with the hemin-induced 26 LPSC\n(band A in Fig. 3C), as well as a band at approximately 14 kDa\n(band C in Fig. 3C) and a band at approximately 11 kDa (band\nD in Fig. 3C). Patient 7 showed very intense reactivity with the\n\n26 LPSC and faint reactivity with band D. Patient 17 showed\nlittle reactivity to anything but the 26 LPSC and band B (ap-\nproximately 20 kDa). Patient 25 reacted strongly with the 26\nLPSC and band C but not band B or D. The percentage of\npatient or control sera of the total number of patient or control\nsera tested that reacted with each band is shown in Fig. 4. Over\n40% of the periodontitis sera reacted with the 26 LPSC (band\nA), while none of the control sera reacted with the hemin-\ninduced band. In general, 75% of periodontitis patient sera\nreacted strongly with multiple LPS bands, especially in the\nrange of 27 to 34 kDa. Only 20% of C sera reacted with more\nthan one LPS band, and most reactivity was also in the range\nof 27 to 34 kDa. In contrast, blotting with LPS from E. coli\nO55:B5 revealed no discernible differences in periodontitis and\ncontrol serum reactivity (not shown).\nA cluster analysis (BMDP [Menlo Park, Calif.] statistical\n\npackage) was performed to determine the association between\nreactivity to LPS and the age, sex, race, and disease status of\nthe patients and controls (not shown). The analysis revealed\nthat 75% of the 24 AP patient sera that reacted with the 26\nLPSC clustered together and were drawn from patients diag-\nnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis. In contrast, the\ntype II or mild-periodontitis patients reacted with fewer LPS\nbands and clustered in the middle. The 26 LPSC was recog-\nnized by only 20% of the five type II patient sera. The controls,\nwith few exceptions, clustered at the bottom and were not\nreactive with the 26 LPSC. No clustering was found for age,\nsex, or race.\nHemin binding by P. gingivalis whole cells and LPS. As\n\nshown in Table 1, H1LPS (or H1 whole cells) from P. gingi-\nvalis A7436 bound significantly more hemin than H2LPS (or\nH2 whole cells). In contrast, H1LPS from strain W50/BEI did\nnot bind hemin. There was no difference in hemin binding\nbetween H1LPS and H2LPS from the transpositional inser-\ntional mutant strain MSM-3, which has a defect in the trans-\nport and utilization of heme (13).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe results of the present study suggest that growth of P.\ngingivalis in H1 media can lead to the expression of additional\nantigenic determinants on the LPS. Similar modifications have\n\nFIG. 1. SDS-PAGE analysis of H1LPS and H2LPS from P. gingivalis. (A)\nH1LPS and H2LPS purified from P. gingivalis cultured in complex media (see\nMaterials and Methods).

The latter study, involving Klebsiella pneu-\nmonia, may be particularly relevant to our findings. A similar\nshift in the LPS profile, involving the low-molecular-mass an-\ntigens, was observed after growth of K. pneumonia in perito-\nneal dialysate or serum; however, the hemin or iron concen-\ntration in these body fluids was not specified. Hemin has been\nshown to regulate the expression of many virulence factors of\nP. gingivalis, including outer membrane proteins, fimbriae,\nouter membrane vesicles, hemolytic activity, protease activity,\ncollagenolytic activity, and hemagglutination (for a review, see\nreference 13); however, this is the first report of a hemin-\ninduced structural modification of LPS.\nThese observations may have particular relevance to peri-\n\nodontal disease and other chronic inflammatory diseases that\nare characterized by epithelial cell ulceration, increased vas-\ncular permeability (11, 22, 25), and leakage of blood into the\ntissues (13). The modulation of LPS by hemin is apparently\nfunctional (6) as well as structural. Champagne et al. (6) have\nshown that H1LPS from P. gingivalis (which they have termed\n“hemin-normal LPS”) is a more potent agonist for polymor-\nphonuclear leukocyte superoxide release than non-hemin-\nmodulated LPS. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are one of the\n\nFIG. 3. Human serum reactivity with H1LPS from strain A7436.

GINGIVALIS LPS 2285\n\n\n\nfirst immune cell types to encounter bacterial pathogens at the\nsite of periodontal infection (7). Polymorphonuclear leuko-\ncytes are thought to play both a protective role and a destruc-\ntive role in the tissues, depending upon the activation state of\nthe cells (7). Therefore H1LPS, if it exists in nature, may\naccelerate tissue destruction by activating polymorphonuclear\nleukocytes and other inflammatory cells to release potentially\ndestructive reactive oxygen products, cytokines, and proteases\n(20). It is tempting to speculate that, as antibodies reactive with\nthe 26 LPSC are observed in patients with periodontitis,\nH1LPS may exist in nature; moreover, despite the hydropho-\nbic and membrane-constitutive nature of lipid A, it is exposed\non the bacterial cell surface, predominantly on outer mem-\nbrane vesicles or blebs (2). Understanding the mechanisms of\nenhanced activation of inflammatory cells by H1LPS may be a\ncritical step in disease intervention.\nWe initially suspected that the hemin-dependent 26-kDa\n\nLPS moiety (26 LPSC) was a protein that copurified with LPS,\nsuch as the 26-kDa outer membrane hemin-binding protein\ndescribed by Bramanti and Holt (3). However, the 26 LPSC\nproved to be refractory to Coomassie blue staining and insen-\nsitive to proteinase K digestion. Although the kinetics of\ngrowth in the H1 media was more rapid than that in the H2\nmedia (14), the induction of the 26-kDa moiety does not ap-\npear to be related to growth phase, since all cultures were\nharvested at late log phase of growth. In addition, we have not\npreviously observed these LPS changes in other growth media\nthat resulted in similar kinetics of growth (not shown). At\npresent, the identity of the 26 LPSC is unknown, but endotox-\nin-associated proteins, such as porins, can be highly resistant to\norganic solvents and enzymes (12). Efforts are under way in\nour laboratories to biochemically and structurally characterize\nthe hemin-dependent changes in LPS.\nStudies by several investigators suggest that the LPS of P.\n\ngingivalis may play a role in sequestering hemin, which it then\ntransports into the cell to obtain iron for growth (13). Grenier\n(15) has shown that P. gingivalis LPS binds hemin with high\naffinity via the lipid A moiety; moreover, Smalley et al. have\nsuggested that LPS may serve as a storage depot for hemin\n(26). Genco et al. (14) have shown that growth in HRM1\nmedia induces an increase in the binding of hemin by P. gin-\ngivalis. The present study indicates that H1LPS binds more\nhemin than H2LPS. Interestingly, H1LPS from the transpo-\nsitional insertional mutant strain MSM-3, which has a defect in\nthe utilization and transport of heme, did not bind more hemin\nthan H2LPS. Whether the 26 LPSC plays a role in hemin\nbinding is subject to speculation. Our finding that the LPS of\nthe nonpigmented strain W50/BE1 does not bind hemin and\ndoes not produce the 26 LPSC in H1 media seems to support\nthis speculation.\nIn summary, our data indicate that growth of P. gingivalis in\n\nH1 media resulted in additional antigenic determinants in the\nLPS, including a 26-kDa LPS moiety (26 LPSC), as well as an\nincreased capacity to bind hemin. These changes in LPS were\nreversed when the bacteria were transferred into H2 media.\nThe pleiotropic mutant strain W50/BE1, which is nonpig-\nmented and does not agglutinate erythrocytes, lacks the 26\nLPSC and does not bind hemin. The 26 LPSC is nonprotein-\naceous, immunogenic, and antigenically similar among three P.\ngingivalis strains tested. A cluster analysis revealed that immu-\nnoreactivity to the 26 LPSC, as well as other low-molecular-\nmass LPS components, clustered with the periodontal disease\nstatus of the patients.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by Public Health Service grant\nDE00214 from the National Institute of Dental Research and by Bay-\nlor College of Dentistry research funds for C.W.C. and by Public\nHealth Service grant DE09161 from the National Institute of Dental\nResearch and grant RR03034 from the National Center for Research\nResources for C.A.G.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
