of Naja sumatrana (Equatorial Spitting\nCobra) Venom and Its Major Toxins in Experimentally\nEnvenomed Rabbits\nMichelle Khai Khun Yap1, Nget Hong Tan1*, Si Mui Sim2, Shin Yee Fung1, Choo Hock Tan2\n\n1 CENAR and Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, 2 Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine,\n\nUniversity of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The optimization of snakebite management and the use of antivenom depend greatly on the knowledge of\nthe venom’s composition as well as its pharmacokinetics. To date, however, pharmacokinetic reports on cobra venoms and\ntheir toxins are still relatively limited. In the present study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics of Naja sumatrana\n(Equatorial spitting cobra) venom and its major toxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin), following\nintravenous and intramuscular administration into rabbits.\n\nPrincipal findings: The serum antigen concentration-time profile of the N. sumatrana venom and its major toxins injected\nintravenously fitted a two-compartment model of pharmacokinetics. The systemic clearance (91.3 ml/h), terminal phase\nhalf-life (13.6 h) and systemic bioavailability (41.9%) of N. sumatrana venom injected intramuscularly were similar to those of\nN. sputatrix venom determined in an earlier study. The venom neurotoxin and cardiotoxin reached their peak concentrations\nwithin 30 min following intramuscular injection, relatively faster than the phospholipase A2 and whole venom (Tmax = 2 h\nand 1 h, respectively). Rapid absorption of the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin from the injection site into systemic circulation\nindicates fast onsets of action of these principal toxins that are responsible for the early systemic manifestation of\nenvenoming. The more prominent role of the neurotoxin in N. sumatrana systemic envenoming is further supported by its\nsignificantly higher intramuscular bioavailability (Fi.m. = 81.5%) compared to that of the phospholipase A2 (Fi.m. = 68.6%) or\ncardiotoxin (Fi.m. = 45.6%). The incomplete absorption of the phospholipase A2 and cardiotoxin may infer the toxins’\naffinities for tissues at the injection site and their pathological roles in local tissue damages through synergistic interactions.\n\nConclusion/Significance: Our results suggest that the venom neurotoxin is absorbed very rapidly and has the highest\nbioavailability following intramuscular injection, supporting its role as the principal toxin in systemic envenoming.\n\nCitation: Yap MKK, Tan NH, Sim SM, Fung SY, Tan CH (2014) Pharmacokinetics of Naja sumatrana (Equatorial Spitting Cobra) Venom and Its Major Toxins in\nExperimentally Envenomed Rabbits.

In\n\nMalaysia, cobra bites appears to be one of the commonest causes\n\nof snake envenomation [4–6]. There are two species of common\n\ncobras in Malaysia: Naja kaouthia and Naja sumatrana, both classified\n\nas Category 1 medically important venomous snake [2]. Of these\n\ntwo Naja cobras, N. sumatrana is widely distributed in the Peninsula\n\nMalaysia (including Singapore), and is also known as the\n\nEquatorial spitting cobra [8], one of the venom-spitting species\n\nin Southeast Asia that are able to cause venom ophthalmia.\n\nClinically, cobra bites produce systemic envenomation syndrome\n\nwith the characteristic neuromuscular paralysis, and local toxicity\n\nmanifested as severe tissue necrosis [2,6,9]. The characterizations\n\nof different cobra venoms, however, are necessary for the better\n\nunderstanding of cobra envenomation pathophysiology as the\n\ntoxin compositions in cobra venoms vary from species to species\n\n[10]. Recent venom profiling with the use of ion-exchange high\n\nperformance liquid chromatography has shown that the major\n\ntoxins of N. sumatrana venom comprise high abundance of\n\nphospholipase A2 and three-finger toxins such as polypeptides of\n\nneurotoxins and cardiotoxins [10]. These are toxins with varied\n\nbiological and physicochemical properties which make the\n\ncharacterizations of individual toxins warranted in order to gain\n\nbetter insights into the toxic effects of the whole venom. The\n\noptimization of snakebite management and the use of antivenom\n\ndepend greatly on the knowledge of the venom’s composition,\n\npharmacological activities, as well as its disposition in the body (i.e.\n\npharmacokinetics). The pathophysiological and pharmacological\n\neffects of snake envenomation are related to the absorption and\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pntd.0002890&domain=pdf\n\n\ndistribution kinetics of venom toxins into the systemic circulation.\n\nIndeed, it has been reported that the serum concentrations of\n\nvenom antigens in snakebite victims are well correlated with the\n\nseverity of systemic and local symptoms during the course of\n\nenvenomation [11]. Although there have been some studies on the\n\npharmacokinetics of snake venoms or toxins in animals [12–22], the\n\nhighly varied snake venom compositions, inconsistent animal\n\nmodels, different pharmacokinetic modelling make the convergence\n\nof the data equivocal to have the pharmacokinetic parameters\n\ngeneralized across all snake species. To date, even within the Naja\n\ngenus of cobras, the pharmacokinetic studies on their venoms were\n\nlimited to isolated toxins of Formosan cobra [12,21], a few African\n\ncobra venoms and their alpha toxins [15] and N. sputatrix venom\n\n[22]. Information on the systemic bioavailability of cobra venoms\n\nand their toxins following envenomation is even scarcer in the\n\nliterature. There is therefore a need to define the pharmacokinetic\n\nparameters of specific cobra venom and its toxins more meticulously\n\nfor better clinical correlation.\n\nIn the present study, the pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana\n\nvenom and its three major types of toxins (neurotoxin, cardiotoxin\n\nand phospholipase A2) were investigated using double-sandwich\n\nELISA. This is the first report where the pharmacokinetics of a\n\ncobra venom was investigated alongside the pharmacokinetics of\n\nall its major types of toxins. The results will make it possible to\n\ninterpret the pharmacokinetics of the whole venom in the light of\n\nthat of its major toxins, and to enable better understanding of the\n\npathophysiological effects of the venom.\n\nMethods\n\nEthical statements\nAll experimental animals were handled in accordance to\n\nCIOMS guidelines on animal experimentation [23]. The exper-\n\nimental protocol on the animal study (2013-06-07/MOL/R/FSY)\n\nwas approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use\n\nCommittee, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.\n\nVenom, reagents and separation media\nThe venom was a pooled sample obtained from three adult N.\n\nsumatrana captured in central Malaysia (Negeri Sembilan) and was\n\nsupplied by Snake Valley (Seremban, Malaysia).\n\nResource S ion exchange column and HiTrap Protein A HP\n\naffinity column were purchased from GE Healthcare (New Jersey,\n\nUSA). Goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conju-\n\ngate was obtained from Abnova, Taipei, Taiwan. Lichrosphere\n\nWP 300 C18 reverse-phase column cartridge was purchased from\n\nMerck, New Jersey, USA. iBlot Gel Transfer stacks and iBlot\n\nblotting system were supplied by Invitrogen. Sephadex G-25 gel\n\nbeads and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma – Aldrich\n\n(St. Louis, USA) or as stated in the methods.\n\nAnimals\nThe animals used in this study (New Zealand white rabbits)\n\nwere supplied by Chenur Supplier (Selangor, Malaysia). The\n\nanimals were housed in Laboratory Animal Centre, Faculty of\n\nMedicine, University of Malaya, and received water and food ad\n\nlibitum.\n\nPurification of N. sumatrana toxins\nThe major N. sumatrana venom toxins (phospholipase A2,\n\nneurotoxin and cardiotoxin) were isolated from the venom by\n\nResource S ion-exchange chromatography as described by Yap et\n\nal., 2011 [10]. The isolated phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin (corresponds to peak 5, peak 7 and peak 8, respectively\n\nas reported in Yap et al., 2011 [10]) were further purified by C18\nreverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to\n\nhomogeneity on 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel\n\nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gel bands were subjected to in-\n\ngel tryptic digestion followed by protein identification using matrix\n\nassisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/\n\nTOF) mass spectrometry, as described by Yap et al., 2011 [10].\n\nProduction of IgG antibodies against N. sumatrana\nvenom, venom phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and\ncardiotoxin\n\nPre-immune serum was collected and used as the control in\n\nELISA. In the first immunization, N. sumatrana venom (10 mg) or\nvenom toxins (neurotoxin, cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2,\n\nrespectively at 5 mg) dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2) and mixed with an\nequal volume of Freund’s complete adjuvant, was injected\n\nintramuscularly into the thigh of the rabbits (n = 3 for each group).\n\nFor the subsequent immunizations, 20 mg of the venom or 10 mg\nof venom toxins were dissolved in PBS (pH 7.2), respectively,\n\nmixed with an equal volume of Freund’s incomplete adjuvant and\n\ninjected intramuscularly at multiple sites at the back of the rabbit\n\nfortnightly for 8 weeks. The immunogenicity and antibody titers of\n\ninocula were monitored using indirect ELISA as described by Yap\n\net al., 2011 [10]. The rabbits were bled by cardiac puncture 9 days\n\nafter the final immunization as indicated by plateauing of antibody\n\ntiter on indirect ELISA.\n\nPurification of IgG and preparation of horseradish\nperoxidase (HRP) conjugate\n\nAnti - N. sumatrana venom IgG and three anti-toxins IgG were\n\nisolated from rabbit sera (upon completion of immunization\n\nscheme) by Sephadex G-25 gel chromatography, followed by\n\nProtein A affinity chromatography [24]. The IgG-HRP conjugate\n\nwas prepared as described by Wisdom, 1996 [25].\n\nInvestigation of immunological cross-reactivity of N.\nsumatrana major venom toxins (phospholipase A2, PLA2;\nneurotoxin, NTX; cardiotoxin, CTX)\n\nIndirect ELISA for investigation of immunological cross-\n\nreactivity. ELISA immunoplate was coated with 100 ng/ml of\n\nvenom toxin (phospholipase A2, PLA2; neurotoxin, NTX or\n\ncardiotoxin, CTX) respectively and incubated overnight at 4uC.\nThe plates were washed with PBS-Tween and subsequently anti-\n\nPLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG or anti-CTX IgG (dilutions 1:200) was\n\nadded and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 1 h. This\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nNaja sumatrana is a medically important cobra species in\nSoutheast Asia. The optimization of snakebite manage-\nment and the use of antivenom depend greatly on the\nknowledge of the venom’s composition, its biological\nactivities, as well as its pharmacokinetics. The present\nstudy on the pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom\nshows that the systemic bioavailability of this venom in\nexperimental envenomation is similar to N. sputatrix\nvenom determined in an earlier study. The neurotoxin\nand cardiotoxin exhibited a more rapid absorption and\nelimination compared to the phospholipase A2 and the\nwhole venom. The venom neurotoxin produced a higher\nsystemic bioavailability than the cardiotoxin and phos-\npholipase A2, suggesting that the neurotoxin plays the\nmajor toxic role in cobra bites.\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\nwas followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish\n\nperoxidase conjugate (dilutions of 1:6000) and 100 ml of substrate\no-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (0.4 mg/ml) for 1 h. The\n\nreaction was terminated by adding 50 ml sulfuric acid (12.5%).\nThe absorbance at 492 nm was then determined using Bio-Rad\n\nModel 690 microplate reader. The degree of cross-reactivity was\n\nexpressed in percentage (%) of absorbance.\n\nDouble-sandwich ELISA for investigation of immunological\n\ncross-reactivity. ELISA immunoplate was coated overnight at\n\n4uC with 100 ml of anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG, anti-CTX IgG\n(4 mg/ml), respectively. Plates were then incubated with 100 ml of the\nrespective venom toxins as antigens (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin,\n\ncardiotoxin) at a concentration of 100 ng/ml. This was followed by\n\nincubation with 100 ml of anti-toxins IgG-HRP conjugate (1:400) for\n2 h, and 100 ml of substrate o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride\n(0.4 mg/ml) was then added. The reaction was terminated after 1 h by\n\nadding 50 ml of 12.5% sulfuric acid and the absorbance at 492 nm\nwere then determined using Bio-Rad Model 690 microplate reader.\n\nThe degree of cross-reactivity was expressed in percentage (%) of\n\nabsorbance.\n\nSDS-PAGE and western blotting (immunoblotting). SDS-\n\nPAGE was conducted in an electrophoresis (slab) system according\n\nto the method described by Studier, 1973 [26] and a Fermentas\n\nSpectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder broad range SDS-\n\nPAGE standard was used for calibration. Ten micrograms of venom\n\ntoxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin or cardiotoxin) was electro-\n\nphoresed (15% gel) under reducing condition.\n\nThe proteins on the polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a\n\npolyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (iBlot Gel Transfer\n\nstacks, PVDF, mini, Invitrogen) using iBlot blotting system\n\n(Invitrogen). The PVDF membrane was subsequently blocked wit\n\n2% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, Tween 20. Anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-\n\nNTX IgG or anti-CTX IgG (dilution of 1:500 in TBS-Tween) was\n\nadded to the PVDF membrane followed by incubation with Goat\n\nanti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (dilutions of\n\n1:1000) for 1 h. The chromogenic detection of the protein bands on\n\nthe PVDF membrane was carried out by addition of the substrate\n\nsolution (Novex HRP Chromogenic Substrate (TMB), Invitrogen).\n\nDetermination of serum venom antigen and venom toxin\nantigen levels using double-sandwich ELISA\n\nDouble-sandwich ELISA was conducted as described previously\n\n[27]. It was used to monitor the serum venom antigen levels\n\nfollowing experimental envenomation in rabbits (n = 3) during\n\npharmacokinetic studies. Briefly, ELISA immunoplates were\n\ncoated overnight at 4uC with optimal coating concentration for\nvenom and venom toxins, which has been optimized as stated\n\nabove in the previous section (double-sandwich ELISA for\n\ninvestigation of immunological cross-reactivity). This was followed\n\nby subsequent incubation with 100 ml of diluted rabbit serum\nsamples (1:20) collected at different time intervals, 100 ml of anti-N.\nsumatrana venom IgG-HRP conjugate and anti-toxins IgG-HRP\n\nconjugate (dilution of 1:400) for 2 h. Substrate o-phenylenedi-\n\namine dihydrochloride (0.4 mg/ml) was added for colorimetric\n\ndevelopment and the absorbance at 492 nm was then determined\n\nusing Bio-Rad Model 690 microplate reader. A standard curve\n\nwas constructed using varying dilutions of venom or the respective\n\ntoxins in the spiked pre-envenomed sera.\n\nPharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom or toxins after\nintravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administrations\n\nThe pharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom or toxins was\n\nstudied using rabbits (n = 3). A sub-lethal dose of the venom or\n\ntoxins was administered intravenously (i.v., marginal ear vein) or\n\nintramuscularly (i.m., quadriceps) into rabbits. Doses administered\n\nwere as follow: venom 0.5 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.1 mg/kg (i.v.);\n\nphospholipase A2 0.1 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.); neurotoxin\n\n0.07 mg/kg (i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.); cardiotoxin 0.15 mg/kg\n\n(i.m.) or 0.05 mg/kg (i.v.). Blood samples were collected from\n\ncentral ear artery before experimental envenomation and at\n\nspecific time points (5 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 6 h and\n\n24 h) after venom injection. The collected blood samples were\n\ncentrifuged at 3,500 g for 20 min to obtain the sera, which were\n\nkept at -20uC until further analysis. The serum antigen concen-\ntrations were measured by double-sandwich ELISA as described\n\nabove using the pre-envenomed serum sample taken from the\n\nsame animal as the control for baseline reading.\n\nA parallel series of experiments were conducted to investigate\n\nthe pharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin in the whole venom when N.\n\nsumatrana venom was injected intravenously or intramuscularly\n\ninto the rabbits (n = 3). The serum concentrations of cardiotoxin\n\n(in the whole venom) at specified sampling times were estimated\n\nusing anti-CTX IgG on a double-sandwich ELISA, as described\n\nabove. The equivalent amounts of cardiotoxin in the injected\n\nwhole venom (0.1 mg/kg, i.v. or 0.5 mg/kg, i.m.) were estimated to\n\nbe 0.04 mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg, respectively, based on a 40% (by dry\n\nmass) composition of the whole venom [10]. This additional study\n\naimed to verify if the pharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin when\n\ninjected alone would be significantly different from that when\n\ninjected in its native environment (the whole venom).\n\nPharmacokinetic analysis\nThe pharmacokinetic parameters of N. sumatrana venom and\n\nvenom toxins were determined using the method of feathering\n\n[28]. The initial phase rate constant (a) and terminal phase rate\nconstant (b) were determined from the slopes of the best-fit lines\nobtained for the initial phase and terminal phase, respectively, of\n\nthe log plasma concentration versus time plot. The initial phase\n\nhalf-life (T1/2a) and terminal phase half-life (T1/2 b) were\n\ndetermined by formula T1/2a or T1/2b = 0.693/a or b. The area\nunder the curve (AUC) was calculated from zero time to the last\n\nexperimental time point by trapezoidal rule and extrapolated to\n\ninfinity (AUC0-‘) according to the formula: AUC0-‘ = AUC0-t+\nCt/b, where t is the last experimental time point and Ct represents\nthe last serum venom concentration determined at time t.\n\nThe distribution rate constants for the transfer between central\n\ncompartment (designated as 1) and peripheral compartment\n\n(designated as 2) were calculated from the equations: k21 = (Ab\n+ Ba)/(A+B) and k12 = a+ b 2 k212 (ab/k21).\n\nThe other important pharmacokinetic parameters were deter-\n\nmined as follows:\n\nSystemic clearance, CL = dose (F)/AUC0-‘\nVolume of distribution by area, Vd,area = CL/b\nVolume of central compartment, Vc = Dosei.v./(A + B)\nVolume of peripheral compartment, Vp = k12/k21 (Vc)\n\nFi.v. is the intravenous bioavailability which is 1.\n\nFi.m. is the intramuscular bioavailability, and was calculated as\n\nfollows:\n\nFi:m~\nAUCi:m:\n\nAUCi:v:\n|\n\nDosei:v:\n\nDosei:m:\n\nStatistical analysis\nAll data are reported as the mean 6 S.D. or mean (95% C.I.).\n\nMann-Whitney U test was used to compare differences between\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 3 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\ntwo independent groups. Kruskal-Wallis H Test is the nonpara-\n\nmetric test for the comparison of more than two independent\n\ngroups. The level of significance was set at p,0.05. The statistical\n\nanalysis was conducted using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,\n\nUSA).\n\nResults\n\nPharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom following\nintravenous administration\n\nThe serum concentration-time profiles of whole N. sumatrana\n\nvenom antigen following a single i.v. and i.m. administrations of\n\nvenom into rabbits (n = 3) are shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe i.v. serum concentration-time profile of N. sumatrana venom\n\n(0.1 mg/kg) (Figure 1, dotted line) showed a bi-exponential pattern\n\nwhich was best fitted to a two-compartment model of pharmaco-\n\nkinetics described by the equation Ct = Ae\n2at + Be2bt: where Ct\n\nrepresents the concentration at time, t; A and B represent the\n\nvenom concentrations at the zero time intercepts of the initial fast\n\nphase and terminal slow phase, respectively; while a and b\nrepresent the first-order disposition rate constants for the initial\n\nfast phase and the terminal phase, respectively.\n\nThe venom antigen level declined rapidly within the first 1 h\n\n(T1/2a = 0.8 6 0.3 h) during the initial phase followed by a much\n\nslower decline at the terminal phase (T1/2b = 13.661.1 h). The\n\nvolume of distribution by area (Vd,area) of the venom antigens in\n\nrabbits was 1.860.03 L, and the systemic clearance (CL) was\n\n91.367.8 ml/h, and the AUC0-‘ was 2201.26185.5 ng/ml.h.\n\nThe distribution rate constant for transfer from central to\n\nperipheral compartment (k12 = 0.460.2 h\n21\n\n) was comparable to\n\nthat from peripheral to central compartment (k21 = 0.560.2 h\n21\n\n;\n\np.0.05). Consequently, the volume of peripheral compartment\n\n(0.860.2 L) calculated based on the ratio of k constants was\n\ncomparable to that of central compartment (1.060.1 L).\n\nPharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom following\nintramuscular administration\n\nThe intramuscular administration of whole N. sumatrana venom\n\nin rabbits yielded a serum concentration-time profile (Figure 1,\n\nsolid line) with the absorption and distribution phase appeared\n\nindistinguishable. The venom antigen level peaked within 1 h at a\n\nconcentration (Cmax) of 391.7648.5 ng/ml. The terminal half-life\n\n(T1/2b = 12.560.9 h), volume of distribution by area (Vd,area\n= 1.760.1 L) and the systemic clearance (CL = 94.8612.7 ml/h) of\n\nthe venom antigen following i.m. injection were not significantly\n\ndifferent from that of i.v. pharmacokinetic parameters (p.0.05)\n\n(Table 1).\n\nThe AUC0-‘ of N. sumatrana venom when injected intramuscu-\n\nlarly (0.5 mg/kg) was 4617.86583.8 ng/ml.h. However, when\n\nadjusted to the intravenous venom dose (0.1 mg/kg), the\n\nnormalized AUC0-‘ of the venom antigens following i.m.\n\nadministration was 923.66116.8 ng/ml.h, which was significantly\n\nlower than the i.v. AUC0-‘ value (2201.26185.5 ng/ml.h;\n\np,0.05). The i.m. bioavailability (Fi.m.) calculated from the two\n\nAUC0-‘ values were 41.960.2%.\n\nImmunological cross-reactions of N. sumatrana venom\ntoxins (phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin)\n\nThe phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin were\n\nisolated and purified from N. sumatrana venom.

The pharmacokinetic parameters\n\nof cardiotoxin when only the toxin was administered are also\n\nlisted for comparison (see Discussion). Most of the pharmacoki-\n\nnetic parameters of the in-venom cardiotoxin were comparable\n\nwith values obtained when only purified cardiotoxin was\n\nadministered, with the major exceptions of a longer elimination\n\nhalf-life (T1/2b) and a lower clearance (CL) for the in-venom\n\ncardiotoxin (Table 5).\n\nDiscussion\n\nGenerally, the serum concentration-time profile of the venom/\n\ntoxin injected intravenously can be described by an open two-\n\ncompartment pharmacokinetic model where the venom or toxin is\n\ndistributed between the central and peripheral compartments. The\n\ndistribution half-life of N. sumatrana venom (T1/2a = 0.77 h) is\n\ncomparable to the value obtained for N. sputatrix venom in an\n\nearlier study (T1/2a = 0.5 h) [22], and to that for the African cobra\n\nvenoms (T1/2a = 22.2–30.5 min) [15] although a three–compart-\n\nment pharmacokinetic model was applied in the latter case. The\n\nterminal half-life (T1/2b = 13.6 h) of N. sumatrana venom was not\n\nsignificantly different to that of N. sputatrix venom (T1/2b = 15.4 h)\n\n[22], indicating that the elimination of the venom antigens of these\n\ntwo Southeast Asian spitting cobras occurred at similar rate.\n\nThe volume of central compartment approximated 1 L for N.\n\nsumatrana venom, indicating that on intravenous administration,\n\nthe venom distributes rapidly and uniformly not only in the plasma\n\nof the animal (28–50 ml/kg for rabbit) but also in highly perfused\n\ntissues and interstitial fluids as well in view of its major content\n\nbeing water-soluble low molecular mass toxins (,10 kDa) which\n\nmay readily permeate the vascular endothelium [10]. As the ratio\n\nof the inter-compartmental transfer rate constants k12 and k21 for\n\nthe venom approximates unity (k12/k21 = 0.78), this means that at\n\nequilibrium (when inter-compartmental transfer rates are equal),\n\nthe amount of venom antigens in both the compartments do not\n\nvary significantly. This finding corroborates with that obtained in\n\nour earlier pharmacokinetic study of N. sputatrix venom (k12/\n\nk21 = 1) [22]. On the other hand, the large Vd,area of the venom\n\n(1.8 L, more than 10-fold of the total blood volume of a 2-kg\n\nrabbit) suggests that this cobra venom antigens distribute\n\nextensively to the peripheral or extra-vascular tissues. This seems\n\nto be a general phenomenon for venom antigens distribution in\n\nexperimentally envenomed animals [12,13,15]. Venom toxins that\n\nare distributed widely into the peripheral compartment may be\n\nassociated with the rebound phenomenon that sometimes occur\n\nduring antivenom therapy as rapid immunodepletion of venom\n\ntoxins in the blood favors the redistribution of venom antigens\n\nfrom the peripheral back into the central compartment [31,32].\n\nTo study the absorption of venom from the non-vascular\n\nparenteral administration site, the pharmacokinetics of N. suma-\n\ntrana venom was studied following an intramuscular administration\n\nof the venom (sub-lethal dose) into rabbits. The resulting serum\n\nvenom antigen concentration-time profile showed a relatively fast\n\nabsorption of some venom antigens within the first few minutes. A\n\nsubsequent short lag observed during the absorption phase of the\n\nvenom was probably due to the absorption of some venom\n\nantigens via the lymphatic route from the injection site into blood\n\ncirculation [20]. However, the serum concentration-time profile of\n\nthe intramuscularly injected whole venom yields apparently\n\nindistinguishable absorption and distribution phases of the various\n\ntoxins. The indistinguishable absorption and distribution phase\n\nreflects the continuous absorption of various antigenic venom\n\ncomponents that occur simultaneously with their respective\n\ndistribution phases. There was only one major serum concentra-\n\ntion peak seen at 1 h, presumably caused by the summated\n\nabsorption of a bulk of phospholipase A2 (Tmax,2 h) and the\nthree-finger toxins, i.e. neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (Tmax,K h)\ninto the systemic circulation occurring at a rate in close proximity\n\nwith each other. Rapid absorption of the venom with a short Tmax\ncorrelates with the fast onset of neurotoxic effect in cobra\n\nenvenoming, where the venom is known to exert direct inhibitory\n\naction on the neuromuscular junction via a postsynaptic blockade\n\n[33]. Administration of the venom by intramuscular route did not\n\nalter T1/2b, Vd,area and CL of the venom antigens. This indicates\n\nthat the elimination (and not the absorption) process is likely the\n\nrate-limiting step for the terminal phase of the pharmacokinetic\n\nprofile of intramuscularly injected venom.\n\nAs demonstrated from ion-exchange HPLC studies [10], N.\n\nsumatrana venom contains more neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (17%\n\nand 40%, respectively) compared to N. sputatrix venom (consists of\n\n8% neurotoxin and 35% cardiotoxin). However, N. sputatrix venom\n\nhas substantially greater amount (35%) of phospholipase A2 than\n\nN. sumatrana venom (28%). This may account for the somewhat\n\ngreater plasma clearance of N. sumatrana venom (91.3 ml/h)\n\ncompared to that of N. sputatrix venom (68.7 ml/h), since the\n\nsmaller three-finger toxins (more abundant in N. sumatrana venom)\n\nare cleared faster than the larger phospholipase A2 (more\n\nabundant in N. sputatrix venom), especially via the renal excretion\n\nroute.\n\nThe bioavailability of N. sumatrana venom following i.m. injection\n\nwas 41.9%, indicating incomplete absorption of the antigenic\n\nvenom components from the injection site into the systemic\n\ncirculation. This may be due to strong affinities of the cobra\n\nvenom toxins at the injection site [12,21], and this hypothesis\n\ncorrelates well with cobra venom’s prominent toxic effect on local\n\ntissues that lasts for days to weeks [9,34–36]. The bioavailability of\n\nN. sumatrana venom (Fi.m.) was similar to that of N. sputatrix venom\n\n(Fi.m = 41.7%), which is a reflection of the fact that the cardiotoxin\n\nrepresents the bulk of both venoms (Fi.m. of cardiotoxin was 46%,\n\ndiscussed below).\n\nPharmacokinetics of the individual major toxins of N.\nsumatrana venom\n\nSince snake venom is a mixture of hundreds of proteins and\n\npeptides, it is therefore virtually impossible to investigate the\n\npharmacokinetics of each individual toxin when the whole venom\n\nwas administered into rabbits. As such, in this study, we only\n\nselected three representative toxins of N. sumatrana venom\n\n(neurotoxin, cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2) for pharmacoki-\n\nnetic investigations. These three toxins also represent the major\n\ntypes of toxins in the venom.\n\nIt should be noted that accurate quantitative measurement of\n\nindividual toxins in the serum of experimentally envenomed\n\nanimal using ELISA assay is not always feasible because of the\n\nimmunological cross-reactivities observed among the snake venom\n\ntoxins [37]. Indeed, our immunological cross-reaction studies\n\nrevealed extensive cross-reactivity between the phospholipase A2\nand polypeptide neurotoxin purified from N. sumatrana venom,\n\ndemonstrating that unrelated venom proteins of distinctive\n\nprimary structures and biological functions may share common\n\nantigenic domains [27,38]. As such, in the present report the\n\npharmacokinetics of N. sumatrana venom purified phospholipase\n\nA2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin was studied after intravenous or\n\nintramuscular injection of a sub-lethal dose of each toxin into\n\nrabbits. Double-sandwich ELISA was developed in which specific\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 9 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\nanti-toxin IgG’s (i.e. anti-PLA2 IgG, anti-NTX IgG, anti-CTX\n\nIgG) were used to measure the serum toxin antigen levels following\n\ninjections of the individual toxins into rabbits.\n\nThe individual serum concentration-time profiles of the toxins,\n\nas with the whole venom, injected intravenously were also best\n\nfitted to an open two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, where\n\nthe toxins distributed between central and peripheral compart-\n\nments. Following intravenous administration, the individual toxins\n\ni.e. phospholipase A2, neurotoxin and cardiotoxin demonstrated\n\nshorter distribution half-lives (0.56–0.66 h) compared to the whole\n\nvenom (0.93 h), reflecting a more rapid distribution of the purified\n\ntoxins on entering the systemic circulation.\n\nOn the other hand, unlike that observed for the whole venom,\n\nthere was no fluctuation pattern during the absorption and/or\n\ndistribution phase in the serum concentration-time profile of\n\nindividual toxins administered intramuscularly. The significant\n\ndifferences in the absorption of the whole venom and toxins were\n\nalso reflected by the time to reach peak concentration (Tmax). The\n\nneurotoxin and cardiotoxin antigens reached their respective peak\n\nconcentrations much faster than phospholipase A2, indicating fast\n\nabsorption of these two low molecular mass toxin molecules\n\n(approx. 8 kDa) from the injection site into the systemic\n\ncirculation. These principal cobra toxins are known to directly\n\ntarget receptors and cellular membranes, inducing rather rapid\n\ntissue responses compared to some viperid toxins the actions of\n\nwhich involve intermediate steps to accomplish the toxic effect, for\n\ninstance, coagulopathy secondary to defribrinogenation induced\n\nby thrombin-like enzymes [32]. The fast absorption of neurotoxin\n\nand cardiotoxin likely accounts for the rapid onset of the systemic\n\neffects upon cobra envenomation i.e. neuromuscular paralysis and\n\ncardiac complications [7,9,39]. In view of the rapid absorption of\n\nthese major toxins, meticulous monitoring for early institution of\n\nantivenom when indicated becomes crucial in order to alleviate\n\nthe severity of syndrome and to preempt fatal outcome.\n\nFurthermore, all the three toxins exhibited a large Vd,area (1.6–\n\n2.2 L) which are .10 fold of the total blood volume of a rabbit,\n\nsuggesting that the toxin antigens distributed extensively into the\n\nperipheral tissues. This finding is congruent with the large volume\n\nof distribution of the whole venom in rabbits as described above.\n\nBoth the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin (2.0–2.2 L) showed a larger\n\nVd,area compared to the phospholipase A2 (1.4 L), and this may be\n\nbecause low molecular mass proteins like neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin (with molecular mass of approximately 7–8 kDa) cross\n\nthe capillary endothelium more easily than do the larger proteins\n\n[13] such as phospholipase A2 (16 kDa).\n\nIn this study, the terminal half-lives (T1/2b) of neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin were similar (8.6–8.8 h) but shorter than that of\n\nphospholipases A2 (11.7 h). This finding is consistently reflected in\n\nthe systemic clearance of the three toxins, where the clearance\n\nvalues of neurotoxin and cardiotoxin were significantly larger\n\n(indicative of faster elimination) than that of phospholipase A2.\n\nAssuming that the elimination takes place primarily from the\n\ncentral compartment and probably via the renal excretion route,\n\nthe faster clearance of neurotoxin and cardiotoxin can be\n\nexplained by the higher vascular permeability of the two toxins\n\nas both are low molecular mass peptides. However, the T1/2b\nvalues for the neurotoxin and cardiotoxin determined in this study\n\nare substantially different from the terminal half-lives of African\n\ncobras’ a-neurotoxin (15–29 h, in rabbits) [15] and that of\ncytotoxin from Chinese cobra, Naja naja atra (3.5 h, in rabbits)\n\n[12], suggesting intrageneric variations in the pharmacokinetics of\n\nthese cobra three-finger toxins.\n\nAmong the three major toxins, N. sumatrana neurotoxin has the\n\nmost complete systemic absorption from the injection site, as\n\nevidenced by its higher intramuscular bioavailability\n\n(Fi.m. = 81.5%) than that of phospholipase A2 (68.6%) and\n\ncardiotoxin (45.6%). This is in agreement with the finding of\n\nIsmail et al. (1998) [16], who reported a bioavailability of 88% for\n\nWalterinnesia aegyptia a-neurotoxin. Interestingly, the Fi.m. of\ncardiotoxin was only 45.6%, presumably due to the strong\n\nbinding affinity of cardiotoxin to the tissues at the injection site\n\nresulting in a poor absorption of cardiotoxin into the systemic\n\ncirculation. On the other hand, the Fi.m. of the phospholipase A2\nwas 68.6%, indicating that a substantial amount of the toxin\n\nremained at the injection site. Indeed, bites from N. sumatrana (and\n\nmost Naja cobras) can produce local envenomation characterized\n\nby local tissue necrosis involving the cutaneous, muscular and\n\nconnective tissue layers [2,9,34,40,41]. Cardiotoxin and phospho-\n\nlipase A2 have been reported to interact synergistically and possess\n\npotent cytolytic activity [42,43], and their substantial unabsorbed\n\namount at the injection site seem to suggest that their toxic effects\n\nplay an important role in local envenoming, which consequences\n\ninclude tissue necrosis following cobra bites, as well as venom\n\nophthalmia in venom-spitted victims [44].\n\nAlthough the i.v. pharmacokinetic behavior of neurotoxin is\n\nsimilar to that of cardiotoxin (particularly in having a rapid\n\nabsorption with a short Tmax), their intramuscular bioavailabilities\n\ndiffered markedly. The relatively low bioavailability of cardiotoxin\n\nwould suggest that the systemic effects of cardiotoxin may not be\n\nthat prominent in cobra envenomation, even though the venom\n\ncontains relatively large amount of cardiotoxins (40% of venom\n\ncontent [10]). Furthermore, the neurotoxin is known to be much\n\nmore lethal than both the cardiotoxin and phospholipases A2, with\n\nan approximate 10-fold lower LD50 in mice (0.1 mg/g, [34]). It\nbelongs to a-neurotoxins with high intrinsic activity of inhibiting\nthe motor endplate nicotinic receptors vis-à-vis that of cardiotoxins\n\nand phospolipases A2, the target receptors of which are primarily\n\ndifferent and their actions are not crucial in mediating neuromus-\n\ncular paralysis - the central cobra envenoming feature that leads to\n\nrapid death [34]. This is consistent with clinical reports where\n\nrapid onset of neuromuscular paralysis (caused by neurotoxins) is\n\nthe most common fatal manifestation of systemic cobra enven-\n\nomation, where victims may succumb to respiratory failure and\n\ndeath ensues within minutes to hours [9,36,45]. The pharmaco-\n\nkinetic result in addition to the neuromuscular blockade activity of\n\nneurotoxin generally supports the hypothesis that the neurotoxin\n\nplays the principal role in systemic envenomation of N. sumatrana,\n\nand should be one of the most crucial toxins to be targeted by\n\nantivenom. Nevertheless, variations of neurotoxins across cobra\n\nspecies have been reported on their structures and activities, and\n\nthe phenomenon is likely the clue to varied efficacies of\n\ncommercially available antivenoms in the cross-neutralization of\n\ncobra venoms in the region [46]. The pharmacokinetic profiling\n\nmethod hence appears useful in validating the toxin’s role from the\n\npharmacokinetic aspect, and may be further utilized as a tool in\n\nassessing antivenom efficacy on the targeted toxin derived from\n\ndifferent cobras.\n\nPharmacokinetics of cardiotoxin following intravenous or\nintramuscular administrations of whole N. sumatrana\nvenom\n\nIn view of the negligible immunological cross-reactivity between\n\ncardiotoxin with phospholipase A2 and neurotoxin, it is possible to\n\naccurately determine the serum concentration of cardiotoxin\n\nfollowing intravenous or intramuscular administration of the\n\nwhole N. sumatrana venom using the same double-sandwich ELISA\n\ndeveloped. This study would help to shed light on whether the\n\npharmacokinetics of an individual toxin could be altered by other\n\nPharmacokinetics of Cobra Venom Toxins\n\nPLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | www.plosntds.org 10 June 2014 | Volume 8 | Issue 6 | e2890\n\n\n\nvenom constituents, and whether the information gathered from\n\nthe pharmacokinetic study of individual toxins can be applied in\n\nsituations where the whole venom was injected.\n\nThe serum concentration-time profile of cardiotoxin when whole\n\nvenom was injected was found to be similar to that when only\n\npurified cardiotoxin was injected (Figure 3C and 3D). It is however\n\nnoted that when whole venom was injected, cardiotoxin exhibited a\n\nlonger T1/2b and a lower CL than when only cardiotoxin was\n\ninjected. The results therefore suggest that the rate of elimination of\n\ncardiotoxin in the whole venom is likely affected by the presence of\n\nother venom components in the venom due to competition among\n\nvarious venom components for the elimination processes. The\n\nresults reflect that in N. sumatrana envenomation, pharmacokinetic\n\ncharacteristics of individual major toxins can be largely applied to\n\nsituations where the whole venom is injected, with the possible\n\nexception that the rate of elimination of the toxins determined may\n\nbe higher than that of the whole venom. On the other hand, the\n\nintramuscular bioavailability (Fi.m) of cardiotoxin injected with\n\nwhole venom (39.5%) was similarly low, if not even lower,\n\ncompared to the Fi.m. of cardiotoxin when only the toxin was\n\nadministered (45.6%), consistent with the indication that cardio-\n\ntoxin remained substantially unabsorbed at the injection tissue site.\n\nConclusions\nIn general, the elimination half-life of the whole venom is\n\ndetermined by the toxic components with the longest T1/2b\n\n(phospholipase A2 in the case of N. sumatrana venom), while its\n\nintramuscular bioavailability is influenced more by the toxic\n\ncomponents that is present most abundantly in the venom\n\n(cardiotoxin, in this case). In the present pharmacokinetic study\n\nof N. sumatrana venom and toxins, both the neurotoxin and\n\ncardiotoxin were rapidly absorbed intramuscularly in the rabbits,\n\nwith neurotoxin achieving the highest systemic bioavailability,\n\nwhile the cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2 possess relatively\n\nlower bioavailabilities. These pharmacokinetic findings therefore\n\nsuggest that the neurotoxin is the principal toxin in systemic\n\nenvenomation (fatal neuromuscular paralysis), while significant\n\namounts of the cardiotoxin and phospholipase A2 remain bound to\n\nthe injection site, causing local tissue destruction. Using toxin-\n\nspecific ELISA, the study also shows that the cobra venom\n\npharmacokinetics is likely an approximation of the pharmacoki-\n\nnetics of individual toxins except for parameters relating to\n\nelimination rate due to possible competition of various toxins for\n\nthe process in vivo.\n\nAuthor Contributions\n\nConceived and designed the experiments: NHT SMS SYF.
