The\n\ninfluence of abiotic and biotic factors, in addition to the\n\nmorphological and genetic characteristics of maize, enables the\n\nconversion from an endophyte to a pathogen [2,3]. This fungus\n\nalso has the potential to produce several mycotoxins, primarily\n\nfumonisins, which are known to cause equine leukoencephaloma-\n\nlacia, pulmonary edema in swine, and cancer in rodents [4]. The\n\nconsumption of fumonisin-contaminated grains is also associated\n\nwith human esophageal cancer and neural tube defects in some\n\nregions of the world [5,6].\n\nDue to economic losses regarding F. verticillioides (Fv) contam-\n\nination and the risks of fumonisin ingestion, many efforts have\n\nbeen made to control this fungus [7]. Resistant crop varieties,\n\nbiological methods, and principally fungicides have been em-\n\nployed to manage Fv contamination; nevertheless, Fusarium strains\n\nexhibit a remarkable capacity to adapt and to become resistant to\n\nthese strategies [8].\n\nPesticides have increased crop resistance for over four decades;\n\nnonetheless, the emerging, re-emerging, and endemic plant\n\npathogens are still challenging crop safety worldwide [9,10].\n\nMoreover, chemicals may leave residues in grains, fruits,\n\nvegetables, and soil that may be harmful to the ecosystems and\n\nhuman health. The development of environmentally friendly crop-\n\nmanagement practices for combating diseases represents a difficult\n\ntask. The use of bacterial antagonists such as Bacillus [11–14],\n\nPseudomonas, and Streptomyces [15,16] as biocontrol agents (BCAs) is\n\nconsidered one of the most rational practices as part of an\n\nintegrated management program to reduce pesticides in the\n\nenvironment [14,17].\n\nBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a ubiquitous gram-positive spore-\n\nforming bacterium that produces parasporal crystals containing\n\ninsecticidal proteins called crystal (Cry) or cytolytic (Cyt) toxins.\n\nThis bacterium is found in a wide variety of habitats such as soils,\n\ndead and living insects, the plant phylloplane, and as an\n\nendophyte. The high abundance of Bt strains is attributed to its\n\nlong-lasting spore viability [18,19], ability to assimilate nutrients\n\nfrom diverse macromolecules [20], and its quorum sensing-\n\nregulated existence that can lead the bacterium from a virulent\n\nto a necrotrophic state [21]. Bt strains are classified according to\n\nthe serological response differences in their flagellar antigens, and\n\nthere are at least 71 serotypes and 84 subspecies [22,23]. B.\n\nthuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk), which produces lepidopteran-\n\ninsecticidal Cry 1A proteins, including Cry 1Ab, is the most\n\ncommonly employed strain used as a bioinsecticide against\n\nlepidopteran pest larvae [24].\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189\n\n˜Sao\n \n\n˜ Sao\n \n\n˜\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092189&domain=pdf\n\n\nAlthough many studies have focused on the activity of B.\n\nthuringiensis insecticidal proteins, the bacterium may also act as a\n\npotential BCA against a variety of plant pathogens due to its\n\nproduction of antimicrobial molecules, including zwittermicin A,\n\nchitinases, chitin-binding proteins, and quorum sensing-quenching\n\nenzymes [14,20,25,26]. Together with chitinases, chitin-binding\n\nprotein facilitates microbial attachment to fungal cell walls, which\n\ndisrupts the cell polarity and leads to inhibition of cell growth.\n\nPrevious studies have also demonstrated that Bt spore germination\n\nand vegetative cell growth were associated with the development\n\nof fungal hyphae in the soil. Furthermore, vegetative cells have\n\nbeen observed growing with the fungal mycelia, likely due to the\n\nability of Bacillus species to cause the death of the fungus and thus\n\nsurvive the hyphal lysis products [27].\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the in vitro interaction\n\nof F. verticillioides and B. thuringiensis serovar kurstaki based on a\n\nmulti-method approach. To our knowledge, this is the first report\n\nof the use of flow cytometry to quantify living and necrotic fungal\n\ncells and the Cry 1Ab toxin during the time-course of interaction\n\nbetween Btk and Fv.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nBacterial and fungal strains and their growth conditions\nF. verticillioides MRC 826 [Programme on Mycotoxins and\n\nExperimental Carcinogenesis (PROMEC), Tygerberg, Republic of\n\nSouth Africa] was obtained from a culture growing on Spezieller\n\nNährstoffarmer agar by monosporic isolation and was used in all\n\nexperiments. This isolate is capable of producing high levels of\n\nfumonisins [28]. The fungal strain was inoculated onto V8 agar in\n\nPetri dishes and incubated under continuous fluorescent white\n\nlight for 7 days at 25uC in a BOD incubator (Thermo Scientific,\nWilmington, DE), after which the colony surface was gently\n\nscraped off and transferred to a tube containing 50 mL of sterile\n\ndistilled water. The spores were counted with a hemocytometer,\n\nand the concentration was adjusted to 16106 spores/mL [29].\nBacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257,\n\nwhich produces the Cry 1A toxin group, was provided by Dr.\n\nLeon Rabinovitch from the Culture Collection of Bacillus and\n\nRelated Genera (CCGB; Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro,\n\nBrazil). This Btk strain was isolated from moist soil from the\n\nMorretes Village, Paranaguá, Paraná State, Brazil prior to 1995. It\n\nwas identified and characterized by Dr. Leon Rabinovitch and Dr.\n\nTania V. Guaycurus at the Bacterial Physiology Laboratory in the\n\nOswaldo Cruz Institute in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute,\n\nParis, France. The LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain exhibits\n\nproteolytic and amylolytic properties, is mesophilic, and produces\n\na bi-pyramidal crystal. The serovar kurstaki (H3a, 3b, 3c), which\n\nproduces flagellar antigens of serotype ‘‘H3’’, was characterized by\n\nthe Pasteur Institute.\n\nThe cultures were stored lyophilized; bacterial spores and\n\ncrystal biomass were obtained by inoculating Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ\n\n(CCGB) 257 into Erlenmeyer flasks containing 250 mL of\n\nNutrient Broth (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, Mich.) and incubat-\n\ning at 30uC on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) for 72 h. The cultures\nwere centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 30 min at 4uC, and the cell\npellets were stored at 220uC [30] until use. The protein\nconcentration was determined with Bradford reagent (Sigma-\n\nAldrich Corporation, St. Louis, MO), and measurements were\n\nmade with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo\n\nScientific, Wilmington, DE), using bovine serum albumin (BSA)\n\nas the standard [31]. A working solution of the Btk spore and\n\ncrystal biomass was made by diluting to 10 mg/mL, which was the\n\nminimum inhibitory concentration for Fv growth under our\n\nlaboratory conditions (data not shown).\n\nAbout 50 mL of Btk biomass (10 mg/mL) was centrally\ninoculated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) using a micropipette.\n\nAfter inoculum adsorption, 50 mL of Fv (16106 spores/mL) was\ncentrally inoculated onto each PDA Petri plate. PDA medium was\n\nchosen since it can provide for Fusarium species’ growth, in\n\naddition to bacterial growth. The microscopy, immunofluores-\n\ncence, and cytometry experiments were conducted with five\n\nreplicates after 3, 5, and 7 days of incubation under continuous\n\nwhite-light illumination at 25uC. The radius measurements of the\npure and mixed (Fv+Btk) cultures were recorded for 20 days for five\nreplicates each, after which the presence of the fumonisins B1 and\n\nB2 was determined.\n\nFlow cytometry analysis for the quantification of fungal\ncells\n\nFive replicates were analyzed after 3, 5, and 7 days of\n\nincubation. The cultures were removed from the agar by scraping,\n\ntransferred into a 50-mL tube containing sterile distilled water and\n\nTween 80 (2 drops/100 mL water), and centrifuged at 7000 rpm\n\nfor 20 min. The cells were rinsed with the Tween 80/water\n\nsolution twice and resuspended in 20 mL phosphate buffered\n\nsaline (PBS), after which a 4 mL aliquot was filtered through a 70-\n\nmm mesh-sized cell strainer [Becton Dickinson and Company\n(BD), San Jose, CA] to obtain a uniform cell suspension. The cell\n\nsolution was stained with 10 mL of 1 mg/mL Calcofluor White\n(CFW; Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) at a final concentration\n\nof 0.05 mg/mL CFW and stained with 5 mL of 7-aminoactino-\nmycin (7-AAD), utilizing the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection\n\nKit (BD, San Jose, CA) per the manufacturer instructions. The\n\ncells were incubated with CFW and 7-AAD in the dark for 15 min\n\nand stored on ice until the analysis.\n\nThe living and necrotic fungal cells were quantified by flow\n\ncytometry performed using a FACS Canto II system (BD, San\n\nJose, CA) equipped for CFW (lex, 365 nm; lem, 430 nm), using\nviolet laser excitation (405 nm) with detection in the Pacific Blue\n\nchannel (405–450/50 nm), and 7-AAD (lex, 546 nm; lem,\n647 nm), using blue laser excitation (488 nm) with detection in\n\nthe PerCP (peridinin chlorophyll A protein) channel (650 nm). A\n\nminimum of 30,000 events per sample were acquired; the data\n\nwere collected using a linear representation for the side scatter\n\n(SSC) and forward scatter (FSC) and a logarithmic representation\n\nfor the fluorescent signals. The analyses were performed using\n\nFlowJo software (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). The necrotic\n\nfungal cell population was gated to separate it from the dead\n\nbacterial cell population. For verifying Fv autofluorescence and\n\ncross reaction between the Btk and CFW, bacterial cells stained\n\nwith CFW and fungal cells not labeled with the fluorochrome were\n\nused as negative controls. For the 7-AAD negative controls, pure\n\ncultures of living bacterial and fungal cells were stained with 7-\n\nAAD. The negative controls were utilized to determine the\n\nbackground of each fluorescent marker. For the 7-AAD positive\n\ncontrols, the bacterial and fungal cells were incubated at 100uC for\n30 min in a water bath [32,33].\n\nTransmission electron microscopy (TEM)\nAfter the incubation periods on PDA, 1-cm\n\n2\nportions of agar\n\ncontaining interaction regions of both microorganisms and\n\nsamples from pure fungal and bacterial cultures were fixed with\n\n2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for\n\n2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4uC. The samples\nwere rinsed with cacodylate buffer and fixed in 1% (w/v) osmium\n\nInteraction between Fusarium and Bacillus\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189\n\n\n\ntetroxide before dehydration in a graded series of ethanol\n\nconcentrations and embedment in Epon 812 resin. Ultrathin\n\nsections were collected on 200-mesh nickel grids coated with\n\nFormvar and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. The\n\ngrids were examined with a JEOL 1010 transmission electron\n\nmicroscope (JEOL, Tokyo). For each replicate, three ultrathin\n\nsections were examined [11].\n\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM)\nThe pure cultures and treatments were placed in a 40%\n\nglutaraldehyde solution for 24 h, dried at 42uC for at least 48 h,\nand fixed to appropriate aluminum bases. The material was then\n\nsputtered with gold and examined with a Leo-440i-SEM scanning\n\nelectron microscope (Leo electron microscopy, Cambridge, UK)\n\n[29].\n\nIndirect immunofluorescence assay\nPure and treated cultures of Fv and Btk were analyzed during\n\nthe incubation period. The cells were removed by scraping,\n\nwashed 3 times with PBS, and incubated for 30 min in PBS/BSA\n\n(1%) at room temperature before adding rabbit polyclonal\n\nantibody against Bt Cry 1Ab toxin (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge,\n\nMA); the incubation was for 30 min in the dark under gentle\n\nrotation (60 rpm). The cells were washed three times with PBS/\n\nBSA and incubated with a goat polyclonal secondary antibody to\n\nrabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (1:1000; Abcam, Cam-\n\nbridge, MA) under the same conditions. The cells were washed\n\nthree times with PBS/BSA and 10 mL of CFW (1 mg/mL) was\nadded. The cells were resuspended in 40 mL of a solution\ncomposed of glycerol (500 mL), PBS (400 mL) and n-propyl gallate\n(0.022 g) (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Slides were pre-\n\npared and analyzed with an EVOS FL Cell Imaging System\n\n(Advanced Microscopy Group, Life Technologies, Foster City,\n\nCA) using the DAPI (diamidino-2-phenylindole) channel for CFW\n\nand the GFP (green fluorescence protein) channel for Alexa Fluor\n\n488 (lex, 495 nm; lem, 519 nm). The background of each\nfluorescent marker was determined with negative controls of the\n\nBtk, Fv, and Btk+Fv treatments incubated with the secondary\nantibody, but not with the primary antibody. For the CFW\n\ncontrols, the bacterial cells were stained with the fluorochrome,\n\nwhile the fungal cells were not [34,35].\n\nFlow cytometry for quantification of the Cry 1Ab toxins\nThe cells were treated as described above, but omitting the\n\nCFW staining. Quantification of the Cry 1Ab toxin was performed\n\nwith the FACS Canto II (BD, San Jose, CA) equipped for Alexa\n\nFluor 488 (lex, 495 nm; lem, 519 nm) using blue laser excitation\n(488 nm) with detection in the FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate)\n\nchannel (530/30 nm). The collection and analysis were as\n\npreviously described for the flow cytometry analysis of the fungal\n\ncells. For negative controls, the cells from all treatments were\n\nincubated only with the secondary antibody [33].\n\nFumonisin analysis\nFv (16106 spores/mL) and Fv plus Btk biomass (10 mg/mL) were\n\ninoculated onto PDA (five replicates/treatment) and incubated at\n\n25uC for 20 days [12]. Fumonisins were extracted from the PDA\nculture with 100 mL of methanol and water (3:1, v/v) followed by\n\nshaking for 45 min. The samples were filtered through Whatman\n\ngrade 4 (12 cm) filter paper and the pH was corrected to pH 5.8–\n\n6.5 with 1 N NaOH, if necessary. The fumonisins were purified by\n\ntransferring 10 mL of the filtrate to a minicolumn containing\n\n500 mg of ion-exchange silica (BondElut SAX-Varian, Palo Alto,\n\nCA, USA) previously conditioned with 5 mL methanol and 5 mL\n\nmethanol/water (3:1, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The\n\nfumonisins were eluted with 15 mL methanol/acetic acid (99:1, v/\n\nv), maintaining the same flow rate. The product was evaporated\n\nand the residue was separated by high performance liquid\n\nchromatography (HPLC) and resuspended in 1 mL acetonitrile/\n\nwater (50:50, v/v). A 50-mL aliquot of the sample extract was\ndiluted with 50 mL OPA reagent (40 mg ortho-phthalaldehyde\ndissolved in 1 mL methanol, diluted with 5 mL 0.1 M sodium\n\ntetraborate solution, and supplemented with 50 mL b-mercapto-\nethanol) and shaken for 30 seconds. Two minutes after the\n\naddition of the OPA reagent, the solution was injected into a\n\nShimadzu LC-10AD liquid chromatograph equipped with a\n\n20 mL fixed loop injector (Rheodyne, Rhonert Park, CA)\n[36,37]. After separation on a C-18 reverse phase column\n\n(Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, 5 ODS-20, 15064.6 mm), the\nfumonisins were detected with an RF-10AXL fluorescence\n\ndetector (lex, 335 nm; lem, 335 nm). An acetonitrile/water/acetic\nacid (96:104:1, v/v/v) solution was used for the mobile phase.\n\nChromatography was conducted with column temperature of\n\n30uC, maintained in an oven, and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min,at\nroom temperature (22–23uC). The retention times of the FB1 and\nFB2 under these conditions were 9 and 20 min, respectively.\n\nCalibration curves were utilized for quantifying the fumonisin with\n\ncorrelation coefficients of 0.9927 (FB1) and 0.9950 (FB2). The\n\nquantification limit was 0.015 mg/g for FB1 and FB2, and the\nmean recoveries from five replicates for each were 92.38% (SD,\n\n13.68%) and 85.39% (SD, 6.87%) for FB1, and FB2, respectively.\n\nStatistical analyses\nStatistical comparisons were performed using ANOVA and\n\nTukey tests, as the data were normally distributed. The differences\n\nwere considered significant when p-values were ,0.05. The\n\nstatistical tests were conducted using Assistat software [38].\n\nResults\n\nAccuracy of flow cytometry analysis for quantification of\nliving and dead Fv cells and Btk Cry 1Ab toxin during the\ntime course of interaction\n\nTo determine whether Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 could\n\nbe a potential BCA against Fv, flow cytometry tests were used to\n\nidentify either apoptotic or living fungal cells. During the culture\n\ngrowth for the analyses, it was observed that Fv increased its\n\nbiomass faster than did Btk on PDA medium, as demonstrated by\n\nthe average of three radius measurements of the colonies alone\n\nversus those of interactions between Fv and Btk (five replicates)\n\nduring the period of analysis (Figure 1). The use of CFW and 7-\n\nAAD fluorochromes was based on the ability of CFW to bind to\n\nthe cell wall chitin of both the living and dead fungus. The 7-AAD\n\npermeates the membrane of late-apoptotic and dead cells, and\n\nbinds to the DNA. Thus, it was possible to verify if the interaction\n\nled to fungal death or growth inhibition. Furthermore, through a\n\ngating strategy, it was possible to distinguish between the bacterial\n\nand fungal populations undergoing apoptosis (Figure 2).\n\nPositive and negative controls were used to validate the flow\n\ncytometry conditions and to analyze the Fv and Btk interaction.\n\nThis technique allowed for the quantification of live and dead\n\nfungal cells and the Cry 1Ab bacterial toxin in terms of\n\npercentages (Figure 2). Btk cells were stained with CFW with\n\nnegligible background detected (Figure 2a.1). Fv cells were also\n\nstained with CFW, and almost 100% of the cells were counted\n\n(Figure 2a.3). Quadrants were defined based on positive and\n\nnegative fungal populations and a negative bacterial population for\n\nInteraction between Fusarium and Bacillus\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e92189\n\n\n\nCFW (Figure 2A). For the 7-AAD, living bacterial, fungal, and\n\nbacterial plus fungal cells were used as negative controls\n\n(Figure 2b.1 and b.2). Quadrants were established after analyzing\n\nboth microorganisms and their interaction. Dead Fv and Btk cells\n\nwere observed as distinct populations since it was possible to select\n\nthe Fv population by gating (Figure 2b.3 and b.4). Not all of the\n\nbacterial cells were in an apoptotic stage after 30 min at 100uC,\nwhich can be explained by the presence of spores and crystals that\n\nare resistant to high temperatures and therefore not labeled by the\n\n7-AAD (Figure 2b.3 and b.4).\n\nCry 1Ab was treated with an antitoxin antibody and stained\n\nwith Alexa Fluor 488 in order to determine the crystal production,\n\nand consequently, the bacterial spore production during the\n\nanalysis period. The quadrants were delimited based on the dot\n\nplot graphic of the negative control for the Cry 1 Ab toxin\n\n(Figure 3A).\n\nIn vitro suppressive effect of Btk against Fv\nThe Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain was found to show\n\nsignificant antagonistic activity against Fv from the second to the\n\ntwentieth day, based on the radius measurements of the five\n\nreplicates (Figure 1). After 3, 5, and 7 days of interaction, the\n\ncolonies were viewed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)\n\nand scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in addition to the\n\nindirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses. After 3\n\ndays of incubation, no marked changes were observed by TEM or\n\nSEM in the Fusarium cells (data not shown). On the fifth and\n\nseventh days, the Fusarium cells appeared damaged, as evidenced\n\nby cell-wall irregularities and by disorganization of the cytoplasm.\n\nIn contrast, the Fv pure cultures showed intact hyphae and\n\nabundant microconidia formation when the colonies were\n\nanalyzed by TEM (Figure 4A). In the SEM analysis, strong fungal\n\ncell wall thickening was seen in response to the interaction after 5\n\nand 7 days of incubation; sparse fungal growth and numerous Btk\n\ncells and spores were also discernible. As a result of the interaction,\n\nhigh numbers of Btk spores and cells were visualized between the\n\nhyphae and microconidia; the Btk pure culture produced\n\nvegetative cells in profusion (Figure 4B).\n\nFlow cytometry dot plot graphs demonstrated a significant\n\nreduction of the fungal cells from the third (10.93%) to the fifth\n\nday (4.19%; p,0.05), although the percentage of cells remained\n\nvirtually the same from the fifth to the seventh day (3.48%).\n\nInterestingly, fungal cell death was observed on the seventh day of\n\nincubation (5.23%), in agreement with the TEM and SEM\n\nobservations (Figure 2C). The fungal cultures alone showed\n\nirrelevant changes in the percentage of cells for the three periods\n\nanalyzed.\n\nThe immunofluorescence assay using CFW to stain the fungal\n\ncell walls allowed for the identification of many sectors of hyphal\n\nthickening on the fifth day, a characteristic that was remarkably\n\nnoted on the seventh day (Figure 5B). On the third day, a few\n\ncrystals were observed and the fungal cells were basically intact\n\n(data not shown), but by the fifth and seventh days, crystals\n\ncontaining Cry 1Ab toxin were mostly free and in abundance\n\nthroughout the cultures (Figure 5B).\n\nBy the end of the experiment, the treated cultures were\n\nprimarily colonized by the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257\n\nstrain, demonstrating its relevance as a BCA. The morphological\n\nalterations observed by TEM, SEM, and the immunofluorescence\n\nassays subsequently confirmed the flow cytometry results. No such\n\nchanges were noted in the control cultures.\n\nEffects of Btk Cry 1Ab production\nThe production of the Cry 1Ab toxin by the Btk LFB-\n\nFIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 strain was analyzed after 3, 5, and 7\n\ndays of incubation by utilizing specific antibodies followed by\n\nFigure 1.

In the control group, the average production of FB1 and\n\nFB2 was 18.97 mg/g [relative standard deviation (RSD), 2.2%]\nand 0.86 mg/g (RSD, 1.2%), respectively. In the treated group, the\naverage production of FB1 was 13.81 mg/g (RSD, 5.9%), while\nFB2 was not detected in any replicate. The five replicates of the\n\ncontrol and treated groups were significantly different from one\n\nanother (p,0.05).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize the interaction\n\nbetween Fv and Btk based on the combined use of microscopy,\n\nflow cytometry, and HPLC techniques. We also presented a\n\npractical and effective approach to identify these interactions using\n\nflow cytometry, which could be extended to other plant pathogens\n\nand antagonistic bacteria, thereby contributing to the ability to\n\ndetermine the potential of microorganisms as possible BCAs.\n\nFlow cytometry has emerged as a high-resolution technology\n\nthat supports the characterization of individual cell types within\n\nmixed populations. Cellular patterns can be identified by assessing\n\nthe protein expression using fluorescent probes and antibodies\n\ncoupled with fluorochromes [39]. This method provides an\n\nanalysis of a large number of cells and can identify changes\n\nwithin a population and between different populations [33].\n\nConsequently, it was possible to characterize Fv in terms of living\n\nand dead cell percentages and identify the Cry 1Ab protein\n\nproduced by Btk during the experimental period.\n\nInteraction studies of two or more microorganisms are\n\nchallenging because the populations are always changing over\n\ntime. In general, fungal and bacterial cells can grow and divide,\n\nFigure 2. Flow cytometry analysis for Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk) interacting with Fusarium verticillioides (Fv).

B. thuringiensis forms a\n\nparasporal crystal during the stationary phase of its growth cycle;\n\nnevertheless, the co-culture can change the kinetics of both\n\nmicroorganisms, imposing the need to mark each population to\n\nmonitor their outcome during the interaction.\n\nThe fungal cells were labeled with the fluorochrome CFW that\n\nbinds to chitin, a cell-wall polysaccharide that maintains the fungal\n\ncell integrity and confers structural rigidity during growth and\n\nmorphogenesis [40]. The concentration of CFW was determined\n\nbased on the background fluorescence, as high concentration\n\nlevels could be misinterpreted as a positive signal. The optimal\n\nconcentration was 0.05 mg/mL in 400 mL of the cell solution. We\nalso evaluated the fungal cell autofluorescence by fluorescence\n\nmicroscopy and flow cytometry. The fungal cells showed negligible\n\nautofluorescence emission, and therefore, no data normalization\n\nwas required. Thus, the variation of CFW during the incubation\n\nperiod was interpreted as an increase or decrease of the number of\n\nFv cells. Because CFW has the ability to stain both living and dead\n\ncells, the use of the 7-AAD fluorochrome was crucial to\n\ndetermining whether the fungal cells were alive or in an apoptotic\n\nstage [39], as the 7-AAD binds only to late apoptotic and necrotic\n\ncell DNA. The flow cytometry analysis was not conducted with\n\nboth markers in the same solution, however, as the CFW could be\n\npartially detected in the PerCP channel, which would lead to an\n\noverestimation of the 7-AAD positive reactions.\n\nThe Btk cells were treated with rabbit polyclonal antibody to the\n\nBt Cry 1Ab toxin, and a goat polyclonal secondary antibody to\n\nrabbit IgG coupled to Alexa Fluor 488, to quantify the Cry 1Ab\n\ntoxin and determine the bacterial sporulation during the analysis\n\nperiod. Due to the parasporal characteristic of the crystals, which\n\nare produced during the stationary phase of Bt growth [41], it is\n\npossible to make an analogy between the crystal and spore\n\nproduction. The flow cytometry analysis allowed for the charac-\n\nterization of the Cry 1Ab toxin in the Btk and Btk+Fv groups. For\nboth groups, background fluorescence was absent when control\n\ncells were treated only with the secondary antibody. This\n\nFigure 3.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of flow\n\ncytometry use for characterizing Cry 1Ab production.\n\nA strong in vitro antagonistic effect of the Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ\n\n(CCGB) 257 strain on Fv MRC 826 was shown. Previous studies\n\nhave reported Bacillus spp. as potential biological controls of plant\n\npathogenic fungi such as F. oxysporum, F. sambucinum, and F.\n\ngraminearum [14,42–44]. In addition, other studies have shown that\n\nthe activity of Bacillus spp. reduced Fv colonization and the\n\naccumulation of fumonisin in corn [12,13,45,46].\n\nThe microscopic examination by SEM and TEM revealed no\n\nmarked changes on the third day of incubation; however, the\n\nantagonistic effect was evident on the fifth and seventh days,\n\nshowing fungal cell wall and cytoplasm damage in comparison to\n\nthe control Fv culture. Sectors of intumescent hyphae were\n\nobserved in response to the bacterial effects, with a paucity of\n\nfungal growth and numerous Bt cells seen in the SEM and indirect\n\nimmunofluorescence assays. In fact, swollen hyphae can be\n\nassociated with a decrease in fungal growth and higher levels of\n\nnon-viable cells due to hyphal transformations and death resulting\n\nfrom Fusarium growth kinetics [47]. Another hypothesis is the\n\nchitin apposition in the fungal cell wall, due to the stress caused by\n\nthe effect of antagonistic bacteria. The extensive accumulation of\n\nchitin is part of an intricate defense strategy by fungi for\n\nrestraining the penetration of pathogens and fungitoxic molecules\n\n[48,49]. Nonetheless, it has been reported that Bacillus spp. are\n\nable to overcome such barriers and cause severe fungal cell injuries\n\n[11]. The cell wall and cytoplasm damage visualized by TEM and\n\nthe profile of dead fungal cells observed by flow cytometry after\n\nincubating Fv MRC 826 and Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257\n\ntogether for 7 days demonstrated that Bt strains can be very\n\naggressive towards fungi and are able to circumvent this fungal\n\ndefense strategy.\n\nFungal endophytes such as Fusarium can reside in the internal\n\ntissues of living plants without causing any immediate or negative\n\neffect, but may turn pathogenic during host senescence. The\n\ninteractions between host plants and endophytes in natural\n\npopulations are poorly understood; however, they can actively\n\ncompete against other microorganisms for niche or infection sites\n\n[50]. Fv is an endophyte and one of the most commonly reported\n\nsoil-borne fungal pathogens infecting maize worldwide [12,51]. In\n\ngeneral, soil-borne pathogens that infect through mycelial contact\n\nare more susceptible to competition from other soil microorgan-\n\nisms associated with plants than from pathogens that germinate\n\ndirectly on the plant surface [14,50]. Our in vitro results\n\ncorroborate this theory, as Fv MRC 826 growth was restricted\n\nby Btk LFB-FIOCRUZ (CCGB) 257 for over 20 days. A reduction\n\nin the cell numbers in the treated cultures was also observed on the\n\nthird (10.93%), fifth (4.19%), and seventh (3.48%) days through\n\nthe flow cytometry analysis.\n\nFigure 4. Microscopic observations of Fusarium verticillioides (Fv) in contact with Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. kurstaki (Btk). Fv and Btk\nwere co-cultured on potato dextrose agar and microscopically examined after 5 (5D) and 7 (7D) days of growth. Figure 4(A).

A number of antifungal compounds,\n\nincluding polypeptides that interact with the fungal membrane,\n\nare produced by Bacillus species [52]. Bt can secrete chitinases and\n\nchitin-binding proteins; together these proteins control fungi by\n\nbinding to cell wall chitin and disrupting the cell polarity, leading\n\nto fungal growth inhibition, and thus conferring an advantage as a\n\ncompetitor in its niche. Degraded chitin can also serve as a\n\nnutrient and further contribute to Bt growth and proliferation\n\n[20,53,54]. Interestingly, it has been shown that a chitin-binding\n\nprotein is expressed in spore mother cells that interact with Cry\n\n1Ac, potentiating the toxin activity [20].\n\nOur results showed increased levels of the Cry 1Ab toxin when\n\nBtk was interacting with Fv. The accumulation of Cry 1ab was\n\nenhanced during the interaction, particularly after 7 days of\n\nincubation. This response probably occurred as a consequence of\n\nthe stressful conditions during the Fv and Btk co-cultivation, which\n\nmay promote more aggressiveness in this Btk isolate. Given that Bt\n\ncrystals are produced concurrently with the spores, there was also\n\nan increase in spore production during the experimental period.\n\nDespite the controversial hypotheses about Bt spore longevity,\n\nsome reports have demonstrated the environmental persistence of\n\nBt spores, which confer resistance and a competitive advantage\n\nagainst other microorganisms [19,27].\n\nDuring the Fv and Btk interactions, less accumulation of\n\nfumonisin was observed. Reduced FB1 levels have been reported\n\npreviously, when Fv was treated with Bacillus spp. in maize [12,13].\n\nIn fact, reduced fumonisin levels were reported when the fungal\n\nbiomass was decreased [13,55,56]. Mycotoxin production has\n\nbeen viewed as an adaptation of the fungus to stressful\n\nenvironmental conditions and as providing an advantage in\n\ncompetition with other microorganisms in its natural habitat [57].\n\nSome stressful conditions such as oxidative stress and nitrogen\n\nstarvation may enhance fumonisin production. However, the\n\nbenefit to the fungus from producing higher levels of fumonisin\n\nremains unclear [58,59].\n\nFigure 5.
