It faces the\nblastocoel cavity and later gives rise to the extraembryonic parietal and visceral endoderm. Here, we investigate a key step\nin primitive endoderm development, the acquisition of apico-basolateral polarity and epithelial characteristics by the non-\nepithelial inner cell mass cells. Embryoid bodies, formed from mouse embryonic stem cells, were used as a model to study\nthis transition. The outer cells of these embryoid bodies were found to gradually acquire the hallmarks of polarised\nepithelial cells and express markers of primitive endoderm cell fate. Fgf receptor/Erk signalling is known to be required for\nspecification of the primitive endoderm, but its role in polarisation of this tissue is less well understood. To investigate the\nfunction of this pathway in the primitive endoderm, embryoid bodies were cultured in the presence of a small molecule\ninhibitor of Mek. This inhibitor caused a loss of expression of markers of primitive endoderm cell fate and maintenance of\nthe pluripotency marker Nanog. In addition, a mislocalisation of apico-basolateral markers and disruption of the epithelial\nbarrier, which normally blocks free diffusion across the epithelial cell layer, occurred. Two inhibitors of the Fgf receptor\nelicited similar phenotypes, suggesting that Fgf receptor signalling promotes Erk-mediated polarisation. This data shows\nthat primitive endoderm cells of the outer layer of embryoid bodies gradually polarise, and formation of a polarised\nprimitive endoderm layer requires the Fgf receptor/Erk signalling pathway.\n\nCitation: Doughton G, Wei J, Tapon N, Welham MJ, Chalmers AD (2014) Formation of a Polarised Primitive Endoderm Layer in Embryoid Bodies Requires Fgfr/Erk\nSignalling.

The primitive\n\nendoderm forms an epithelium which localises between the\n\nblastocoel cavity and the epiblast, these three components are\n\nsurrounded by a second epithelium, the trophectoderm. Two\n\nsubpopulations are formed from the primitive endoderm, the\n\nparietal and visceral endoderm give rise to the yolk sac, whilst the\n\nvisceral endoderm also contributes to the gut endoderm and\n\nprovides embryonic patterning signals [2]. In contrast, cells of the\n\nepiblast give rise to the embryo proper. Recently, there has been a\n\nrapid increase in our understanding of how the primitive\n\nendoderm versus epiblast cell fate decision is regulated (Reviewed\n\nin [2,3]). These studies have used mouse embryos, as well as\n\nembryoid bodies which can be formed from mouse embryonic\n\nstem (mES) cells. The outer cell layer of embryoid bodies is an\n\nepithelium with many similarities to the embryonic primitive\n\nendoderm, and has therefore been used as a model of its\n\ndevelopment [4,5].\n\nCell fate decisions in the ICM cells are a dynamic process: cells\n\ninitially express both epiblast (e.g. Nanog) and primitive endoderm\n\nmarkers (e.g. Gata6 and Gata4), the expression then resolves into a\n\nsalt-and-pepper pattern within the ICM, where cells express either\n\nepiblast or primitive endoderm markers [6–8]. The cells of the\n\nprimitive endoderm then migrate to their final position facing the\n\nblastocoel cavity where they form an epithelial sheet.\n\nFgf receptor (Fgfr) signalling via the Raf/Mek/Erk signalling\n\n(Erk signalling) pathway has an important role in promoting\n\nprimitive endoderm formation (Reviewed in [9]). For instance\n\nGrb2, an adaptor protein that links receptor tyrosine kinases to the\n\nErk cascade, is essential for primitive endoderm development [10].\n\nInterestingly, activated H-Ras expression in Grb2-deficient mES\n\ncells promotes endoderm differentiation in embryoid bodies,\n\nsuggesting Grb2 functions through activation of Ras in this\n\ncontext [10]. A more detailed analysis of the Grb2\n2/2\n\nmouse\n\nphenotype demonstrated that Gata6 expression is lost and all ICM\n\ncells are Nanog positive [6]. In addition, when embryoid bodies\n\nare formed from mES cells transfected with a constitutively active\n\nMek mutant, Nanog expression is repressed, and primitive\n\nendoderm differentiation occurs [11]. This suggests that the Erk\n\nsignalling pathway mediates Nanog repression, which is known to\n\nbe required for differentiation of ICM cells into primitive\n\nendoderm. These results led to the hypothesis that the mosaic\n\nexpression of epiblast and primitive endoderm markers is\n\ndependent upon a Grb2-Ras-Mek/Erk signalling cascade.

Treatment of embryos with a\n\ncombination of inhibitors for both the Fgfr and Mek causes\n\nICM cells to express Nanog whilst repressing primitive endoderm\n\nmarkers Gata6 & 4 [16,17]. Conversely, treatment of embryos\n\nwith Fgf4 and heparin causes all cells of the ICM to become Gata6\n\npositive [17,18]. In Fgf4\n2/2\n\nembryos Gata6 and Nanog colocalise\n\nuntil the 32-cell stage, but by the 64-cell stage only a small number\n\nof weakly Gata6 positive cells could be detected, whilst Gata4 was\n\nnever detected. This mutant could not be rescued by addition of\n\nexogenous Fgf at a uniform concentration suggesting in vivo it is\n\nregional differences in Fgf concentration which produce the salt-\n\nand-pepper pattern [19]. Together, these studies provide convinc-\n\ning evidence that Fgf4/Fgfr activation of Erk signalling is essential\n\nfor primitive endoderm specification.\n\nIn contrast to our growing understanding of cell fate specifica-\n\ntion less is known about the mechanisms which regulate\n\npolarisation of primitive endoderm cells. A number of studies\n\nhave shown a polarised localisation of proteins within the epithelial\n\ncells of the primitive endoderm. E-cadherin is localised to their\n\nbasolateral membrane [20], and Lrp2 localises to the apical\n\nsurface of the primitive endoderm in E4.5 mouse embryos [21].\n\nThe adaptor protein Disabled-2 (Dab2) also localises apically and\n\nis required for the establishment of epithelial polarity [22,23] and\n\nLaminin, a constituent of the basement membrane is required for\n\nproper epithelial organisation of the primitive endoderm [24].\n\nIn the trophectoderm epithelial polarisation has been tightly\n\nlinked to the regulation of cell fate [25] and a role for polarity in\n\nthe control of the primitive endoderm cell fate has also been\n\nsuggested. One aspect to this is that epithelial polarity in the\n\nprimitive endoderm cells appears to anchor the sorted cells to their\n\nfinal localisation on the outer surface of the epiblast [20,22,23]. If\n\naPkc, a key regulator of cell polarity, is inhibited the primitive\n\nendoderm cells do not become anchored [26]. No effect was\n\nobserved on early primitive endoderm markers (e.g. Pdgfra), but\n\nlater there was a reduction in Gata4 positive cells. This suggests\n\nthat in addition to being essential for sorting, aPkc is also required\n\nfor maturation of the primitive endoderm cell fate [26]. Despite its\n\nwell established role in promoting primitive endoderm fate, it is\n\nnot clear if the Erk signalling pathway is required for formation of\n\na polarised primitive endoderm.\n\nHere, we use embryoid bodies as a model to investigate the\n\nmechanisms which promote polarisation of the primitive endo-\n\nderm, and determine whether the Fgfr/Erk signalling pathway is\n\nrequired for polarisation of this tissue. We show that embryoid\n\nbodies gradually expressed markers of primitive endoderm cell fate\n\nand down regulate Nanog. Polarity complex, tight junction,\n\nadherens junction, and basement membrane proteins also\n\ndeveloped a polarised localisation in the primitive endoderm\n\nlayer. Treatment with small molecule inhibitors of Mek or the Fgfr\n\ncaused the outer cells of the embryoid body to fail to upregulate\n\nprimitive endoderm markers and no longer downregulate Nanog\n\nexpression. Mislocalisation of the proteins which normally show\n\napico-basolateral polarisation in the primitive endoderm cells also\n\noccurred. Additionally, disruption of the epithelial barrier, which\n\nnormally blocks free diffusion across the epithelium of the\n\nprimitive endoderm, was observed. These results show that Fgfr\n\ndriven Erk signalling is required for the formation in embryoid\n\nbodies of a primitive endoderm layer which exhibits apico-\n\nbasolateral polarity and epithelial barrier function.\n\nMethods\n\nCulture of mESCs\nThe E14tg2A mES cell line (Clone R63) was a kind gift of Dr\n\nOwen Witte, UCLA, California, [27]. mESCs were routinely\n\ncultured on dishes coated in 0.1% (w/v) porcine gelatin (Sigma) in\n\nKnock-out Dulbecco’s modified Eagles Medium (Gibco) supple-\n\nmented with 15% (v/v) knockout serum replacement (Gibco),\n\n2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (Bio-\n\nRad), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids (Gibco) and 10\n3\n\nunits/ml\n\nmurine Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (ESGRO; Chemicon:\n\nESG1106).

Over time, the embryoid\n\nbodies showed increased heterogeneity and at day 7 and 10\n\nballoon-like cysts were present (Figure 1A), which resembled those\n\nobserved previously [30].\n\nWhole-mount immunostaining of the outer-layer of the\n\nembryoid body showed that a small percentage of nuclei were\n\npositive for the primitive endoderm fate markers Gata6, Gata4 or\n\nHnf4a on day 3 (Figure 1B). As the embryoid bodies grew, the\nnumber of nuclei which expressed these markers increased,\n\nreaching a peak on day 7 (Figure 1B). Additionally, expression\n\nof the pluripotency protein Nanog decreased (Figure 1C). It was\n\nexpressed in approximately 35% of nuclei on day 3, this fell to 7%\n\non day 5 and no cells expressed Nanog by day 7. Increasing\n\nexpression of the primitive endoderm fate markers and loss of the\n\npluripotency marker Nanog suggests that the outer layer of the\n\nembryoid bodies is undergoing a developmental program similar\n\nto that observed in the embryonic primitive endoderm.\n\nPrimitive Endoderm of the Embryoid Body Develops\nApico-basolateral Polarity by Day 5\n\nThe outer layer of the embryoid bodies appears to be following\n\na developmental pathway which recapitulates primitive endoderm\n\ndevelopment. As polarity has been shown to change as the\n\nprimitive endoderm forms [26], whole-mount immunostaining\n\nwas used to observe the localisation of key markers of epithelial\n\npolarisation in embryoid bodies. After 3 days of culture, the\n\nembryoid bodies showed expression of the polarity complex\n\nprotein aPkcf/l in the outer layer of cells, where it localised to the\ncytoplasm (Figure 2A). By day 5, aPkcf/l localisation was mostly\napically restricted across the whole of the outer surface of cells of\n\nthe embryoid body, this localisation remained unchanged on day 7\n\nand 10. The tight-junction protein Zo-1 was localised to the\n\nborder between the apical and lateral side of the epithelial cells,\n\nforming rings which outlined the cells by day 3 (Figure 2B). By day\n\n5 the apical puncta were uniformly present in cells of the outer layer.\n\nb-catenin, an adherens junction protein was predominantly\npresent at the lateral side of cells of the outermost cell layer from\n\nday 3, but in some areas was also apically localised (Figure 2C). By\n\nday 5, b-catenin was consistently localised to the lateral side of the\nouter-most cell layer. Fibronectin is a basement membrane\n\nprotein, on day 3 it localised to patches directly below the\n\noutermost cell layer, and deeper into the embryoid body\n\n(Figure 2D). This localisation gradually became more specific, by\n\nday 5 the staining was more restricted to the basal side of the\n\noutermost cell layer, whilst there were still patches of apical\n\nFibronectin. By day 7 the Fibronectin was restricted to below the\n\nbasal-side of the outermost cells and no staining was observed in\n\ncells below the outer cell layer. The gradual localisation of these\n\napico-basolaterally polarised proteins shows that the epithelium\n\nsurrounding the embryoid body has begun to polarise on day 3\n\nand has clear polarisation by day 5.\n\nInhibition of Mek with PD-0325901 Results in a Loss of\nGata4 and Gata6 Expression in Embryoid Bodies\n\nErk signalling has previously been shown to have a role in\n\nprimitive endoderm fate specification [10,11], but its role in\n\npolarisation of these cells is less well established. To investigate the\n\nrole of Mek signalling in this process PD-0325901, a potent Mek\n\ninhibitor [31,32] was added to the cell suspension (day 0) and\n\nanalysis of the phenotype of the embryoid bodies was carried out\n\nafter 7 days of development (Figure 3A). Diphosphorylated Erk1\n\nand 2 was markedly decreased (Figure 3B) demonstrating that,\n\nwhen added to the media PD-0325901 successfully inhibited Mek\n\nsignalling. There was a slight reduction in size of the embryoid\n\nbodies at the highest dose tested (4 mM) in comparison to\nembryoid bodies treated with vehicle, but this was not statistically\n\nsignificant (Figure 3C). A statistically significant increase in the\n\ncircularity of the embryoid body (Figure 3D) in comparison to\n\ncontrol was observed. To establish if the addition of PD-0325901\n\ncaused an increase in apoptosis, whole-mount immunostaining for\n\ncleaved Caspase-3 was performed (Figure 3E). No significant\n\nchange in the number of nuclei positive for cleaved Caspase-3 was\n\nobserved in the outer layer of the embryoid bodies showing that\n\ninhibiting Mek did not cause a significant increase in apoptosis\n\nthat might have affected the development of these cells.\n\nDisruption of Mek-signalling causes a loss of Gata6 and Gata4\n\nexpression, and an increase in Nanog expression preventing the\n\nfate specification of the primitive endoderm both in vivo and in vitro\n\n[6,10]. The expression levels of Gata6, Gata4 and Nanog were\n\nanalysed to assess the effect Mek inhibition has in this system.\n\nWestern blotting of embryoid bodies showed a dose-dependent\n\ndecrease in Gata6 and Gata4 protein expression levels, resulting in\n\nvery little protein remaining at the highest concentration of PD-\n\n0325901 (4 uM) (Figure 4A & B). This result was confirmed using\n\nwhole-mount immunostaining of Gata6 (Figure 4C). In contrast,\n\nthe percentage of Nanog positive nuclei increased from 0% in\n\ncontrol to an average of 76% upon addition of 4 mM PD-0325901\n(Figure 4D). This confirms that upon inhibition of Mek the cells of\n\nthe outer-layer of the embryoid body failed to become primitive\n\nendoderm cells, but instead remained pluripotent.\n\nMek Inhibition Results in Disruption of Epithelial Polarity\nHaving observed a disruption in the specification of the\n\nprimitive endoderm cell fate following inhibition of Mek signalling\n\n(Figure 2), embryoid bodies were cultured in PD-0325901 and the\n\nlocalisation of polarity and junctional proteins examined (Figure 2).\n\nThe addition of 2 mM PD-0325901 appeared to cause maximal\ninhibition of ppErk1/2, but 4 mM caused a bigger reduction in\nGata4/6 staining. The expression of these proteins in the primitive\n\nendoderm is Mek dependent [33] arguing that in this system there\n\nmay be a low level of Mek signalling which is inhibited by addition\n\nof 4 mM PD-0325901. For this reason 4 mM PD-0325901 was\nchosen for subsequent experiments. aPkcf/l was apically localised\nin the control embryoid bodies, but when treated with the Mek\n\ninhibitor aPkcf/l was also present in the cytoplasm and in cell\nlayers below the outer layer (Figure 5A). After treatment with the\n\nMek inhibitor the tight-junction protein Zo-1 remained localised\n\nat the apical side of the outer layer cells but did not form a belt-like\n\nstructure around the cells (Figure 5B). Occasional labelled\n\njunctions remained, but the majority of protein was present in\n\nisolated puncta. This suggested that inhibition of Mek disrupted the\n\nformation of the tight junctions and the localisation of aPkcf/l.\n\nFgfr/Erk and Primitive Endoderm Polarisation\n\nPLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 8 April 2014 | Volume 9 | Issue 4 | e95434\n\n\n\nb-catenin localisation was also disrupted by treatment with the\nMek inhibitor. It localised apically as well as laterally in the outer\n\ncell layer of embryoid bodies treated with PD-0325901 (Figure 5C)\n\nand was observed in the second layer of cells (the layer below the\n\nouter-layer). This localisation was not observed in the controls\n\n(Figure 5C, 2\nnd\n\nlayer panel). Lastly, a disruption in the localisation\n\nFigure 6.

Upon addition of PD-0325901, Fibronectin formed\n\nsmall aggregates of protein instead of a fibrous network as\n\nobserved in the control embryoid bodies. In addition, the\n\nFibronectin protein in embryoid bodies treated with PD-\n\n0325901 was not basally restricted, but was present in all cell\n\nlayers observed. The mislocalisation of aPkcf/l, as well as tight\njunction, adherens junction and basement membrane proteins\n\nshows that the apico-basolateral polarity of the outer layer of\n\nembryoid bodies was disrupted following Mek inhibition.\n\nLoss of Gata6 and Gata4 Expression upon Inhibition of\nFgfr Signalling\n\nAs disruption of the Erk signalling cascade resulted in a\n\ndisruption in the apico-basolateral polarity of the outer-layer of the\n\nembryoid body, we wished to identify the receptor responsible for\n\nErk activation in this system. A leading candidate for this was the\n\nFgfr, as its inhibition has previously been shown to decrease\n\nexpression of Gata6 and Gata4, disrupting further fate specifica-\n\ntion of the primitive endoderm [13–15]. A newly developed potent\n\nand selective inhibitor of the Fgfr, AZD-4547, was used to treat\n\nembryoid bodies (Figure 6A). This inhibitor was chosen as it is\n\nmore selective than previously available compounds such as PD-\n\n173074 [34,35]. Addition of this inhibitor caused a reduction in\n\nppERK1 and 2 (Figure 6B). Some ppErk expression remained,\n\nperhaps due to other signalling pathways upstream of Mek such as\n\nGPCRs, integrins or other receptor tyrosine kinases. Addition of\n\nAZD-4547 produced embryoid bodies which were smaller than\n\ncontrols even at the lowest dose tested (1uM) (Figure 6A&C).\n\nThere was also a dose dependent increase in the circularity of the\n\nembryoid bodies, resulting in embryoid bodies which were\n\nsignificantly more circular than controls when cultured with\n\n4 mM and 8 mM PD-0325901 (Figure 6A&D). To determine if\naddition of AZD-4547 caused an effect on apoptosis whole-mount\n\nimmunostaining for cleaved Caspase-3 was carried out. There was\n\na small, but not statistically significant, increase in the number of\n\nnuclei in the outer-layer of the embryoid body which were positive\n\nfor cleaved Caspase-3 (Figure 6E). The majority of cells (.85%)\n\nremained Caspase negative, arguing that any changes in\n\ndevelopment of the primitive endoderm are not due to cell death.\n\nA dose-dependent decrease in expression levels of both Gata4\n\nand Gata6 was observed by western blotting when embryoid\n\nbodies were grown in increasing concentrations of the Fgfr\n\ninhibitor (Figure 7A&B). Additionally, whole-mount immuno-\n\nstaining confirmed a reduction in Gata6 positive nuclei when\n\n4 mM AZD-4547 was used (Figure 7C). Nanog expression\nincreased from 0% in control to an average of 82% upon\n\ninhibition of the Fgfr (Figure 7D). This suggests that Fgfr signalling\n\nis activating Erk to drive an increase in size, heterogeneity of\n\nshape, loss of Nanog, and expression of primitive endoderm fate\n\nmarkers in embryoid bodies.\n\nLoss of Apico-basolateral Polarity upon Fgfr Inhibition\nHaving observed a loss in expression of primitive endoderm\n\nmarkers, we examined apico-basolateral polarity components\n\nfollowing inhibition of the Fgfr. This analysis was performed\n\nusing 4 mM AZD-4547 as a clear inhibition of ppERK, loss of\nGata6 and Gata4 expression and, morphological changes were\n\nobserved at this concentration. Following inhibition of the Fgfr,\n\naPkcf/l localised throughout the cytoplasm of the outer-layer and\nwas found in the layers below (Figure 8A). A disruption in both\n\nadherens junctions and tight junction proteins was also observed.\n\nZo-1 localised to apical puncta, but did not form a belt around the\n\nperiphery of the cells, instead only patches or short lines of Zo-1\n\nwere detected (Figure 8B). b-catenin was observed apically in some\ncells and was also found in the cells below the outer layer\n\n(Figure 8C). Localisation of Fibronectin was also investigated. The\n\nprotein was spread throughout the outer layer, as well as in layers\n\nFigure 7.

The mislocalisation of\n\nthese proteins was similar to that seen when embryoid bodies were\n\ntreated with the Mek inhibitor, suggesting that Mek dependent\n\npolarisation is driven by activation of the Fgfr.\n\nInhibition of Mek Or Fgfr Signalling does not Significantly\nAlter the Expression Levels of Polarity and Junction\nProteins\n\nTo determine whether inhibition of Mek or the Fgfr altered the\n\nlevels of the polarity proteins, the expression of aPkcf/l, b-\ncatenin, Fibronectin were assessed following treatment with PD-\n\n0325901 or AZD-4547 using western blotting (Figure 9). Quan-\n\ntification suggested some small changes following inhibitor\n\ntreatment, but none of these were statistically significant. This\n\nargues that, although small changes cannot be ruled out, inhibition\n\nof Mek or the Fgfr predominantly caused a re-localisation of these\n\nproteins rather than a change in their expression levels.\n\nInhibition of the Fgfr with PD-173074 Causes a\nDisruption in Polarisation of the Outer-layer of Cells\n\nTreatment of embryoid bodies with the recently developed Fgfr\n\ninhibitor AZD-4547 caused a mis-localisation of apico-basolater-\n\nally polarised proteins. To confirm the specificity of this effect and\n\nallow comparison with previous literature, the polarisation of\n\nembryoid bodies was observed using the structurally distinct and\n\nmore commonly used inhibitor PD-173074. This is an effective\n\ninhibitor of Fgfr1, but also inhibits the Vascular endothelial\n\ngrowth factor receptor 2 (Vegfr2) [35]. The polarisation of the\n\nprimitive endoderm was observed following treatment with\n\n0.1 mM PD-173074 which is the concentration commonly used\nfor studying primitive endoderm in vivo [16,17]. In these in vivo\n\nstudies it is often used in combination with a Mek inhibitor\n\n[16,17]. Embryoid bodies were therefore also treated with 0.1 mM\nPD-173074 and 1 mM PD-0325901, the combination and\nconcentration of inhibitors previously used to assess primitive\n\nendoderm development [16,17].\n\nThe tight-junction protein Zo-1 localised to junctions in control\n\nembryoid bodies, but this localisation was disrupted following\n\ntreatment with either 0.1 mM PD-173074 or the combination of\n0.1 mM PD-173074 and 1 mM PD-0325901 (Figure 10A). The\nlocalisation of the adherens junction protein b-catenin was also\ndisrupted following treatment with PD-173074 and when treated\n\nwith the combined inhibitors (Figure 10B). The use of two\n\nstructurally distinct inhibitors of the Fgfr, which gave very similar\n\nresults, argues that the phenotypes described above are caused by\n\nspecifically inhibiting Fgfr signalling.\n\nInhibition of Mek or the Fgfr Signalling Results in a Loss\nof Epithelial Barrier Function\n\nThe maintenance of a diffusion barrier is a common function of\n\nepithelial layers [36]. We therefore investigated if, in addition to\n\nthe mislocalisation of apico-basolateral polarity proteins described\n\nabove, the cells of the embryoid bodies had defects in their barrier\n\nFigure 9. Inhibition Mek or the Fgfr did not significantly alter the expression levels of polarity and junction proteins.

Our data demonstrates\n\na gradual increase in expression of primitive endoderm markers,\n\nloss of Nanog expression and establishment of epithelial polarisa-\n\ntion in the primitive endoderm layer of embryoid bodies.\n\nInhibition of both Mek and the Fgfr caused a loss of primitive\n\nendoderm markers, maintenance of Nanog and mislocalisation of\n\nall the polarity proteins examined; polarity complex protein\n\naPkcf/l, tight junction protein Zo-1, adherens junction protein b-\ncatenin, and basement membrane protein Fibronectin. Associated\n\nwith the disruption in polarity and junctional protein localisation\n\nwas a loss of the barrier function of the epithelium. This argues\n\nthat Fgfr signalling activates Erk 1 and 2 which then promotes cell\n\nfate specification, polarisation and establishment of a functional\n\nepithelial barrier.\n\nEmbryoid Bodies as a Model of Epithelial Polarity\nThe polarised localisation of a number of proteins has been\n\npreviously reported in the primitive endoderm [20–24], however,\n\nthe temporal localisation of multiple epithelial polarity proteins has\n\nnot previously been examined. The results presented here show\n\nthat the primitive endoderm of an embryoid body gradually\n\npolarises in an order which is similar to that observed in other\n\nepithelia (Reviewed by [37]). Zo-1 and b-catenin localise at\njunctions at the initial stage of cell polarisation, followed by\n\nlocalisation of aPkcf/l at the apical membrane and deposition of\nFibronectin to form a basement membrane.\n\nThere are many different models which can be used to study\n\nepithelial polarisation, including model organisms such as\n\nDrosophila melanogaster, polarised cell culture cells such as MDCK\n\ncells, and epithelial organs from embryonic and adult mice [38–\n\n40]. However, the primitive endoderm of an embryoid body has a\n\nnumber of characteristics which we believe will make it a valuable\n\nmodel for future experiments. It is a 3 dimensional model\n\ncomposed of a variety of non-transformed cell types, which\n\ngradually polarise and express cell fate markers. There are also a\n\ngrowing number of knockout and transgenic ES cell lines which\n\ncould be studied in this system [41,42]. In particular, embryoid\n\nbodies are well suited for studying the relationship between\n\npolarisation and fate specification in a developing epithelium.\n\nFgfr/Erk Signalling is Required for Cell Fate Specification\nand Polarisation of the Primitive Endoderm\n\nThe Fgfr/Erk signalling pathway is known to be required for\n\ncell fate specification of the primitive endoderm [9]. Our data\n\nconfirms that inhibition of either the Fgfr or Mek signalling causes\n\na loss of primitive endoderm cell fate markers and maintenance of\n\nFigure 11. Inhibition of the Fgfr or Mek caused a loss in barrier function of the cells in the outer layer of the embryoid body.\nEmbryoid bodies were treated with (A) 0.04% DMSO, or 4 mM PD-0325901(Mek inhibitor), (B) 0.04% DMSO or 4 mM AZD-4547 (Fgfr inhibitor) for 7\ndays. A membrane impermeable biotin which covalently links to amino groups was added to the embryoid bodies and subsequently visualised using\nAlexa-fluor-488-conjugated Streptavidin. The biotin was largely restricted to the apical surface of the embryoid body in DMSO controls. Following\ntreatment with either a Mek or an Fgfr inhibitor, biotin also bound to basolateral membrane proteins of the outer cell layer and the membranes of\ncells under this layer. This shows that the normal epithelial barrier has been disrupted. A representative image from 3 independent experiments is\nshown. Scale bars 10 mm.

Interestingly, inhibition of the\n\nFgfr caused a stronger reduction of primitive endoderm fate\n\nmarkers, despite inducing less inhibition of Erk than the Mek\n\ninhibitor. This suggests that another receptor may be activating\n\nMek. It also raises the possibility that the Fgfr might be activating\n\nother signalling pathways, such as Pi3k-Akt, Stat, Plcc, p38\nMapK, and Jnk [43] to promote expression of Gata4 and Gata6.\n\nThese additional pathways may regulate embryoid body size, as\n\nthe Fgfr inhibitor caused a bigger reduction in size than addition of\n\nthe Mek inhibitor. Another interesting phenotype seen following\n\ninhibition of both Fgfr or Mek was an increase in circularity. This\n\nmay be caused by a failure to become cystic, causing the embryoid\n\nbodies to remain more homogeneous. Gata4\n2/2\n\nembryoid bodies\n\nare also smaller than controls and non-cystic [44] and embryoid\n\nbodies made with Laminin c1\n2/2\n\nmES cells do not cavitate [45].\n\nTherefore, the increase in circularity may be linked to a failure in\n\nprimitive endoderm development and polarisation.\n\nOur data also show that Fgfr/Erk signalling is required for the\n\nformation of a polarised primitive endoderm layer with an efficient\n\nbarrier function. This hypothesis is supported by a several other\n\nfindings. Firstly, aPkc does not polarise in the primitive endoderm\n\nof embryos grown in 2i medium, which includes a Mek and a\n\nGSK3b inhibitor [26]. Secondly, expression of a truncated form of\nFgfr2 in mES cells has been reported to disrupt basement\n\nmembrane formation [46], while Grb2 knockout embryoid bodies\n\nshow an absence of Laminin basal to the outer cell layer [10].\n\nCombining our data with previous studies leads us to propose that\n\nthe Fgfr/MAPK signalling pathway promotes polarisation of the\n\nprimitive endoderm as well as its fate. There are at least three\n\npossibilities to explain this dual role; 1) Fgfr/Erk signalling\n\nregulates primitive endoderm cell fate specification which then\n\npromotes polarisation. 2) Fgfr/Erk signalling initiates the polar-\n\nisation of the primitive endoderm which then drives fate\n\nspecification. 3) MAPK independently regulates both the polar-\n\nisation and fate determination of the primitive endoderm.\n\nIn embryoid bodies, the cells start to polarise prior to the\n\nmaximal nuclear localisation of Gata6, Gata4, and Hnf4a\n(Figures 1 and 2). This suggests that in embryoid bodies the onset\n\nof polarisation occurs before cell fate specification and argues\n\nagainst model one where cell fate regulators promote polarisation.\n\nThere is also evidence that disrupting polarisation of the primitive\n\nendoderm does not affect fate determination, arguing against\n\nmodel two. Embryoid bodies formed with mES cells which do not\n\nexpress Laminin c1, a key component of the basement membrane,\nhave primitive endoderm cells in the outer-layer although they\n\nwere not properly organised [24,45]. Additionally, E-cadherin\n2/2\n\nES cells showed normal primitive endoderm development, but the\n\nembryoid bodies did not form a cavity, consistent with defects in\n\nepithelial barrier formation [23]. In Dab2 null mouse embryos\n\ncells of the primitive endoderm lose their apico-basolateral\n\npolarity. In these embryos Gata4 expression was observed, but\n\npositive cells were positioned throughout the epiblast, suggesting a\n\nfailure in positioning but not fate regulation [22,23].\n\nThe studies described above argue against the idea of polarity\n\nregulating cell fate (model 2). However, there is also conflicting\n\nevidence that loss of proteins required for epithelial polarisation\n\ncan disrupt primitive endoderm fate specification. In Integrin\n\nb12/2 embryoid bodies, a-fetoprotein (a marker of visceral\nendoderm) is only expressed in clusters of endoderm cells, Dab2\n\nprotein was not observed by immunostaining, and Gata4 became\n\ncytoplasmic [47]. This suggests that the absence of integrins\n\ndisrupts the development of the primitive endoderm. The mutant\n\nembryoid bodies had no diphospho-Erk1/2, and had reduced p38\n\nand Akt activation suggesting that Integrins control endoderm\n\ndifferentiation via the Raf/Erk and Akt signalling pathways [47].\n\nLive-imaging of embryos treated with an aPkc inhibitor revealed\n\nthat the primitive endoderm cells migrate but fail to remain on the\n\nICM surface when they reach the cavity. This resulted in primitive\n\nendoderm cells being present throughout the epiblast rather than\n\nforming a distinct layer on the edge of the blastocoel [26]. No\n\neffect was seen on early markers of the primitive endoderm fate\n\n(Pdgfra, and Gata6), but some cells were negative for both Nanog\n\nand Gata4, suggesting a defect in primitive endoderm maturation\n\n[26]. Co-transfection experiments also showed that the Dab2\n\npromoter can be transactivated by forced expression of Gata6, in\n\nNIH-3T3 cells [48] suggesting the polarity regulator Dab2 may be\n\na downstream target of the cell fate regulator Gata6. In summary,\n\ncurrent evidence appears to support the idea of a hybrid model\n\nwhere early regulation of primitive endoderm fate acts upstream of\n\npolarisation, but that aPkc and possibly other regulators of\n\npolarity, are required for the maturation of the primitive\n\nendoderm fate. This is clearly a complex process, and the\n\nmechanistic elucidation of Fgfr/Erk signalling’s dual role in cell\n\nfate determination and cell polarisation, and how these two\n\nprocesses are interlinked and interact will be a key aim goal for\n\nfuture work.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, our results demonstrate that the Fgfr/Erk\n\npathway is required for the formation of a polarised primitive\n\nendoderm cell layer in embryoid bodies. Further studies into the\n\nmechanisms responsible for this requirement and the relationship\n\nbetween cell fate specification and cell polarity are needed to\n\nimprove our understanding of the development of this key\n\nembryonic cell type. These studies are likely to be relevant to\n\nthe development of other embryonic and adult epithelia.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors would like to thank Benjamin Sharpe, Christopher Bryant and\n\nSilvia Munoz-Descalzo for reading a draft of this manuscript.
