    "title": "14-3-3σ is required to prevent mitotic catastrophe after DNA damage",
    "summary": "14-3-3σ is a member of a family of proteins that regulate cellular activity by binding and sequestering phosphorylated proteins. It has been suggested that 14-3-3σ promotes pre-mitotic cell-cycle arrest following DNA damage, and that its expression can be controlled by the p53 tumour suppressor gene1. Here we describe an improved approach to the generation of human somatic-cell knockouts, which we have used to generate human colorectal cancer cells in which both 14-3-3σ alleles are inactivated. After DNA damage, these cells initially arrested in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, but, unlike cells containing 14-3-3σ, the 14-3-3σ-/- cells were unable to maintain cell-cycle arrest. The 14-3-3σ-/- cells died (‘mitotic catastrophe’) as they entered mitosis. This process was associated with a failure of the 14-3-3σ-deficient cells to sequester the proteins (cyclin B1 and cdc2) that initiate mitosis and prevent them from entering the nucleus. These results may indicate a mechanism for maintaining the G2 checkpoint and preventing mitotic death.",

It\nhas been suggested that 14-3-3s promotes pre-mitotic cell-cycle\narrest following DNA damage, and that its expression can be\ncontrolled by the p53 tumour suppressor gene1. Here we describe\nan improved approach to the generation of human somatic-cell\nknockouts, which we have used to generate human colorectal\ncancer cells in which both 14-3-3j alleles are inactivated. After\nDNA damage, these cells initially arrested in the G2 phase of the\ncell cycle, but, unlike cells containing 14-3-3s, the 14-3-3s−/− cells\nwere unable to maintain cell-cycle arrest. The 14-3-3s−/− cells died\n(‘mitotic catastrophe’) as they entered mitosis. This process was\nassociated with a failure of the 14-3-3s-deficient cells to sequester\nthe proteins (cyclin B1 and cdc2) that initiate mitosis and prevent\nthem from entering the nucleus. These results may indicate a\nmechanism for maintaining the G2 checkpoint and preventing\nmitotic death.\n\nMany cell types treated with DNA-damaging agents arrest in the\nG2 phase of the cell cycle. The 14-3-3j gene is transcriptionally\nactivated by p53 after DNA damage, and exogenous overexpression\nof 14-3-3s can block cells in G2, indicating that 14-3-3s might be a\ncomponent of the G2 checkpoint1. To test this hypothesis, we\ncreated cell lines deficient in 14-3-3s by homologous recombina-\ntion. The human 14-3-3j genomic locus was cloned and fully\nsequenced, and subclones were used to construct a targeting\nvector containing a geneticin-resistance gene in place of genomic\n14-3-3j sequences. Two loxP sites were introduced into the con-\nstruct, one immediately 59 and the other directly 39 to the geneticin-\nresistance gene. A primer site for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nderived from deleted genomic sequences was placed between the 59\nloxP site and the 59 end of the selection marker2. The two loxP sites\nand the primer-containing construct enabled a relatively rapid and\nrobust approach to screening clones for correctly targeted alleles,\nand for sequentially generating clones with both alleles disrupted\n(see Methods).\n\nThe human colorectal cancer cell (CRC) line HCT116 was used\nfor these experiments because it expresses wild-type p53 and\n14-3-3s, has intact DNA-damage checkpoints and is suitable for\ntargeted homologous recombination3. Two independently derived\n14-3-3s+/− and three 14-3-3s−/− clones were used for the studies\ndescribed below (Fig. 1a–c). All clones of the same genotype\nbehaved identically.\n\nWe investigated the function of 14-3-3s in human cells following\nDNA damage by adriamycin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic\nagent, as well as by ionizing radiation. The disruption of 14-3-3s\nhad a marked effect on the responses of the cells to these agents.\nAfter either treatment, 14-3-3s+/+ and 14-3-3s+/− cells increased in\nsize, with a corresponding nuclear enlargement and DNA content\ncharacteristic of cells arrested in G2 (Fig. 2a). Although 14-3-3s−/−\n\ncells appeared to enter into a similar G2 block following DNA\ndamage, they failed to maintain this arrest and eventually under-\nwent ‘mitotic catastrophe’ (Fig. 2a). Mitotic catastrophe is an\napoptosis-like process than begins in prophase, after dissolution\nof the nuclear membrane, and is associated with the entry of cdc2\nand cyclin B1 into the nucleus4,5. This process began ,24 h after\n\n\n\n© 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd\n\nletters to nature\n\nNATURE | VOL 401 | 7 OCTOBER 1999 | www.nature.com 617\n\ntreatment and was complete after 72–96 h (Fig. 3a). Although\nchromatin condensation and micronucleation occurred during\nmitotic catastrophe, this process was distinguished from more\ncommon forms of apoptosis by a relative lack of DNA degradation,\nindicated by both DNA laddering (not shown) and TdT-mediated\ndUTp nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining for nicked DNA\n(compare with ceramide-induced apoptosis in Fig. 2b).\n\nRoughly 75% of parental cells and 14-3-3s+/− heterozygote cells\narrested after DNA damage with a G2 DNA content, whereas the\nremaining 25% of cells arrested in G1 (Fig. 3b). A similar fraction\n(,25%) of 14-3-3s−/− cells arrested in G1, but a relative decrease in\nthe G2 fraction was evident as early as 24 h after adriamycin\ntreatment (Fig. 3b). At later times, the 14-3-3s−/− cells showed a\nmarked decrease in cells arrested in G2 and a corresponding increase\nin the number of sub-G1 cells, whereas the fraction of G2-arrested\ncells remained constant in both 14-3-3s+/+ and 14-3-3s+/− cells\n\n(Fig. 3b). The number of G1-arrested cells remained constant in\ncells of all three genotypes, indicating that the cells were probably\nundergoing catastrophe directly from the G2/M phase rather than\nfrom all parts of the cell cycle.\n\nTo study the expression of 14-3-3s following DNA damage, we\ngenerated an antibody specific for 14-3-3s using an amino-acid\nsequence found in 14-3-3s but not in the other six 14-3-3 family\nmembers. The specificity of this antibody was verified by the\ndetection of a protein of the expected size upon western blotting\nof parental cells treated with DNA-damaging agents but not of\n14-3-3s−/− cells (Fig. 1d). The 14-3-3s protein was induced as early\nas 6 h after exposure to adriamycin, with kinetics similar to those of\nthe p53-induced gene p21 in the same cells (Fig. 3c).\n\nThe 14-3-3s antibody was used to study the protein in situ.\nThere was no detectable staining in most exponentially growing\n14-3-3s+/+ cells, although a small population of large cells stained\n\nFigure 1 Generation of human cells deficient in 14-3-3s. a, Genomic structure of the\nhuman 14-3-3j gene and targeting construct.

The size and morphology of the cells expressing\n14-3-3s in the absence of DNA damage suggested that they were\narrested in G2 and perhaps senescent. When cells were treated with\ng-ionizing radiation or adriamycin, all the cells expressed 14-3-3s\n(Fig. 3d). As expected, 14-3-3s−/− cells did not stain for 14-3-3s\neither before or after treatment with adriamycin (Fig. 3d), confirm-\ning the specificity of the antibodies for immunohistochemical\nanalysis.\n\nA key step in regulating the progression of cells from G2 into\nmitosis is the activation of the protein kinase cdc2 (ref. 6). Cdc2 and\ncyclin B1 are cytoplasmic during interphase and are translocated to\nthe nucleus in late G2 to initiate mitosis4,7. The DNA damage\ncheckpoint prevents the activation of cdc2–cyclin B1 complexes\nand thereby prevents cells from entering a potentially lethal\nmitosis when their DNA is damaged8. When we treated parental\ncells or 14-3-3s+/− cells with adriamycin or ionizing radiation, cdc2\nand cyclin B1 remained in the cytoplasm throughout the duration\nof the experiment (Fig. 4a). In identically treated 14-3-3s-deficient\ncells, cdc2 and cyclin B1 were initially cytoplasmic, as in the parental\ncells; however, cdc2 and cyclin B1 soon migrated to the nucleus in\nmost of the cells, and mitotic catastrophes occurred soon after\n(Fig. 4a, b). Normally, the entry of cyclin B1, cdc2, and cdc25C into\nthe nucleus occurs simultaneously4; however, cdc25C remained\nlocalized in the cytoplasm before nuclear-membrane dissolution,\ndespite the fact that cyclin B1 and cdc2 were in the nucleus (Fig. 4a).\nDouble-staining with antibodies specific for cdc2 and 14-3-3s in\nDNA-damaged cells revealed a striking colocalization of the two\nproteins in the cytoplasm of parental cells (Fig. 4c). This may\nindicate that 14-3-3s normally sequesters cyclin B1 and cdc2 in the\n\ncytoplasm, keeping cdc2–cyclin B1 from entering the nucleus and\ninitiating mitosis following DNA damage. To investigate the mole-\ncular determinants of this sequestration, we carried out immuno-\nprecipitation experiments using anti-14-3-3s antibodies. Western\nblots of the immunoprecipitates showed that cdc2 and cyclinB1\nwere bound to 14-3-3s, and that this binding markedly increased\nfollowing adriamycin treatment (Fig. 4d; and data not shown).\nWee1 kinase was also found in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4d); it\nhas already been shown that cdc2 and cyclin B1 can bind to each\nother, and that wee1 binds to cdc2–cyclin B1 (ref. 9). No cdc25C\ncould be detected (Fig. 4d), indicating that other 14-3-3 family\nmembers, but not 14-3-3s, may be responsible for the reported\ncdc25C interactions10.\n\nThus, it appears that 14-3-3s normally sequesters cdc2–cyclinB1\ncomplexes in the cytoplasm during G2 arrest, and that the absence\nof 14-3-3s eventually allows cdc2–cyclin B1 complexes to enter the\nnucleus, resulting in mitotic catastrophe. This idea is consistent\nwith several previous experiments which show that the cytoplasmic\nlocalization of cdc2–cyclinB1 is a critical regulator of the G2/M\ntransition8, and that mitotic catastrophes occur if mitosis is experi-\nmentally induced in the presence of unreplicated or damaged DNA4.\nOur results also support the idea that the initiation of G2 arrest is\ndistinct from its maintenance11. Notably, we observed identical\nmitotic catastrophes in DNA-damaged parental cells after treating\nthem with leptomycin B, an agent that inhibits nuclear export and\nresults in a similar lack of cytoplasmic sequestration of cdc2–cyclin\nB1 (data not shown). These results, in combination with previous\nstudies, suggest a simple but redundant set of mechanisms for\npreventing lethal mitosis following exposure of cells to DNA-\n\nFigure 3 Cells deficient in 14-3-3s are sensitive to DNA-damage. a, Cells with the\nindicated 14-3-3s genotypes were treated with adriamycin for various time periods,\nstained with DAPI and scored for chromosome condensation.

Chk1 inactivates cdc25C through phos-\nphorylation of serine 216 and consequent binding to 14-3-3\nproteins. The cdc2–cyclin B1 complex is thereby prevented from\nbecoming activated and initiating mitosis, and the cells arrest in G2.\nAlthough this arrest is initiated in cells without 14-3-3s or without\np21, the arrest cannot be sustained. The 14-3-3s protein is normally\n\nin a cytoplasmic complex with cdc2 during G2 arrest, and localiza-\ntion is dependent both on 14-3-3s (Fig. 4) and on continued\nnuclear transport by the crm1-dependent nuclear-export com-\nplex12–14. In the absence of either 14-3-3s or nuclear transport,\ncdc2 and cyclin B1 escape to the nucleus and initiate a catastrophic\nmitotic process4.

The G2/M checkpoint is\ninitiated by the phosphorylation of chk1 by rad3 family members (such as ATM in\nmammalian cells)20. Chk1 then inactivates cdc25C through phosphorylation of serine\n216, which leads to the binding of cdc25C to a 14-3-3 protein (not 14-3-3s) and to its\nexportation out of the nucleus15. The cdc2–cyclin B1 complex is thereby prevented from\n\nbecoming activated and initiating mitosis, and the cells arrest in G2. DNA damage also\nleads to stabilization of p53, which is required for maintenance of the G2 arrest through\nthe transactivation of the p21 and 14-3-3j genes. 14-3-3s is required to sequester\ncdc2–cyclin B1 complexes in the cytoplasm and prevent mitotic catastrophes. p21 may\nprevent any cdc2–cyclin B1 that enters the nucleus from becoming activated.\n\n\n\n© 1999 Macmillan Magazines Ltd\n\nletters to nature\n\n620 NATURE | VOL 401 | 7 OCTOBER 1999 | www.nature.com\n\nensure that mitosis does not occur in the presence of DNA damage,\none by sequestering cdc25C15 and the other by sequestering cdc2–\ncyclin B1. It is becoming apparent that it is not only the enzymatic\nactivities of cyclin-dependent kinase complexes but also their spatial\ncompartmentalization that is critical for proper control of the cell\ncycle5. M\n\nMethods\n14-3-3s targeting construct\nA BAC clone containing 14-3-3s was obtained as described1. The BAC clone was digested\nwith BamHI, and two fragments, one 4.7 kilobases (kb) and the second 3.8 kb, were used to\nconstruct the 59 and 39 arms of the targeting vector, respectively. The 4.7-kb subclone\ncontained the region immediately 59 of the initiating codon of the 14-3-3s coding region.\nThe 3.8-kb subclone contained a region beginning 900 base pairs (bp) distal to the\ninitiating codon. A synthetic EcoRV site plus the sequence 59-CGTGGAGAGGGACT\nGGCAG-39, derived from a region of the 14-3-3s locus deleted by the targeting construct,\nwere ligated to the 59 end of a geneticin-resistance gene. This product was placed into the\npBluescript plasmid (Stratagene). To facilitate knockout of both alleles, loxP sites\nsurrounding the geneticin-resistance gene were incorporated into the vector. Details of the\nconstructs are available upon request. The construct was linearized by digestion with NotI\nand used for transfection. Southern blot analysis was carried out using standard\ntechniques.\n\nCell culture and transfection\nHCT116 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The\nHCT116 p21−/− line has been described3. Cells were cultured in McCoy’s medium\nsupplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco). We carried out transfections with\nLipofectamine as directed by the manufacturer (Gibco). Clonal selection following\ntransfection with the knockout construct was carried out in McCoy’s medium with 10%\nfetal bovine serum and 0.4 mg ml−1 geneticin (Gibco). Following transfection, cells were\ndiluted in selection media and plated out in 96-well plates. After selection, we prepared\ngenomic DNA from the drug-resistant clones using the QiaAmp column system (Qiagen).\nIdentification of clones with successful targeting events was achieved using a PCR-based\nscreen with the primers 59-AGTGTCCTGGGATCTCCAGC-39 and 59-CTGCCAGTCCC\nTCTCCACG-39 and Taq Platinum (Gibco). PCR products were resolved by electrophor-\nesis in 1% agarose gels. Knockout clones were confirmed by Southern blot and western\nblot analysis. Irradiation was performed using a 137Cs g-irradiator at 1 Gy min−1 for\n12 min. Adriamycin was used at a concentration of 0.2 mg ml−1 (ref. 16). Leptomycin B was\na gift from M. Yoshida. Time-lapse microscopy was done as described17.\n\nFlow cytometry\nCells were trypsinized, washed with HBSS (Gibco) and resuspended in 40 ml HBSS. The\ncells were then added to 360 ml of a solution containing 1% NP-40 (Sigma), 4.7%\nformaldehyde (J. T. Baker), and 11 mg ml−1 Hoechst 33258 in PBS. The fixed and stained\ncells were stored at 4 8C and analysed within three days by flow cytometry.\n\nImmunoprecipitation and western blot analysis\nImmunoprecipitations were performed as described9,18. 14-3-3s antibody was conjugated\nto beads using an Affi-Gel kit (Bio-Rad). Samples of protein from equivalent numbers of\ncells were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Novex). The proteins were then\ntransferred to Immobilon P (Millipore) and incubated with either the p53-specific DO1\nmonoclonal antibody, the p21-specific EA10 monoclonal antibody (Calbiochem), a 14-3-\n3s-specific polyclonal antibody, anti-cdc2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-wee1\nantibody (Santa Cruz), or anti-cdc25C antibody (Santa Cruz). Polyclonal antibodies\nagainst 14-3-3s were generated in rabbits using a KLH-conjugate of the peptide\nSNEEGSEEKGPEV and were affinity purified using the same conjugate. The membranes\nwere then washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the appro-\npriate horseradish-peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Jackson Labs). Proteins were\nvisualized with ECL (Pierce).\n\nImmunohistochemistry\nCells were rinsed twice with PBS and then fixed with Histochoice (Amresco), permeabi-\nlized with 1% NP40 in PBS, and blocked in goat serum for 1 h. Antibodies specific for cdc2,\ncyclin B, cdk4, cyclin D, a-tubulin (all from Santa Cruz), 14-3-3s (generated as described\nabove) and p21 (Calbiochem) were applied in GT (goat serum containing 0.05% Tween\n20). After washing in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20), fluorochrome-labelled secondary\nantibody (Molecular Probes) was applied in GT for 1 h. Cells were washed for 5 min in\nPBST 3 times. In some cases, cells were counterstained with 4,6 diamidino-2-phenylindole\n(DAPI). Slides were mounted in DAPCO/glycerol and analysed with a Nikon Eclipse E800\nmicroscope equipped with a CCD camera (Photometrics). Images were pseudocoloured\nusing the software program IPLab (Signal Analytics Cooperation). TUNEL analysis was\nperformed as described19. Cdc2 kinase assays were performed as described17.\n\nReceived 28 June; accepted 2 August 1999.\n\n1. Hermeking, H. et al. 14-3-3s is a p53-regulated inhibitor of G2/M progression. Mol.
