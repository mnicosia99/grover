Freeman,3 and\nG.

LPS binding to its receptors is the crucial step in the causation of\nthese multistep events. LPS binding and signaling involves CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, the\nrelative contributions of CD14 and TLR4 in the induction of ALI and their therapeutic potentials are not clear\nin vivo. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the roles of CD14 and TLR4 in LPS-induced\nALI to determine which of these molecules is the more critical target for attenuating ALI in a mouse model.\nOur results show that CD14 and TLR4 are necessary for low-dose (300-�g/ml) LPS-induced microvascular\nleakage, NF-�B activation, neutrophil influx, cytokine and chemokine (KC, macrophage inflammatory protein\n2, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6) expression, and subsequent lung damage. On the other hand,\nwhen a 10-fold-higher dose of LPS (3 mg/ml) was used, these responses were only partially dependent on CD14\nand they were totally dependent on TLR4. The CD14-independent LPS response was dependent on CD11b. A\nTLR4 blocking antibody abolished microvascular leakage, neutrophil accumulation, cytokine responses, and\nlung pathology with a low dose of LPS but only attenuated the responses with a high dose of LPS. These data\nare the first to demonstrate that LPS-induced CD14-depdendent and -independent (CD11b-dependent) sig-\nnaling pathways in the lung are entirely dependent on TLR4 and that blocking TLR4 might be beneficial in\nlung diseases caused by LPS from gram-negative pathogens.\n\nPulmonary inflammation leading to acute lung injury (ALI)\nor its severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome\n(ARDS), is a leading cause of mortality among humans (5, 28).\nALI is characterized by extensive neutrophil influx into the\nlungs, production of proinflammatory mediators, and damage\nof lung epithelial and endothelial surfaces (12, 33, 38). Pulmo-\nnary inflammation resulting in ALI may be a harbinger of\nmultiple organ failure, particularly during sepsis associated\nwith increased circulatory levels of endotoxin or lipopolysac-\ncharide (LPS) derived from gram-negative bacteria. Hence,\nLPS has been recognized as a principal component in the\ncausation of ALI (7). LPS recognition by the host receptors is\nthe critical first step in a multistep sequence leading to activa-\ntion of a plethora of signal transduction cascades in a variety of\ncells present in the lung. The downstream effectors of these\nLPS-induced signaling pathways then induce the production of\na variety of endogenous mediators, including proinflammatory\ncytokines and chemokines, adhesion molecules, reactive oxy-\ngen species, and nitric oxide, by various lung cells (8, 21, 31),\nleading to ALI or ARDS.\n\nLPS recognition is mediated, in part, by CD14 (30, 39).\nCD14 is expressed as a 55-kDa protein in two forms; a soluble\nform (sCD14) is found in serum, while a glycosylphosphatidyl-\ninositol-linked membrane-bound form (mCD14) is found pre-\n\ndominantly in phagocytes. Neither of these forms has intrinsic\nsignaling properties because of the lack of a transmembrane\ndomain (30). Although mCD14 requires Toll-like receptor 4\n(TLR4), sCD14 requires both LPS-binding protein (LBP) and\nTLR4 to induce downstream signaling cascades (10). It is\nwidely believed that mCD14 transfers LPS to its high-affinity\nreceptor, TLR4 (9, 14). It has also been demonstrated that\nboth CD14-dependent and -independent signaling cascades\nare responsible for cellular responses in thioglycolate-elicited\nperitoneal macrophages in response to Escherichia coli LPS\n(27). A subsequent study showed that CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) is\nan important molecule, in addition to CD14 and TLR4, in\neliciting a complete LPS response in thioglycolate-elicited\nperitoneal macrophages (26). However, it has not been deter-\nmined whether CD11b is responsible for the CD14-indepen-\ndent but TLR4-dependent pathway of LPS signaling in vivo.\nFurthermore, the exact contribution of CD14-dependent and\n-independent pathways to the multiple signaling pathways re-\nsulting in lung injury induced by LPS is unknown.\n\nA large body of evidence has demonstrated that TLR4 is\nrequired for induction of an innate immune response against\nLPS from gram-negative bacteria (14, 29). This conclusion is\nsupported by the fact that mice having a gene disruption\n(TLR4�/�) (14), deletion (C57BL/10ScCr), or natural point\nmutation (C3H/HeJ) in the TLR4 gene are unresponsive to\nsystemic LPS (29). However, the role of TLR4 in the induction\nof pulmonary inflammation in mice is still debatable. A role of\nTLR4 has been described in a murine model of hemorrhage–\nLPS-induced lung inflammation (4). By contrast, another study\n\n* Corresponding author.

The goal of the present study was to\ncompare the roles of CD14 and TLR4 in the pathogenesis of\nlung damage induced after inhalation of E. coli LPS in order to\ndetermine which of these molecules is the more critical target\nfor attenuating lung damage in a mouse model. Since CD14\nand TLR4 are important for LPS recognition and signaling in\nthe host, we hypothesized that a deficiency in or mutation of\neither CD14 or TLR4 protects mice against pulmonary inflam-\nmation caused by LPS, but the relative efficacy of such hypoth-\nesized protection is not known.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nMice. CD14-null (CD14�/�) mice were used after they were backcrossed 10\ntimes with C57BL/6 mice as described previously (24). Wild-type C57BL/6 mice\n(CD14�/�; Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, Ind.) were used as controls for\n\nCD14�/�. TLR4 mutant mice (TLR4mt; C3H/HeJ) were purchased from Jack-\nson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, Maine); the mutation in these mice resulted in\nresistance to the pathophysiological effects of LPS, and these mice have no other\nknown defects in responses to microbes and/or their products (29). Wild-type\nC3H/HeN mice (TLR4wt; Harlan Sprague-Dawley) were used as controls for\nTLR4mt mice. In another set of experiments, we used a CD14 TLR4 double-\nknockout strain that was created from CD14�/� and TLR4-deficient mice after\n10 backcrosses with C57BL/6 mice (14). All animal experiments were conducted\nin accordance with National Jewish Medical and Research Center committee-\napproved protocols based on Association for Assessment and Accreditation of\nLaboratory Animal Care policies. The mice weighed between 20 and 30 g and\nwere between 8 and 10 weeks old at the time of use.\n\nReagents. Purified E. coli O111:B4 LPS, sterile distilled water, hexadecyltri-\nmethylammonium bromide (HTAB), and O-dianisidine were purchased from\nSigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, Mo.). Anti-mouse CD11b and its isotype-\nmatched control antibody (Ab), capture and blocking antibodies for enzyme-\nlinked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and cytokine standards were purchased\nfrom R&D systems (Minneapolis, Minn.). Anti-TLR4 Ab and the isotype Ab\nwere obtained from e-Biosciences (San Diego, Calif.). Isotonic saline (0.9%\nsodium chloride) was purchased from Baxter Corp. (Deerfield, Ill.).\n\nLPS-induced pulmonary inflammation. The induction of pulmonary inflam-\nmation in a mouse model by LPS instillation has been described previously (17,\n25). Briefly, mice were exposed to 0.3 mg of LPS per ml in 0.9% saline or to 0.9%\nsaline by aerosolization for 20 min under a laminar flow hood by using a flow rate\nof 2 liters/min. For high-dose LPS experiments, 3 mg of LPS per ml in 0.9%\nsaline was used in a similar manner (17, 25). At 2, 8, and 24 h after inhalation of\nLPS or 0.9% saline, mice were sacrificed for collection of bronchoalveolar lavage\n\nFIG. 1.

A dose of Ab (sodium azide free) was diluted\nin 40 �l of phosphate-buffered saline prior to intratracheal administration. In\ncontrol experiments, 40 �l of phosphate-buffered saline was administrated in-\ntratracheally.\n\n(i) Anti-CD11b Ab. The immunoglobulin G2B (IgG2B) clone M1/70 CD11b\nblocking Ab or the isotype control IgG2B Ab was administrated at a concentra-\ntion of 40 �g/mouse 2 h prior to LPS exposure. The mice were anesthetized by\nusing Avertin (333 mg/kg), and the Ab was slowly infused intratracheally into the\nmouse lungs. It has been shown previously that the anti-CD11b Ab specifically\nblocks mouse CD11b at this concentration in vivo (6).\n\n(ii) Anti-TLR4 Ab. Mice were pretreated with either an anti-TLR4 Ab that\nrecognizes the extracellular domain of mouse TLR4 or the isotype-matched\ncontrol Ab 2 h prior to LPS exposure. Previous studies have shown that this\nanti-TLR4 Ab is indeed a blocking Ab that binds to TLR4 and blocks LPS-\ninduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-�) production in cultured macro-\nphages (2). We used a concentration of 20 �g/mouse based on its maximal\ninhibition of LPS-induced effects in vivo as determined with a range of Ab\nconcentrations (2, 20, and 100 �g/mouse) (Jeyaseelan and Worthen, unpublished\ndata). The mice were then exposed to LPS and were sacrificed at 8 and 24 h for\nthe collection of BALF and lungs.\n\nBALF collection. BALF was harvested as previously described (17, 25). Ap-\nproximately 3.0 ml of BALF was obtained from each mouse. One hundred\nmicroliters of BALF was centrifuged for 5 min at 400 � g by using a cytospin on\na Superfrost/Plus microscopic slide, and BALF cells were stained by the Diff-\nQuick method (Fisher, Chicago, Ill.). The rest of the BALF was passed through\na 0.22-�m-pore-size filter and then used immediately or stored at �70°C for\nprotein measurement of KC, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2),\nTNF-�, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) contents by ELISA, and the total protein con-\n\ncentration in recovered BALF was determined by using the Bradford assay\n(Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.).\n\nTissue collection. The animals were humanely sacrificed, and their lungs were\nexcised. The whole lungs were then snap frozen and processed for NF-�B\ntranslocation and myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays.\n\nMPO assay. An MPO assay was performed as described previously (3, 17).\nAfter BALF was collected, isolated whole lungs were weighed, frozen at �70°C,\nand then homogenized in 1 ml of HTAB buffer for 30 s (50 mg of tissue/ml of\nHTAB). After addition of more HTAB buffer (according to the weight of the\nlungs) to each tube, the samples were vortexed. After this, 1 ml of homogenate\nwas transferred into a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuged at 20,000 � g for 4\nmin. Seven microliters of supernatant was transferred into a flat-bottom 96-well\nplate, and 200 �l of a O-dianisidine hydrochloride solution was added immedi-\nately before the optical density at 450 nm was determined. The MPO activity was\nexpressed in units per milligram of lung tissue.\n\nLung morphology. Mouse lungs were perfused and fixed with Streck tissue\nfixative (Streck Laboratories, Omaha, Nebr.) overnight at room temperature.\nThe lungs were embedded in paraffin, and 5-�m sections were cut and stained\nwith hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis.\n\nNF-�B activation assay. Nuclear extract from mouse lungs was prepared by\nusing the manufacturer’s protocol (Active Motif, Carlsbad, Calif.). Briefly, frozen\nlung samples were homogenized with 300 �l of ice-cold 1� hypotonic buffer\nsupplemented with dithiothreitol for 30 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at\n850 � g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet (nuclear\nfraction) was resuspended in 50 �l of complete lysis buffer and incubated for 30\nmin on ice. Then the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 � g for 10 min at 4°C, and\nthe supernatant was collected and stored at �70°C. The protein concentrations\nof the samples were assessed by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). A total of 20 �g\nof nuclear extract was used to measure the activity of the p65 subunit of NF-�B\naccording to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Active Motif). The optical\n\nFIG. 2.

These times were selected because\nin our previous studies we found dramatic differences in the\ncharacteristic features of the inflammatory response to LPS\n(17). We first examined the microvascular leakage of proteins\ninto lung parenchyma in response to LPS. In saline controls for\nall four groups of mice (C57BL/6 [CD14�/�], CD14�/�,\nC3HeN [TLR4wt], and C3HeJ [TLR4mt]), the total protein\ncontents in mice were not different at 2, 8, or 24 h (Fig. 1A and\nE). On the other hand, inhalation of LPS significantly in-\ncreased the BALF total protein content in wild-type mice\n(CD14�/� and TLR4wt) at 8 and 24 h (Fig. 1A and E), indi-\ncating that there was microvascular leakage induced by LPS at\nlater times in these mouse strains. By contrast, no increase in\nthe total protein content was observed in LPS-treated lungs of\nCD14�/� and TLR4mt mice at 8 and 24 h (Fig. 1A and E). In\norder to measure leukocyte accumulation in response to LPS,\nthe total number of white blood cells (WBCs) and neutrophils\nin BALF and lung MPO activity, an index of neutrophil se-\nquestration, were determined. Saline control data showed that\n\nthere was no difference among the four groups (Fig. 1B to D\nand F to H). On the other hand, LPS treatment of wild-type\nmice (CD14�/� and TLR4wt) increased the total WBC and\nneutrophil counts in BALF and the lung MPO activity at 8 and\n24 h (Fig. 1B to D and F to H), indicating that neutrophils\naccumulated in both the alveolar space and the whole lung.\nHowever, no increase in the total WBC and neutrophil counts\nin BALF or in lung MPO activity was noted in CD14�/� and\nTLR4mt mice at either 8 or 24 h after LPS treatment (Fig. 1B\nto D and F to H). We then assessed lung histology in response\nto LPS at 24 h since we previously demonstrated that lung\npathology in response to inhaled LPS is most evident at 24 h\n(17). In animals treated with saline, no lung pathology was\nobserved in any of the four groups (Fig. 2 C to D and G to H).\nBy contrast, LPS treatment induced interstitial edema and\nneutrophil influx in CD14�/� and TLR4wt mice at 24 h (Fig. 2B\nand F). No changes in lung histology were detected in\nCD14�/� and TLR4mt mice at 24 h after LPS treatment (Fig.\n2A and B). These observations indicate that both CD14 and\nTLR4 are essential for the induction of microvascular damage,\nincrease in the total WBC count, neutrophil influx, and lung\nhistology in response to 300 �g of LPS/ml.\n\nFIG. 5.

Previous studies have shown that LPS binding to its\nreceptor(s) induces a signaling cascade that involves activation\nof NF-�B, which activates the transcription of a variety of\ngenes involved in ALI (18). Therefore, we measured the trans-\nlocation of the p65 subunit of NF-�B into the nucleus of lung\ncells as an index of LPS signaling. LPS caused significant ac-\ntivation of NF-�B in the lungs from CD14�/� and TLR4wt\n\nmice (Fig. 3), but no significant activation of NF-�B was ob-\nserved in CD14�/� and TLR4mt mice or saline-treated\nCD14�/� and TLR4wt mice (Fig. 3A). These observations\ndemonstrated that CD14 and TLR4 are essential in LPS sig-\nnaling cascades leading to NF-�B activation.\n\nCytokine responses in CD14�/� and TLR4mt mice in re-\nsponse to LPS. To understand the mechanisms involved in the\nCD14- and TLR4-dependent innate immune response in the\nlung in response to LPS, BALF was analyzed to determine the\nexpression of chemokine and cytokine proteins, including KC,\nMIP-2, TNF-�, and IL-6. Figure 4 shows that there were in-\ncreased KC, MIP-2, TNF-�, and IL-6 levels in CD14�/� and\nTLR4wt mouse BALF after LPS treatment at 2, 8, and 24 h,\nrespectively, compared to the saline-treated control mice. In\ncontrast, no increases in the levels of these cytokines were\nobserved in CD14�/� mice (Fig. 4A to D) and TLR4mt mice\n(Fig. 5E to H) in response to LPS. These findings show that\nLPS signaling via CD14 and TLR4 is necessary for induction of\nexpression of these chemokines and cytokines.\n\nTLR4mt, TLR4�/�, and CD14/TLR4 double-knockout mice,\nbut not CD14�/� mice, are completely resistant to high-dose\nLPS-induced ALI. In order to determine whether the lack of a\n\nresponse seen in CD14�/� and TLR4mt mice reflected a rela-\ntive blockade rather than an absolute blockade, we tested the\nresponse to a high dose of LPS (3 mg/ml). Furthermore, LPS\ncaused significant microvascular protein leakage, an increase\nin the total WBC count, neutrophil influx into the lungs, and\nlung histopathology in CD14�/� mice at 24 h (Fig. 5A to D).\nHowever, no microvascular leakage, neutrophil influx, or lung\npathology was observed in TLR4mt mice in response to the\nhigh dose of LPS at 24 h (Fig. 5E to H). In addition, this\nCD14-independent response was not observed in TLR4-defi-\ncient mice, which had a C57BL/6 background, or in the CD14/\nTLR4 double-knockout mice, which also had a C57BL/6 back-\nground (Fig. 5C, inset). Collectively, these data suggest that\nboth CD14-dependent and -independent responses to LPS are\ntotally dependent on TLR4. We next determined the mecha-\nnisms underlying the CD14-independent signaling pathway us-\ning a CD11b-blocking Ab, since it has been shown that CD11b\nis required for LPS-induced signaling in peritoneal macro-\nphages (15). Interestingly, LPS did not induce an increase in\nneutrophils (Fig. 6A) or in lung MPO activity (Fig. 6B) in\nanti-CD11b Ab-treated CD14�/� mice, indicating that CD11b\nis responsible for the CD14-independent pathway.\n\nEffects of TLR4-blocking Ab in LPS-induced ALI. Since\nTLR4, unlike CD14, is critical for induction of ALI in mice in\nresponse to both low and high doses of LPS, we examined\nwhether it is possible to modulate TLR4 signaling in order to\nminimize ALI caused by LPS in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Ab\nblockade (20 �g/mouse) revealed that treatment of C57BL/6\nmice with Ab directed against TLR4 abrogated the neutrophil\ninflux, neutrophil sequestration in the lung, and lung pathology\ninduced by a low dose of LPS, whereas treatment with the\nisotype-matched control Ab (IgG2�) (20 �g/mouse) did not\ninfluence LPS-induced ALI (Fig. 7). In a similar fashion, LPS-\ninduced expression of KC, MIP-2, TNF-�, and IL-6 in BALF\nwas eliminated by anti-TLR4 Ab but not by the isotype-\nmatched control Ab (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, anti-TLR4 Ab\nabrogated LPS-induced histopathology at 24 h (Fig. 7). More-\nover, at the high dose of LPS, these responses were attenuated\nonly by anti-TLR4 Ab (Fig. 8A to C, F, and G). However,\nanti-TLR4 or isotype-matched control Ab alone did not influ-\nence lung histopathogy at 24 h after saline treatment (Fig. 8D\nand E).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nInfection with gram-negative bacteria may lead to develop-\nment of the sepsis syndrome as a consequence of an excessive\nhost response to LPS in humans (19, 23). One of the clinical\nfeatures associated with sepsis in humans is pulmonary inflam-\nmation resulting in ALI or ARDS, which may also reflect a\npoorly controlled inflammatory response in the lungs in re-\nsponse to LPS (12, 33, 38). Despite recent advances, statistics\nhave shown that the mortality associated with ALI remains\nhigh among humans, warranting new treatment and prevention\nstrategies (28). LPS binding to CD14 and TLR4 is critical for\ninduction of a plethora of downstream effects leading to ALI.\nA thorough understanding of the role of these molecules that\nrecognize LPS and induce its signaling cascades is critical for\ndesigning novel therapeutic and prophylactic strategies to at-\ntenuate ALI or ARDS. The present study was undertaken to\n\nFIG. 6.

In the absence of CD14, however, microvas-\ncular leakage, neutrophil influx and sequestration, and lung\nhistology with the high dose of LPS were only attenuated. In\nanti-CD11b Ab-treated CD14�/� mice, no features of ALI\nwere observed with the high dose of LPS. Furthermore, none\nof the features was present in TLR4mt mice with both low and\nhigh doses of LPS. Blockade of TLR4 with an Ab remarkably\nattenuated LPS-induced microvascular protein leakage, neu-\ntrophil influx, and lung histology with both the low and high\ndoses of LPS in normal C57BL/6 mice. These new findings\ndemonstrate that the inflammatory responses induced by LPS\nare CD14 dependent as well as CD14 independent (CD11b\ndependent), but both of these signaling cascades are entirely\ndependent on TLR4 in a mouse model. To our knowledge, we\n\ndemonstrated here for the first time that modulation of TLR4\nfunction in the lung is a useful strategy for minimizing LPS-\ninduced ALI in a mouse model.\n\nAlthough aerosolization of LPS-induced ALI is self-limiting\nin mouse models, this rodent model mimics several key fea-\ntures of human ALI and ARDS (11, 20). Our previous studies\nwith lung tissues and BALF cytospin preparations demon-\nstrated that LPS instillation into mice results in the influx of\nneutrophils and monocytes and severe inflammation in the\nlung in a time-dependent fashion within 24 h (17). In addition,\nthis model permits analysis of the roles of CD14 and TLR4\nwhen appropriate gene-deficient or mutant mouse strains are\nused.\n\nThe role of CD14 in the induction of ALI in mice has been\ndemonstrated largely by using blocking antibodies in response\nto systemic LPS or aerosolized LPS. CD14 blockade experi-\nments performed with various neutralizing antibodies resulted\nin a range of effects on lung inflammation in mice in an incon-\nsistent fashion (16, 34). These observations were probably due\nto several inherent limitations of the procedure, such as (i) the\nbinding sites of some of those antibodies are not known (34);\n\nFIG. 7. Blocking TLR4 abolishes ALI induced by a low dose of LPS, as demonstrated by the neutrophil counts in BALF (A), the MPO activity\nin the lungs at 8 and 24 h (B), the BALF cytokine profiles at 2 h (C), and the lung histopathology at 24 h after inhalation of LPS (D and E).

The precise mechanisms by which LPS in-\nduces ALI via CD14 in the lung as a whole representing several\ncell types are still debatable. Our study demonstrated that ALI\ninduced by a low dose of LPS is totally dependent on CD14;\nhowever, at a high dose of LPS, ALI is only partially mediated\nby CD14. By contrast, Andoneui et al. (3) demonstrated that\nLPS-induced neutrophil influx in the lung is entirely dependent\non CD14; the reason for the apparent discrepancy is that the\nroute of LPS administration (intraperitoneal), the dose of LPS\n(0.5 mg/kg), and the time after LPS treatment that lungs were\nharvested (4.5 h) were different in their study (3).\n\nThe potential mechanisms for the CD14-independent and\nTLR4-dependent signaling via LPS include Mac-1 (CD11b/\nCD18) (10, 15, 24) and the macrophage scavenger receptor,\nwhich are known to bind LPS and induce signaling (15). Other\nexplanations for CD14-independent and TLR4-dependent sig-\nnaling include (i) higher-affinity binding of LPS to TLR4 than\nto CD14 (1); (ii) changes in the avidity of the LPS-TLR4\n\ncomplex upon the initial LPS binding (32); (iii) the involve-\nment of heat shock proteins 70 and 90, growth differentiation\nfactor 5, and chemokine receptor 4, since these molecules form\na CD14-independent signal transduction mechanism in re-\nsponse to LPS (35); and (iv) the presence of MD-2, since a\nrecent report showed that MD-2 is a bona fide LPS-binding\nprotein that does not need the assistance of LPS-binding pro-\ntein or CD14 to induce signaling via TLR4 (36, 37). Most of\nthese mechanisms have been identified in individual cell types.\nSince the lung as a whole represents a broad spectrum of cell\ntypes, it is extremely difficult to test these possibilities in vivo.\nDespite these limitations, our results demonstrate for the first\ntime that ALI induced by a high dose of LPS in CD14�/� mice\nis totally dependent on CD11b, suggesting that this is the major\nmechanism in the CD14-independent pathway in the lung in\nresponse to LPS.\n\nLPS signaling involves interaction of LBP, CD14, MD2, and\nTLR4, although LBP, CD14, and MD-2 have no intrinsic sig-\nnaling properties (10). TLR4 is a germ line-encoded trans-\nmembrane signaling protein that recognizes microbial prod-\nucts, including E. coli LPS, and induces signaling upon binding\nto LPS (14).

On the\nother hand, another study demonstrated that factors other\nthan TLR4 were involved in the secretion of TNF-� and MIP-2\nin the lungs in response to inhaled LPS (22). However, the\nauthors postulated that this response was due to low levels of\ncontamination of the E. coli LPS used. This possibility is un-\nlikely since the present study showed that TLR4 is solely re-\nsponsible for the induction of ALI via activation of NF-�B and\nsubsequent production of cytokines.\n\nSince our results demonstrated that LPS-induced ALI is\npartially dependent on CD14 but fully dependent on TLR4, we\ndecided to determine whether TLR4 blocking is a useful strat-\negy for minimizing ALI in normal and healthy wild-type\nC57BL/6 mice. Blocking the critical first step of LPS binding to\nTLR4 by anti-TLR4 antibody was effective in attenuating ALI\nwith both low and high doses of LPS. To our knowledge, this\nis the first report showing that a TLR4-blocking antibody re-\nduces the characteristic features of ALI, including an increase\nin the total WBC count, neutrophil influx and sequestration in\nthe lung, and lung histology induced by LPS. This could serve\nas a basis for future investigations to study the role of TLR4 in\nthe pathogenesis of ALI in humans leading to pulmonary in-\nflammation and its severe form, acute respiratory distress syn-\ndrome.\n\nIn summary, the results presented here for the first time\ndemonstrate that LPS-induced host responses are entirely de-\npendent on TLR4 and are only partially dependent on CD14 in\nan in vivo mouse model. Furthermore, we found that CD11b\ncontributes to the CD14-independent pathway in the lungs in\nresponse to LPS. Collectively, these observations suggest that\nTLR4 is an attractive target for immunomodulation. Our data\nsupport that blocking the extracellular domain of TLR4 is a\nbeneficial therapeutic strategy for minimizing lung diseases in\nwhich LPS from gram-negative pathogens has been implicated\nas the primary etiological agent.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by NIH grants P50HL067671-03 and\nRR14466.\n\nWe thank Kenneth Malcolm and Mike Fessler for helpful discus-\nsions and Paul Kubes for providing the protocol for the MPO assay.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
