They play a\nfundamental role in light adaptation by coupling the rate of cGMP synthesis to the intracellular concentration of calcium.\nMutations in GCAPs lead to blindness. The importance of functional EF-hands in GCAP1 for photoreceptor cell integrity has\nbeen well established. Mutations in GCAP1 that diminish its Ca2+ binding affinity lead to cell damage by causing unabated\ncGMP synthesis and accumulation of toxic levels of free cGMP and Ca2+. We here investigate the relevance of GCAP2\nfunctional EF-hands for photoreceptor cell integrity. By characterizing transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of GCAP2\nwith all EF-hands inactivated (EF2GCAP2), we show that GCAP2 locked in its Ca2+-free conformation leads to a rapid retinal\ndegeneration that is not due to unabated cGMP synthesis. We unveil that when locked in its Ca2+-free conformation in vivo,\nGCAP2 is phosphorylated at Ser201 and results in phospho-dependent binding to the chaperone 14-3-3 and retention at\nthe inner segment and proximal cell compartments. Accumulation of phosphorylated EF\n\n2\nGCAP2 at the inner segment\n\nresults in severe toxicity. We show that in wildtype mice under physiological conditions, 50% of GCAP2 is phosphorylated\ncorrelating with the 50% of the protein being retained at the inner segment. Raising mice under constant light exposure,\nhowever, drastically increases the retention of GCAP2 in its Ca2+-free form at the inner segment. This study identifies a new\nmechanism governing GCAP2 subcellular distribution in vivo, closely related to disease. It also identifies a pathway by which\na sustained reduction in intracellular free Ca2+ could result in photoreceptor damage, relevant for light damage and for\nthose genetic disorders resulting in ‘‘equivalent-light’’ scenarios.\n\nCitation: Hoyo NL-d, López-Begines S, Rosa JL, Chen J, Méndez A (2014) Functional EF-Hands in Neuronal Calcium Sensor GCAP2 Determine Its Phosphorylation\nState and Subcellular Distribution In Vivo, and Are Essential for Photoreceptor Cell Integrity.

They confer Ca\n2+\n\n-sensitivity to\n\nguanylate-cyclase (Ret-GC) activity in retinal photoreceptor cells.\n\nGCAP1 and GCAP2 constitute the major species in mammals [1–\n\n3]. At rod and cone outer segments GCAPs form permanent\n\ncomplexes with Ret-GCs allowing short response times of cyclase\n\nmodulation to fluctuations in intracellular Ca\n2+\n\nconcentration.\n\nGCAPs inhibit cyclase activity in their Ca\n2+\n\n-loaded form at the\n\nhigh free [Ca\n2+\n\n]i characteristic of the dark steady-state, and switch\n\nto their activator state as they replace Ca\n2+\n\nby Mg\n2+\n\nwhen light\n\nreduces Ca\n2+\n\ninflux upon closing the cGMP-channels [4]. Light\n\nexposure results in up to a 10-fold decline in the intracellular free\n\n[Ca\n2+\n\n], from ,250 nM in darkness to 23 nM in saturating light in\nmouse rod outer segments [5]. This Ca\n\n2+\ndecrease is first sensed at\n\nGC/GCAP complexes comprising GCAP1 and successively at\n\nthose comprising GCAP2 [Ca\n2+\n\nEC50 for GCAP1 ,130 nM; for\nGCAP2 ,50 nM, [6]], in a sequential mode of action referred to\nas a Ca\n\n2+\n-relay model [7–9]. Altogether, the rate of cGMP\n\nsynthesis upon light exposure is stimulated up to ,12-fold over its\nbasal levels, serving to restore the cGMP levels and to reopen the\n\nchannels during the recovery of the light response and light\n\nadaptation [10,11].\n\nDespite the importance of GCAPs-mediated Ca\n2+\n\n-feedback on\n\ncGMP synthesis in the control of sensitivity, deletion of GCAP1\n\nand GCAP2 in mice does not lead to significant effects on retinal\n\nmorphology, indicating that GCAPs are not essential for the\n\ndevelopment or maintenance of retinal organization [11].\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480&domain=pdf\n\n\nHowever, mutations in the GCAP1 and GCAP2 genes have been\n\nlinked to inherited autosomal dominant retinopathies. Ten\n\nheterozygous mutations in the GUCA1A gene encoding GCAP1\n\nhave been linked to autosomal dominant cone dystrophy (adCD),\n\ncone rod dystrophy (adCRD) or macular degeneration (adMD)\n\n[12–20]. One mutation in the GUCA1B gene, G157R, has been\n\nassociated to autosomal dominant retinal dystrophies ranging from\n\nretinitis pigmentosa to macular degeneration [21].\n\nMost of GCAP1 mutations map at EF-hand domains and affect\n\nCa\n2+\n\ncoordination directly, such as D100E and N104K at EF-3 or\n\nL151F and E155G at EF-4 [13–15,20], or map at the incoming or\n\noutgoing a-helixes in EF-3 and EF-4, such as E89K, Y99C,\nT114I, I143NT and G159V, causing conformational distortions\n\nthat make Ca\n2+\n\nbinding less favorable [15,17,18]. These mutations\n\nshift the Ca\n2+\n\nIC50 of GC activation to higher free [Ca\n2+\n\n], so that\n\nin vitro the mutant proteins fail to switch to the inhibitory state\nand lead to persistent activation of RetGC in the whole\n\nphysiological range of [Ca\n2+\n\n]i [15,20,22–24]. In vivo, as demon-\nstrated for the Y99C and E155G GCAP1 mutations, the unabated\n\ncGMP synthesis results in abnormally high levels of cGMP and\n\nCa\n2+\n\nin rods, and the ensuing retinal degeneration can be\n\nsignificantly prevented by conditions that promote constitutive\n\nstimulation of PDE6 such as constant light exposure [23,25,26].\n\nThere are aspects of GCAPs that remain less understood, such\n\nas their Ca\n2+\n\n-dependent structural changes or the mechanisms\n\nthat determine their cellular distribution. GCAP1 and GCAP2 are\n\nboth myristoylated at the NH2-terminus. While myristoylation of\n\nGCAP1 not only affects the affinity of GCAP1 for Ret-GC and\n\nRet-GC maximal activation, but also increases the Ca\n2+\n\nsensitivity\n\nof Ret-GC inhibition at EF-4 [27], myristoylation of GCAP2\n\naffects its overall structural stability without affecting Ret-GC\n\nregulation [28]. Both GCAP1 and GCAP2 form homodimers\n\nupon Ca\n2+\n\ndissociation, with the capacity to dimerize in GCAP2\n\ncorrelating with the ability to activate Ret-GC [29]. However,\n\nwhile in GCAP2 dimerization is reversed by Ca\n2+\n\nbinding,\n\nGCAP1 dimerization is resistant to the presence of Ca\n2+\n\n, implying\n\na difference in their Ca\n2+\n\n-dependent conformational changes [29].\n\nOverall, the Ca\n2+\n\n-free form of GCAP2 shows a higher tendency to\n\naggregate than GCAP1. In addition, Ca\n2+\n\n-dependent conforma-\n\ntional changes in GCAP2 have been shown to correlate with a site-\n\nspecific phosphorylation at Ser201, the significance of which is not\n\nyet clear as it does not affect Ret-GC regulation in vitro [30].\nRegarding their cellular localization, GCAP1 is more abundant\n\nat cone than at rod outer segments [31]. GCAP2 localizes\n\nprimarily to rods and at lower levels in cones. In rods, GCAP2\n\nlocalization is not restricted to rod outer segments. It is present at\n\nrod inner segments at about the same level, and at lower levels in\n\nmore proximal compartments of the cell [32,33]. At the synaptic\n\nterminal GCAP2 has been shown to interact with Ribeye, the\n\nmajor structural component of synaptic ribbons, and to lead to\n\nsignificant alterations of synaptic ribbon dynamics when overex-\n\npressed in vivo [34,35]. The mechanisms that determine GCAPs\nsubcellular distribution are largely unknown, but it was proposed\n\nthat GCAPs are transported by vesicular trafficking guided by Ret-\n\nGCs, in a process assisted by RD3 [36,37].\n\nTo study whether genetic mutations or light conditions that\n\nwould preclude Ca\n2+\n\n-binding to GCAP2 would compromise rod\n\ncell viability by an analogous mechanism by which GCAP1 EF-\n\nhand mutations do, we set to study the effect of expressing in rods\n\na mutant form of GCAP2 impaired to bind Ca\n2+\n\n: GCAP2 with all\n\nfunctional EF hands inactivated (bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2) [38]. Whereas in\nvitro bEF2GCAP2 shows a similar biochemical behavior as\nY99C-GCAP1 [24,38], we show that in vivo it leads to a rapid\nretinal degeneration by a mechanism independent of cGMP\n\nmetabolism. In vivo, the protein accumulates at the inner segment,\nin a form that is largely incompetent to activate the cyclase. It\n\nbinds to 14-3-3 protein isoforms due to enhanced phosphorylation\n\nat Ser201. We show that the cause of the pathology in\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 mice is not constitutive activation of the cyclase,\n\nbut rather the accumulation of the phosphorylated protein at the\n\nproximal compartments of the cell, likely in a conformationally\n\nunstable form stabilized by 14-3-3 binding, that ultimately causes\n\nextensive damage to the cell. We propose that this mechanism will\n\ncontribute to the pathology of those inherited retinal dystrophies\n\ncaused by mutations in different genes that share as an initial\n\nconsequence of the mutation the sustained reduction of the\n\nintracellular concentration of Ca\n2+\n\n, the so-called ‘‘light-equivalent\n\ndamage’’ scenarios.\n\nResults\n\nTransgenic expression of bEF2GCAP2 in mouse rods\nleads to progressive retinal degeneration\n\nTo study the relevance of functional EF-hand domains in\n\nGCAP2 for protein activity and photoreceptor cell integrity in\nvivo, we expressed a mutant form of GCAP2 with inactivated EF\nhands: GCAP2(E80Q/E116Q/D158N), hereafter referred to as\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2, in the rod photoreceptors of transgenic mice\n\n(Fig. 1A). It was previously shown that inactivation of the three\n\nfunctional EF hands in bGCAP2 abolishes its capacity to bind\n\nCa\n2+\n\n[38]. To generate transgenic mice we expressed the cDNA of\n\nthe bovine GCAP2 isoform, so that the transgene product could be\n\ndistinguished from the endogenous murine form by SDS-PAGE\n\nelectrophoretic mobility. To discriminate the effect of the\n\nmutations in GCAP2 from the effect that overexpression of\n\nGCAP2 might have on the cell, we included in the study a control\n\ntransgenic line that expresses wildtype bovine GCAP2 (line E,\n\nFig. 1A,B). This line was reported to express wildtype bovine\n\nGCAP2 at a ,2:1 ratio relative to endogenous GCAP2 [11].\nWe established two independent transgenic lines that expressed\n\ndifferent levels of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2. Line A expressed bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 at\n\na ratio of 2.76:1 relative to endogenous GCAP2, whereas line B\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nVisual perception is initiated at retinal photoreceptor cells,\nwhere light activates an enzymatic cascade that reduces\nfree cGMP. As cGMP drops, cGMP-channels close and\nreduce the inward current –including Ca2+ influx– so that\nphotoreceptors hyperpolarize and emit a signal. As the\nlight extinguishes, cGMP levels are restored to reestablish\nsensitivity. cGMP synthesis relies on guanylate cyclase/\nguanylate cyclase activating protein (RetGC/GCAP) com-\nplexes. GCAPs link the rate of cGMP synthesis to\nintracellular Ca\n\n2+\nlevels, by switching between a Ca\n\n2+\n-free\n\nstate that activates cGMP synthesis during light exposure,\nand a Ca2+-bound state that arrests cGMP synthesis in the\ndark. It is established that GCAP1 mutations linked to\nadCORD disrupt this tight Ca2+ control of the cGMP levels.\nWe here show that a GCAP2 functional transition from the\nCa2+-free to the Ca2+-loaded form is essential for photo-\nreceptor cell integrity, by a non-related mechanism. We\nshow that GCAP2 locked in its Ca2+-free form is retained by\nphosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding to the proximal rod\ncompartments, causing severe cell damage. This study\nidentifies a pathway by which a sustained reduction in\nintracellular free Ca2+ could result in photoreceptor\ndamage, relevant for light damage and for those genetic\ndisorders resulting in ‘‘equivalent-light’’ scenarios.\n\nToxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca\n2+\n\n-Free Form\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480\n\n\n\nToxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca\n2+\n\n-Free Form\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 3 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480\n\n\n\nhad a higher relative level of expression (3.85:1 ratio), Fig. 1B and\n\nFig. S1, see Methods.\n\nTo assess whether bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 expression in rods causes\n\ncompensatory changes in the expression levels of other proteins\n\ninvolved in cGMP metabolism, we compared the level of\n\nexpression of PDE6 and Ret-GCs in retinal homogenates from\n\nwildtype and transgenic mice from lines A and B (Fig. 1C).

Figure 1D shows normal retinal morphology in\n\nthe control transgenic line E at p40 and at 3 months of age. In\n\ncontrast, clear signs of retinal degeneration were observed in mice\n\nexpressing bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 from lines A and B. Mice from line B,\n\nwhich express the highest levels of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2, presented a\n\nsubstantial shortening of rod outer segments and a noticeable\n\nreduction of outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness as early as p40,\n\nwith ONL thickness reduced to 6–7 rows of nuclei. Mice from line\n\nA showed a slower progression of the disease, noticeable at 3\n\nmonths, when the ONL thickness was reduced to 7–9 rows of\n\nnuclei.\n\nBecause expression of wildtype bGCAP2 did not cause retinal\n\ndegeneration for up to one year of age in line E (results not shown),\n\nthe retinal degeneration observed in mice from lines A and B likely\n\nresults from distinctive properties of the mutant form of GCAP2\n\nimpaired to bind Ca\n2+\n\n. However, due to the different transgene\n\nexpression levels, we could not exclude that the observed\n\nphenotype may result from overexpression of bGCAP2. To rule\n\nout this possibility, we bred the control line E to homozygosity, to\n\nobtain a line that expressed bGCAP2 to equivalent levels as\n\nmutant line A. This line showed normal outer segment length and\n\norganization, as well as normal outer nuclear layer thickness for up\n\nto six months of age when raised in cyclic light [34]. From these\n\nresults we conclude that mutations that impair Ca\n2+\n\nbinding in\n\nGCAP2 lead to retinal degeneration in vivo.\n\nRetinal degeneration by bEF2GCAP2 is reproduced in the\nGCAPs 2/2 background, and correlates with the loss of\nvisual function\n\nIn order to study the effects of the mutant protein on cell\n\nphysiology, we bred the transgenic lines to GCAPs2/2 mice, to\n\nobtain expression of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 or control bGCAP2 in the\n\nabsence of the endogenous protein.\n\nThe relative levels of expression of the transgene in the\n\nindependent transgenic lines were maintained in the GCAPs2/2\n\nbackground (Fig. 2A). Expression of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 in the\n\nGCAPs2/2 background slightly accelerated the rate of retinal\n\ndegeneration observed in the GCAPs+/+ background. Mice from\nthe control lines GCAPs2/2 and GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 E\n\nshowed largely normal retinas with an outer nuclear layer (ONL)\n\nthickness of 10 rows of nuclei for up to 5 months of age (Fig. 2B),\n\nand preserved normal visual function when raised in cyclic light\n\nconditions as assessed by electroretinogram (ERG) [34]. In\n\ncontrast, GCAPs2/2 expressing bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 showed a pro-\n\ngressive retinal degeneration that correlated with loss of visual\n\nfunction (Fig. S2). In retinas from line B the ONL was reduced to\n\nsix rows of nuclei and outer segments were much shorter than\n\nnormal as early as p30 (Fig. 2B), when the A and B-wave\n\namplitudes of ERG responses were half the size of normal\n\nresponses from littermate controls (not shown). At 3 months of age\n\nthe ONL was reduced to 4 rows of nuclei, and by 5 months it was\n\nlimited to a single row. Mice were unresponsive to light (flat ERG\n\ntraces) by 7 months (Fig. S2). A slightly slower retinal degeneration\n\nwas observed in mice from line A that went from a normal outer\n\nnuclear layer thickness of 12 rows of nuclei at p30 to about 5 rows\n\nby 3 months of age. ERG responses of these mice resembled\n\nnormal responses at very early ages, but A- and B-wave amplitudes\n\nwere reduced by half by 4 months, correlating with a dramatic cell\n\nloss in these mice between p20 and 5 months of age (Fig. 2B and\n\nFig. S2). Most of these mice are non responsive to light by ERG by\n\n7–8 months (Fig. S2).\n\nbEF2GCAP2 protein accumulates in inactive form at the\ninner segment of the cell\n\nIn vitro studies have shown that recombinant bEF2GCAP2\nleads to maximal activation of Ret-GCs in reconstitution studies\n\nFigure 3. Guanylate cyclase activity in retinal homogenates of\ntransgenic mice at 0 mM [Ca2+] and 2 mM [Ca2+]. Guanylate cyclase\nactivity (pmol cGMP/min.mg prot) was determined in WT, GCAPs2/2,\nGCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line E and GCAPs2/2 bEF\n\n2\nGCAP2 line A retinal\n\nextracts at 0 mM [Ca2+] or 2 mM [Ca2+] conditions, in the absence or\npresence of 3 mM recombinant GCAP2. In WT retinal homogenates at\n0 mM [Ca2+] the endogenous GCAPs activate RetGC activity about 8-fold\nover the activity at 2 mM [Ca2+]. This stimulation of RetGC activity at\n0 mM [Ca2+] is lost in GCAPs2/2 retinal homogenates, but restored in\nthe GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line E, which indicates that the control bGCAP2\nprotein expressed in vivo as a transgene is active in these assays.\nHowever, retinal homogenates from GCAPs2/2bEF2GCAP2 line A mice\nshowed greatly reduced RetGC activity at 0 mM [Ca2+] and no activity at\n2 mM [Ca2+] conditions. Addition of 3 mM recombinant GCAP2 elicited\nactivation of RetGC at 0 mM [Ca2+] in all retinal homogenates, indicating\nthe presence of functional RetGC in all samples. These results show that\nbEF\n\n2\nGCAP2 was present, but mostly inactive, in GCAPs2/2bEF\n\n2\nGCAP2\n\nline A retinal homogenates.

To assay whether the transgenic bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2\n\nprotein has the capacity to activate Ret-GC activity in retinal\n\nextracts from mice in a similar manner as in in vitro studies we\nperformed guanylate cyclase activity assays in retinal extracts from\n\nthe mutant or control mice obtained prior to significant retinal\n\ndegeneration -between p20 and p30 - under conditions of 0 Ca\n2+\n\nor 2 mM Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Ca2+-dependent modulation of Ret-GC\nactivity was observed in retinal homogenates from wildtype mice\n\nand control GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 E line. As expected, the Ca\n2+\n\n-\n\nsensitive guanylate cyclase activity was undetectable in\n\nGCAPs2/2 retinal extracts, indicating that the guanylate cyclase\n\nactivity that is measurable in whole mouse retinal extracts\n\noriginates essentially from photoreceptor cells in a GCAPs-\n\ndependent manner. As a control for the presence of functional\n\nRet-GCs in retinal extracts, guanylate cyclase activity was also\n\nmeasured after addition of 3 mM recombinant bGCAP2, which\nrestored robust activity in a Ca\n\n2+\ndependent manner. Surprisingly,\n\nretinal extracts from GCAPs2/2 bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 B mice resem-\n\nbled those of GCAPs2/2. They showed little detectable retGC\n\nactivity at either 0 Ca\n2+\n\nor high Ca\n2+\n\n. Even though the levels of\n\nRet-GCs and bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 were reduced to some extent in these\n\nretinal extracts due to the shortening of the rod outer segments in\n\nthis line, the addition of recombinant bGCAP2 showed that there\n\nwas functional Ret-GCs in these extracts at levels that were\n\nsufficient to elicit a measurable activity. The results shown are the\n\naverage of four independent experiments. These results indicate\n\nthat while the transgenic bGCAP2 control protein expressed in the\n\nGCAPs2/2 background reproduced normal activity, the trans-\n\ngenic mutant form of bGCAP2 impaired to bind Ca\n2+\n\nshowed\n\nvery little detectable activity in vivo.\nTo study whether the bEF\n\n2\nGCAP2 protein reproduced the\n\nlocalization pattern of endogenous GCAP2 in transgenic mice, we\n\nimmunostained GCAP2 in retinal cryosections. Whereas trans-\n\ngenic bGCAP2 in the control line mimicked the localization of\n\nendogenous GCAP2 in wildtype retinas (staining the outer\n\nsegment, inner segment, cytosol of outer nuclear layer and outer\n\nplexiform layers of the retina, with the signal being most intense at\n\nrod outer segments); this pattern was shifted in the case of\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2, with the signal being most intense at the rod\n\nproximal compartments, particularly at the inner segment layer\n\n(Fig. 4). These results show that bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2, when expressed in\n\nthe GCAPs2/2 background, tend to accumulate at the metabolic\n\ncompartment of the cell.\n\nThese results indicate that bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 in the retinas of\n\ntransgenic mice has a greatly reduced capacity to activate the\n\ncyclase and accumulates at the inner segment of the cell, indicating\n\nthat the pathology in these mice does not result from unabated\n\ncGMP synthesis. Furthermore, the retinal degeneration in\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 mice could not be prevented by raising the mice\n\nin constant light exposure that would counteract the increase in\n\ncGMP synthesis by continuous cGMP hydrolysis (Fig. S3), as was\n\nthe case in Y99C-GCAP1 mice [26].\n\nTaken together, these results point to a mechanism independent\n\nof cGMP metabolism as the molecular basis for the neurodegen-\n\neration in these mice.\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 protein is phosphorylated to high levels in\nvivo and binds to 14-3-3 in a phosphorylation-dependent\nmanner\n\nWe reasoned that the accumulation of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 at the\n\nproximal compartments of the cell rather than its absence at the\n\nrod outer segment was the cause of the progressive retinal\n\ndegeneration in these mice, given that the absence of GCAP1 and\n\nGCAP2 in GCAPs2/2 mice does not affect gross retinal\n\nmorphology [11]. To address why bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 fails to be\n\ndistributed to the rod outer segment and how its retention and\n\naccumulation at the inner segment leads to toxicity, we\n\ninvestigated the protein-protein interactions that the mutant form\n\nof the protein establishes in a specific manner. Immunoprecipi-\n\ntation assays were conducted with an anti-GCAP2 monoclonal\n\nantibody cross-linked to magnetic beads, using Triton X100-\n\nsolubilized whole retinal extracts from GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 E\n\nand GCAPs2/2 bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 B mice. Retinal extracts from\n\nGCAPs2/2 mice were carried to define the background. The\n\npool of proteins immunoprecipitated in each case was identified by\n\ndirectly subjecting the elution fractions to trypsin-digestion and\n\nliquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis (LC-\n\nMS/MS). We searched for proteins identified in the GCAPs2/2\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 B sample with an spectral counting at least 1.5-fold\n\nover the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 control lines).\n\nWe found that only the distinct isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins fulfilled\n\nFigure 4. bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 mislocalizes in transgenic retinas, accumulating at the inner segment compartment of the cell.

However, in\nGCAPs2/2 bEF2GCAP2 line B the pattern of staining is shifted, with the GCAP2 signal being much stronger at the inner segment and proximal\ncompartments of the cell than at the outer segment. os, outer segment; is, inner segment; onl, outer nuclear layer.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480.g004\n\nToxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca\n2+\n\n-Free Form\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 6 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480\n\n\n\nthese criteria, being identified with a considerably higher number\n\nof peptides [1.33 to 3.2-fold higher] in the GCAPs2/2bEF\n2\n\nG-\n\nCAP2 B than in control samples in at least two independent\n\nexperiments (Table 1).

We\n\nfirst reproduced the observation that GCAP2 can be phosphor-\n\nylated in vitro by PKG, with Ca2+-free bGCAP2 being a better\nsubstrate for the kinase than Ca\n\n2+\n-loaded bGCAP2 (Fig. 5A).\n\nSubsequently, we used recombinant bGCAP2 or bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 in\n\nin vitro phosphorylation reactions with PKG to generate\nphosphorylated-bGCAP2 or mock-treated bGCAP2 for pull-down\n\nassays with bovine whole retinal homogenates (Fig. 5B). As seen in\n\nFig. 5C, 14-3-3 showed preferential binding to the phosphorylated\n\nform of bGCAP2 or bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 in two independent experi-\n\nments.\n\nThe observations that 14-3-3 binds more efficiently to bEF\n2\n\nG-\n\nCAP2 than to bGCAP2 in vivo and that 14-3-3 binds to bGCAP2\nin a phosphorylation dependent manner, together with the\n\nreported higher efficiency of GCAP2 phosphorylation in its\n\nCa\n2+\n\n-free rather than its Ca\n2+\n\n-bound conformational state led us\n\nto hypothesize that bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 might be abnormally phosphor-\n\nylated in the living cell. To test this hypothesis we performed a\n32\n\nPi\n-metabolic labeling of GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 retinas in situ, followed by GCAP2 immunoprecip-\nitation and SDS-PAGE analysis. Following the incorporation of\n32\n\nPi into the retinas of dark-adapted mice for 2 h, retinas were\n\neither kept in darkness or exposed to 5 min of bright white light\n\nand immediately subjected to Triton X100-solubilization and\n\nGCAP2 immunoprecipitation. GCAPs2/2 retinas were carried\n\nas a negative control.\n\nFig. 6A shows equal fractions of the Triton X100-solubilized\n\nretinas after\n32\n\nPi-incorporation and 5 min dark- or light-exposure.\n\nThe overall pattern of bands in this panel shows that incorporation\n\nof\n32\n\nPi into the ATP pool of the retina occurred at comparable levels\n\nin all samples, allowing the detection of phosphorylated proteins\n\nand changes in the overall phosphorylation pattern caused by light\n\n(e.g. the light-dependent phosphorylation of rhodopsin is observed\n\nat 35–37 kDa). GCAP2 phosphorylation could not be detected in\n\nwhole retinal extracts, so these samples were used as inputs for the\n\nGCAP2 immunoprecipitation assay shown in Fig. 6B. GCAP2 was\n\nphosphorylated to low levels in the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 sample\n\nin the dark, and to a slightly higher extent when the retina was\n\nexposed to light. No 24 kDa bands were observed in the\n\nGCAPs2/2 samples. Strikingly high levels of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2\n\nphosphorylation were observed in GCAPs2/2 bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2\n\nsamples (lines A and B). A GCAP2 immunoblot of the\n32\n\nP-labeled\n\nmembrane confirmed that comparable levels of GCAP2 were\n\nimmunoprecipitated in GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 samples (Fig. 6C). Fig. 6D shows the subsequent\n\nimmunostaining of the 14-3-3 pan and epsilon isoforms in the same\n\nmembrane, further confirming the selective binding of 14-3-3 to the\n\nphosphorylated mutant form of GCAP2 impaired to bind Ca\n2+\n\n.\n\nGCAP2 phosphorylation was further characterized by isoelec-\n\ntrofocusing gel analysis followed by immunoblotting with a\n\nGCAP2 antibody (Fig. 7).

The intensity of the 4.85 band\n\nwas greatly diminished when NaF, a broad phosphatase inhibitor,\n\nwas omitted from the samples, thus confirming the identity of this\n\nband as phosphorylated GCAP2 (Fig. 7A).

Upper panel shows an autoradiograph of\n\n33\nP phosphorylation products from an in vitro\n\nphosphorylation reaction of recombinant wildtype bGCAP2 or bEF2GCAP2 with protein kinase G (PKG), in the presence or absence of free Ca2+. The\n20 ml reaction mixture contained 8.5 mg of purified recombinant wildtype bGCAP2 or bEF2GCAP2, purified PKGIa (100 units, Calbiochem) and 3 mCi\nof 33P- cATP in phosphorylation reaction buffer, containing either CaCl2 or EGTA (see Methods). After incubation, reaction mixtures were resolved by\n15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Lower panel shows immunostained GCAP2. Recombinant bGCAP2 or bEF\n\n2\nGCAP2\n\nprotein were present to similar amounts in all reaction tubes. B. In vitro phosphorylated or mock-treated bGCAP2 and bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 were generated\nfor pull-down assays. Phosphorylation reactions were performed as above, in the presence of EGTA, except that cGMP was added to 500 mM (+ lanes)\nor not added (2 lanes). Immunostaining of GCAP2 in the same nitrocellulose membrane shows the GCAP2 monomer at 25 kDa and upper bands\ncorresponding to dimers and multimers of GCAP2, observed to a higher extent in the EF2GCAP2 lanes. Molecular mass (MW) markers (Precision Plus\nProtein Standards, BioRad) are 20, 25, 37, 50, 75, 100 and 150 kDa. Experiment shown in duplicate. C. The 14-3-3 protein isoforms bind more\nefficiently to phosphorylated bGCAP2 and bEF2GCAP2 than to unphosphorylated counterparts. Phosphorylated or mock- proteins were cross-liked\nto magnetic beads and pull-down assays were performed with whole bovine retinal extracts obtained in 1% Triton-X100. Panels show the input and\nbound fractions for the indicated phospho- or mock-proteins, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE.

If we presume that GCAP2 is preferentially\n\nphosphorylated during periods of light exposure when in its Ca\n2+\n\n-\n\nfree conformation, these results may indicate that a few hours of\n\ndark- or light-adaptation are not enough to have a noticeable\n\neffect on the overall GCAP2 population. This would not be\n\nsurprising if only newly synthesized GCAP2 was subjected to the\n\nkinase/phosphatase regulation (see Discussion).\n\nIsoelectrofocusing of retinal samples from GCAPs2/2\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 were performed to\n\nassay the steady-state relative levels of non-phosphorylated and\n\nphosphorylated GCAP2 (Fig. 7C). Whereas endogenous GCAP2\n\nin wildtype C57/B6 mice showed similar proportions of non-\n\nphosphorylated and phosphorylated GCAP2, the GCAPs2/2\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 sample showed a larger fraction of phosphorylated\n\nGCAP2 and the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 sample showed the\n\nreverse: a larger fraction of non-phosphorylated GCAP2. These\n\nresults are consistent with the metabolic labeling results, namely,\n\nlow levels of phosphorylation in the GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 control\n\nline, and much higher phosphorylation levels in the GCAPs2/2\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 line (Fig. 7C and Fig. 6B).\n\nTo address whether 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated GCAP2\n\nmight be the cause of its retention at inner segments, we analyzed\n\nthe localization of the 14-3-3 proteins in retinal sections from\n\nGCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 samples.\n\nFig. 8 shows that 14-3-3 epsilon localizes to all cell layers of the\n\nretina; the ganglion cell layer, the inner cell layer and the\n\nphotoreceptor cell layer of the retina. In photoreceptor cells it\n\nappears to distribute to the inner segment, the perinuclear region\n\nand the synaptic terminal, but it is excluded from the outer\n\nsegment. This isoform of 14-3-3 colocalized with GCAP2 mainly\n\nat the inner segment of GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 samples, but also to\n\nthe perinuclear region and synaptic terminals in the GCAPs2/2\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 samples. From these results we infer that the\n\nlocalization pattern of 14-3-3e in photoreceptor cells would be\nconsistent with a role of GCAP2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3\n\nbinding at retaining the mutant form of GCAP2 impaired to bind\n\nCa\n2+\n\nat the proximal compartments of the cell.\n\nPhosphorylation at Ser201 is required for the retention of\nbEF2GCAP2 at the proximal compartments of the\nphotoreceptor cell in vivo\n\nTo address whether phosphorylation of GCAP2 is what causes\n\nthe retention of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 at the inner segment and proximal\n\ncompartments of the cell, we expressed a mutant form of\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 in which Ser201 was mutated to Gly as a transient\n\ntransgene in rod cells, given that Ser201 is the only residue that\n\nwas found to be phosphorylated in GCAP2 [30].\n\nThe bS201G/EF\n2\n\nGCAP2 cDNA was expressed under the rod\n\nopsin promoter by subretinal injection and in vivo electroporation\nof the DNA in neonatal GCAPs2/2 mice as described [40]. Both\n\nbGCAP2 and bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 cDNAs were carried out in parallel in\n\norder to compare the localization of the mutants under equivalent\n\nexperimental conditions. A plasmid expressing the green fluores-\n\ncent protein (GFP) under the Ubiquitin C promoter was coinjected\n\nto identify the region around the injection site in which DNA\n\ntransfection was efficient, and electroporated retinas were\n\nanalyzed at p28.\n\nFigure 7.

Transient expression of\nwildtype bGCAP2 by electroporation reproduced the reported localization pattern in the stable transgenic line, namely, its almost equal distribution\nbetween the inner and outer segments (panels A–C, profile for cell N.3). bEF2GCAP2 was mostly retained at the inner segments, being excluded from\nouter segments (panels D–F, and profile for cell N.6), which also reproduced the observation from the stable bEF2GCAP2 transgenic lines.

These genetic\n\ndisorders that ultimately cause an effect similar to continuous\n\nlight exposure, are collectively referred to as ‘‘equivalent-light’’\n\ndisorders [43]. Therefore, if GCAP2 was retained at the inner\n\nsegment under constant illumination conditions, it would be an\n\nindication that this pathway could contribute to the pathology of\n\nthese disorders.\n\nWildtype mice were exposed to constant fluorescent light\n\n(700 lux), or kept in dark cabinets for thirty days, and GCAP2\n\nsubcellular distribution was analyzed by immunofluorescence\n\n(Fig. 10). The percentage of GCAP2 co-localizing with rhodopsin\n\nwas quantified in four mice per condition. After 30 days of light\n\nexposure 84% of GCAP2 was retained at the inner segment, in\n\ncontrast to 45% of GCAP2 retained in mice kept for 30 d in\n\nconstant darkness, P#0,0001 (histogram Fig. 10).\n\nThese results show that a sustained drop in [Ca\n2+\n\n]i in wildtype\n\nrod photoreceptors causes GCAP2 retention at the inner segment.\n\nThis, together with the results obtained from bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2\n\ntransgenic mice showing that accumulation of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 at\n\nthe inner segment results in toxicity, points to the sustained\n\nretention of Ca\n2+\n\n-free GCAP2 at the inner segment as a pathway\n\nthat could contribute to the pathology of ‘‘light-equivalent’’\n\ndisorders.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPrecluding Ca\n2+\n\nbinding to GCAP2 in vivo leads to retinal\ndegeneration\n\nWe here report that a form of GCAP2 with mutations that impair\n\nCa\n2+\n\ncoordination at the three functional EF-loops (bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2)\n\nled to retinal degeneration when expressed in rods in transgenic\n\nmice. In vitro the bEF2GCAP2 mutant shows a similar shift in Ca2+\n\nsensitivity of guanylate cyclase regulation as the Y99C, E155G and\n\nother GCAP1 mutants that directly or indirectly affect Ca\n2+\n\ncoordination [22,24,38]. These GCAP1 mutants have been\n\ndemonstrated to cause retinal degeneration in vivo by leading to\npersistent activation of the cyclase, causing elevated levels of cGMP\n\nand Ca\n2+\n\n[23,25,26]. Intriguingly, we found that the retinal\n\ndegeneration caused by bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 expression in rods was\n\nindependent of cGMP metabolism. When guanylate cyclase activity\n\nwas measured in retinal homogenates from bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 trans-\n\ngenic mice, instead of constitutive activation of the cyclase we found\n\nvery diminished cyclase activity independently of the [Ca\n2+\n\n]\n\nconditions, which contrasts with the normal cyclase activity\n\nobserved in homogenates of wildtype and bGCAP2 control-\n\ntransgenic mice (Fig. 3). Furthermore, retinal degeneration in\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 transgenic mice could not be prevented or delayed by\n\nraising the mice under constant light exposure (Fig. S3). These\n\nresults show for the first time that functional EF-hands in GCAP2\n\nare required for photoreceptor cell integrity in vivo, by a\nmechanism independent of guanylate cyclase regulation.\n\nPhosphorylation of GCAP2 and 14-3-3 binding as a new\nin vivo mechanism controlling GCAP2 subcellular\ndistribution that causes toxicity when overly deregulated\n\nIn contrast to the bGCAP2 control-transgenic protein that\n\nreproduced the endogenous mGCAP2 subcellular localization,\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 largely accumulated at inner segment and proximal\n\ncompartments of the rod when it was expressed in the\n\nGCAPs2/2 background (Fig. 4). At this compartment, bEF\n2\n\nG-\n\nCAP2 was phosphorylated to a much higher extent than the\n\ncontrol transgenic protein in in situ phosphorylation assays as well\n\nas under steady state conditions in the intact rod as shown by IEF,\n\nand it was found to bind 14-3-3 proteins (Table 1, Figs. 5–7). This\n\nconstitutes the first report that GCAP2 is phosphorylated in vivo,\nat much higher levels when locked in its Ca\n\n2+\n-free conformation,\n\nand that phosphorylation of GCAP2 triggers 14-3-3 binding. We\n\nshow that 14-3-3 localization in rod photoreceptors is restricted to\n\nproximal compartments and excluded from the outer segments\n\n(Fig. 8). Furthermore, we demonstrate that phosphorylation is\n\nrequired for bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 retention at proximal compartments by\n\nshowing that replacing Ser201 by Gly in bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 substan-\n\ntially reverts this retention (Fig. 9). On average 57% of bS201G/\n\nEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 localized to rod outer segments (Fig. 10 histogram\n\nand Fig. S4, n = 13 cells). We believe that the reason that a 100%\n\nreversion was not observed is that 14-3-3 shows some affinity for\n\nunphosphorylated bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 as well (Fig. 5). We therefore\n\ninfer that 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated GCAP2 retains the\n\nprotein at proximal compartments, in what clearly represents an\n\nimportant step in the regulation of GCAP2 subcellular distribution\n\nin vivo, somewhat analogous to 14-3-3 regulation of phosducin\navailability during dark and light adaptation.\n\n14-3-3 proteins are a family of phosphobinding proteins of\n\nabout 30 kDa that comprises seven homologs in mammals. They\n\nexist as homo- or hetero-dimers that are rigid in structure, with\n\neach 14-3-3 dimer binding to two different phospho-binding sites\n\neither in the same or in two independent target proteins. By\n\nmasking an epitope, clasping epitopes or promoting the scaffolding\n\nof their clients, 14-3-3 proteins exert a diverse range of regulatory\n\nroles in metabolism, trafficking or integration of cell survival versus\n\ncell death pathways [39]. In the retina, 14-3-3 proteins interact\n\nwith phosducin at rod inner segments, regulating the amount of\n\nfree phosducin during dark- and light-adaptation [44,45].\n\nPhosducin modulates the amount of Trabc heterotrimer through\n\ncompetition with Gta subunit for binding to the Gtbc complex.\n\nWhen light exposure activates Gt, releasing Gtbc from Gta at rod\n\nouter segments, phosducin association to Gtbc facilitates Gta and\n\nPd-Gtbc independent translocation to the inner segment compart-\n\nment [46]. At the inner segment during dark-adaptation\n\nphosducin is simultaneously phosphorylated at Ser-54 and Ser-\n\n73 residues by PKA and CaMK, which causes a competing\n\ninteraction with the 14-3-3 protein that dramatically reduces\n\nphosducin binding to Gtbc [47]. This allows the redistribution of\n\nGta and Gtbc to rod outer segments, the former assisted by\n\nUNC119 and the latter by PrBP [48,49]. At rod outer segments Tr\n\nsubunits are discharged to membranes and a heterotrimer forms\n\nagain.\n\nHow 14-3-3 binding to phosphorylated GCAP2 fits with\n\nGCAP2 overall role in photoreceptor cell physiology and inherited\n\nretinal dystrophies is only emerging. It is clear from this work that\n\nGCAP2 is phosphorylated preferentially in its Ca\n2+\n\n-free form in\nvivo. Because it is well established that GCAP2 in its Ca2+-free\nform forms dimers [29], and that 14-3-3 exists as dimers that bind\n\nto two consensus binding sites in client proteins [39], it seems\n\nstraightforward to propose that a dimer of 14-3-3 would bind to a\n\ndimer of GCAP2, presumably to stabilize it (Fig. 11). Because\n\nGCAP1 and GCAP2, unlike recoverin or phosducin, were shown\n\nnot to redistribute between subcellular compartments during dark-\n\nor light-adaptation [50], we deduce that this mechanism would\n\nmainly affect the cytosolic distribution of newly synthesized\n\nprotein.\n\nWe propose a model in which the GCAP2 molecules\n\nsynthesized during the dark period (predominantly in the Ca\n2+\n\n-\n\nloaded state) would bind to RetGC and be transported to rod\n\nouter segments, whereas the GCAP2 molecules synthesized in the\n\nlight period (GCAP2 in its Ca\n2+\n\n-free state) would be phosphor-\n\nToxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca\n2+\n\n-Free Form\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 13 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480\n\n\n\nylated and retained at proximal compartments by 14-3-3 binding\n\n(Fig. 11). Such a scenario would result in the phosphorylation and\n\nretention to proximal compartments of about 50% of GCAP2\n\nmolecules in a physiological situation (wildtype mice raised in\n\nstandard cyclic light). This is what we observe by IEF (Fig. 7) and\n\nby immunolocalization analysis (Fig. 4). This model would also\n\nexplain why 12 h of dark-adaptation did not have a noticeable\n\neffect on the steady-state phosphorylation levels of GCAP2 (Fig. 7).\n\nThe model would predict that wildtype mice reared under\n\nconstant light exposure for a period of time covering the complete\n\nrenewal of the rod outer segment would result in massive GCAP2\n\nretention at the inner segment, given that GCAP2 would always\n\nbe synthesized in a context of low [Ca\n2+\n\n]i, and that is precisely\n\nwhat we have observed after exposing mice to constant light for\n\n30 days (Fig. 10). In contrast, it would be predicted that wildtype\n\nmice reared in constant darkness would result in GCAP2 major\n\nlocalization to the rod outer segment layer. This, however, was\n\nnot observed. In mice reared in darkness for 30 days GCAP2\n\ndistributed about equally between inner and outer segment\n\nlayers (Fig. 10). We interpret this result as an indication that\n\nsome of the protein interactions required for GCAP2 transport\n\nto the rod outer segment (e.g. RetGC, RD3) might be rate-\n\nlimiting.\n\nWe propose that GCAP2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding\n\nconstitute a major molecular determinant of GCAP2 subcellular\n\nlocalization upon its synthesis. What is its physiological relevance?\n\nA possibility is that 14-3-3 binding to GCAP2, by trapping\n\nGCAP2 to proximal compartments, might work to secure a\n\nreservoir of GCAP2 at these compartments, where GCAP2 may\n\nbe exerting other roles, e.g. at the synaptic terminal [34,35].\n\nAlternatively, the 14-3-3 trapping of Ca\n2+\n\n-free GCAP2 upon its\n\nphosphorylation might serve as a protein quality control mecha-\n\nnism, to avoid that an excess of Ca\n2+\n\n-free, aggregation-prone\n\nGCAP2 molecules would reach the rod outer segment. Irrespec-\n\ntive of its physiological significance, this regulatory enzymatic step\n\nis specific of GCAP2, given that GCAP1 is not phosphorylated,\n\nand might have evolved because it is more relevant for rods than\n\ncones. Conditions that substantially alter this regulatory mecha-\n\nnism increasing the protein retention at the inner segment of the\n\nCa\n2+\n\n-free form would have toxic consequences for the cell. We\n\npropose that toxicity in this scenario would arise from GCAP2\n\nnatural tendency to aggregate (see below).\n\nFigure 10.

We hypothesize that\n\naccumulation of these complexes might result in pathology due to\n\nthe formation of misfolded GCAP2 oligomers, in much a similar\n\nway to which synuclein, APP, Tau, Huntingtin or ataxin lead to\n\nneuronal cell death in Parkinson’s (PD), Alzheimer (AD),\n\nHuntington’s (HD) or spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) diseases.\n\nGCAP2 shows a natural tendency to aggregate. Structural studies\n\nhave shown that the Ca\n2+\n\n-free form of GCAP proteins, and\n\nparticularly of GCAP2, are difficult to maintain in solution and are\n\nprone to aggregation [51]. When expressed in bacteria,\n\nrecombinant GCAP2 accumulates in inclusion bodies, is only\n\nsolubilized at high concentrations of guanidinium or urea, and is\n\ndifficult to maintain in solution after refolding [1]. Dimers and\n\nhigh molecular weight aggregates can typically be distinguished by\n\nSDS-PAGE, more prominently for EF\n2\n\nGCAP2 than for the\n\nwildtype form of the protein (e.g. this study, Fig. 5B). On the other\n\nhand, previous studies have found a close association between 14-\n\n3-3 and progressive neurodegenerative diseases. 14-3-3 proteins\n\nhave been shown to colocalize with AD neurofibrillary tangles that\n\nare composed primarily of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins\n\n[52,53]. In PD, 14-3-3 is detectable in Lewy bodies which\n\naccumulate a-synuclein [54]; and 14-3-3 colocalization was also\nreported for mutant ataxin in SCA [55]. Furthermore, 14-3-3 zeta\n\nand epsilon binding to phosphorylated ataxin-1 at S776 was\n\nshown to aggravate neurodegeneration by stabilizing mutant\n\nataxin, retarding its degradation and enhancing its aggregation in\n\ntransfected cells and transgenic flies [55]. The requirement of 14-\n\n3-3 zeta for Htt86Q aggregate formation has also been established\n\nin cells [56].\n\nWe propose that the mutant form of GCAP2 locked in its Ca\n2+\n\n-\n\nfree conformation results in toxicity in vivo by the progressive\nformation of soluble high molecular weight oligomers of GCAP2-\n\n14-3-3 that are toxic for the cell. Inclusion bodies were not\n\ndetected in our immunofluorescence assays with the polyclonal or\n\nmonoclonal anti-GCAP2 antibodies used, or the anti-14-3-3e\nmonoclonal antibody. It may happen that these antibodies do not\n\nFigure 11. Model depicting a mechanism regulating GCAP2 distribution in rods involving GCAP2 phosphorylation and 14-3-3\nbinding. Under high Ca\n\n2+\nconditions typical of the dark-steady state, the Ca\n\n2+\n-loaded form of GCAP2 would bind to Ret-GC and be transported to\n\nrod outer segments (left sketch); whereas under low Ca2+ conditions (e.g. light periods), the Ca2+-free form of GCAP2 would be retained by 14-3-3 at\nproximal compartments (middle). These alternating scenarios would result in approximately half of GCAP2 distributing to the inner segment and\nproximal compartments of the cell, and half to the outer segment compartment in a physiological situation (e.g. in wildtype mice raised in standard\ncyclic light). However, a prolonged light exposure or genetic conditions that would result in an abnormal accumulation of GCAP2 in its Ca2+-free form\n(e.g. mutations in components of the phototransduction cascade causing unabated signaling, hyperpolarization of the cell and a sustained reduction\nin [Ca\n\n2+\n]i at the inner segment) would lead to neurodegeneration likely by inducing GCAP2 aggregation, or by GCAP2-mediated toxicity some other\n\nway (right sketch).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pgen.1004480.g011\n\nToxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca\n2+\n\n-Free Form\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 15 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480\n\n\n\nrecognize inclusion bodies, or that their absence would result from\n\na relatively efficient clearance of the mutant protein and therefore\n\nslow formation of putative deposits. In this sense we have observed\n\nthat inhibition of the proteasome results in an increase of\n\nEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 levels (López-del Hoyo and Méndez, unpublished\n\nobservation).\n\nThis mechanism of toxicity caused by GCAP2 misfolding may\n\ncontribute to the pathology of genetic mutations causing\n\n‘‘equivalent-light damage’’ that result in a sustained reduction in\n\nthe level of intracellular Ca\n2+\n\n: e.g. mutations in the visual cycle\n\nresulting in opsin basal constitutive activity (e.g. null mutations in\n\nRPE65 [42]). Furthermore, this mechanism of toxicity is likely to\n\ncontribute to cell death and retinal degeneration in those cases of\n\nLebers Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) in which two conditions\n\nconverge: GCAPs accumulation at the inner segment and a\n\nsustained reduction in the level of intracellular Ca\n2+\n\n. Those\n\nconditions are met, for instance, in LCA1 caused by null mutations\n\nin RetGC-E (GUCY2D) or LCA12 caused by mutations in RD3,\n\ntwo severe and prevalent inherited retinal dystrophies.\n\nIn conclusion, we propose that GCAP2 may be a mediator of\n\n‘‘equivalent-light’’ genetic damage, by its natural tendency to\n\naggregate when in its Ca\n2+\n\n-free form, in a process regulated by\n\nphosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. Future studies will be\n\naddressed at further characterizing the stoichiometry, solubility\n\nand turn-over of GCAP2-14-3-3 complexes, as well as their effects\n\non the normal functions of the cell.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nTransgenic expression of bEF2GCAP2 in mouse rods and\ndetermination of transgene expression levels by western\nblot\n\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the ARVO\n\nstatement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision\n\nResearch and in compliance with Acts 5/1995 and 214/1997 for\n\nthe welfare of experimental animals of the Autonomous Commu-\n\nnity (Generalitat) of Catalonia, and approved by the Ethics\n\nCommittee on Animal Experiments of the University of Barcelona\n\nand the University of Southern California. The GCAP2 expres-\n\nsion vectors used to generate transgenic mice were obtained by\n\nassembling the 4.4 kb mouse opsin promoter with bovine wildtype\n\nGCAP2 cDNA or mutant bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 [GCAP2 E80Q/E116Q/\n\nD158N, [38]] cDNA (0.7 kb), and a 0.6 kb fragment containing\n\nthe mouse protamine 1 polyadenylation sequence, into pBluescript\n\nII SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, California). The resulting fusion gene,\n\n5.7 kb in size, was excised from the plasmid, gel purified and\n\nmicroinjected at 1 mg/ml into the pronuclei of C57Bl6/J6DBA/\n2J F1 hybrid mouse embryos (The Jackson Laboratories, Bar\n\nHarbor, Maine). Injected embryos were implanted into pseudo-\n\npregnant females, and progenie was screened for founders by PCR\n\namplification of tail genomic DNA with primers:\n\nRh1.1: 59GTGCCTGGAGTTGCGCTGTGGG39 (forward)\n\nand p24: 59TGGCCTCCTCGTTGTCCGGGACCTT39 (re-\n\nverse).\n\nFounder mice were bred to C57Bl6 mice to maintain the\n\ntransgene in a pigmented wildtype genetic background, or to\n\nGCAPs2/2 to generate GCAPs2/2 bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 mice. To\n\ndetect transgenic GCAP2 expression by immunoblot, retinas from\n\nmice of each genotype were obtained at either postnatal day 22\n\n(p22) (for WT and mice from line B) or p40 (lines A and E), and\n\nwere homogenized in 100 ml of homogenization buffer [80 mM\nTrisHCl, pH 8.0, 4 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc SC,\n\n0.5 mg/ml Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel,\n\nSwitzerland)]. After addition of SDS Laemmli sample buffer,\n\nsamples were boiled for 5 min, and fractions corresponding to 1/\n\n40 of a retina were resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 12% tris-glycine\n\ngel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran,\n\nSchleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). Membranes were incubated\n\nwith polyclonal antibodies to bovine GCAP2 [p24DN [1], a gift\nfrom A. Dizhoor, Pennsylvania College of Optometry, Elkins\n\nPark, Pennsylvania], [GC1 and GC2 [57], a gift from D. Garbers,\n\nHHMI and UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas] and PDE\n\n(abc2, Cytosignal, Irvine, CA). Immunopositive protein bands\nwere detected with a peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG\n\nwith the ECL system (Amersham, UK).\n\nFor determination of the precise level of expression of the\n\ntransgene (expressed as a function of the endogenous), retinal\n\nextracts from mice from bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 line B and line A (2-fold\n\nserial dilutions of retinal extracts obtained as described above)\n\nwere directly compared to retinal extracts from the bGCAP2\n\ncontrol line (2-fold dilutions). The expression level of bGCAP2 in\n\nthis line was previously established as 2-fold the endogenous levels\n\n[11]. This same study established that the anti-GCAP2 antibody\n\nused recognized bGCAP2 with a 1.5-fold higher affinity than\n\nmGCAP2 [11]. That is the reason that we compared transgenic\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 to the transgenic bGCAP2 reference. The 2-fold\n\nserial dilutions in each sample were used to obtain the integration\n\nvalues of those bands present in the linear range in the same gel,\n\nfor a direct comparison. The expression of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 line A\n\nwas determined to be 2.7660.12 –fold the endogenous levels\n\n(average 6 St Dev, n = 3). The expression of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 line B\n\nwas estimated to be 1.4-fold higher than line A, that is, 3.85-fold\n\nthe endogenous levels.\n\nHistology and retinal morphometry\nFor histological analysis of the retina by light microscopy,\n\neyecups were marked for orientation, fixed, embedded in epoxy\n\nresin and sectioned at 1 mm thickness as described previously [58].\nRetinal morphometry measurements were taken as previously\n\ndescribed [58].\n\nGuanylate cyclase assays\nGuanylate cyclase activity was assayed in mouse retinal\n\nhomogenates. Six retinas from dark-adapted mice of each\n\ngenotype were dissected under infrared illumination, pooled and\n\nhomogenized in 112 ml of 26assay buffer (100 mM MOPS-KOH\npH 7.5, 16 mM NaCl, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM IBMX, 20 mM\n\nMgCl2, 14 mM 2-b-mercaptoethanol). From this, 12.5 ml aliquots\nwere mixed with either 7.5 ml of 1.33 mM EGTA (for a final\nconcentration of 0.4 mM EGTA per reaction, the ‘‘low Ca\n\n2+\n’’\n\ncondition) or 7.5 ml of 6.6 mM CaCl2 (for a final concentration of\n2 mM Ca2+, the ‘‘high Ca2+’’ condition) and preincubated at 30uC\nfor 10 min. Reactions were initiated by addition of 5 ml of 56\nsubstrate mix (1.0 mM GTP, 0.2 mCi/ml of [a-32P]GTP, 1.0 mM\nATP), and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 30uC. Reactions were\nterminated by addition of 500 ml of ice-cold 120 mM Zn(OAc)2,\nneutralized with 500 ml of Na2CO3, kept at 280uC for 15 min\nand centrifuged at 14,000 g, 4uC for 20 min. Radiolabeled cGMP\nin the supernatants was separated from radiolabeled GTP by\n\nalumina column chromatography as described [59]. Protein\n\nconcentration in retinal homogenates was determined by Brad-\n\nford. Results are the average and standard deviation of four\n\nindependent experiments performed in duplicate, with mice that\n\nwere between p20 and p30. Guanylate cyclase activity was also\n\ndetermined in all retinal homogenates after the addition of 3 mM\nrecombinant GCAP2 as a control for the presence of active Ret-\n\nGCs.\n\nToxicity of GCAP2 Locked in Its Ca\n2+\n\n-Free Form\n\nPLOS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 16 July 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 7 | e1004480\n\n\n\nImmunocytochemistry\nTo obtain retinal sections for immunofluorescence analysis\n\nmouse eyecups were fixed, infiltrated in sucrose or acrylamide,\n\nembedded in OCT and cryosectioned as described [34]. Sections\n\nwere incubated with blocking solution (3% normal goat serum, 1%\n\nBSA, 0.3% Triton X100 in PBS pH 7.4, 1 h at room tempera-\n\nture); primary antibody (14 h at 4uC), secondary antibody (1 h at\nroom temperature), and fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde\n\nprior to being mounted with Mowiol [Calbiochem, Billerica, MA].\n\nAn antigen retrieval treatment of retinal sections [incubation in\n\n0.05 mg/ml proteinase K in PBS pH 7.4 for 2 min at room\n\ntemperature followed by a heat shock at 70uC for 10 sec] was\nneeded for GCAP2 immunostaining. Antibodies used were: a\n\npolyclonal anti-GCAP2 (35), monoclonal anti-GCAP2 [mAb2235,\n\nMillipore, Billerica, MA], rabbit monoclonal anti-14-3-3e\n[EPR3918, abcam, Cambridge, UK]. Secondary antibodies for\n\nimmunofluorescence were Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and\n\nAlexa 555 goat anti-mouse IgG [Molecular Probes, Eugene,\n\nOregon]. Images were acquired at a laser scanning confocal\n\nmicroscope (Leica TCS-SL and TCS-SP2).\n\nGCAP2 immunoprecipitation and protein identification\nby LC-MS/MS\n\nFor GCAP2 immunoprecipitation in order to identify protein\n\ninteracting partners in the different phenotypes [GCAPs2/2\n\nbGCAP2, GCAPs2/2 bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 control\n\nmice] forty retinas per phenotype were pooled and homogenized\n\nin HEPES buffer [10 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 5 mM KCl, 135 mM\n\nNaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 4 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaF,\n\n1 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 1% Triton-X100 and protease inhib-\nitor cocktail Complete Mini (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)], and\n\nclarified by centrifugation. Supernatants were incubated with anti-\n\nGCAP2 monoclonal antibody-covalently crosslinked to magnetic\n\nbeads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) for\n\n45 minutes at room temperature (anti-GCAP2 mAb2235, Milli-\n\npore, Billerica, MA). Following extensive washing, elution was\n\nperformed with 0.2M Glycine-HCl pH 2.5. Elution fractions were\n\nneutralized and concentrated by ethanol precipitation, reduced\n\nand alkylated with 45 mM DTT at 60uC followed by 100 mM\niodoacetamide at room temperature, dehydrated and rehydrated\n\nwith sequencing grade trypsin in 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate\n\nfor 12 h. For LC-MS/MS samples were resuspended in 0.1%\n\nformic acid and injected into a series Proxeon LC nanoEASY\n\nsystem (Thermo Fisher Scientific, West Palm Beach, Florida)\n\ncoupled to a LTQ-Velos Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific, West\n\nPalm Beach, Florida). The resulting mass spectral peak lists were\n\nsearched with the Sequest search engine (v.2.1.04, Matrix\n\nSciences, London, UK) against the merged BOVIN-MOUSE\n\nUP SP r 2011-1.fasta sequence library. Immunoprecipitation\n\nassays and LC-MS/MS analysis with the indicated mouse\n\nphenotypes were performed in three independent experiments,\n\nwith similar results.\n\nIn vitro phosphorylation of GCAP2 and pull-down assays\nwith mock- or phosphorylated-GCAP2\n\nFor in vitro phosphorylation of GCAP2 in the presence of\nradioactivity, 20 ml reaction mixtures contained 8.5 mg of purified\nrecombinant wildtype bGCAP2 or bEF\n\n2\nGCAP2, purified PKGIa\n\n(100 units, Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) and 3 mCi of 33P-cATP\n(Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) in phosphorylation reaction\n\nbuffer (30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM sodium\n\nphosphate buffer pH 7.5, 6 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EGTA and\n\n10 mM ATP). For reactions in Ca2+ or EGTA conditions, the\n\n0.1 mM EGTA in the reaction buffer was substituted to 5 mM\n\nCaCl2 or 2 mM EGTA, respectively. cGMP was added to\n\n500 mM (to obtain phosphorylated GCAP2 or P-GCAP2) or not\nadded (mock- controls). After incubation for 2 h at 30uC and\novernight at 4uC, each reaction mixture was diluted with Laemmli\nbuffer and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer to a\n\nnitrocellulose membrane, an autoradiograph of the\n33\n\nP phosphor-\n\nylation products was obtained by 15 min of exposure to a Kodak\n\nX-ray film. The nitrocellulose membrane was subsequently\n\nincubated with a pAb anti-GCAP2 and IRDye 800CW Goat\n\nAnti-rabbit IgG for GCAP2 immunodetection.\n\nTo obtain phosphorylated bGCAP2 or bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 for pull-\n\ndown assays in the absence of radioactivity, the same procedure\n\nwas used except that 25 mg of bGCAP2 or bEF2GCAP2 protein\nand 230 units of purified PKGIa were used per reaction tube. The\nproduct of each reaction tube was cross-linked to 2.5 mg of\n\nmagnetic beads (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) and used\n\nin pull-down assays with solubilized bovine retina. Each sample\n\nwas incubated with material corresponding to 1/8 of a bovine\n\nretina, previously homogenized in binding buffer (10 mM HEPES,\n\n135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM b-\nmercaptoethanol, 1% Triton X-100, 4 mM EGTA, 2 mM\n\nEDTA, Complete Mini protease inhibitors, pH 7.4) and pre-\n\ncleared by centrifugation. After 1 h incubation at room temper-\n\nature, beads were washed and bound proteins were eluted under\n\nacidic conditions, equilibrated and ethanol precipitated. Samples\n\nwere resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a\n\nnitrocellulose membrane. For Western detection of GCAP2 and\n\n14-3-3 the following antibodies were used: a polyclonal anti-\n\nGCAP2 (35), a pAb to 14-3-3pan (JP18649, IBL International,\n\nHamburg, Germany), a mAb to 14-3-3e (EPR3918, abcam,\nCambridge, UK), a IRDye 800CW Goat anti-rabbit IgG and a\n\nIRDye 680CW Goat anti-mouse IgG (Tebu Bio, Offenbach,\n\nGermany). Image was acquired at the Odyssey Imaging System\n\n(LI-COR, Lincol, Nebraska USA).\n\nIn situ phosphorylation assays\nAll mice for in situ phosphorylation assays were 30–36 days old.\n\nMice were dark-adapted for a minimum of 14 h prior to use.\n\nRetinas were dissected under infrared light (two retinas per\n\nphenotype per light condition) and incubated for 90 min in\n\n600 ml of bicarbonate-buffered Locke’s solution (112.5 mM NaCl,\n3.6 mM KCl, 2.4 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM HEPES,\n\n0.02 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaHCO3, 10 mM glucose, 3 mM\n\nsodium succinate, 0.5 mM sodium glutamate, 0.1% vitamin and\n\namino acids supplement) containing 1 mCi/ml [\n32\n\nPi]H3PO4\n(10 mCi/ml, Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) in the dark in a\n\n5% CO2 incubator to allow incorporation of\n32\n\nP in the endogenous\n\nATP pool. Following incubation, retinas were washed with Locke’s\n\nsolution and immediately homogenized in 200 ml of solubilization\nbuffer [10 mM HEPES, 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM PMSF,\n\n2 mM NaF, 4 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 1%\n\nTriton X100, complete mini protease inhibitors (Roche Applied\n\nSciences, Basel, Switzerland), pH 7.4] in the dark, or exposed to\n\nbright white light for 5 min prior to homogenization.

Site-directed mutagenesis was\n\nperformed with the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit\n\n(Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using primers:\n\nbGCAP2_S201G_Fw: CTCAGCAGAGGCGGAAAGGTGC-\n\nCATGTTC; bGCAP2_S201G_Rv: GAACATGGCACCTTTC-\n\nCGCCTCTGCTGAG;\n\nMutagenesis was confirmed by sequencing. Mice were electro-\n\nporated at p0 according to reference [40] and processed at p28–\n\n30. Briefly, 0.5 ml at a concentration of 6 mg/ml of DNA mix in\nPBS was injected into the subretinal space, by making use of a\n\nNanojet microinjector and micromanipulator (Drummond Scien-\n\ntific, Broomall, PA). The DNA mix consisted of the expression\n\nvector for the specific GCAP2 mutant (bGCAP2, bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 or\n\nbS201G/EF\n2\n\nGCAP2) in circular form and a tracer plasmid\n\n(pL_UG that expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven\n\nby the Ubiquitin C promoter, [60]) also in circular form, at a mass\n\nratio of 2:1. Electroporation was performed with a square-wave\n\nelectroporator (CUI21, Nepagene, Japan) by triggering 5 pulses of\n\n80 V with a 50 ms duration and an interval time of 950 ms.\n\nElectroporated pups were raised under standard cyclic light\n\nconditions and sacrificed at p28–30 for immunofluorescence\n\nanalysis. Briefly, eyes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in\n\nPBS at pH 7.4, embedded in acrylamide mix and frozen as\n\ndescribed [34]. Retinal cryosections were obtained at 22 mm\nthickness. An antigen retrieval protocol was performed preceding\n\nthe immunofluorescence studies: glass slides were incubated with\n\nproteinase K in PBS pH 7.4 (0.05 mg/ml) for 2 min and heated at\n\n70uC for 8 sec. Sections were incubated in blocking solution (1%\nBSA, 3% normal goat serum, 0.1% Triton X100, PBS pH 7.4);\n\nprimary antibody solution (1% BSA, 3% normal goat serum, PBS\n\npH 7.4 containing 0.01 mg/ml polyclonal antibody to GCAP2\n\nand 0.00025 mg/ml mAb 1D4 to rhodopsin); and secondary\n\nantibody solution (1% BSA, 3% normal goat serum, PBS pH 7.4\n\ncontaining Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rabbit IgG (signal converted to\n\nred in figures); and Alexa Fluor 555 anti-mouse IgG (signal\n\nconverted to blue in figures). Images were acquired in a Leica\n\nconfocal microscope. GCAP2 and rhodopsin signal profiles were\n\nobtained for the individual cells shown by tracing a line along the\n\ninner segment compartment, and another line along the outer\n\nsegment compartment, and plotting the summation of the red and\n\nthe green signal along both lines from the collection of planes in a\n\nz-stack that covers the whole volume of the cell, by using the Leica\n\nconfocal software (Leica Microsystems).\n\nAnalysis of the effect of 30 days of constant light\nexposure versus 30 days of dark rearing on GCAP2\nsubcellular distribution in wildtype mice\n\nThree-month old C57Bl/6J mice were kept in a ventilated dark\n\ncabinet for 30 d, or kept under constant light exposure for the\n\nsame time (fluorescent light, 700 lux intensity inside the cage), and\n\ntheir eyecups were processed for immunofluorescence analysis.\n\nRetinal cryosections were stained with an anti-GCAP2 pAb and\n\nanti-rhodopsin mAb 1D4, by indirect immunofluorescence stain-\n\ning with Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa 555 goat anti-\n\nmouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon). Z-axis stacks\n\nwere obtained from four mice per condition at a Leica TCS-SL\n\nconfocal microscope, and the percentage of GCAP2 signal\n\ncolocalizing with the rhodopsin signal at the rod outer segment\n\nwas quantified by ImageJ in three representative planes from each\n\nstack, one stack per mouse, four mice per condition. Precisely, for\n\na 636-objective frame of retina, an ROI was defined to include\nthe inner and outer segment layers, while another ROI was\n\ndelimited to the outer segment layer based on rhodopsin staining.\n\nGCAP2 signal was quantified in each ROI, and the percentage of\n\nGCAP2 colocalizing with rhodopsin was expressed as a function of\n\nGCAP2 at the inner and outer segment layers (ImageJ). Mean\n\nvalues were obtained and statistical analysis performed with\n\nGraphPad Prism 6.\n\nElectroretinogram\nElectroretinogram responses to flash stimuli were recorded on a\n\nNicolet Electrovisual Diagnostic System. Mice were dark-adapted\n\nfor 12 h and then anesthetized under dim red light by\n\nintraperitoneal administration of Ketamine HCl (100 mg/kg)\n\nand Xylazine HCl (10 mg/kg). Phenylephrine HCl (2.5%) and\n\nTropicamide (0.5%) were applied to the cornea to dilate the\n\npupils, and mice were dark-adapted again for 10 min previous to\n\nthe recording. Following administration of Tetracaine HCl (0.5%)\n\neyedrops as a topical corneal anesthetic, the mice are placed on a\n\nheated pad at 37uC in a Faraday cage. The corneal electrode\nconsisted of a carbon-fiber moistened in saline. A 1 ms light flash\n\nwas delivered through a fiber optic centered vertically over a few\n\nmillimeter of the corneal surface. Mice from the different\n\ngenotypes were recorded over the course of eight months under\n\nidentical conditions.\n\nEffect of constant light-rearing versus constant dark-\nrearing on retinal morphology of GCAPs2/2\nbEF2GCAP2 and GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 control mice\n\nEvaluation of the rate of retinal degeneration by retinal\n\nmorphometry analysis.

A stage micrometer\n\n(Klarmann Rulings, Litchfield, NH) was used for calibration. Each\n\nretina half (superior and inferior) was divided into ten equal\n\nsegments from the optic nerve to the tip (excluding a radius of\n\n100 mm from the optic nerve, due to the natural thinning of the\nONL at this region). Three independent measurements were taken\n\nper segment, and the average value was obtained. In this manner\n\n60 independent measurements were obtained per section (20\n\nsegments63 measurements/segment). The mice analyzed per\ngenotype were: GCAPs2/2 bEF\n\n2\nGCAP2 line A, n = 4 for each\n\ndark and light conditions; GCAPs2/2 bGCAP2 line E, n = 3 for\n\neach dark and light conditions; and GCAPs 2/2 control line,\n\nn = 2 for each condition.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 Determination of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 transgenic expression\n\nlevels in lines A and B. A. The level of expression of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2\n\nin line A was determined by direct comparison with that of\n\nbGCAP2 in line E, by loading in the same gel two-fold serial\n\ndilutions of a retinal homogenate representing 1/40 of a retina.\n\nExpression of bEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 was determined to be 1.38-fold higher\n\n(60.06 St Dev) than that of bGCAP2 in control line E. Because\n\nline E was previously established to express 2-fold the endogenous\n\nlevels of GCAP2 [11], line A is determined to express 2,76-fold the\n\nendogenous levels of GCAP2. B. Likewise, by comparison to line\nA, line B was determined to express 1.4-fold more transgene, or\n\n3.86-fold the endogenous GCAP2 levels.\n\n(TIF)\n\nFigure S2 Timecourse for the loss of visual function in\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 expressing mice as assessed by electroretinogram.\n\nERG B-wave amplitudes (mV) are plotted to postnatal age of mice\n(months).

Rationale. If\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 expression led to unabated cGMP synthesis in vivo\nand accumulation of cGMP was the basis of the pathology, then\n\nconditions of constant light exposure would slow the retinal\n\ndegeneration by causing the sustained activation of PDE6 activity\n\nand cGMP hydrolysis. Light induced sustained cGMP hydrolysis\n\nwould counteract unabated cGMP synthesis. A.

Measurements of ONL thickness (mm) were taken\nat ten equal intervals along the superior and inferior hemispheres of\n\nthe retina, indicated in abscissas as positive values (superior retina)\n\nand negative values (inferior retina) from the optic nerve (position 0).\n\nThe superimposition of the red and black lines indicate that retinal\n\ndegeneration (shortening of ONL thickness along the retina) was\n\nobserved to the same extent in dark-reared or constant light-reared\n\nbEF\n2\n\nGCAP2 mice.
