However, the molecular mechanism by which CAPE affects oral cancer cell metastasis has yet to be elucidated.\nIn this study, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying the effects of CAPE on the invasive ability of SCC-9 oral cancer\ncells. Results showed that CAPE attenuated SCC-9 cell migration and invasion at noncytotoxic concentrations (0 μM to 40 μM).\nWestern blot and gelatin zymography analysis findings further indicated that CAPE downregulated matrix metalloproteinase-2\n(MMP-2) protein expression and inhibited its enzymatic activity. CAPE exerted its inhibitory effects on MMP-2 expression and\nactivity by upregulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2) and potently decreased migration by reducing focal\nadhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and the activation of its downstream signaling molecules p38/MAPK and JNK. These\ndata indicate that CAPE could potentially be used as a chemoagent to prevent oral cancer metastasis.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nOral cancer is associated with a high degree of local inva-\nsiveness and a high rate of metastasis to regional cervical\nlymph nodes. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the\nmost common head and neck cancer and is characterized by\npoor prognosis and low survival rate [1]. Metastasis is the\nmajor cause of cancer death and involves multiple processes\nincluding the remodeling and degradation of the extracellu-\nlar matrix (ECM) [2]. Various proteinases, such as the matrix\nmetalloproteinases (MMPs), cathepsins, and plasminogen\nactivator (PA), are involved in the interactions between\ncancer cells and the ECM [3, 4]. The MMPs function\nin the degradation of structural proteins in the ECM\n\nand regulate several cellular functions including growth,\ninvasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis [5]. Among the\nvarious MMPs thought to be involved in human disease,\ninvestigators have intensively investigated the gelatinases\n(MMP-2 and MMP-9). Matrix metalloproteinase-2 and\nMMP-9 are the principal enzymes involved in the degra-\ndation of the major structural component of the basement\nmembrane, type IV collagen [6, 7]. Several studies have\nshown that the gelatinases are overexpressed in several types\nof human cancer, such as breast [8], pancreas [9], prostate\n[10], lung [11], and oral [12] cancers. Previous studies\nhave also identified significantly increased urine and plasma\nMMP-2 concentrations in cancer patients [13, 14], with\nMMP-2 and MMP-9 being considered as predictors of risk\n\nmailto:ysf@csmu.edu.tw\nmailto:cwlin@csmu.edu.tw\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nC\nel\n\nl \nvi\n\nab\nil\n\nit\ny \n\n(%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\no\nl)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCAPE concentration (μM)\n\n0 5 10 20 40\n\n24 h\n48 h\n\n(a)\n\nC\nel\n\nl \nvi\n\nab\nil\n\nit\ny \n\n(%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\no\nl)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nCAPE concentration (μM)\n\n0 5 10 20 40\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 1: Effect of CAPE on cell viability.

Previous\nresearch has shown that CAPE exerts antioxidative, anti-\ninflammatory, and anticancer activities [17]. In addition,\nCAPE suppresses eicosanoid synthesis and inhibits the\nrelease of arachidonic acid from cell membranes [17, 18]. Its\nanti-inflammatory activity is derived from the downregula-\ntion of COX-2 expression [19, 20]. Chuu et al. identified that\nCAPE suppressed human prostate cancer cell proliferation\nthrough the inhibition of Akt [21]. Other studies have shown\nthat CAPE induced apoptosis through the activation of Fas\nand Bax and the inhibition of NF-κB [22, 23]. However,\nits effects on OSCC invasion and metastasis and their\nunderlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated.\n\nThis study investigated the association between CAPE\ntreatment and invasion of SCC-9 oral cancer cells. Our\nresults showed that CAPE suppressed the migration and\ninvasion of oral cancer cells, probably through the inhibition\nof FAK phosphorylation and its downstream p38 and\nJNK signaling pathways. Results also indicated that the\nanti-invasive activity of CAPE is partly mediated by the\nregulation of MMP-2 expression and activity, which reduces\nthe ability of oral cancer cells to degrade components of the\nextracellular matrix.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Cell Culture and CAPE Treatment. SCC-9, a human\ntongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line obtained from\n\nATCC (Manassas, VA, USA), was cultured in Dulbecco’s\nModified Eagle’s Medium supplemented with a nutri-\nent mixture, which comprised F-12 Ham’s medium (Life\nTechnologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 10% fetal bovine\nserum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA), 2 mM glu-\ntamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.\nAll cell cultures were maintained at 37◦C in a humidified\natmosphere of 5%CO2. For CAPE treatment, appropriate\namounts of stock solution of CAPE were added into culture\nmedium to achieve the indicated concentrations and then\nincubated with cells for indicated time periods, whereas\ndimethyl sulfoxide solution without CAPE was used as blank\nreagent.\n\n2.2. Determination of Cell Viability (MTT Assay). For cell\nviability experiment, a microculture tetrazolium (3-(4,5-\ndimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) co-\nlorimetric assay was performed to determine the cytotoxicity\nof CAPE [3]. SCC-9 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at\na density of 5 × 104 cells/well and treated with CAPE at a\nconcentration between 0 and 40 μM at 37◦C for 24 and 48 h.\nAfter the exposure period, the media were removed, and cells\nwere washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then\nincubated with 20 μL MTT (5 mg/mL) (Sigma chemical Co.,\nSt. Louis, MO, USA) for 4 h. The viable cell number per dish\nis directly proportional to the production of formazan, which\ncan be measured spectrophotometrically at 563 nm following\nsolubilization with isopropanol.\n\n2.3. Annexin V/PI Double Staining. An FITC Annexin V\nApoptosis Detection Kit I was used to quantify cell numbers\n\n\n\n4 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\nC\nel\n\nl \nm\n\nig\nra\n\nti\no\n\nn\n (\n\n%\n o\n\nf \nco\n\nn\ntr\n\no\nl)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nCAPE concentration (μM)\n\nCAPE concentration (μM)\n\n0 5 10 20 40\n\n0 5 10 20 40\n\n∗\n\n∗\n∗\n\n∗\n\n(a)\n\nCAPE concentration (μM)\n\n0 5 10 20 40\n\nCAPE concentration (μM)\n\n0 5 10 20 40\n\nC\nel\n\nl \nin\n\nva\nsi\n\no\nn\n\n (\n%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\no\n\nl)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n∗\n\n∗\n\n∗\n∗\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Effect of CAPE on cell migration and invasion in SCC-9 cells. (a) The cell migration and (b) cell invasion were measured using a\nBoyden chamber for 16 h and 24 h with polycarbonate filters, respectively. The migration and invasion abilities of SCC-9 cells were quantified\nby counting the number of cells that invaded to the underside of the porous polycarbonate as described in Section 2. The values represented\nthe means ± SD of at least three independent experiments. ∗P < 0.05 as compared with the vehicle group.\n\nin different stages of cell death. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were\nresuspended in 100 μL 1x binding buffer (0.01 M Hepes/\nNaOH (pH 7.4), 0.14 M NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2). With\nan addition of 5 μL of FITC Annexin V and 5 μL PI, the\ncell suspension was incubated for 15 minutes at room\ntemperature in the dark. Afterwards, 400 μL of 1x binding\nbuffer was added to each tube followed by flow cytometry\nanalysis within 1 hour.\n\n2.4. In Vitro Wound Closure. SCC-9 cells (1 × 105 cells/well)\nwere plated in 6-well plates for 24 h, wounded by scratching\nwith a pipette tip, then incubated with DMEM medium\ncontaining 0.5% FBS, and treated with or without CAPE\n(0, 5, 10, 20, and 40 μM) for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Cells were\nphotographed using a phase-contrast microscope (×100).\n\n2.5. Cell Migration and Invasion Assays. Cell migration and\ninvasion were assayed according to the methods described\nby Yang et al. [4]. After a treatment with CAPE (0, 5,\n10, 20, and 40 μM) for 24 h, surviving cells were harvested\nand seeded to Boyden chamber (Neuro Probe, Cabin John,\nMD, USA) at 104 cells/well in serum-free medium and then\nincubated for 24 hours at 37◦C. For invasion assay, 10 μL\nMatrigel (25 mg/50 mL; BD Biosciences, MA, USA) was\napplied to 8 μm pore-size polycarbonate membrane filters,\nand the bottom chamber contained standard medium. Filters\nwere then air-dried for 5 h in a laminar flow hood. The\ninvaded cells were fixed with 100% methanol and stained\nwith 5% Giemsa. Cell numbers were counted under a light\n\nmicroscope. The migration assay was carried out as described\nin the invasion assay with no coating of Matrigel [3].\n\n2.6. Determination of MMP-2 by Gelatin Zymography. The\nactivities of MMP-2 in conditional medium were mea-\nsured by gelatin zymography protease assays as previously\ndescribed [3]. Briefly, collected media of an appropriate\nvolume (adjusted by vital cell number) were prepared\nwith SDS sample buffer without boiling or reduction and\nsubjected to 0.1% gelatin and 8% SDS-PAGE electrophoresis.\nAfter electrophoresis, gels were washed with 2.5% Triton X-\n100 and then incubated in reaction buffer (40 mM Tris–HCl,\npH 8.0, 10 mM CaCl2, and 0.01% NaN3) for 12 h at 37◦C.\nThen the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-\n250.\n\n2.7. Preparation of Total Cell Lysates. For total cell lysates\npreparation, cells were rinsed with PBS twice, scraped with\n0.2 mL of cold RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitors\ncocktail, and then vortexed at 4◦C for 10 min. Cell lysates\nwere subjected to a centrifugation of 10,000 rpm for 10 min\nat 4◦C, and the insoluble pellet was discarded. The protein\nconcentration of total cell lysates and nuclear fraction was\ndetermined by Bradford assay [3].\n\n2.8. Western Blot Analysis.

Furthermore, CAPE also did not alter\nthe cell viability of normal gingival fibroblast at various\nconcentrations (0–40 μM) for 24 h (Figure 1(b)). Thus, all\nsubsequent experiments, therefore, used this CAPE concen-\ntration range.\n\nWe further investigated the effect of CAPE on Annexin\nV flipping and caspase cleavage.

Inhibition of SCC-9 Cell Motility, Migration, and Invasion\nby CAPE. In the wound-healing assay, CAPE significantly\nreduced the cell motility of SCC-9 cells both dose and time\ndependently (P < 0.05) (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)). At 40 μM,\nCAPE decreased the migrated cell number by 38%, 56%,\nand 82% at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, respectively. Using a cell\nmigration and invasion assay with a Boyden chamber, we\nshowed that CAPE reduced SCC-9 cell migration and inva-\nsion significantly and in a concentration-dependent manner\n(P < 0.05) (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). In the invasion assay,\nthe inhibition percentage was 16–64% (Figure 4(b)) after\nincubation of cells with different concentrations (0–40 μM)\nof CAPE for 24 h. Our results indicated increased inhibition\nof cell migration with increasing CAPE concentration.\n\n3.3. Effects of CAPE on MMP-2 and TIMP-2 Protein Expres-\nsions and MMP-2 Enzymatic Activity. To confirm that MMP-\n2 plays a vital role in the suppression of cell migration,\nwe compared MMP-2 protein expression in CAPE-treated\nand control SCC-9 cells. As shown in Figures 5(a) and\n5(b), treatment of SCC-9 cells with CAPE downregulated\nMMP-2 enzymatic activity in a concentration-dependent\nmanner (P < 0.05). At 40 μM, CAPE decreased the MMP-\n2 enzymatic activity by 57% at 24 h. CAPE also significantly\nreduced MMP-2 protein expressions and increased TIMP-2\nexpression in western blotting (Figures 5(c) and 5(d)). CAPE\n(40 μM) increased TIMP-2 expression with about 1.58 folds\nat 24 h.\n\n3.4. Effects of CAPE on Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) Activa-\ntion. Our investigation of the molecular regulation of cell\nmigration indicated the involvement of FAK in CAPE activ-\nity. Having shown that CAPE inhibits SCC-9 cell migration\nand invasion, we further aimed to evaluate any changes\nin FAK activation in these cells using antibodies directed\nagainst the FAK phosphorylation site Tyr397. As shown\nin Figure 6, CAPE reduced FAK phosphorylation in SCC-9\ncells. The inhibition percentage was 20–42% (Figure 6(b))\nafter incubation of cells with different concentrations of\nCAPE for 24 h. These results suggested that CAPE inhibits\nSCC-9 cell migration, at least in part, through the regulation\nof FAK phosphorylation.\n\n3.5. Effects of CAPE on MAPK and PI3K/Akt Pathways. We\ninvestigated the effects of CAPE on MAPK and PI3K/Akt\npathways using western blot analysis. Results indicated\nthe constitutive phosphorylation of pERK (Figure 7(a))\nand pAKT (Figure 7(d)) in untreated SCC-9 cells and the\ndownregulation of p38 (Figure 7(b)) and pJNK (Figure 7(c))\nphosphorylation in CAPE-treated cells in a dose-dependent\nmanner (P < 0.05). At 40 μM, CAPE decreased phosphory-\nlation levels of p38 and JNK by 51% and 40%, respectively.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe management of patients with malignant tumors has\nimproved greatly over the past few decades. Patients with\nOSCC now have an overall 5-year survival rate of approxi-\nmately 25% [24]. However, patients with advanced disease\noften experience cancer spread to local and distant sites,\nwhich is poorly controlled by surgery.

We identified that\nCAPE (1) inhibits migration and invasion of SCC-9 oral\ncancer cells at noncytotoxic concentrations, (2) downregu-\nlates MMP-2 protein expression and inhibits its enzymatic\nactivity, (3) increases TIMP-2 expression, (4) inhibits FAK\nphosphorylation, (5) and inhibits p38 MAPK and JNK\nactivation.\n\nInvasion and migration are considered the most impor-\ntant characteristics of malignant tumors. Solid tumor\nmetastasis is the major cause of death in human can-\ncer patients and involves multiple complicated processes.\nThe degradation of the ECM is considered essential for\ntumor progression [25]. Among various proteases, which\ncause ECM degradation, matrix metalloproteinase-2 is the\nmost significant in oral cancer [26]. Previous studies inves-\ntigated the clinical significance of MMP-2 in different races\nwith oral cancer. Immunohistochemical results indicated\nthat MMP-2 expression significantly elevated in malignant\ntissues as compared with adjacent normal tissues. MMP-\n2 overexpression positively correlated with lymph node\nmetastasis [27, 28]. The activation ratio of MMP-2 was\nhigher in the malignant tissues of patients with lymph node\nmetastasis as compared with those without lymph node\nmetastasis [29]. OSCC invasion and metastasis represent\nmajor obstacles to treatment. Thus, inhibition of metastasis\nof OSCC by CAPE could provide important preventive and\ntherapeutic benefitsagainst oral cancer.\n\nThe result of this study’s showed that CAPE significantly\ninhibited the migratory/invasive ability of SCC-9 cancer cells,\ndownregulated MMP-2 protein expression, and inhibited\nMMP-2 enzymatic activity. However, our data also indicated\nthat the secreted concentrations of MMP-9 from SCC-9 cells\nwere quite low (data not shown). The function of the MMP\nin vivo is dependent on the local balance between them and\ntheir natural inhibitors [30]. The TIMPs are physiological\ninhibitors that bind MMP in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry. Several\nstudies have suggested that measuring the protease/protease\ninhibitor ratio in some tumors can provide an exact\nreflection of ECM remolding [31]. However, the relationship\nbetween metastasis and TIMP-2 remains controversial. In\nprevious studies, TIMP-2 overexpression protected cancer\ncells from apoptosis and reduced cell invasion in various\ntumor cell lines [32, 33]. In other clinical analyses, TIMP-2\nexpression was positively associated with tumor recurrence\n[34]. Our data suggested a role for TIMP-2 in the prevention\nof tumor cell invasion because its expression is upregulated\nin CAPE-treated SCC-9 cells.\n\nPrevious studies have well established the role of the\nMitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in the\nregulation of MMP expression and metastasis of tumor cells\n[35–37]. Inhibition of p38 by SB203580 reduced the rate of\nmigration of several cancer cells significantly [38]. In the\nstudy by Huang et al., the dominant-negative mutant of JNK\ninhibited the migration of human corneal epithelial cells\n[39]. In other studies, both p38 and JNK modulated MMP-\n2 production in cancer cells [40–42]. Our data showed that\nCAPE treatment inhibited p38 and JNK phosphorylation\nand downregulated MMP-2 expression, indicating a possible\n\nmechanism for the inhibition of MMP-2 synthesis by\nCAPE. The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal\ntransduction pathway is involved in MMP production and\ncell proliferation, survival, and migration [43]; however, our\nstudy results indicated that CAPE has nonsignificant effects\non the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.\n\nIn conclusion, the result of our study suggested that\nCAPE partly exerts its antimetastatic effects on oral cancer\ncells by regulating MMP-2 expression through the inhibition\nof FAK and MAPK activation. Overall, these data suggest that\nCAPE has a potential use as a chemoagent for the prevention\nof oral cancer cell metastasis.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis study was supported by a research Grant from the\nNational Science Council, Taiwan (no.
