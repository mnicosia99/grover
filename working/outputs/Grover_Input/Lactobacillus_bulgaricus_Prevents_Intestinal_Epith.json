Our previous studies demonstrated that E.\nsakazakii induces NEC in a newborn rat model by inducing enterocyte apoptosis. However, the mechanisms\nresponsible for enterocyte apoptosis are not known. Here we demonstrate that E. sakazakii induces significant\nproduction of nitric oxide (NO) in rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) upon infection. The elevated produc-\ntion of NO, which is due to increased expression of inducible NO synthase, is responsible for apoptosis of IEC-6\ncells. Notably, pretreatment of IEC-6 cells with Lactobacillus bulgaricus (ATCC 12278) attenuated the upregu-\nlation of NO production and thereby protected the cells from E. sakazakii-induced apoptosis. Furthermore,\npretreatment with L. bulgaricus promoted the integrity of enterocytes both in vitro and in the infant rat model\nof NEC, even after challenge with E. sakazakii. Infection of IEC-6 cells with E. sakazakii upregulated several\ngenes related to apoptosis, cytokine production, and various signaling pathways, as demonstrated by rat gene\narray analysis, and this upregulation was subdued by pretreatment with L. bulgaricus. In agreement with these\ndata, L. bulgaricus pretreatment protected newborn rats infected with E. sakazakii from developing NEC,\nresulting in improved survival.\n\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a worldwide problem in\nvery-low-birth-weight infants, with a highly variable incidence,\naffecting 2.6% to 28% of these infants. The precise etiology of\nNEC is unknown but is widely considered multifactorial. Three\nmajor factors have been proposed, including the presence of a\npathogenic organism, the challenge of enteral feeding, and\naltered enteric mucosal integrity. Although mortality rates\namong infants with NEC may have decreased as a result of\nimproved supportive and surgical care, effective preventive\nstrategies are lacking. The initial management of infants who\nare suspected of having NEC relies upon aggressive fluid re-\nsuscitation and the prompt initiation of broad-spectrum anti-\nbiotics (30). Thus, it would be of extreme value to develop a\npreventive or therapeutic strategy in the management of this\ndisease. Prevention offers benefits over reactive intervention\nbecause despite successful treatment, once infants are affected\nwith NEC, they continue to be at risk for multiple morbidities,\nincluding short gut syndrome, stricture formation, and even\npoor neurologic outcomes.\n\nSeveral pathogens have been associated with NEC. How-\never, thus far, none fulfills Koch’s postulates (17). Enterobacter\nsakazakii is a bacterium that has been implicated in outbreaks\nof sepsis, meningitis, and NEC in newborns. Such outbreaks\nhave been attributed to E. sakazakii contamination of pow-\ndered human infant formula (43). A taxonomic reclassification\n\nof E. sakazakii to consist of five species within a new genus,\nCronobacter, was recently proposed (20). However, due to the\nfamiliarity of the name Enterobacter sakazakii in the literature,\nwe continue to use the same in this study. Additionally, E.\nsakazakii infection confers a high mortality rate in affected\ninfants (40). Our recent studies have shown that oral feeding of\nE. sakazakii induces NEC in an experimental animal model\n(16). We further demonstrated that E. sakazakii binding to rat\nintestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6) in vitro and in vivo causes\nenterocyte apoptosis. However, the mechanisms involved in E.\nsakazakii-induced apoptosis of IEC-6 cells have not yet been\nidentified.\n\nAlthough E. sakazakii may be an important pathogenic trig-\nger in the development of NEC, it has been recognized that\nthere are both quantitative and qualitative changes in the fecal\nflora before the onset of NEC. A decline in the variety of\nspecies and a shift to a predominance of members of the\nEnterobacteriaceae before the onset of NEC were identified.\nGewolb et al. reported that Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus\nare found in the stools of �5% of extremely-low-birth-weight\ninfants within the first month of life (11). These data suggest\nthat low levels of colonization of Bifidobacterium and Lacto-\nbacillus in low-birth-weight infants may serve as a predisposing\nfactor in microbial infection. Recently, there have been several\nrandomized prospective human clinical trials that have shown\na decreased incidence of NEC after prophylactic oral admin-\nistration of certain probiotic species (2, 4, 15, 29). Although the\nresults for humans are promising, very little is understood\nregarding the mechanisms by which probiotics may alter dis-\nease susceptibility, and an appreciation of the role of specific\nprobiotics is absent. However, there are several theoretical\n\n* Corresponding author.

Two\nof the isoforms, endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS,\nare expressed at constitutively low levels. The third isoform,\ninducible NOS (iNOS), is not expressed under normal condi-\ntions but is dramatically increased during inflammation, result-\ning in high levels of NO production (34). Elevated levels of\niNOS have been demonstrated in infants with NEC as well as\nin adults with inflammatory bowel disorders (14, 37). The role\nof iNOS in E. sakazakii-induced NEC is unknown, as is the role\nof probiotics in iNOS induction. In this study, we report the\nfollowing two important phenomena: (i) E. sakazakii stimu-\nlates the production of NO, leading to apoptosis of IEC-6 cells;\nand (ii) oral feeding of Lactobacillus bulgaricus prior to infec-\ntion with E. sakazakii significantly reduces mortality rates in an\nexperimental animal model of NEC.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nBacterial strains, cells, and reagents. E. sakazakii (ATCC 51329), a Lactoba-\ncillus species deposited as Lactobacillus bulgaricus (ATCC 12278), and rat intes-\ntinal epithelial cells (IEC-6; passages 20 to 26) were obtained from ATCC\n(Manassas, VA). IEC-6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s\nmedium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 U/ml insulin, 100 U/ml\npenicillin G, and 100 U/liter streptomycin. E. sakazakii was grown in Luria broth\nunder microaerophilic conditions, whereas L. bulgaricus was cultured in MRS\nbroth under anaerobic conditions. Rodent formula (Esbilac) was obtained from\nPetAg (Hampshire, IL).\n\nTransformation of E. sakazakii with a GFP-expressing plasmid. E. sakazakii\nwas grown for 8 h in Luria broth at 37°C, centrifuged to pellet down the bacteria,\nwashed with saline, and treated with 0.1 M calcium chloride for 30 min on ice. E.\nsakazakii cells were then transformed with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-\nexpressing plasmid. Colonies were assessed for GFP expression by being viewed\nunder UV light, and further cultures were grown from a single colony.\n\nTransfection of IEC-6 cells with siRNA and determination of NO production.\nIEC-6 cells were grown to 30% confluence in 24-well plates and then transfected\nwith small interfering RNA (siRNA) for iNOS or eNOS by use of Lipofectamine\nPlus according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). E.\nsakazakii was grown overnight, centrifuged to pellet down the bacteria, washed\nwith saline, and adjusted to 108 CFU/ml in saline by measuring the optical\ndensity at 600 nm in a spectrophotometer. Approximately 107 CFU of E. saka-\nzakii were added to the wells in 24-well tissue culture plates containing confluent\nmonolayers of IEC-6 cells, equivalent to a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100,\nand incubated for various periods (0 h, 2 h, and 6 h). Upon completion of the\nexperiment, supernatants were collected, cleared by centrifugation, and analyzed\nfor NO production by the method of Rockett et al. (38). Briefly, nitrate was\nconverted to nitrites with �-NADP (NADPH) (1.25 mg/ml; Sigma, St. Louis,\nMO) and nitrate reductase (Sigma), followed by the addition of Griess reagent\n(Sigma). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min,\nfollowed by the addition of trichloroacetic acid. Samples were centrifuged, clear\nsupernatants were collected, and the optical density was recorded at 550 nm. The\namounts of NO produced were determined from the standard curves.\n\nRT-PCR and Western blotting. IEC-6 cells were grown to 90% confluence in\n60-mm dishes and infected with E. sakazakii at an MOI of 100 (cell-to-bacterium\nratio, 1:100) for various periods in the presence or absence of L. bulgaricus. The\ncells were then washed and total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit\n(Qiagen). RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop machine, and reverse tran-\nscription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using the following primers: FP (5�\nCGCTTTGCCACGGAAGAGACGCACA 3�) and RP (5� TGCAGCTAAATA\nTTAGAGCAGCGG 3�). Ribosomal protein S-17 (RPS-17) primers were used in\nRT-PCR to amplify a housekeeping gene. For Western blot analysis, IEC-6 cells\ninfected with E. sakazakii in 60-mm petri dishes were washed three times with\n\nice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted by centrifugation at 230 � g\nfor 10 min, and resuspended in 200 �l of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,\n137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% NP-40, 10 �g/ml aprotinin, and 10 �g/ml\nleupeptin). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 14,000 � g for\n10 min. The protein concentration was determined using a bicinchoninic acid\nprotein assay kit (Pierce Co., Rockland, IL). Aliquots of protein (30 �g) were\nseparated in 9 to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, using a Bio-\nRad minigel system, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots\nwere incubated with 5% bovine serum albumin overnight at 4°C to block the\nnonspecific binding sites, followed by anti-iNOS antibody (1:100 dilution) for 2 h at\nroom temperature. The blots were then washed for 15 min in PBS and further\nincubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 di-\nlution). A chemiluminescent reagent was used to detect the bands. Similarly, intes-\ntinal scrapings were collected from infant rats into lysis buffer, and the protein\ncontent was estimated and subjected to Western blotting with anti-iNOS antibody.\n\nRat pup model of E. sakazakii-induced NEC. Animal experiments were ap-\nproved by the IACUC and the biosafety committee of Children’s Hospital Los\nAngeles. NEC was induced in newborn rats by formula feeding/hypoxia as previously\ndescribed (33). Briefly, timed pregnant rats were purchased from Charles River\n(Wilmington, MA) and induced with oxytocin at term. The following experimental\ngroups were used: (i) twice daily feeding of 0.2 ml clean Esbilac formula and three\ntimes (�5 min each) daily hypoxia exposure with 5% O2–95% N2 (FF�H group);\n(ii) once daily feeding of 0.2 ml formula containing 105 CFU of E. sakazakii and\nhypoxia three times daily (FF�H�E. sakazakii group); (iii) similar to FF�H group,\nbut with a single feeding of 105 CFU of L. bulgaricus on the first feed after birth\n(FF�H�L. bulgaricus group); (iv) similar to FF�H�E. sakazakii group, but both L.\nbulgaricus and E. sakazakii were administered together (FF�H�L. bulgaricus-E.\nsakazakii group); and (v) similar to FF�H�E. sakazakii group, but L. bulgaricus was\nadministered in the first feed after birth and then E. sakazakii was administered\n(FF�H�L. bulgaricus�E. sakazakii group). A total of 30 animals per group were\nused. Blood and intestinal tissues were obtained at 4 days postinfection. NEC was\ngraded microscopically by a pathologist blinded to groups, from grade 0 (normal) to\ngrade 4 (severe), based on pathological manifestations including submucosal edema,\nvillus core edema, epithelial sloughing/obliteration, neutrophil infiltration, intestinal\nperforation, and necrosis (33).\n\nE. sakazakii binding assays using IEC-6 cells. The binding of E. sakazakii to\nconfluent monolayers of IEC-6 cells was performed as previously described (16). In\nseparate experiments, L. bulgaricus was added at an MOI of 10 (106 CFU) for 1 h\nto confluent monolayers of IEC-6 cells in 24-well tissue culture plates. After pre-\ntreatment, E. sakazakii was added at an MOI of 100 (107 CFU) and further incu-\nbated for various periods. The cells were washed with Hanks buffered salt solution\nthree times after the incubation period, and the monolayers were solubilized with\n0.3% Triton X-100 for 8 min. The contents were removed, and serial dilutions were\nmade, plated onto blood agar, and incubated at 37°C overnight. The numbers of\nCFU were recorded and the percent binding calculated.\n\nEvaluation of apoptosis in vitro after E. sakazakii exposure, using immuno-\ncytochemistry and ImageStream technology. IEC-6 cells were grown to 90%\nconfluence in four-well chamber slides and infected for various periods with E.\nsakazakii. Cells were washed with PBS, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde for 20\nmin at room temperature, and assessed for apoptosis by use of an ApoTag Red\nin situ apoptosis detection kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and DAPI (4�,6-\ndiamidino-2-phenylindole) staining. Cells were visualized using a Leica DMRA\nfluorescence microscope equipped with Plan-Apochromat 40�/1.25-numerical\naperture and 100�/1.40-numerical aperture oil immersion objective lenses. Im-\nages were acquired with a SkyVision-2/VDS digital charge-coupled device cam-\nera (12-bit; 1,280 by 1,024 pixels) with open lab software. TIFF images were\nassembled and labeled with Adobe Photoshop, version 6.0. IEC-6 cells in solu-\ntion were infected with GFP-labeled E. sakazakii for 4 h, washed, and stained\nwith annexin V. After being stained, cells were washed, fixed with 4% parafor-\nmaldehyde for 20 min, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution\nfor 10 min. Stained cells were resuspended in PBS, and 7-aminoactinomycin D\n(7-AAD) (40 �M; Invitrogen, Molecular Probes) was added 5 min before anal-\nysis. Samples were run directly on an ImageStream system 100 machine (Amnis\nCorporation, Seattle, WA) without any cell classifier (instrument threshold).\nSignals from fluorescein isothiocyanate, 7-AAD, and phycoerythrin-Cy5 were\ndetected by channels 3, 4, and 5, respectively, while side scatter and bright-field\nimages were collected in channels 1 and 2, respectively. The methodology was\napplied for experiments comparing the size, N/C ratio (the relative fluorescence\nintensity of probes in the cytoplasm and nucleus), and cytoplasmic area. Imagery\nwas analyzed using the IDEAS software package.\n\nAssessment of microbial attachment to and ultrastructure of IEC-6 cells by\nscanning and transmission electron microscopy. IEC-6 cells were grown to 90%\nconfluence and treated with various concentrations for various durations with E.\n\n1032 HUNTER ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nsakazakii and/or L. bulgaricus. Samples were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1\nM cacodylate buffer, pH 7.1, with 1% sucrose. All samples were washed three\ntimes in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 15 min each and then postfixed for 20 min\nin 1% osmium tetroxide at 4°C. Ethanol (EtOH) (60%) was added to each dish.\nCells were scraped with a rubber scraper and spun at 5,000 rpm for 4 min. The\npellet was resuspended in 70% EtOH at 20°C. Samples were dehydrated through\n70, 80, 95, and 100% EtOH (two times, for 15 min each) and then into propylene\noxide (two times, for 15 min each) and a 1:1 propylene oxide-Eponate mixture\nand left overnight, capped, at room temperature. The propylene oxide-Eponate\nmixture was decanted and replaced with 100% Eponate mixture. The samples\nwere polymerized at 70°C for 48 h. Thin sections (�80 nm; silver) were cut using\na diamond knife, mounted on uncoated 300-mesh copper grids, and stained with\n5% uranyl acetate for 15 min. The sections were viewed and photographed in an\nFEI Tecnai Twin 12 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan\nUltra Scan 1000 charge-coupled device camera. For scanning electron micros-\ncopy, IEC-6 cells were grown on glass coverslips, fixed as described for trans-\nmission electron microscopy, transferred to a critical point dryer holder, washed\ntwo times with buffer, and dehydrated in 60, 70, 80, and 95% EtOH (4 min each)\nand then 100% EtOH (two times, for 5 min each) before being critical point\ndried in CO2 for 35 min. The coverslips were then mounted on aluminum\nscanning electron microscopy stubs with colloidal silver and sputter coated with\nPt-Pb (80:20) for 20 s in argon gas. The cells were then viewed and photographed\nin an FEI Quanta 200 environmental scanning electron microscope under high\nvacuum (City of Hope Hospital, Duarte, CA).\n\nGene array analysis. IEC-6 cells were grown to 90% confluence in 60-mm\nplates and exposed for 6 h to E. sakazakii (MOI of 100), L. bulgaricus (MOI of\n10), L. bulgaricus and E. sakazakii together, L. bulgaricus for 1 h followed by E.\nsakazakii, or medium alone. Total RNAs were collected using a Qiagen kit and\nused for microarray processing on an Affymetrix GeneChip rat exon 1.0 ST array\ncovering over 800,000 exon clusters within the transcribed regions of the entire\nrat genome. Gene expression was obtained using the robust multichip analysis\n(RMA) algorithm from an Affymetrix expression console 1.1 on multiple probes\non different exons after a probe set summarization (annotation file RaEx-1_0-\nst-v1) was calculated for all transcripts from the same gene. In addition to this\nalgorithm, which performs the background correction and quantile normaliza-\ntion for each array, the subsequent transcript values were renormalized to the\nmean for the �-actin probe set summarization levels. Log ratios were calculated\nacross conditions, and gene groups were preselected and viewed using Cluster 3.0\n(metric � average) and TreeView (http://genome-www5.stanford.edu/).\n\nStatistical analysis. Where appropriate, Mann-Whitney analysis, chi-square\ntest, or Student’s t test was performed. P values of �0.05 were considered\nsignificant.\n\nRESULTS\n\nE. sakazakii-induced NO production is responsible for apop-\ntosis of intestinal epithelial cells. Enhanced production of NO\nhas been demonstrated to play a role in the pathogenesis of\nNEC (9, 10). Sustained release of NO as a result of iNOS\nupregulation may lead to cellular injury and gut barrier failure.\nAs mentioned earlier, iNOS is upregulated in the gastrointes-\ntinal tract in rats exposed to endotoxin and in the intestinal\nmucosa in patients with active ulcerative colitis (see reference\n16 and the references therein). Therefore, we speculate that E.\nsakazakii interaction with intestinal epithelial cells might in-\nduce increased production of NO, thereby causing apoptosis of\nthe cells. To test this hypothesis, we initially determined the\nproduction of NO in IEC-6 cells infected with E. sakazakii for\n2 and 6 h, using the Greiss method. As shown in Fig. 1A, the\nsupernatants of uninfected IEC-6 cells contained 100 pg/ml of\nNO, whereas infection with E. sakazakii for 2 h increased the\n\nFIG. 1. E. sakazakii-induced NO production is responsible for the\napoptosis of IEC-6 cells. (A) Confluent monolayers of IEC-6 cells,\neither nontransfected or transfected with siRNA, were treated with E.\nsakazakii (ES) for 2 h or 4 h, the supernatants were collected and\ncentrifuged to remove the bacteria, and NO production was deter-\nmined by the Greiss method. Wild-type IEC-6 cells demonstrated a\nsmall increase in NO production by 2 h and a 10-fold increase after 6 h\nof exposure (*, P � 0.002), and NO production decreased significantly\nin siRNA-iNOS/IEC-6 cells (**, P � 0.001). The experiments were\ncarried out separately in triplicate at least three times. (B) IEC-6 cells\nwere infected with E. sakazakii for various periods, total RNA was\nextracted, and RT-PCR was performed using primers for iNOS and\nRPS-17. RNA expression was determined by semiquantitative PCR. In\nseparate experiments, total cell lysates were prepared from IEC-6 cells\ninfected with E. sakazakii for 6 h, and equal quantities of proteins were\nsubjected to Western blotting using anti-iNOS or anti-�-actin anti-\nbody. (C) Confluent monolayers of IEC-6 cells, either nontransfected\n\nor transfected with siRNA to iNOS or eNOS, were left untreated\n(control) or infected with E. sakazakii for the indicated periods, and\nthe monolayers were assessed for apoptosis by TUNEL staining using\nan ApoTag kit.\n\nVOL. 77, 2009 LACTOBACILLUS PROTECTION IN E. SAKAZAKII-INDUCED NEC 1033\n\n\n\nproduction to 170 pg/ml. A 10-fold increase in the production\nof NO was observed at 6 h postinfection, indicating that E.\nsakazakii can efficiently produce NO in IEC-6 cells. To further\ndefine the specificity of NO production in response to E. saka-\nzakii, IEC-6 cells were transfected with siRNA for either iNOS\nor eNOS (negative control) and subjected to E. sakazakii in-\nfection. Knocking down iNOS activity significantly reduced NO\nproduction by E. sakazakii to basal levels, whereas siRNA for\neNOS had no effect. Next, RNAs were isolated from IEC-6\ncells infected with E. sakazakii for various periods and exam-\nined for increased transcript of iNOS by RT-PCR. The expres-\nsion of iNOS was increased at 3 h postinfection (Fig. 1B),\nwhereas the expression of RPS-17, encoded by a housekeeping\ngene, was similar at all time periods, suggesting that E. saka-\nzakii increased NO production by inducing the transcription of\niNOS at the gene level. The increased iNOS activity was also\nconfirmed by Western blot analysis at 6 h postinfection. To\nconfirm our hypothesis that E. sakazakii-induced NO produc-\ntion is responsible for IEC-6 cell apoptosis, siRNA-transfected\nIEC-6 cells were infected for various times and then stained\nwith ApoTag. This method identifies apoptotic cells by staining\nfragmented DNA, which is present at a late stage in apoptosis.\nUninfected and nontransfected IEC-6 cells revealed no or very\nfew apoptotic cells at 6 h of culture (Fig. 1C). The cells trans-\nfected with control siRNA upon infection with E. sakazakii\nshowed a gradual increase in the number of apoptotic cells by\n6 h. In contrast, siRNA-iNOS/IEC-6 cells revealed no or very\nfew apoptotic cells compared to siRNA-eNOS/IEC-6 cells, in\nwhich the number of apoptotic cells was similar to that in E.\nsakazakii-infected cells. These data suggest that E. sakazakii-\ninduced NO production in IEC-6 cells is responsible for the\nobserved apoptosis of IEC-6 cells.\n\nL. bulgaricus decreases E. sakazakii-induced iNOS expres-\nsion in IEC-6 cells. As mentioned earlier, oral administration\nof probiotic bacteria reduced the severity of NEC. However,\nthe choice of the type of probiotic and the mechanism by which\nprobiotic bacteria protect against NEC are not clearly defined.\nThe L. bulgaricus strain used in these studies was deposited\nwith ATCC as L. bulgaricus. Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp.\nbulgaricus is used in industrial yogurt starter cultures. Yogurt\nhas traditionally been considered a probiotic carrier food with\nhealth-promoting effects, although the probiotic status of L.\nbulgaricus is still debated (13, 44). In addition, L. bulgaricus has\nbeen shown to survive efficiently in the gastrointestinal tract\n(7). Therefore, to examine whether our choice of L. bulgaricus\ninhibits iNOS activity induced by E. sakazakii in infected IEC-6\ncells, total RNA was isolated from IEC-6 cells pretreated with\nor without L. bulgaricus for 1 h followed by further infection\nwith E. sakazakii for 3 h and then subjected to RT-PCR for\niNOS mRNA expression. The increased iNOS expression ob-\nserved in IEC-6 cells infected with E. sakazakii was suppressed\nby pretreatment with L. bulgaricus (Fig. 2A). Similarly, NO\nproduction in response to E. sakazakii was significantly re-\nduced to basal levels when L. bulgaricus was added 1 h prior to\ninfection with E. sakazakii. NO production remained at basal\nlevel in cocultures even after prolonged exposure (24 h) or\nafter treating the cells with high doses of E. sakazakii (up to 109\n\nCFU/ml) (data not shown). To examine whether the decreased\nNO production in IEC-6 cells infected with E. sakazakii was\ndue to inefficient binding of E. sakazakii to IEC-6 cells, binding\n\nassays were performed using IEC-6 cells with or without pre-\ntreatment with L. bulgaricus. As shown in Fig. 2B, the binding\nof E. sakazakii to IEC-6 cells increased with time, and L.\nbulgaricus pretreatment had no effect. The binding of E. saka-\nzakii to cells in the presence of L. bulgaricus was also confirmed\nby transmission electron microscopy of infected cells. E. saka-\nzakii-infected cells revealed a high degree of membrane ruf-\nfling compared to cells pretreated with L. bulgaricus, although\nE. sakazakii attachment was not affected (Fig. 2C). Further-\nmore, to determine whether L. bulgaricus is able to protect\nagainst E. sakazakii-induced apoptosis, we assessed the in-\nfected cells by ApoTag staining. L. bulgaricus by itself did not\nincrease apoptosis in IEC-6 cells, regardless of dose or dura-\ntion of exposure (Fig. 2D). E. sakazakii produced a high degree\nof apoptosis after 6 h of infection in IEC-6 cells (21%). Re-\nmarkably, L. bulgaricus pretreatment significantly inhibited E.\nsakazakii-induced apoptosis, resulting in only 0.2% apoptotic\ncells (P � 0.001 by two-tailed t test). Taken together, these\ndata suggest that L. bulgaricus prevents E. sakazakii-induced\napoptosis of IEC-6 cells by suppressing NO production.\n\nTo further examine whether IEC-6 cells associated or in-\nfected with E. sakazakii undergo apoptosis, ImageStream flow\nanalysis was performed. ImageStream technology is uniquely\nsuited to the measurement of apoptosis, as the imagery allows\nfor a number of advantages, as follows: first, the use of bright-\nfield imagery, dark-field scatter, and nuclear imagery (with the\naddition of a DNA binding dye) to classify cells via morpho-\nmetric changes, such as nuclear pyknosis, during the process of\napoptosis; second, to combine these classifiers with established\nassays; and finally, to make use of the imagery to minimize\nfalse-positive and false-negative events. For instance, nuclear\nfragments from apoptotic cells have been observed to bind to\nthe surfaces of healthy cells in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl-\ntransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)\nassay, creating a population of false-positive cells. The imagery\nprovided by ImageStream technology can classify these events\nand eliminate them from the assessment of apoptosis. Figure\n2E shows that IEC-6 cells associated with GFP-labeled E.\nsakazakii had increased annexin V and 7-AAD staining com-\npared to uninfected control cells, whereas IEC-6 cells pre-\ntreated with L. bulgaricus had significantly reduced apoptotic\nmarkers despite having attached E. sakazakii. Gliotoxin, used\nas a positive control to treat IEC-6 cells, also showed apoptotic\nmarkers by this analysis (data not shown). Taken together,\nthese data suggest that L. bulgaricus prevents E. sakazakii-\ninduced apoptosis of IEC-6 cells by suppressing NO produc-\ntion.\n\nL. bulgaricus promotes structural integrity of IEC-6 cells\nand enterocytes in infant rats despite infection with E. saka-\nzakii. To examine whether L. bulgaricus pretreatment protects\nagainst the morphological changes induced by E. sakazakii\ninfection, IEC-6 cells infected with E. sakazakii were subjected\nto scanning electron microscopy. Control IEC-6 cells exposed\nto medium alone showed small hairy microvilli on the surface,\nwhereas infection with E. sakazakii for 6 h induced a balding\npattern with a loss of such structures (Fig. 3A, panels a to c).\nSeveral E. sakazakii cells were attached to the surfaces of\nIEC-6 cells. Pretreatment with L. bulgaricus protected against\nthe loss of microvillus structure (Fig. 3A, panel f). Although\nvery few L. bulgaricus organisms were attached to the cells, E.\n\n1034 HUNTER ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nFIG. 2. Pretreatment with L. bulgaricus prevents E. sakazakii-induced apoptosis in IEC-6 cells. (A) Total cell lysates of IEC-6 cells, either noninfected,\ninfected with E. sakazakii (ES) or L. bulgaricus (LB), or pretreated with L. bulgaricus for 1 h followed by infection with E. sakazakii (LB�ES) were subjected\nto Western blotting with anti-iNOS or anti-�-actin antibody. A positive control for iNOS was also included in the blot. (B) Confluent monolayers of IEC-6 cells\nwere infected with E. sakazakii for various periods and washed, and the number of bound E. sakazakii cells was determined as described in Materials and\nMethods. In separate experiments, IEC-6 cells were pretreated with L. bulgaricus for 1 h followed by E. sakazakii for the indicated periods. (C) IEC-6 cells\ninfected with E. sakazakii or pretreated with L. bulgaricus for 1 h followed by E. sakazakii infection for 6 h were subjected to transmission electron microscopy.\nMagnification, �6,500. (D) IEC-6 cells that were uninfected, infected with E. sakazakii, or pretreated with L. bulgaricus followed by E. sakazakii (LB�ES) for\n6 h were subjected to TUNEL staining using an ApoTag kit. (E) IEC-6 cells were left uninfected (control), infected with GFP-labeled E. sakazakii alone (two\npanels of images are shown), or pretreated with L. bulgaricus for 1 followed by GFP-labeled E. sakazakii (LB�ES) for 4 h. The cells were stained with annexin\nV and 7-AAD as described in Materials and Methods and subjected to ImageStream analysis. The picture is representative of several cells screened for apoptosis.\n\n1035\n\n\n\nsakazakii still bound to these cells in a similar manner to that\nwith untreated cells. These data suggest that L. bulgaricus is\nable to promote both micro- and macroscopic intestinal villus\nhealth despite the binding of E. sakazakii. Previous studies\nhave shown that enterocytes of infant rats lose their integrity\nunder experimental conditions that induce NEC (17). There-\nfore, to examine whether L. bulgaricus pretreatment promotes\nintestinal health in vivo, rat pups were fed with formula or\nformula plus L. bulgaricus, E. sakazakii, or E. sakazakii and L.\nbulgaricus together or were pretreated with L. bulgaricus prior\nto receiving daily formula with E. sakazakii under hypoxic\nconditions. Intestinal segments were collected, fixed, embed-\nded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A\npathologist blinded to groups analyzed the samples. Intestinal\ndamage was scored as follows: 0, healthy; 1, mild damage; 2,\nmoderate injury; 3, severe injury; and 4, complete destruction\nof the intestine. Intestinal segments from animals fed with\nformula alone showed no damage to villi, whereas intestines\nfrom E. sakazakii-infected animals revealed a significant loss of\nvilli, with infiltration of neutrophils (Fig. 3B, panels a and b).\nAn intestinal segment that was severely damaged by E. saka-\nzakii is shown, although the average morphological changes\nwere less than those depicted in the figure. Feeding with L.\nbulgaricus alone demonstrated no alterations in intestinal in-\ntegrity, which was similar to that in formula-fed animals (Fig.\n3B, panel c). Animals fed with formula containing L. bulgaricus\nand E. sakazakii together showed some protection against E.\nsakazakii-induced microvillus destruction. However, a signifi-\ncant infiltration of neutrophils was still observed (Fig. 3B,\npanel d). Interestingly, pretreatment of animals with L. bul-\ngaricus prior to infection with E. sakazakii decreased the de-\ngree of intestinal injury (Fig. 3B, panel e). Pathology scores\nalso demonstrated that E. sakazakii induced significantly\ngreater morphological changes in intestinal segments than\nthose in control animals, which were prevented by L. bulgaricus\npretreatment of the animals (for FF�H group versus E. saka-\nzakii group, P � 0.001; for E. sakazakii group versus L. bul-\ngaricus-plus-E. sakazakii group, P � 0.001; for L. bulgaricus\ngroup versus FF�H group, P � 0.029; and for L. bulgaricus\ngroup versus L. bulgaricus-plus-E. sakazakii group, P � 0.280)\n(Fig. 3C). These data suggest that pretreatment with L. bul-\ngaricus prior to infection with E. sakazakii preserves enterocyte\nintegrity both in vitro and in vivo. However, L. bulgaricus\ntreatment after or together with E. sakazakii is not protective.\n\nSuppression of E. sakazakii-induced differential gene ex-\npression in IEC-6 cells by L. bulgaricus pretreatment. Our data\nso far suggest that E. sakazakii-induced NO production might\nbe responsible for apoptosis of IEC-6 cells, but to further\nuncover the cellular signaling events induced by E. sakazakii\ninfection and whether L. bulgaricus pretreatment modulates\nthese events, we conducted a whole-genome-based transcrip-\ntion analysis. IEC-6 cells were treated with E. sakazakii, L.\nbulgaricus, or L. bulgaricus and E. sakazakii together or were\npretreated with L. bulgaricus for 1 h followed by E. sakazakii\nfor 6 h. Total RNA was isolated from these cells and used for\nwhole rat genome DNA microarray analysis, which is a pow-\nerful tool for the investigation of the genomic response to\nbacterial infections. A fundamental concern with this approach\nis the vast number of genes that are modulated by various\ntreatments; therefore, the separation of candidate genes that\n\nFIG. 3. L. bulgaricus pretreatment preserves the integrity of intestinal\nepithelial cells. (A) IEC-6 cells treated with bacteria as described in the legend\nto Fig. 2 and processed for scanning electron microscopy at 6 h postinfection.\n(B) Newborn rats were either left uninfected or infected with E. sakazakii by\nbeing fed 105 CFU once a day under hypoxic conditions. The animals were\nsacrificed after 4 days, intestines were collected, and sections of intestine were\nparaffin embedded and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In separate ex-\nperiments, newborn rats were either pretreated with 105 CFU of L. bulgaricus\nalone (c) or fed with L. bulgaricus and E. sakazakii together (d) or L. bulgari-\ncus for 1 day followed by E. sakazakii (e). (C) The intestinal sections stained\nwith hematoxylin and eosin were scored by a blinded pathologist and\ngraphed. A protective effect of L. bulgaricus pretreatment is clearly seen in the\npresence of E. sakazakii compared with the effect of E. sakazakii alone (*, P �\n0.001).\n\n1036 HUNTER ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nare relevant to apoptosis from those that are merely epiphe-\nnomena is difficult. For this reason, data were arranged by\ngrouping the genes into the following four categories: (i) apop-\ntosis genes, (ii) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) sig-\nnaling genes, (iii) common cytokine-related genes, and (iv)\nToll-like receptor (TLR) genes. As shown in Fig. 4A, E. saka-\nzakii induced the activation of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\nfamily members Tnf, Tnfrsff5, Tnfrsf1b, Tnfrsf11b, and\nTnfrs10 and the apoptotic proteins Bik, Bnip3, Bid3, and\nBnip1. Similarly, caspase 6, caspase 9, and caspase 8 genes\nwere also activated by E. sakazakii compared to those in un-\ntreated cells. Notably, none of these molecules was upregu-\nlated by L. bulgaricus treatment alone. However, they were\nsuppressed more than 50% when the cells were pretreated with\nL. bulgaricus but not when L. bulgaricus was added together\nwith E. sakazakii. Apoptosis pathway information generated by\nKEGG revealed that most of the proapoptotic genes were\ninduced by TNF-\t-mediated signaling (Fig. 4B). The KEGG\npathways were compiled from multiple literature sources and\nintegrate individual components into a unified pathway (24,\n25). At the same time, several antiapoptotic genes, such as the\nDad1 gene, were also downregulated with E. sakazakii infec-\ntion. Nonetheless, the ratio of pro- and antiapoptotic re-\nsponses dictates whether the cell should undergo apoptosis.\n\nAnother finding of the comparative gene expression analysis\nwas increased levels of cytokines and chemokines. Of all genes,\nthe CCL2, CXCL1, CCL7, and CCL20 genes showed the great-\nest increases (three- to fivefold compared to controls) (Fig.\n4C). TNF-\t and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production increases dur-\ning NEC in humans, which is in agreement with our previous\ndata showing increased expression of these cytokines in an\nexperimental animal model of NEC (17). The gene array data\nalso revealed increased expression of iNOS, by �2-fold, in E.\nsakazakii-treated cells and a reduction in expression of 50%\nwhen IEC-6 cells were pretreated with L. bulgaricus prior to E.\nsakazakii infection. In contrast, treatment with L. bulgaricus\nand E. sakazakii together did not change the upregulation of\niNOS, similar to our RT-PCR data. Previous studies demon-\nstrated that NEC in mice and humans is associated with in-\ncreased expression of TLR4 in the intestinal mucosa and that\nphysiological stressors associated with NEC development sen-\nsitize the murine intestinal epithelium to lipopolysaccharide\nthrough upregulation of TLR4 (22, 28). Our microarray data\nshowed that TLR6 and TLR2 were upregulated significantly\nmore than TLR4 was (Fig. 4D). Previous studies have shown\nthat lipopolysaccharide induces the production of COX-2 in\nIEC-6 cells via the p38 MAPK pathway (12). In agreement\nwith this observation, the gene array analysis also showed that\nCOX-2 expression was increased 1.3-fold when IEC-6 cells\nwere treated with E. sakazakii and was reduced 60% when cells\nwere pretreated with L. bulgaricus prior to E. sakazakii treat-\nment. Notably, the expression of several MAPKs in E. sakaza-\nkii-treated IEC-6 cells was reduced at least below the control\nlevels and those in L. bulgaricus-treated cells, although\nMAPKK2, MAPKK3, MAPK6, MAPK7, MAPK10, MPAK12,\nand MAPK13 levels were increased marginally (average of\n0.6-fold) (Fig. 4E). Taken together, these data indicate that E.\nsakazakii induces apoptosis-related, cytokine, TLR, and signal-\ning pathway gene expression in IEC-6 cells and corroborate the\nbiochemical data obtained by various other methods.\n\nPrevention of E. sakazakii-induced NEC in infant rats by\npretreatment with L. bulgaricus. To examine whether pretreat-\nment with L. bulgaricus prior to E. sakazakii infection prevents\nthe induction of NEC in vivo, newborn rats were fed with\ndifferent regimens as described earlier. First, intestinal seg-\nments from these rats were stained with anti-iNOS antibody to\nexamine its expression. The sections were mounted in DAPI-\ncontaining solution so that nuclei were also stained. Intestinal\nsegments from control and L. bulgaricus-treated animals showed\nno or very little expression of iNOS, whereas rats infected with\nE. sakazakii or E. sakazakii and L. bulgaricus together revealed\nsignificant increases in iNOS expression in enterocytes (Fig.\n5A). Newborn rats pretreated with L. bulgaricus, in contrast,\nhad reduced expression of iNOS. In addition, the mucosal\nlinings of intestinal segments at 2 and 4 days postinfection were\nscraped and subjected to Western blotting with anti-iNOS an-\ntibody. The control group showed a basal level of expression of\niNOS, whereas the group infected with L. bulgaricus alone\ndemonstrated no detectable iNOS (Fig. 5B). However, the E.\nsakazakii group had a marked increase in iNOS expression.\nThis induction was ameliorated in animals that received pre-\ntreatment with L. bulgaricus prior to the E. sakazakii infection\nbut not in animals fed with E. sakazakii and L. bulgaricus\ntogether. Densitometric analysis of the iNOS bands revealed\nthat L. bulgaricus prevented the E. sakazakii-induced expres-\nsion of iNOS fivefold (Fig. 5C). The data suggest that prophy-\nlactic L. bulgaricus prevents E. sakazakii-induced iNOS induc-\ntion, thereby protecting enterocytes. However, L. bulgaricus\ndoes not attenuate iNOS when administered simultaneously\nwith E. sakazakii inoculation. In agreement with these in vitro\nobservations, L. bulgaricus-pretreated animals survived for\nlonger periods than did E. sakazakii-infected animals (P �\n0.001 by chi-square test; n � 30 for each group). Notably,\ncontrol group animals also showed increased mortality, which\ncould be due to the hypoxic conditions utilized in the experi-\nments. However, animals receiving E. sakazakii and L. bulgari-\ncus together showed no such protective effect. Pups that were\nadministered L. bulgaricus prior to the initiation of E. sakazakii\ninfection also had a significantly lower degree of E. sakazakii\nbacteremia than did those fed E. sakazakii alone (P � 0.001)\n(data not shown). Together, these data suggest that L. bulgari-\ncus pretreatment of infant rats protects against the deleterious\neffects of E. sakazakii by downregulating the NO production\ninduced by E. sakazakii. These data also indicate that under-\nlying physiological conditions such as hypoxia might also in-\ncrease the severity of disease due to E. sakazakii infection.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nNEC is a devastating disease of neonates and is associated\nwith high morbidity and mortality (17). The present manage-\nment of NEC includes prompt clinical diagnosis, fluid resusci-\ntation, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and in\nsevere cases, surgical resection of affected intestine. Currently,\nthere is no single effective preventive strategy for this life-\nthreatening disease. Three major factors have been associated\nwith the development of NEC, including the presence of a\npathogenic organism, enteral feeding, and altered enteric mu-\ncosal integrity. We recently demonstrated that oral feeding of\nE. sakazakii induces NEC in a rat pup model of NEC (16). E.\n\nVOL. 77, 2009 LACTOBACILLUS PROTECTION IN E. SAKAZAKII-INDUCED NEC 1037\n\n\n\nFIG. 4.

The attachment\nof E. sakazakii to enterocytes in the infected animals caused\nenterocyte apoptosis. However, the mechanisms involved in E.\nsakazakii-induced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells are\nstill undefined. NO is a key mediator in NEC and serves as\nboth a marker and a propagator of intestinal inflammation\n(33). Overexpression of NO or its toxic metabolite, ONOO\n,\nmay promote mucosal injury and gut barrier failure, possibly\nthrough the induction of enterocyte apoptosis. Our data dem-\nonstrate that E. sakazakii induces significantly larger amounts\nof NO in IEC-6 cells. Suppression of NO production using\nsiRNA to iNOS inhibited E. sakazakii-induced apoptosis, in-\ndicating that NO is responsible for E. sakazakii-induced apop-\ntosis of IEC-6 cells. One potential mechanism for NO-medi-\nated and ONOO\n-mediated cell death is through the\ndisruption of mitochondrial function. NO has been shown to\nreversibly inhibit cellular respiration of IEC-6 cells and to\nresult in decreased ATP levels in Caco-2BBe cells (35, 39).\n\nRecently, several randomized prospective clinical studies\nwere performed in human infants, with prophylactic oral pro-\nbiotics administered to newborns in neonatal intensive care\nunits (2, 4, 15, 29). Each of the studies reported a decreased\nincidence of NEC after probiotic administration. Probiotics,\nsuch as Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus\nLA5 and NFCM, Lactobacillus casei Shirota, Streptococcus\nthermophilus, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium bifidum,\nEscherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and Enterococcus faecium\nPR88, to name a few, are regarded as bacteria that confer a\nbeneficial effect to the host (5, 18, 19). However, in the clinical\nstudies there was no standardization of the type of probiotic\nbacteria used or the dosage administered. A systematic review\nof randomized clinical trials performed by several investigators\nrevealed that treatment with various probiotics, such as L.\nlactis, L. rhamnus GG, L. acidophilus, S. thermophilus, and\nBifidobacterium infantis, showed a trend toward less NEC (1).\nNonetheless, there is a lack of understanding regarding the\nmechanisms by which probiotics promote intestinal health and\npotentially prevent NEC. Although the native intestine actively\nworks to protect itself from pathogenic bacteria, it is essential\nfor normal gut health and function to have a diverse intestinal\nmicroflora that includes commensal (probiotic) organisms\n(17). It has been proposed that probiotics may increase mucus\nproduction, inhibit bacterial translocation, modulate microflo-\nral adherence, and prime the gut immune system (18, 19, 31).\nThe L. bulgaricus strain used in this study was deposited as L.\nbulgaricus with ATCC, but the probiotic status of this strain is\nunknown at present. In addition, the extracts of L. bulgaricus\ndisplayed cytoprotective effects on intestinal epithelium (23).\nOur studies also show that L. bulgaricus pretreatment pre-\nserves the microvillus architecture, despite concurrent E. saka-\nzakii infection. Notably, no significant difference in the adher-\nence of E. sakazakii was observed in L. bulgaricus-pretreated\nIEC-6 cells. Microvilli increase the surface area of cells and are\ninvolved in a wide variety of functions, including absorption,\nsecretion, cellular adhesion, and mechanotransduction. Loss of\nmicrovilli is severely detrimental to intestinal and host health.\nCongenital infantile absence of microvilli is characterized by\nfatal disease in humans (36). Therefore, we concluded that L.\nbulgaricus prevents the deleterious effects of E. sakazakii by the\n\nfollowing three possible mechanisms: (i) L. bulgaricus may\ndirectly affect the expression of E. sakazakii virulence factors,\n(ii) L. bulgaricus may promote intestinal health by increasing\nintestinal defenses (immune and/or innate) against E. sakaza-\nkii, or (iii) L. bulgaricus may protect against NEC through a\ncombination of both of these mechanisms. L. bulgaricus pro-\ntection against E. sakazakii-induced NEC could be due to\ndownregulation of iNOS expression enhanced by E. sakazakii,\nthereby suppressing NO production and apoptosis both in vitro\nand in vivo. A simultaneous decrease in intestinal apoptosis\nwas noted in pups pretreated with oral L. bulgaricus prior to E.\nsakazakii inoculation. Therefore, the ability of L. bulgaricus to\nprotect this microvillus architecture may, in part, explain its\nability to prevent pathogen-induced NEC.\n\nVarious inflammatory mediators, including TNF-\t, IL-1�,\nIL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and NO, have been implicated in the patho-\ngenesis of NEC (32). Our previous and present studies re-\nvealed that E. sakazakii interaction with IEC-6 cells induced\nsignificantly greater quantities of IL-6 and NO (14). In agree-\nment with these observations, the gene array analysis also\nrevealed that expression of IL-6 and NO was increased in\nresponse to E. sakazakii infection, along with that of IL-1, IL-8,\nIL-10, and TNF-\t. Notably, the expression of CCL2, CCL7,\nand CCL20 was increased �3-fold in infected IEC cells. Var-\nious enteropathogenic but not commensal bacteria stimulated\nCCL20 and IL-8 gene expression (21). Under steady-state con-\nditions, immature dendritic cells (DCs) are continually enter-\ning the gut, probably via a constitutive CCL20-dependent\nmechanism, and are sampling antigens (41). The absence of\ninjury and/or the anti-inflammatory environment of the gut has\nbeen proposed to induce tolerance because antigen presenta-\ntion by DCs occurs in the absence of costimulation (27). The\ncoupling of CCL20 and IL-8 transcriptional activation could be\ncrucial for the induction of protective immune responses in the\ngut. In pathogens, flagella are expressed during infection, and\nthe associated motility is crucial for virulence. Flagellin was\nalready known to induce proinflammatory IL-8 chemokine ex-\npression in epithelial cells (26, 42). The resulting inflammation\nprovides danger signals, especially TNF-\t and IL-1 cytokines,\nrequired for DC maturation. Thus, DCs attracted upon flagel-\nlin stimulation may be fully activated and potent stimulators of\nadaptive responses. The recruitment of memory CD4 and B\nlymphocytes by CCL20 could also contribute to immunity in\nthe gut (6). However, it is not clear at this time whether\nflagellin of E. sakazakii contributes to the induction of IL-8\nexpression. The data in this report indicate that screening of E.\nsakazakii-stimulated gene expression by gene array techniques\ncan uncover previously undetected but important potential in\nvitro correlates of cellular immunity. Although there is no\nexperimental proof at this stage of our analysis for all of the\ngene products, we assume that the majority of differential gene\nexpression is caused by adherent E. sakazakii cells. Further\nanalysis of complete gene sets may disclose additional biomar-\nkers of immune status. Correlation of gene expression patterns\nwith studies of protective efficacy may allow delineation of a\nprotective profile that could improve screening of vaccine can-\ndidates. Alternatively, identification of novel genes that are up-\nor downregulated specifically in antigen-stimulated E. sakaza-\nkii-immune cells could suggest new regulatory mechanisms or\neffector functions that operate in E. sakazakii-induced NEC.\n\nVOL. 77, 2009 LACTOBACILLUS PROTECTION IN E. SAKAZAKII-INDUCED NEC 1041\n\n\n\nIn summary, L. bulgaricus confers protection from NEC by\npreventing E. sakazakii-induced iNOS induction and entero-\ncyte apoptosis. L. bulgaricus further maintains macro- and mi-\ncrovillus structure and decreases intestinal injury and morpho-\nlogical disruption. In order for L. bulgaricus to exert its\nbeneficial effects, it must be administered prophylactically,\nsince the addition of L. bulgaricus after E. sakazakii infection\nfails to prevent enterocyte inflammation, restore normal mor-\nphology, or rescue E. sakazakii-infected pups from NEC. Al-\nthough these findings suggest that prophylactic L. bulgaricus\ncould be a successful strategy to prevent pathogen-induced\nNEC, there is insufficient evidence for extrapolation of these\nresults for global recommendations, as only one probiotic\nstrain and one E. sakazakii strain were used in this study. We\nare currently investigating the effects of various Lactobacillus\nstrains on other isolates of E. sakazakii from different sources,\nwhich may provide strategies to develop “potential probiotic”\ntherapy to treat and prevent NEC.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe are grateful for the technical assistance of Patricia Boyle, Xioru\nZhang, and Jin Wang.
