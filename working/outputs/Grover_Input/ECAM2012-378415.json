Antrodia cinnamomea (A. cinnamomea), a medicinal mushroom in Taiwan,\nhas shown antioxidant and anticancer activities. In this study, we first observed that ethanol extract of fruiting bodies of A. cinna-\nmomea (EEAC) exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on migration and motility of the highly metastatic CL1-5 cells\nin the absence of cytotoxicity. The results of a gelatin zymography assay showed that A. cinnamomea suppressed the activities of\nmatrix metalloproteinase-(MMP-) 2 and MMP-9 in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot results demonstrated that\ntreatment with A. cinnamomea decreased the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-2; while the expression of the endogenous inhibitors\nof these proteins, that is, tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) increased. Further investigation revealed that A. cinnamo-\nmea suppressed the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2. A. cinnamomea also suppressed the expressions of PI3K and\nphosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, treatment of CL1-5 cells with inhibitors specific for PI3K (LY 294002), ERK1/2 (PD98059),\nJNK (SP600125), and p38 MAPK (SB203580) decreased the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9. This is the first paper confirming\nthe antimigration activity of this potentially beneficial mushroom against human lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cancer cells.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nLung cancer has been the leading cause of cancer-related\nmortality worldwide. In some countries, it has become the\nnumber one cancer cause of death, accounting for more\nfatalities than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal\ncancer combined [1]. Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines\nCL1-0, CL1-1, CL1-5, and CL1-5-F4 are a series of sub-\nlines with progressively invasive ability established by in vitro\ninvasion screening. CL1-5 cells are a human lung adeno-\ncarcinoma cell line derived from the parental CL1 cells by\nfive successive Matrigel selections. CL1-5 cells showed a 4-\n\nto 6-fold higher invasive ability than the parental cells and\ntheir production of 92-kDa MMP-9 also exhibited a drastic\nincrease over that of their parental cells.\n\nMetastasis is a characteristic of highly malignant cancers\nwith poor clinical outcome. Malignant tumor progression\ndepends upon the capacity to invade, metastasize, and pro-\nmote the angiogenic host response. One critical characteris-\ntic that metastatic cancer cells have acquired is the ability to\ndissolve basement membranes and the extracellular matrix\n(ECM). This degradative process is mediated largely by\nmatrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are a large family\nof at least 20 zinc-dependent neutral endopeptidases that\n\nmailto:chhswu@mail.cmu.edu.tw\nmailto:soybean13mtdtw@gmail.com\n\n\n2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\ntogether can degrade all known components of ECM [2].\nMMP-9 is abundantly expressed in various malignant tu-\nmors and is postulated to play a critical role in tumor inva-\nsion and angiogenesis [3]. Thus, the inhibition of MMP\nactivity, including MMP-9, is important for the prevention\nof cell invasion. CL1-5 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma\ncell line, expressed an elevated level of MMP-2, MMP-9\nand exhibited a highly invasive and metastatic ability [4, 5].\nMeanwhile, the activity of MMPs is prone to the inhibition of\nendogenous tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs),\nwhich are specific inhibitors of MMPs, and the imbalance\nbetween MMPs and TIMPs may contribute to degradation or\ndeposition of ECM [6]. The mitogen-activated protein kina-\nses (MAPKs) play an important regulatory role in cell\ngrowth, differentiation, apoptosis, and metastasis [7]. In ad-\ndition, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/serine/threonine pro-\ntein kinase (or protein kinase B) (PI3K/Akt) signal trans-\nduction pathway is involved in the development, progression,\nand metastasis of various tumors [8–10].\n\nTraditionally, Antrodia cinnamomea (A. cinnamomea;\nalso named niu-chang-chih in Chinese) has been used as\na health food to prevent inflammation, hypertension, itchy\nskin, and liver cancer [11]. There is increasing evidence\nthat A. cinnamomea possesses an extensive range of bio-\nlogical activities, including the liver protection [12], anti-\ninflammation [13], and antioxidation [14]. Some reports\nhave suggested that extracts of mycelia and fruiting bodies\nof A. cinnamomea could be a potential chemotherapeutic\nagent against hepatoma, as well as prostate, breast, bladder,\nand lung cancer cells [15–20], the antimetastatic effect of\nA. cinnamomea in lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cancer cells\nis still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the\nantimetastatic effects of A. cinnamomea on a highly metas-\ntatic CL1-5 cell lines as well as the underlying mechanisms.\n\n2. Materials and Methods\n\n2.1. Chemicals. A. cinnamomea was kindly provided by Cos-\nmox Biomedical Co. Ltd. (Taoyuan, Taiwan). RPMI Medium\n1640, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium\nbromide (MTT), LY294002, SP600125, and SB203580 were\nobtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA).\nPD98059 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology\n(Beverly, MA, USA). Trypsin−EDTA, fetal bovine serum\n(FBS), and penicillin/streptomycin were from Gibco Life\nTechnologies, Inc. (Paisley, UK). Cell culture supplies were\npurchased from Costar (Corning, Inc., Cypress, CA, USA).\nThe antibody against AKT, Rac-1, MAPK/extracellular sig-\nnal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase\n(JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 MAPK pro-\nteins and phosphorylated proteins were purchased from Cell\nSignaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Anti-ERK1/2,\nanti-PI3K, antifocal adhesion kinase (FAK), anti-p-FAK,\nand horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG\nantibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology\nCo. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA), β-actin was purchased from\nChemicon (Temecula, CA, USA).\n\n2.2. Preparation of Ethanol Extract of Fruiting Bodies of A. cin-\nnamomea (EEAC). The fruiting body of A. cinnamomea was\nkindly provided by Cosmox Biomedical Co. LTD (Taoyuan,\nTaiwan) and identified by Dr. Chao-Lin Kuo (School of\nChinese Pharmaceutical Sciences and Chinese Medicine\nResource, Taiwan). A. cinnamomea was weighed about 1 kg\nand soaked in 10 L of 95% ethanol solution (extractive sol-\nvent) for 3 days at room temperature. The solid residue of\nthe above soaked herbs was filtered and discarded through\na Buchner funnel lined with Whatman filter paper, and the\nfiltrate was concentrated to paste by vacuum distillation\nusing the rotary evaporator (N-11, EYELA; Tokyo, Japan)\nand vacuum controller (VC-760, TAKARA; Tokyo, Japan) to\nmaintain the desired pressure and temperature at 25◦C with\n40 mmHg. The various concentration of EEAC was further\ndiluted with DMSO for the further use.\n\n2.3. Cell Culture. CL1-5 cell lines were kindly provided by Dr.\nW.-S. Wayne Chang (National Institute of Cancer Research,\nNational Health Research Institutes, Miaoli, Taiwan). The\ncells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Gibco, Grand\nIsland, NY, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco)\nat 37◦C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2.\n\n2.4. Cytotoxicity Assay. The cells (1× 105 cells/mL) were cul-\ntured in 96-well plate containing RPMI-1640 supplemented\nwith 10% FBS for 24 h to become nearly confluent. Then cells\nwere cultured with EEAC for 24 h and 36 h. Then, the cells\nwere washed twice with PBS and incubated with 100 μL of\n0.5 mg/mL MTT for 3 h at 37◦C, testing for cell viability. The\nmedium was then discarded and 50 μL of dimethylsulfoxide\n(DMSO) was added. After 10 min incubation, absorbance at\n590 nm was read by a microplate reader.\n\n2.5. Wound-Healing Assay. For cell motility determination,\nCL1-5 cells (2 × 105 cells/mL) were seeded in a 12-well\ntissue culture plate and grown to 80−90% confluence. After\naspiration of the medium, the center of the cell monolayers\nwas scraped with a sterile micropipette tip to create a denu-\nded zone (gap) of constant width. Subsequently, cellular\ndebris was washed with PBS, and CL1-5 cells were exposed\nto various concentrations of EEAC (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5,\nand 1.0 μg/mL). Wound closure was monitored and photo-\ngraphed at 0 h and 36 h with a Nikon inverted microscope.\nTo quantify the migrated cells, pictures of the initial wounded\nmonolayers were compared with the corresponding pictures\nof cells at the end of the incubation. Artificial lines fitting the\ncutting edges were drawn on pictures of the original wounds\nand overlaid on the pictures of cultures after incubation.\nCells that had migrated across the white lines were counted\nin six random fields from each triplicate treatment.\n\n2.6. Cell Migration Assay. Tumor cell migration was assayed\nin transwell chambers (Millipore) according to the method\nreported by Weng et al. [6] with some modifications. Briefly,\ntranswell chambers with 6.5 mm polycarbonate filters of\n8 μm pore size were used. CL1-5 cells (1 × 104 cells/mL) and\n0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/mL of EEAC were suspended\nin RPMI-1640 (100 μL, serum free), placed in the upper\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 3\n\ntranswell chamber, and incubated for 24 h at 37◦C. Then, the\ncells on the upper surface of the filter were completely wiped\naway with a cotton swab, and the lower surface of the filter\nwas fixed in methanol, stained with Giemsa, and counted\nunder a microscope at a magnification of 200x. For each\nreplicate, the tumor cells in 10 randomly selected fields were\ndetermined and the counts were averaged.\n\n2.7. Determination of MMP-2 and MMP-9 by Zymography.\nMMPs in the medium released from CL1-5 cells were assayed\nusing gelatin zymography (8% zymogram gelatin gels) accor-\nding to the methods reported by Weng et al. with some modi-\nfication [6]. Briefly, the culture medium was electrophoresed\n(80 V for 120 min) in a 8% SDS-PAGE gel containing 0.1%\ngelatin. The gel was then washed at room temperature in\na solution containing 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 with two\nchanges and subsequently transferred to a reaction buffer for\nenzymatic reaction containing 1% NaN3, 10 mM CaCl2 and\n40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37◦C with shaking overnight (for\n12−15 h). Finally, the MMP gel was stained for 30 min with\n0.25% (w/v) Coomassie blue in 10% acetic acid (v/v) and\n20% methanol (v/v) and destained in 10% acetic acid (v/v)\nand 20% methanol (v/v).\n\n2.8. Western Blotting Analysis. Whole-cell lysates proteins\n(40 μg of partially purified protein) were mixed with an equal\nvolume of electrophoresis sample buffer, and the mixture\nwas then boiled for 10 min. Then, an equal protein content\nof total cell lysate from control and EEAC-treated sample\nwere resolved in 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then\ntransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bed-\nford, MA, USA) by electroblotting using an electroblotting\napparatus (Bio-Rad). Nonspecific binding of the membranes\nwas blocked with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) contain-\ning 1% (w/v) nonfat dry milk and TBS-T buffer (Tris-Buffer\nSaline with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for more than 2 h. Mem-\nbranes were washed with TBS-T buffer three times each for\n10 min and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of\nspecific primary antibodies in TBS-T buffer overnight at 4◦C.\nThe membranes were washed with TBS-T buffer and then\nincubated with an appropriate secondary antibody (horse-\nradish peroxidase-conjugated, goat anti-mouse, or anti-rab-\nbit IgG) for 1 h. After washing the membrane three times for\n10 min in TBS-T buffer, the bands were visualized using ECL\nreagents (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Band intensity on\nscanned films was quantified using Kodak Molecular Imag-\ning (MI) software and expressed as relative intensity com-\npared with control.\n\n2.9. Statistical Analysis. Values are expressed as means ± SD\nand analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by LSD test\nfor comparisons of group means. All statistical analyses were\nperformed using SPSS for Windows, version 10 (SPSS, Inc.);\na P value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Cytotoxicity of EEAC to CL1-5 Cells. The effect of EEAC\n(0−128 μg/mL) on cell viability was determined by the MTT\n\nassay. After incubation for 24 h and 36 h, cell viability was not\nsignificantly affected by EEAC (0.125−1.0 μg/mL), as com-\npared to the untreated control (Figure 1(a)), indicating that\nEEAC is not toxic to CL1-5 cells at these concentrations.\nWhen cells were treated with EEAC at 1.0–128 μg/mL for\n24 h and 36 h, cell viability was significantly decreased.\nEEAC (0.125–1.0 μg/mL) were also evaluated their apoptotic\neffect with flow cytometry, and SubG1 was not significantly\naffected by EEAC (0.125−1.0 μg/mL), as compared to the un-\ntreated control (Figure 1(b)). To avoid inhibition of cell via-\nbility in the following experiments, we chose to use EEAC\nconcentrations between 0.125 and 1.0 μg/mL and an incuba-\ntion time of 36 h.\n\n3.2. Effect of EEAC on Wound-Healing Assay. We further as-\nsessed the effect of EEAC on the migration of CL1-5 cells\nusing the wound healing assay in which the confluent mono-\nlayer was scraped with a sterile micropipette tip to create\na scratch wound. As shown in Figure 2(a), EEAC inhibited\nthe migration of CL1-5 cells in a dose-dependent manner,\nwith 27.7% and 40.1% inhibition at 0.5 and 1.0 μg/mL after\nincubation for 36 h, respectively, (Figure 2(b)).\n\n3.3. Effect of EEAC on Migration of CL1-5 Cells In Vitro.\nThe transwell assay was used to investigate the migration\nof CL1-5 cells at 24 h after EEAC treatment. We found that\nEEAC added at 0.125−1.0 μg/mL significantly decreased the\nmigration (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) of CL1-5 cells and that\nthese effects of EEAC were dose dependent.\n\n3.4. EEAC Inhibits the Release of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CL1-5\nCells. To examine the possible antimigration mechanisms of\nEEAC, we determined the activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in\nculture media of CL1-5 cells by zymographic analysis. In the\nabsence of treatment, CL1-5 cells constitutively secreted high\nlevels of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Our results showed that EEAC\ninhibited MMP-9 and MMP-2 activities in a concentration-\ndependent manner (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)). These results\nsuggest that the antimigration effect of EEAC is related to\nthe inhibition of the enzymatically degradative processes of\nCL1-5 migration.\n\n3.5.

To further investigate the involvement of\nPI3K/AKT, a series of experiments was performed to measure\nthe expression of candidate signaling molecules upon EEAC\nstimulation.

Specific Inhibitor to Analyze the Signaling Transduction.\nTo further delineate whether the inhibition of cell migration\nby EEAC occurs through inhibition of PI3K, ERK, JNK, and\np38 signaling, CL1-5 cells were 1 h pretreated with a PI3K\ninhibitor (LY294002; 50 μM), ERK1/2 inhibitor (PD98059;\n50 μM), JNK inhibitor (SP600125; 50 μM), p38 MAPK inhi-\nbitor (SB203580; 50 μM), and then incubated in the presence\nor absence of EEAC (1.0 μg/mL) for 36 h. The Western blot-\nting assay revealed that EEAC or LY294002 (50 μM), PD98-\n256 (50 μM), SP600125 (50 μM), SB203580 (50 μM) alone\ndecreased MMP-9 and MMP-2 protein expressions. Further-\nmore, the combined treatment (50 μM, LY294002, SB203580,\nSP600125 and PD98059 plus 1.0 μg/mL EEAC) resulted in\nenhanced inhibition of MMP-9 and MMP-2 (Figure 7(b)).\n\n4. Discussions\n\nSeveral cancer cell lines including A498, NPC-TW01, Hep3B,\nHepG2, TW206, CL1-0, and CL1-5 have been screed for their\ncell cytotoxicity at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h. Our results showed\nthat CL1-0 (IC50 = 16 μg/mL) and CL1-5 (IC50 = 16 μg/mL)\nexhibits more susceptible to EEAC than other cells for 36 h\nexposure. As CL1-5 cells showed higher metastatic ability, we\nexplored the antimigration effects and mechanistic actions\nof EEAC in human lung adenocarcinoma CL1-5 cells. Our\nresults demonstrate that EEAC significantly inhibited the\nmigration (assessed using the transwell assay and the wound-\nhealing assay) of CL1-5 cells (Figures 2 and 3). We also\nshowed that EEAC remarkably inhibited the activities of\nMMP-2 and MMP-9 (Figure 4). These results demonstrated\nthat the antimetastastic effect of EEAC was associated with\n\nthe inhibition of enzymatically degradative processes of\nsmooth muscle cells migration. To our knowledge, it is the\nfirst study to demonstrate that EEAC reduces the biochemical\nmechanisms of the migration in CL1-5 cells.\n\nSeveral bioactive compound from the ethanol extract\nof A. cinnamomea, such as antroquinonol, 4-acetylantro-\nquinonol B, and zhankuic acid A, have been reported to\nreduce cell proliferation of hepatoma, colon and leukemia\ncancer cells [21–23]. Our previous studies demonstrated that\nthe marked compounds (i.e., adenosine, cordycepin, and\nzhankuic acid A) within EEAC were identified by HPLC and\nLC/MS/MS to be as indicator compounds for quality check\nof extraction procedure of each batch (data not shown).\nAccording to the relative concentration of external standards,\nthe content of adenosine, cordycepin and zhankuic acid A\nwere calculated to be 0.08, 0.16, and 235 mg/g EEAC, res-\npectively, (data not shown). Of these, adenosine might be\nthrough binding to adenosine A3 receptors (A3-AR) to dec-\nrease the telomeric signal, resulting in G0/G1 arrest of lym-\nphoma cell. Moreover, A3 receptor antagonist cotreated with\ncordycepin would reverse cordycepin-induced in mouse Ley-\ndig tumor cell death, which indicate the possible relationship\nbetween A3-AR and cordycepin-induced death effect [24,\n25]. Wu et al. indicated that cordycepin could induce cell\narrest at G2/M and subG1 phases followed by significant\napoptotic cell death in human OEC-M1 oral cancer cell line\n[26]. Similarly, cordycepin has also been found to cause\nG2/M arrest in human bladder and colon cancer cells\nthrough upregulation of p21WAF1 level as well as reduction of\ncyclin B1, Cdc2, and Cdc25c proteins in a p53-independent\nmanner by regulating c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation\n[27, 28]. Furthermore, Geethangili and Tzeng reported that\nzhankuic acid A exhibited cytotoxic activity against P-388\nmurine and leukemia cells with an IC50 value of 1.8 and\n5.4 μg/mL, respectively, [29].\n\nDuring cancer progression, certain tumor cells become\nmotile and attack the host tissue leading to metastasis.\nFocal adhesion kinase (FAK) can be activated in response to\nvarious stimuli and plays an important role in the cancer\n\n\n\n6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine\n\n24 h\n\n36 h\n\n0 μg/mL 0.25 μg/mL 0.5 μg/mL 1 μg/mL\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n∗\n∗∗ ∗\n\n0 0.25 0.5 1 0 0.25 0.5 1\n\nM\nig\n\nra\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\no\n\nl)\n\nM\nig\n\nra\nti\n\no\nn\n\n (\n%\n\n o\nf \n\nco\nn\n\ntr\no\n\nl)\n\nEEAC (μg/mL) EEAC (μg/mL)\n\n24 h\n36 h\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: Effects of EEAC on (a) transwell migration assay of CL1-5 cells.

Compiling evidence\nimplies that FAK regulates focal adhesion signaling by phos-\nphorylating various substrates and by acting as a scaffold\nfor protein-protein interactions, as well as the MMPs-medi-\nated matrix degradation, which consecutively regulates\ndownstream signaling cascades [31]. FAK, a cytoplasmic kin-\nase that is involved in ECM and integrin-mediated signaling\npathways, has been suggested to have an essential role in\nmetastasis through the modulation of tumor cell migration\nand invasion [32]. Majorly, integrin-mediated FAK signaling\nis phosphorylation of Tyr397. Particularly, phosphorylation of\nTyr397 forms a high-affinity binding site for Src-homology\ndomain 2 (SH2), domains of Src family kinase, therefore\npromoting Src kinase activity. As a result, a major function of\nFAK is to recruit and activatr Src at cell-extracellular matrix\nadhesion sites. Activated FAK in cancer cells relays signals\nthrough multiple downstream targets. For example, activa-\nted FAK binds the SH2 of PI3K, thereby transporting the\ncatalytic subunit of PI3K to the membrane, where it catalyzes\nthe phosphorylation of inositol lipids in lung cancer cell\nmigration [33]. The residues surrounding Tyr397 can also\nconstitute a sequence that binds to the Ras signaling pathway.\nThe downstream targets of the Ras signaling pathway include\nERK1/2 [34]. Indeed, these pathways are activated during\n\nintegrin binding to the ECM, resulting in the transduction\nof external stimuli from the ECM to the nucleus [35]. Cer-\ntain result suggests that anti-invasive effect in androgen-in-\ndependent prostate cancer by controlling MMP-9 expression\nthrough the suppression of the EGFR/JNK pathway [36].\nFAK and MAPK signaling involved in MMP-2 secretion has\nbeen shown in QG90 lung cancer cells [37]. Moreover, it was\nfound that the MMP-9 gene promoter is partially regulated\nthrough activation of the ERK1/2 pathway [38]. In recent,\np38 is implicating mediating bladder cancer invasion via\nregulation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at the level of mRNA stabi-\nlity [39]. Also, p38γ MAPK activates c-Jun, and the activated\nc-Jun recruits p38γ as a cofactor into MMP-9 promoter to\ninduce its trans-activation and cell invasion [40]. In this\nstudy, we found that EEAC inhibited the activation of FAK, as\nevidenced by reduced phosphorylation of FAK (Figure 7(a)).\nWe also demonstrated that treatment with EEAC inhibited\nphosphorylation of ERK1/2, phospho-p38, and JNK1/2 acti-\nvity (Figure 7(a)). The use of specific inhibitors revealed that\nPI3K, ERK, JNK, and p38 play important roles in regulating\ncell death induced by EEAC in CL1-5 cells (Figure 7(b)). In\nthis study, the Western blotting assay was used to examine\nthe effects of specific MAPK inhibitors, as the same method\nhas often been used to examine the effects of specific MAPK\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7\n\n0 0.125 0.50.25 1\n\nEEAC (μg/mL)\n\nMMP-9\n\nMMP-2\n\n92 kDa\n\n72 kDa\n\n(a)\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n0 0.125 0.25 0.5 1\n\nMMP-9\nMMP-2\n\n∗ ∗\n∗\n\nM\nM\n\nP\n-2\n\nM\nM\n\nP\n-9\n\n (\n%\n\n c\no\n\nn\ntr\n\no\nl)\n\nEEAC (μg/mL)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4: Effects of EEAC on MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities of CL1-\n5 cells.

Therefore, it appears that FAK can promote\nCL1-5 cancer cell migration through the MAPK signaling\nand MMP-2 and MMP-9 pathway.\n\nIn addition, we showed that EEAC inhibited PI3K/AKT\nin CL1-5 cells. Thus, it seems that FAK promotes CL1-5\ncancer cell migration in concert with the activation of the\nPI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Increased phosphorylation\nof FAK and its downstream targets, Src, ERK1/2, PI3K,\nand AKT have been shown in A549 lung epithelial cells\nstimulated by fibronectin. Consistent with this observation,\ndepletion of FAK by siRNA resulted in the inhibition of Src,\nERK1/2, PI3K, and AKT activity [33]. Several studies have\nindicated that FAK/PI3K/Akt is involved in the regulation\nof MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities on different cell types\n[9, 41]. Shibata et al. [42] have shown that stimulated ovarian\ncancer cells with fibronectin activated MMP-9 secretion,\nwhile both antisense oligonucleotide to FAK and dominant-\nnegative mutation of Ras abolished this phenomenon. To\nassess whether EEAC inhibits the phosphorylation of FAK,\nAKT, and the protein level of PI3K, CL1-5 cells were treated\nwith various concentrations of EEAC (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and\n1.0 μg/mL) for 36 h. Figure 6 showed EEAC significantly\ninhibited the activation of FAK and AKT as shown by the\ndecrease in the phosphorylation of FAK and AKT. In ad-\ndition, EEAC inhibited the protein levels of PI3K in a dose-\ndependent manner (Figure 6). Zeng et al. [43] reported that\nactivated FAK-induced PI3K is required for the production\nof matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Also, PI3K is one of\nthe critical downstream signal molecules of FAK pathways\n[44].

The Rho family of GTPases has been reported to be\ninvolved in the regulation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kin-\nase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathway [46]. In addition, Camp-\nbell et al. [9] reported that PI3K/AKT signal transduction\npathway regulates cell invasion and metastasis of nonsmall\ncell lung cancer (NSCLC) and is closely associated with the\ndevelopment and progression of various tumors. Rac1 was\nreported to act as a downstream effect of PI3-K in several\ngrowth factor-stimulated pathways [47] and to induce inva-\nsion and metastasis in cancer cells [48]. Rac1 activation also\nplayed a critical role in the migration of cancer cells [49].\nRac-1 has been implicated in the regulation of the contrac-\ntion and retraction forces that are required for cell migra-\ntion [50]. Increased Rac-1 expression enhances the phos-\nphorylation of myosin, which cross-links actin filaments and\ngenerates contractile forces, promoting movement of the cell\nbody and facilitating cell rear detachment. Rac-1 is also im-\nplicated in the invasion of human microvascular endothelial\ncells. Active-Rac-1 could induce the expression of MMP-9\n\nmetalloproteinase and promote migration of endothelial\ncells [51]. Rac-1 may exert this activity through upregulate\ntranscription factors such as NF-κB known to be involved\nin the expression of certain metalloproteinases including\nMMP-9. Our finding that EEAC concentration dependen-\ntly decreased Rac-1 protein expression (Figure 6), suggest-\ning that EEAC may also inhibit the metastasis of CL1-5\ncells through the PI3K/Akt—Rac-1 and Rac-1—MMP-9\npathways.\n\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated that EEAC inhibits\nthe migration of human lung adenocarcinoma cancer CL1-5\ncells. Mechanistically, we show that this effect of EEAC may\noccur through inactivation of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway,\nexerting inhibitory effects on FAK, p-FAK, and Rac-1 protein\nexpressions and inhibiting PI3K, and phospho-Akt levels,\nthereby decreasing the activities of MMP-2, MMP-9 of CL1-\n5 cells (Figure 8). Further preclinical and clinical studies are\nrequired to demonstrate the potential of EEAC as an anti-\ncancer agent.\n\n\n\nEvidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 9\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n \n\nECM \n\nCytosol \n\nEEAC\n\np-FAK\n\nPI3K\n\np-ERK p-p38 p-JNK AKT\n\nRac-1\n\nMMP-2,\nMMP-9\n\nMigration\n\nFigure 8: Proposed signaling pathways for EEAC-mediated inhibi-\ntion against migration of CL1-5 cells.
