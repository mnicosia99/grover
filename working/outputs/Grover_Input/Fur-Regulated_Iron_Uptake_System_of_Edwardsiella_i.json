Iron Uptake System of Edwardsiella ictaluri and Its\nInfluence on Pathogenesis and Immunogenicity in the Catfish Host\n\nJavier Santander,a,b Greg Golden,a Soo-Young Wanda,a and Roy Curtiss IIIa,b\n\nThe Biodesign Institute, Center for Infectious Diseases and Vaccinology,a and School of Life Sciences,b Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, USA\n\nThe ability of bacterial pathogens to take up iron from the host during infection is necessary for their multiplication within the\nhost. However, host high-affinity iron binding proteins limit levels of free iron in fluids and tissues. To overcome this deficiency\nof iron during infection, bacterial pathogens have developed iron uptake systems that are upregulated in the absence of iron,\ntypically tightly controlled by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein. The iron uptake system of Edwardsiella ictaluri, a host-\nrestricted pathogen of channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and the main pathogen of this fish in aquaculture, is unknown. Here\nwe describe the E. ictaluri Fur protein, the iron uptake machinery controlled by Fur, and the effects of fur gene deletion on viru-\nlence and immunogenicity in the fish host. Analysis of the E. ictaluri Fur protein shows that it lacks the N-terminal region found\nin the majority of pathogen-encoded Fur proteins. However, it is fully functional in regulated genes encoding iron uptake pro-\nteins. E. ictaluri grown under iron-limited conditions upregulates an outer membrane protein (HemR) that shows heme-hemo-\nglobin transport activity and is tightly regulated by Fur. In vivo studies showed that an E. ictaluri �fur mutant is attenuated and\nimmune protective in zebrafish (Danio rerio) and catfish (Ictalurus punctatus), triggering systemic immunity. We conclude that\nan E. ictaluri �fur mutant could be an effective component of an immersion-oral vaccine for the catfish industry.\n\nVertebrates sequester iron from invading pathogens as a meansof nutritional immunity, using high-affinity iron binding\nproteins to limit levels of free iron in biological fluids and tissues in\norder to deprive pathogens of this key nutritional component.\nInvading bacterial pathogens sense this iron depletion as a signal\nthat they are within a host and induce the expression of genes that\nallow iron uptake in order to overcome the host defenses. To\nobtain this host sequestered iron, most pathogenic bacteria have\ndeveloped iron uptake systems that usually are siderophore medi-\nated or that directly take up iron from host proteins (50). Sidero-\nphore-mediated systems typically involve low-molecular-weight\nsiderophores released by the bacteria that chelate iron and subse-\nquently transfer it to iron-regulated outer membrane proteins\n(IROMPs) that function as receptors of the iron-siderophore\ncomplexes (39, 50). These siderophore mechanisms of iron acqui-\nsition have been linked to the virulence of different fish bacterial\npathogens, such as Vibrio anguillarum (Listonella anguillarum)\n(38, 73), Aeromonas salmonicida (24, 27), Photobacterium damse-\nlae subsp. piscicida (13), Edwardsiella tarda (25), and Tenacibacu-\nlum maritimum (2). Direct iron uptake systems from host pro-\nteins rely on the interaction between specific microbial receptors\nand host transferrin or heme-containing compounds (31, 41) and\noften involve bacterial hemolytic or proteolytic activity (10). Usu-\nally, both siderophore-mediated and direct iron uptake systems\nare controlled by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein (10).\n\nFur is a dimeric metal ion-dependent transcription regulator\nthat controls the expression of genes involved in a diversity of\ncellular functions, including iron uptake. Fur monomers typically\ncontain two structural domains, the N-terminal DNA binding\ndomain and the C-terminal dimerization domain (26, 28, 29).\nWhen Fur monomers are bound to Fe2�, they form a dimer that\nbinds to promoter DNA regions (Fur boxes), repressing gene ex-\npression (29). During oral-gastric infection, it is thought that the\nsmall intestine conditions are anaerobic and therefore replete with\nfree Fe2�, leading to an active Fur protein that represses genes\ninvolved in iron uptake. The iron uptake system is induced upon\n\ninvasion, when iron is presumably sequestered by host iron bind-\ning proteins (26, 28).\n\nChannel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) is the most important\naquaculture species in the United States, accounting for more than\n60% of all U.S. aquaculture production (20), and Edwardsiella\nictaluri is one of the most important pathogens in this industry\n(61). The most highly upregulated group of catfish genes follow-\ning E. ictaluri infection are the genes involved in iron homeostasis,\nincluding those for intelectin, haptoglobin, hemopexin (Wap65),\nceruloplasmin, transferrin, and ferritin (34, 35, 45, 46, 63). This\nindicates that there is a “tug of war” for the iron between the\ncatfish host and the bacterial pathogen E. ictaluri. While the iron\nacquisition system of E. ictaluri has not been previously character-\nized, we observed that E. ictaluri grown in the absence of iron\nupregulates synthesis of a specific outer membrane protein. This\nobservation prompted us to investigate the iron uptake system of\nE. ictaluri.\n\nIn this study, we characterized the E. ictaluri Fur protein, the\niron uptake system controlled by Fur, and the effects of the fur\ngene on virulence and immunogenicity in the fish host. We deter-\nmined that fish isolates of Edwardsiella have a fur gene that is\nsmaller than other fur family members, where its evolutionary\npathway may have undergone genome degradation. We also es-\ntablished that E. ictaluri does not secrete detectable siderophores\n\nReceived 4 January 2012 Returned for modification 27 February 2012\nAccepted 13 May 2012\n\nPublished ahead of print 21 May 2012\n\nEditor: A.

Salmonella �fur mutants\nare attenuated in mammals when administered orally (51) or in-\ntraperitoneally (16) but are not very immunogenic (11). We also\nevaluated the potential utilization of E. ictaluri �fur mutants as a\nlive attenuated vaccine. E. ictaluri �fur mutants were attenuated in\nzebrafish and catfish hosts. When E. ictaluri �fur mutants were\nadministered by immersion or orally, they conferred immune\nprotection, triggering systemic and skin immune responses.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nBacterial strains, plasmids, media, and reagents. The bacterial strains\nand plasmids used are listed in Table 1. Bacteriological media and com-\nponents were from Difco (Franklin Lakes, NJ). Antibiotics and reagents\nwere from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). LB broth (tryptone, 10 g; yeast extract\n5 g; NaCl, 10 g; glucose, 1 g; double-distilled water [ddH2O], 1 liter) (5),\nBacto brain heart infusion (BHI) broth, chromoazurol S (CAS) broth\n(58), and Trypticase soy broth (TSB) were used routinely. When required,\nmedia were supplemented with 1.5% agar, 5% sucrose, colistin sulfate\n(Col) (12.5 �g/ml), ampicillin (Amp) (100 �g/ml), chloramphenicol\n(Cm) (25 �g/ml), kanamycin (Km) (50 �g/ml), FeSO4 (150 �M)\n(Sigma), or 2,2=-dipyridyl (150 �M) (Sigma). Bacterial growth was mon-\nitored spectrophotometrically and/or by plating. Oligonucleotides were\nfrom IDT (Coralville, IA). Restriction endonucleases were from New Eng-\nland BioLabs. Taq DNA polymerase (New England BioLabs) was used in\n\nall PCR tests. Qiagen products (Hilden, Germany) were used to isolate\nplasmid DNA, gel purify fragments, or purify PCR products. T4 ligase, T4\nDNA polymerase, and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP) were from Pro-\nmega.\n\nSequence analysis. A nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool\n(BLAST) search was performed based on the sequences of the putative fur\nand heme uptake genes present in the genome sequence of E. ictaluri\n93-146 accessed from NCBI’s Entrez Genome database (NC_012779). fur\nsequences were obtained from NCBI’s Entrez Protein database for Ed-\nwardsiella ictaluri 93-146 (YP_002934295.1), E. tarda PPD 130/90\n(AEO72442.1), E. tarda EIB202 (YP_003296656.1), E. tarda FL6-60\n(ADM42454.1), E. tarda ATCC 23685 (ZP_06715756.1), Escherichia coli\nO157:H7 EDL933 (NP_286398.1), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi Ty2\n(NP_455254.1), Yersinia pestis KIM 10 (NP_668533.1), Vibrio cholerae\n(AAA27519.1), A. salmonicida A449 (YP_001143048.1), Pseudomonas\nputida (YP_001269900.1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NP_253452.1).\n\nAmino acid sequence alignments were performed using the CLC Free\nWorkbench software tool (v. 6.1; CLC bio A/S, Aarhus, Denmark). Pro-\ntein structure-based alignments were performed by using the web-based\ninterface for ESPript v.2.2 located at http://espript.ibcp.fr/ESPript/cgi-bin\n/ESPript.cgi (18). The three-dimensional (3D) structures of the E. ictaluri\nFur, HemP, HemR, HemT, HemU, HemV, and HemS proteins were pre-\ndicted using position-specific iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) alignment\nand HHpred (62).\n\nConstruction of E. ictaluri mutants. The recombinant pEZ suicide\nvectors (Table 1) carrying the linked flanking regions to generate an in-\nframe deletion of the fur or hmuR gene were constructed as described\npreviously (55–57). The defined deletion mutations encompass a deletion\n\nTABLE 1 Bacterial strains and plasmids\n\nStrain or plasmid Relevant characteristics\nSource or\nreference(s)\n\nStrains\nEscherichia coli\n\n�6212 �80dlacZ�M15 deoR �(lacZYA-argF)U169 glnV44 �� gyrA96 recA1 relA1 endA1 �asdA4\n�zhf-2::Tn10 hsdR17 (r� m�); F� Rec� (UVs) DAP� Lac� Nalr Tets\n\n12\n\n�7213 thi-1 thr-1 leuB6 glnV44 fhuA21 lacY1 recA1 RP4-2-Tc::Mu [�pir] �asdA4 �(zhf-2::Tn10);\nKmr Tets Amps DAP�\n\n52\n\n�7232 endA1 hsdR17 (rK\n� mK�) glnV44 thi-1 recA1 gyrA relA1 �(lacZYA-argF)U169 �pir deoR\n\n[�80dlac�(lacZ)M15]; Nalr UVs Thi� Lac�\n52\n\n�7122 O78 49\nEdwardsiella ictaluri\n\nJ100 Wild type; pEI1�; pEI2� API20E 40040057; smooth LPS; Colr; H2S\n� 47, 57\n\nJ135 J100 derivative; �fur-35; pEI1�; pEI2� API20E 40040057; smooth LPS; Colr; H2S\n� This study\n\nJ146 J100 derivative; �hmuR36; pEI1�; pEI2� API20E 40040057; smooth LPS; Colr; H2S\n� This study\n\nJ147 J135 derivative; �fur-35 �hmuR36; pEI1�; pEI2� API20E 40040057; smooth LPS; Colr; H2S\n� This study\n\nJ135 J100 derivative; �fur-35; pEI1�; pEI2� API20E 40040057; smooth LPS; Colr; H2S\n� This study\n\nSalmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium\n�3761 UK-1 21, 36\n�11143 UK-1 �fur-44 This study\n�11143(pEZ116) UK-1 �fur-44; pEZ116; Cmr This study\n\nPlasmids\npMEG-375 8,142 bp, Cm, Amp, lacZ, R6K ori, mob, incP, sacR, sacB 56\npR112 5173 bp, Cm, R6K ori, oriT, oriV, sacR, sacB 14\npACYC184 4,245 bp, Tetr, Cmr, p15A ori 7\npEZ151 4,065 bp, pSC101 ori, Gmr GFP� 55\npYA4807 �fur-44, Cm, pR112 This study\npEZ116 Pfur-fur, Cm\n\nr, pACYC184 This study\npEZ123 �fur-35, pMEG-375 This study\npEZ155 �hmuR36, pMEG-375 This study\npEZ191 Pfur-fur, Gm\n\nr, pEZ151 This study\npEZ192 Plac-hemR, Gm\n\nr, pEZ151 This study\n\nSantander et al.\n\n2690 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nincluding the ATG start codon but not including the TAG stop codon.\nThe primers used to construct the suicide vectors are listed in Table 2.\nPrimers 1 and 2 were designed to amplify the upstream gene-flanking\nregions. The downstream gene-flanking regions were amplified by prim-\ners 3 and 4. The flanking regions were ligated and cloned into pMEG-375\ndigested with SphI and XbaI. To construct E. ictaluri mutants, the suicide\nplasmid was conjugationally transferred from Escherichia coli �7213 (52)\nto E. ictaluri strains. Strains containing single-crossover plasmid inser-\ntions were isolated on BHI agar plates containing Col and Amp. Loss of\nthe suicide vector after the second recombination between homologous\nregions (i.e., allelic exchange) was selected by using the sacB-based sucrose\nsensitivity counterselection system (14) adapted to E. ictaluri (55, 57). The\ncolonies were selected for Amps and Colr and screening by PCR using\nprimers 1 and 4. Biochemical profiles of E. ictaluri strains were deter-\nmined using the API 20E system (bioMérieux, Marcy L’Etoile, France).\n\nConstruction of Salmonella Typhimurium �fur-44. The fur gene of\n�3761 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UK-1 (Table 1) was de-\nleted in frame mediated the previous suicide vector methodology (55, 57).\nThe primers used to construct the suicide vectors are listed in Table 2. The\nflanking regions were ligated and cloned into pRE112 (14) digested with\nBglII and XmaI. The S. Typhimurium �fur-44 mutation consisted of a\ndeletion of 706 bp, including 453 bp of the fur gene and 253 bp of the fur\npromoter region, with the Crp binding and the OxyR binding sites.\n\nComplementation of the fur and hemR genes. The fur gene of E.\nictaluri, with its own promoter, was cloned into the pAYCY184 vector (7)\nat the XbaI and HindIII restriction sites and into pEZ151 at the AdhI\nrestriction site. The primers used to amplify fur were 5=-TCGTCTAGAT\nGTCTGCCGCCTGCCGGCGC-3= (upstream) and 5=-CCCAAGCTTTC\nAGGCCTTTTCATCGTGCA-3= (downstream). XbaI and HindIII sites,\nrespectively, were included in these primers (underlined). The resulting\nplasmid, pEZ136, was used to complement Salmonella �fur-44 mutant\nstrains, and pEZ191 was used to complement E. ictaluri. The primers used\nto amplify hemR were 5=-TCGTCTAGATTTACACTTTATGCTTCCGG\nCTCGTATGTTATGCCTACGCTTTTCTCCCCTTCCCTACGC-3= (up-\nstream) and 5=-CCCAAGCTTCCGCTCGAGCTACCACTGGTAGCTG\nAGCAGCAGACGGGC-3= (downstream). XbaI and HindIII sites,\nrespectively, were included in these primers (underlined). The lactose\n\npromoter (Plac) was used to express the hemR gene. The resulting plasmid,\npEZ192, was used to complement E. ictaluri.\n\nSDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To evaluate the synthesis of Fur,\nthe strains were grown in 3 ml of BHI broth or LB broth at 28°C with\naeration (180 rpm). The samples were collected when the culture reached\nan absorbance of 0.85 (optical density at 600 nm [OD600] of 1.0 � 1.0 \t\n108 CFU/ml). One milliliter of culture was collected and prepared for\nWestern blot analysis (54). The total proteins were normalized using a\nNanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000) at 25 �g/�l, separated by 10%\n(wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophore-\nsis, and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (54). A fat-free milk\npowder solution (5%, wt/vol) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supple-\nmented with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) was used for blocking. The mem-\nbrane was incubated individually with a primary rabbit polyclonal anti-\nGroEL antibody (Sigma) (1:10,000) or rabbit polyclonal anti-Fur\nantibody (1:10,000) (60) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times\nwith PBS-T, and then incubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of alkaline phos-\nphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Sigma). Color\nwas developed with a mixture of nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-\nchloro-3-indolylphosphate mixture (NBT-BCIP) (Amaresco), chromo-\ngenic substrates for alkaline phosphatase.\n\nOMP isolation. Sarkosyl-insoluble outer membrane proteins (OMPs)\nwere obtained as previously described (55). OMPs were isolated from E.\nictaluri grown under iron-replete conditions (BHI broth and BHI broth\nsupplemented with 150 �m FeSO4). Iron-regulated outer membrane pro-\nteins (IROMPs) were isolated from E. ictaluri grown in BHI broth supple-\nmented with 2=2=-dipyridyl (150 �M) (iron-depleted conditions). The\nouter membrane proteins were normalized to 25 �g/�l by using the\nNanoDrop spectrophotometer (ND-1000) and separated by 10% (wt/vol)\nsodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Coo-\nmassie blue staining was performed to visualize proteins.\n\nProtein identification. The single protein band of \n72 kDa synthe-\nsized in the absence of iron or in E. ictaluri �fur mutants was excised from\nthe SDS-polyacrylamide gel for peptide sequencing analysis (ProtTech\nInc., Norristown, PA) by using NanoLC-MS/MS peptide sequencing\ntechnology. The protein gel band was destained, cleaned, and digested\nin-gel with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI).\nThe resulting peptide mixture was analyzed with a liquid chromatogra-\nphy-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) system, in which a high-\nperformance liquid chromatograph (HPLC) with a 75-�m-inner-diame-\nter reverse-phase C18 column was coupled to an ion trap mass\nspectrometer (Thermo, Palo Alto, CA). The mass spectrometric data were\nutilized to search the nonredundant protein database at the National Cen-\nter for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).\n\nDetection of secreted siderophores. Production of compounds with\nsiderophore activity was tested by the chemical assays described by\nSchwyn and Neilands (58) in solid and liquid media. The assays were\nperformed by spotting 10 �l of each bacterial culture grown under iron-\nlimiting conditions onto a modified chromoazurol S (CAS) (Sigma) agar.\nThe siderophore levels produced by the strains on plates were visualized\nby a yellow-orange halo around the bacterial colony after 18 to 72 h of\nincubation. For siderophore detection in liquid, supernatants from bac-\nterial cultures grown in BHI broth or LB broth supplemented with 2=2=-\ndipyridyl (150 �M) were mixed with CAS solution, and the absorbance of\nthe mixture was measured at 630 nm.\n\nIron-free siderophores were obtained by the following method. Bac-\nterial cultures grown in 5 ml of LB broth supplemented with 2=2=-dipyri-\ndyl (150 �M) or FeSO4 (150 �M) for 18 to 24 h at 28°C (OD600 of 1.0)\nwere harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 \t g for 10 min. The superna-\ntants were filtered through a 0.2-�m-pore-size membrane filter to com-\npletely remove the cells, acidified with 25 �l of 10 N HCl, and extracted\ntwice with a total of 4 ml of ethyl acetate for catechols and benzyl alcohol\nfor hydroxamates (44). The aqueous phase was dried with gaseous N2 and\nresuspended in 40 �l of methanol, and 10 �l was spotted onto 250-�m-\nlayer (20 by 20 cm) flexible PE SIL G/UV254 plates (Whatman).

Plates were then removed from the\nchamber, allowed to dry, and then immersed briefly in 0.1% FeCl3 to\nvisualize Fe binding compounds. Avian-pathogenic Escherichia coli\n�7122, S. Typhimurium UK-1 �3761 (36, 52), and S. Typhimurium\n�11143 �fur-44 were used as controls (Table 1).\n\nUtilization of heme and hemoglobin by E. ictaluri. Sterile filter paper\ndisks were placed onto a BHI agar plate supplemented with 2=2=-dipyridyl\n(150 �M) and swab inoculated with an E. ictaluri strain. The disks were\ninoculated with 5 �l of water (control), heme (10 �M; Sigma), and he-\nmoglobin (�9.3 �M; Sigma). The plates were incubated for 48 h at 28°C.\nGrowth around the paper disk indicated positive utilization of the iron\nsource.\n\nSemiquantitative RT-PCR. Expression of putative Fur-regulated\ngenes was evaluated by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). Total RNA\nextraction was performed with an RNeasy QIAgene kit from wild-type E.\nictaluri grown in the presence and absence of iron and from E. ictaluri J135\n�fur-35 grown in BHI. The cells were grown until late exponential phase\n(OD600 of 0.85; �1 \t 10\n\n8 CFU/ml). cDNA synthesis was performed with\nthe SuperScript III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) using ran-\ndom hexamer primers. Semiquantitative PCR was performed using the\nspecific primers listed in Table 2. The number of PCR cycles was normal-\nized to 27. The 16S rRNA (rrn) gene was used as an expression control,\nand fadR was used as a single-gene expression control.\n\nBacterial inoculate preparation. Bacterial strains were grown over-\nnight in standing cultures that were diluted 1:20 in prewarmed BHI broth\nwith mild aeration (180 rpm) at 28°C to an OD600 of 0.85 (�10\n\n8 CFU/ml).\nBacteria were sedimented for 10 min by centrifugation (5,865 \t g) at\nroom temperature and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline\ncontaining 0.01% gelatin (BSG) (12) to densities appropriate for the in-\noculation.\n\nInfection and immunization of zebrafish (D. rerio). The zebrafish\nchallenges were performed by the methodology described earlier (47),\nwith modifications (55, 57). The water temperature was 26 � 1°C, and the\nfish were acclimated for 2 weeks prior to the experiment. Groups of 12\nadult zebrafish (average weight, 0.5 g) were sedated in 100 mg/liter tric-\naine methanesulfonate (MS-222; Sigma) and injected intramuscularly\n(i.m.) with 10 �l of the bacterial suspension per fish. A 3/10-ml U-100\nultrafine insulin syringe with a 0.5-in.-long (ca. 1-cm-long) 29-gauge nee-\ndle (catalog no. BD-309301; VWR) was used to inject the fish. Two sets of\ncontrols were used: fish that were not injected and fish that were injected\nwith 10 �l of BSG (12). Moribund fish demonstrating clinical signs were\neuthanized, necropsied, and plated for enumeration of bacterial loads in\nvarious organs (47). Survivors of each dose at 4 weeks after i.m. inocula-\ntion were challenged with 105 CFU of E. ictaluri (100 50% lethal doses\n[LD50]). The fish were fed twice daily with TetraMin tropical fish flake\nfeed. During the experiments, the fish were observed daily, and every\nother day the water quality was monitored for pH, NO2, and NO3 with\nstandard kits (Lifegard Aquatics water testing strips). The LD50 for the\ninfection trials was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1).\nFish care and use were in accordance with the requirements of the Arizona\nState University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\ni.c. infection and immunization of catfish (I. punctatus). Specific-\npathogen-free channel catfish fingerlings with a mean weight of 18.5 � 1.3\ng were used. The animals were randomly assigned to treatment groups of\n10 to 25 fish each in 100-liter tanks. Each tank was equipped with a recir-\nculating, biofiltered, mechanically filtered, and UV-treated water system\nwith 12-h light cycle per day. The water temperature was set at 28 � 1°C\nduring the first 2 weeks of acclimatization and during the course of the\nexperiments. The fish were fed daily with commercial Aquamax grower\n400 (Purina Mills Inc., St. Louis, MO). During the experiments, the fish\nwere observed daily, and every other day the water quality was monitored\nfor pH, NO2, and NO3 with standard kits (Lifegard Aquatics water testing\nstrips). Catfish were infected by the intracelomic (i.c.) route with 105 to\n108 CFU of E. ictaluri strains (fish were not fed until 1 h after infection).\n\nThe fish were anesthetized with buffered tricaine methanesulfonate (pH\n7.5) (MS-222; Sigma) (100 mg/liter of water) prior to handling. The LD50\nwas calculated by the method of Reed and Muench (1). Moribund animals\nwere euthanized and then necropsied to evaluate the presence of E. ictaluri\nin kidney, spleen, and liver.\n\nImmersion immunization of catfish. Catfish fingerlings were im-\nmersed in a solution of E. ictaluri �fur-35 containing 107 CFU/ml for 30\nmin. At 6 weeks postimmunization, fish were challenged by immersion\nwith 107 CFU/ml of wild-type E. ictaluri (10 LD50) for 30 min. The ani-\nmals were fasted for 24 h prior to oral inoculation and for 1 h postinocu-\nlation. Nonimmunized animals were used as a control. During the exper-\niments, the fish were observed daily.\n\nOral immunization of catfish. Catfish were fasted for 24 h before oral\ninoculation with the E. ictaluri strains. Fish were anesthetized with buff-\nered tricaine methanesulfonate (pH 7.5) (100 mg/liter of water) prior to\nhandling. The animals were orally inoculated with 100 �l of the corre-\nsponding bacterial suspension (see below). BSG (12) was used as a con-\ntrol. The fish were not fed until 1 h after inoculation.\n\nDetermination of IgM titers in serum and skin mucus. Cutaneous\nmucus and blood samples were collected at both 2 weeks prior to immu-\nnization and 4 weeks postimmunization as described previously (55). Ten\ni.c. immunized fish and 10 immersion-immunized fish were sampled in-\ndividually. The experiment was repeated twice. E. ictaluri outer mem-\nbrane proteins diluted in 20 mM Tris-OH (pH 8.0) and purified E. ictaluri\nlipopolysaccharide (LPS) were independently applied to polyvinyl chlo-\nride 96-well plates, both at 100 ng per well. The plates were incubated\novernight at 4°C, washed once with 200 �l of PBS– 0.05% Tween (PBS-T)\nper well, and blocked with 1% sea buffer (Thermo, Rockford, IL) diluted\nin PBS (1 h at room temperature). Catfish serum samples diluted in PBS\n(1:2) and undiluted mucus samples were plated in triplicate wells at 100\n�l/well. Triplicate control wells on each plate contained diluted sera from\nimmunized and nonimmunized catfish. Mucus assays also included wells\nof pooled mucus from nonexposed fish. The plates were incubated over-\nnight at 4°C and washed five times with PBS-T. The biotinylated rabbit\nanti-catfish Ig antibody was applied at 0.25 to 0.50 �g/well. The plates\nwere incubated for 1 h at room temperature and were washed five times\nwith PBS-T. Application of the primary antibody was followed by appli-\ncation of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Southern Biotech,\nBirmingham, AL) diluted in PBS (1:50,000). The enzyme substrate p-\nnitrophenyl phosphate diethanolamine (100 �l; Sigma) was added and\nincubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with\n50 �l of 3 M NaOH. The absorbance (A405) values were determined on a\nkinetic microplate reader (model V-max; Molecular Devices Corp.,\nSunnyvale, CA) at 30 min and 1 h. The immunized fish were challenged at\n6 weeks postimmunization as described previously.\n\nStatistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) (SPSS software), followed\nby least-significant-difference (LSD) analysis, was used to evaluate differ-\nences in antibody titers, using 95% confidence intervals. The Kaplan-\nMeier method (SPSS software) was applied to obtain the survival fractions\nfollowing challenges. P values of \n0.05 were considered statistically sig-\nnificant.\n\nRESULTS\nSequence analysis of fur. An analysis of DNA and protein se-\nquences, structural alignment, predicted 3D structure, and pre-\ndicted binding residues revealed that the E. ictaluri and E. tarda\nFur proteins have several key differences from other bacterial iron\nregulator protein families (Fig. 1 to 3). This provides evidence that\nthese Fur proteins are members of a distinctive bacterial iron reg-\nulator protein family, shaped by gene reduction. The E. ictaluri fur\ngene sequence from E. ictaluri wild-type J100 is identical to the\nsequence from the E. ictaluri 93-146 strain published at the NCBI.\nIn comparison to E. coli and Salmonella fur genes, the E. ictaluri fur\ngene has a smaller open reading frame (ORF), and has a guanine\n\nSantander et al.\n\n2692 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nplus cytosine (G�C) content of 57%, which is 10% higher than\nthose of the Escherichia coli (48.5%) and Salmonella (47.7%) fur\ngenes (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). The fur gene\nsequences from the fish-isolated E. tarda PPD130/91 and E. tarda\nEIB202 (71) contain 333 identical base pairs, in contrast with the\nhuman-isolated E. tarda ATCC 23685, which contains a longer fur\ngene (435 bp) similar to those of the rest of the enteric bacteria (see\nFig. S1 in the supplemental material). The E. ictaluri fur promoter\nregion contains a Crp binding site, indicating that Crp might par-\nticipate in Fur regulation (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental mate-\nrial).\n\nThe Fur protein from fish-isolated E. tarda PPD130/91 and E.\ntarda EIB202 (71) contains 111 identical residues, in contrast with\nthe longer Fur proteins in E. coli (145 residues), Salmonella Typhi-\nmurium (150 residues), Yersinia pestis (148 residues), and other\nenteric bacteria (Fig. 1). Interestingly, the human-isolated strain\nE. tarda ATCC 23685 contains a longer Fur protein (145 residues)\nsimilar to those of the rest of the enteric bacteria, indicating that it\nmay be more adapted to humans than to fish. E. ictaluri 93-146\nand E. ictaluri J100 contain a shorter Fur with 104 identical resi-\ndues (Fig. 1). Alignment of these sequences showed that the N-ter-\nminal helices, �1, �2, and �3, at the DNA binding domain are\nmissing in E. ictaluri, as well as in the E. tarda fish-isolated Fur\nproteins (Fig. 1). The �4 helix at the Fur DNA binding domain is\nstill intact in E. ictaluri and E. tarda fish isolates, sharing about\n90% identity with other bacterial Fur proteins (Fig. 1). Structural\nprotein alignment between functional representative bacterial Fur\nproteins revealed that 37 amino acid residues out of 104 residues\n(�36%) are strictly conserved in E. ictaluri Fur (Fig. 1). E. ictaluri\n\nFur has 29%, 53%, 54%, 57%, and 93% amino acid similarity to\nthe Fur proteins of Pseudomonas, Escherichia coli, S. enterica, Y.\npestis, and E. tarda, respectively.\n\nIn terms of phylogeny, the fish-isolated Edwardsiella Fur pro-\nteins belong to a distinctive group compared to those from the rest\nof the Enterobacteriaceae family (Fig. 2). Although the Enterobac-\nteriaceae share a Fur ancestor, the only phylogenic group with a\nshort Fur protein among enteric bacteria is Edwardsiella (Fig. 2),\nindicating that Fur might have undergone host bacterial pathogen\nspecialization.\n\nStructural protein analysis showed that Edwardsiella Fur con-\ntains two domains, like other Fur proteins (32, 48). The DNA\nbinding domain harbors the Zn2� bond residues, and the\ndimerization domain harbors the Fe2� bond residues (Fig. 1 and\n3A and B). We observed that E. ictaluri Fur, as well as the E. tarda\nFur (only fish-isolated strains), do not contain the �-helices �1,\n�2, and �3 (Fig. 1). Analysis of the residues related to the Zn2�\n\nand Fe2� bonds showed they are located in positions similar to\nthose for their corresponding residues in the Pseudomonas Fur\nprotein but misplaced with respect to their corresponding resi-\ndues in E. coli Fur. Specifically, the E. coli Fur-related residues\nCys92 and Cys95 required for the Zn2� bond (17, 32) (in E. icta-\nluri Fur, Cys48 and Cys51 [Fig. 3A and C]) and the residues\nCys132 and Cys88 required for the Fe2� bond (17, 32) (in E. icta-\nluri Fur, Cys93 and Cys88 [Fig. 3A and C]) are located at the loop\nregion in E. ictaluri Fur (Fig. 3A and C). The Pseudomonas Fur-\nrelated residues His24, His86, Asp88, and Glu107 required for the\nZn2� bond (48) (in E. ictaluri Fur, Glu36, His45, and Glu56 [Fig.\n3B and D]) and the residues His32, Glu80, His89, and Glu100\n\nFIG 1 E. ictaluri Fur alignment and secondary structure. The white stars indicate the residues related to the Zn2� binding pocket. The black stars indicate the\nresidues related to the Fe2� binding pocket. The black circles indicate the cysteine residues related to E. coli Fe2� and Zn2� binding pockets. The secondary\nstructure at the top of the alignment corresponds to the E. ictaluri Fur protein. The secondary structure at the bottom of the alignment corresponds to the\nEscherichia coli Fur protein. Spirals represent �-helices, and arrows represent \r-sheets.\n\nIron Uptake by E. ictaluri\n\nAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2693\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nrequired for the Fe2� bond (48) (in E. ictaluri Fur, His42, Glu63,\nHis80, and Glu90 [Fig. 3D and E]) are located in their respective\ndomains within E. ictaluri Fur (Fig. 3B, D, and E). In P. aeruginosa,\nthe Fur residue His32 is required for the Fe2� bond and is essential\nfor its activity (4). However, the N-terminal region, where His32\nwould normally be located, is absent in the E. ictaluri Fur protein\n(Fig. 1). Spectroscopic and biochemical data have shown that the\nstructural zinc sites in the P. aeruginosa and E. coli Fur proteins are\ndifferent, which might be related to their specific functions in the\ndifferent organisms. However, in both the E. coli and P. aeruginosa\nFur proteins, the N-terminal region is essential for Fur activity (4,\n9). On the other hand, the importance of the cysteines is different\nin E. coli Fur and in P. aeruginosa Fur, because the Cys92 and\nCys95 bound to Zn2� in E. coli Fur are essential for its activity (8).\nThe single cysteine residue in the P. aeruginosa Fur is dispensable\nfor its in vivo activity (33), and it is absent in other Pseudomonas\nFur proteins, such as P. putida Fur (Fig. 1). Based on the above\nanalysis, we believe that E. ictaluri Fur is a distinct Fur protein\namong the Fur family. Further structural information on the E.\nictaluri Fur protein is necessary for a better understanding of the\nspecific structure-function relationship within the Fur family.\n\nComplementation of the fur gene. The structural analysis of E.\nictaluri Fur indicated that the overall domain organization is dif-\nferent from that of other Fur family members, but it has the same\nset of key residue groups and likely a similar mechanism as other\nFur proteins (Fig. 1 to 3). To further evaluate the functionality of\nE. ictaluri Fur, we complemented �fur mutants of Salmonella en-\nterica with the E. ictaluri Pfur-fur gene cloned into the low-copy-\nnumber plasmid pEZ136 (Table 1). S. enterica serovar Typhimu-\nrium �fur-44 was utilized for complementation assays (Table 1).\nS. enterica �fur mutants present a constitutive synthesis of\nIROMPs and secretion of siderophores (Fig. 4A to C). E. ictaluri\nPfur-fur complements S. enterica �fur-44 mutants, repressing\nIROMP and siderophore synthesis in an iron-dependent fashion\n(Fig. 4). This indicates that the missing N-terminal region, (con-\ntaining the �1, �2, and �3 helices) is not essential for the Fur\nfunction (59).\n\nSiderophore synthesis in E. ictaluri. Results from CAS liquid\nand plate assays showed that E. ictaluri does not synthesize detect-\nable siderophores (Fig. 5A). Although the E. ictaluri chromosome\ncontains a ferric enterobactin transport protein (FepE, sidero-\nphore receptor; NC_012779.1) and a TonB-dependent fer-\n\nFIG 2 Molecular phylogenetic analysis of fur. The evolutionary history was inferred by using the maximum-likelihood method based on the Tamura-Nei model\n(65). The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 100 replicates is taken to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed (15). Branches corresponding\nto partitions reproduced in fewer than 50% bootstrap replicates are collapsed. Initial trees for the heuristic search were obtained automatically as follows. When\nthe number of common sites was less than 100 or less than one-fourth of the total number of sites, the maximum-parsimony method was used; otherwise, the\nBIONJ method with MCL distance matrix was used. The analysis involved 48 nucleotide sequences. Codon positions included were first, second, third, and\nnoncoding. There were a total of 546 positions in the final data set. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA5 (64). The gold lines indicate a representative\narchaea fur evolutionary path, the green lines indicate the Enterobacteriaceae fur family evolution path, and the red lines indicate the fish-isolated Edwardsiella fur\nevolution path.\n\nSantander et al.\n\n2694 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nrichrome receptor protein (FcuA; NC_012779.1), thin-layer chro-\nmatography (TLC) analysis showed that E. ictaluri does not\nsecrete either catechol- or hydroxylamine-related siderophores or\nheme binding molecules (data not shown), regardless of the pres-\nence of iron in the growth medium or Fur protein (Fig. 5B). Our\nresults correlate with previous observations (67) and with the fact\nthat siderophore biosynthesis genes are not present in the E. icta-\nluri chromosome (72).\n\nFur iron-regulated outer membrane proteins and heme up-\ntake machinery. Wild-type E. ictaluri grown under iron limiting\nconditions and E. ictaluri �fur-35 mutants both upregulate an\nIROMP of �72 kDa, indicating that this protein is iron-Fur de-\npendent and related to iron acquisition (Fig. 5C to E). Protein\nidentification indicated that this IROMP corresponds to a TonB-\ndependent heme receptor protein (HemR) (Fig. 6). The gene en-\ncoding HemR is part of the hemPRSTUV operon, which contains\nthe genes required for the synthesis of the heme uptake machinery\n(Fig. 6).\n\nStructural analysis of the iron uptake proteins reveled that\nthese are similar to the putative E. tarda heme uptake system and\n\nto the Yersinia heme uptake system (Fig. 6). The outer membrane\nreceptor HemR contains a \r-barrel structure with a cork required\nto transfer the heme into the cell (Fig. 7). Structural analysis of\nHemR predicts a signal sequence peptide in the N-terminal region\n(see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material), which was observed in\n8% SDS-PAGE gel analysis (data not shown). The predicted\nmodel of heme transport is described in Fig. 7 and consists of the\nfollowing steps. First, heme is transferred into the cell, mediated\nby HemR, where it is captured by HemT, a periplasmic hemin\nbinding protein. It is then transported through the cytoplasmic\nmembrane by the ATP-dependent HemU-HemV cytoplasmic\nmembrane ABC transport complex. Once heme is transferred to\nthe cytoplasm, it is captured by HemS, a predicted heme degrada-\ntion-storage protein (Fig. 7).\n\nE. ictaluri uses heme and hemoglobin as iron sources, medi-\nated by HemR. To determine whether E. ictaluri has a functional\nheme-hemoglobin uptake system, we constructed an E. ictaluri\n�hemR mutant (thereby disrupting heme-hemoglobin receptor\nsynthesis) (Fig. 8A to C). E. ictaluri iron-depleted cells grow\npoorly in iron-depleted medium. Wild-type E. ictaluri iron-de-\n\nFIG 3 E. ictaluri Fur protein functional analysis.

Residues E36, H45, and E56, related to the Zn2� binding pocket, and residues H42, E63, and H80, related to the Fe2�\n\nbinding pocket, are related to the Pseudomonas Fur protein. Residues C51 and C48, related to the Zn2� binding pocket, and residues C88 and C93, related to the\nFe2� binding pocket, are related to the Escherichia coli Fur protein and are misplaced in the overall E. ictaluri Fur protein structure.\n\nIron Uptake by E. ictaluri\n\nAugust 2012 Volume 80 Number 8 iai.asm.org 2695\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\npleted cells were able to grow in iron-depleted medium when it\nwas supplemented with heme or hemoglobin as an iron source\n(Fig. 8D and G).

We identified a Fur box with an F-F-X-R\norientation at the hem operon, between the �4 and �14 positions\nin the hemP gene (Fig. 9A). The Fur binding box in the F-F-X-R\nconformation found in E. ictaluri is similar to the Pseudomonas\naeruginosa Fur binding box (40) (Fig. 9A).\n\nUsing the consensus hexamers for the E. ictaluri Fur box, we\nidentified six different promoters not related to the hemPRSTUV\noperon, which could be regulated by the E. ictaluri Fur protein\n(Fig. 9B). These are promoters for Mg2� transport (mgtB), man-\nganese transport (mntH), fatty acid degradation (fadR), heme syn-\nthesis (hemF), and glycolysis (gmpA). The expression of the hemR,\nmgtB, mntH, hemF, and gmpA genes in the absence of iron in\nwild-type E. ictaluri, as well as in our �fur mutant, was confirmed\nby RT-PCR (Fig. 9C). Although we predicted a Fur binding box at\nthe fadR promoter, its expression does not depend on either iron\nor the Fur protein (Fig. 9C).\n\nVirulence of E. ictaluri �fur-35 mutants in the fish host.

The E. ictaluri\n�fur mutant was also evaluated in catfish (I. punctatus), the natu-\nral host of E. ictaluri. We found that E. ictaluri �fur administered\ni.c. to catfish was attenuated, with around a 1,000-fold LD50 in-\ncrease over that of the wild type (Fig. 10C and D).

E. ictaluri �hemR that was\norally administered to the catfish (108, 107, and 106 CFU/dose)\nwas attenuated, with 80% survival at 108 CFU/dose and 100%\nsurvival at the lower doses. No hemorrhagic symptoms were ob-\nserved in catfish that were immersion or orally infected with the\n�hemR mutant. E. ictaluri �hemR administered i.c. to the catfish\nwas attenuated but still caused significant mortality (Fig. 11) and\nhemorrhagic symptoms in the fish. In vitro growth of the E. ictaluri\nwild-type, �hemR, and �hemR(pEZ192) (complemented in\ntrans) strains was similar in presence and absence of iron, exclud-\ning the possibility that the attenuation is due to slow growth of the\n�hemR mutant (Fig. 8D to F).

We determined that E. ictaluri �fur does not\nconfer immune protection against i.c. challenge (Fig. 12A) but\ndoes confer full protection against immersion challenge (data not\nshown). Catfish that were immersion immunized or orally immu-\nnized with E. ictaluri �fur survived the immersion challenge (Fig.\n12B). Catfish i.c. immunized presented significant levels of IgM\ntiters, either in the blood or in the mucus (Fig. 12C). However,\nthese IgM levels were not protective for i.c. challenged fish (Fig.\n12A). Immersion-immunized catfish presented significant levels\nof systemic IgM and low levels of skin IgM titers (Fig. 12D). These\nlevels were sufficient to protect the fish against the immersion\nchallenge (Fig. 12B).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe ferric uptake regulator (Fur) is a global regulatory protein that\nis involved in diverse aspects of bacterial life. It is a metalloregu-\nlatory protein that requires Fe2�, or other divalent transition\nmetal ions such as Zn2�, as a cofactor (3, 40, 74). Fur possesses\nthree functional domains, the helix-turn-helix DNA binding do-\nmain, the protein-protein dimerization domain, and the metal\nion-responsive domain. The last domain is essential for Fur\ndimerization to form a functional protein (9, 48, 53). It has already\nbeen suggested by Pohl et al. (48) that the N-terminal helix is\nrequired for efficient DNA binding at the Fur box. This is sup-\nported by mutagenesis studies. For example, P. aeruginosa Fur\nhaving Ala10 mutated to glycine (a much poorer helix former)\nwas unable to bind to the Fur box at the pvdS gene promoter (4).\nIn E. coli it was shown that proteolytic cleavage of the 8 or 9 N-ter-\nminal residues resulted in a protein with reduced DNA binding\naffinity and specificity (9). However, as we have shown, the N-ter-\nminal region present in most of the Fur proteins is missing in E.\nictaluri Fur (Fig. 1). The His32 residue, which interacts with Fe2�\n\nin P. aeruginosa Fur, is also missing (Fig. 1). This indicates that the\nbinding residues for Fe2� and other divalent ions in E. ictaluri Fur\nare different than those used in E. coli and Pseudomonas Fur pro-\nteins.\n\nIn terms of phylogeny, the sequenced E. tarda isolated from\nhumans contains a fur gene longer than fur genes in E. tarda iso-\nlated from fish, which contain a short version and appear to have\na common ancestor with the E. ictaluri fur gene (Fig. 2). Numer-\nous examples of genome reduction in the transition from free-\nliving bacteria to a parasitic life style have been documented (37).\n\nPathogenic bacteria seem to have embarked on some of the same\nprocesses of gene degradation and deletion that have led to exten-\nsive genome shrinkage in host-restricted pathogenic groups. For\nexample, large numbers of pseudogenes have been identified in\nboth Y. pestis (43) and S. enterica serovar Typhi (42). Perhaps the\nemergence of a shorter fur gene in the Edwardsiella genus is an\nadaptation to the fish host. E. ictaluri was first described by Hawke\nin 1979 (22) and then characterized in 1981 (23), during the in-\ndustrial expansion of the catfish aquaculture industry (70). Thus,\nan alternate hypothesis is that the reduction of the fur gene could\nbe part of a process of E. ictaluri host specialization due to inten-\nsive fish aquaculture. This observation raises the question of how\nthis shorter fur gene increases the fitness of Edwardsiella in the fish\nhost and how it appears during the evolution to host adaptation.\n\nAlthough E. ictaluri Fur is missing the N-terminal region of\nother Fur proteins, it is fully functional in S. enterica, comple-\nmenting the regulation of siderophore and IROMP synthesis in an\niron-dependent fashion (Fig. 4). This indicates that a single �-he-\nlix in the DNA binding domain is enough for DNA binding and\ngene repression. Detailed studies are required to evaluate this hy-\npothesis. Nevertheless, the fact that E. ictaluri fur complements S.\nenterica indicates a recent divergence from the Fur phylogenetic\ntrunk and supports the idea that E. ictaluri fur might be part of an\nongoing process of host specialization.\n\nAs mentioned above, iron acquisition mechanisms, such as\nsiderophores, are essential for bacterial pathogens to overcome\n\nFIG 12 Immune protection of E. ictaluri �fur-35 in catfish host. (A) Catfish\ni.c. challenged with wild-type E. ictaluri (107 CFU/dose) at 6 weeks after im-\nmersion immunization with E. ictaluri �fur-35 (107 CFU/dose during 30 min).\n(B) Catfish immersion challenged with wild-type E. ictaluri (107 CFU/dose\nduring 30 min) at 6 weeks after immersion (107 CFU/dose during 30 min) or\noral (107 CFU/dose) vaccination with E. ictaluri �fur-35.

However, we did not detect siderophore synthesis\nin E. ictaluri, regardless of the presence or absence of iron in the\ngrowth medium, the volume of culture, or the presence or absence\nof the fur gene (Fig. 5). Our results correlate with previous obser-\nvations (67) and with the absence of know siderophore biosynthe-\nsis genes in the E. ictaluri chromosome (72). This observation\nreinforces the hypothesis of genome degradation during the pro-\ncess of host specialization of E. ictaluri to catfish, where sidero-\nphore genes might be lost. The siderophore receptor genes fepA\nand fcuA were identified in the chromosome of E. ictaluri within\ntheir respective operons, containing an undefined fur binding box\n(data not shown). This indicates that E. ictaluri could utilize sid-\nerophores secreted from other bacterial species, likely in a Fur-\nindependent fashion. Further studies are required to evaluate the\nforeign utilization of siderophores by E. ictaluri. Nevertheless, in\nthe absence of iron, E. ictaluri upregulates a heme-hemoglobin\nacquisition system in a Fur-dependent fashion (Fig. 5 to 8). Dur-\ning pathogenesis, clearly there is a battle between E. ictaluri and\nthe catfish host for iron (34, 35, 45, 46, 63), where the E. ictaluri\nheme-hemoglobin acquisition system becomes a lethal weapon\ncontributing to the systemic infection of the fish. However, this\nheme-hemoglobin acquisition system needs to be tightly regu-\nlated and synthesized at a precise time and location within the\nhost.\n\nFur protein is a global regulator that controls genes related to\nacquisition of iron and other divalent metal ions and genes related\nto bacterial catabolism, affecting virulence. We determined that E.\nictaluri Fur regulates genes related to iron acquisition and heme\nsynthesis as well as Mg2� and Mn2� uptake (Fig. 9). Fur also\nregulates genes related to heme biosynthesis (hemF), where, in the\nabsence of iron, the bacterial cell has to preserve the integrity of\nthe electron transport chain parts and respiration by upregulating\nthe synthesis of tetrapyrroles such as heme. On the other hand, Fur\nregulates catabolism of sugars by regulation of gmpA, linking the\navailability of nutrients to the availability of essential ion metals.\nThe gmpA gene encodes a phosphoglycerate mutase that is regu-\nlated by Fur in E. coli (19) and Salmonella (69). Here we have\ndescribed that Fur contributes to the regulation of gmpA in E.\nictaluri (Fig. 9). This indicates that Fur participates in the general\nregulation of metabolic pathways, linking bacterial growth to the\nsupply of key nutrients such as iron. We found a cyclic AMP re-\nceptor protein (Crp) binding box in the fur promoter region (see\nFig. S2 in the supplemental material), which is conserved in E. coli\nand Salmonella fur promoters (19, 69). Crp may link expression of\nthe Fur regulator to the availability of carbon sources.\n\nThe main described virulence factors in Edwardsiella are the\ntype III secretion system, required for cell invasion and survival in\nEdwardsiella-containing vesicles in macrophages, and the type VI\nsecretion system, required for full virulence (66, 68, 75). The Ed-\nwardsiella type III and VI secretion systems, as well as the tran-\nscriptional regulators EsrB and EsrC, are very similar in E. tarda\nand E. ictaluri (66, 68, 75). Recently the linkage of Fur with viru-\nlence in E. tarda has been reported (6). Fur regulates the type VI\nsecretion system-mediated repression of evpP gene expression (a\ntype VI secretion effector), binding to its promoter region and\nblocking the binding of the EsrC activator (6). We did not find\neither an E. ictaluri evpP gene ortholog or a Fur binding box at the\npromoter region of the evpA gene or E. ictaluri type VI secretion\nsystem (data not shown). Protein-protein interaction between Fur\nand EsrC or between Fur and EsrB response regulators was de-\n\nscribed for E. tarda (6). Although we did not find a Fur binding\nbox in the type III secretion system or in the type VI secretion\nsystem of E. ictaluri, it is possible that Fur influences the virulence\nof E. ictaluri-mediated protein-protein interaction as was de-\nscribed in E. tarda.\n\nSalmonella �fur mutants are attenuated in mammals when ad-\nministered orally (51) or intraperitoneally (16) but are not very\nimmunogenic (11). However, �fur mutants constitutively synthe-\nsize their IROMPs, exposing them to the immune system of the\nhost. Although E. ictaluri �fur is not an efficient vaccine compared\nto the recently described E. ictaluri �crp mutant (55), the fur gene\nis an evolutionarily conserved regulon that controls iron homeo-\nstasis and bacterial virulence. Therefore, deletion of fur is an effec-\ntive modification for live attenuated vaccines and can be com-\nbined with other deletions, such as that of crp, to improve the\nsafety and immunogenicity of the vaccines.\n\nIn summary, we conclude that E. ictaluri does not secret detect-\nable siderophores under the growth conditions tested, regardless\nof the presence or absence of Fur and iron. Fur regulates a heme-\nhemoglobin uptake system in E. ictaluri, and deletion of fur can be\nsuccessfully used as a means to attenuate E. ictaluri in order to\ndevelop effective immersion live attenuated vaccines for the aqua-\nculture industry.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported by USDA grant CRIS-ARZR-2009-01801 and\nComisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT),\nGestión Propia Fellowship, Chile.\n\nWe thank Jacquelyn Kilbourne for assistance at The Biodesign Insti-\ntute, Arizona State University.
