KANNAN,1 R. E. BRIGGS,2 P. THUMBIKAT,1 AND S. K. MAHESWARAN1*\n\nDepartment of Veterinary PathoBiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Minnesota,\nSt. Paul, Minnesota 55108,1 and National Animal Disease Center, United States\n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Ames, Iowa 500102\n\nReceived 22 March 2001/Returned for modification 11 June 2001/Accepted 6 July 2001\n\nThe leukotoxin (LktA) produced by Mannheimia haemolytica binds to bovine lymphocyte function-associated\nantigen 1 (LFA-1) and induces biological effects in bovine leukocytes in a cellular and species-specific fashion.\nWe have previously shown that LktA also binds to porcine LFA-1 without eliciting any effects. These findings\nsuggest that the specificity of LktA effects must entail both binding to LFA-1 and activation of signaling\npathways which are present in bovine leukocytes. However, the signaling pathways leading to biological effects\nupon LktA binding to LFA-1 have not been characterized. In this context, several reports have indicated that\nligand binding to LFA-1 results in activation of a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) signaling cascade. We\ndesigned experiments with the following objectives: (i) to determine whether LktA binding to LFA-1 leads to\nactivation of NRTKs, (ii) to examine whether LktA-induced NRTK activation is target cell specific, and (iii) to\ndetermine whether LktA-induced NRTK activation is required for biological effects. We used a biologically\ninactive mutant leukotoxin (�LktA) for comparison with LktA. Our results indicate that LktA induces tyrosine\nphosphorylation (TP) of the CD18 tail of LFA-1 in bovine leukocytes. The �LktA mutant does not induce TP\nof the CD18 tail, albeit binding to bovine LFA-1. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail was attenuated by an NRTK\ninhibitor, herbimycin A; a phosphatidylinositol 3�-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor, wortmannin; and a Src kinase\ninhibitor, PP2, in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, LktA induces TP of the CD18 tail in\nbovine, but not porcine, leukocytes. Moreover, LktA-induced intracellular calcium ([Ca2�]i) elevation was also\ninhibited by herbimycin A, wortmannin, and PP2. Thus, our data represent the first evidence that binding of\nLktA to bovine LFA-1 induces a species-specific NRTK signaling cascade involving PI 3-kinase and Src kinases\nand that this signaling cascade is required for LktA-induced biological effects.\n\nBovine pneumonic pasteurellosis (BPP) caused by Mannhe-\nimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica serotype 1 remains a major eco-\nnomic problem for the beef and dairy cattle industries in North\nAmerica and Western Europe (2, 10, 14, 47). The leukotoxin\n(LktA) produced by this bacterium is the primary virulence\nfactor that contributes to the pathogenesis of the fibrinonecro-\ntizing pleuropneumonia and death characteristic of this disease\n(7, 8, 43, 44). A large body of evidence indicates that much of\nthe lung injury in this disease is caused by inflammatory me-\ndiators released from alveolar leukocytes by LktA-induced ac-\ntivation and cytolysis (11, 34, 41, 48).\n\nLktA is a member of a family of gram-negative RTX (re-\npeats in toxin) cytolysins (12, 20). Unlike most other RTX\ncytolysins, leukotoxins produced by Actinobacillus actinomyce-\ntemcomitans (LtxA) and M. haemolytica (LktA) demonstrate\ncell-type-specific and species-specific biological effects. The\nLtxA of A. actinomycetemcomitans, which causes dental caries\nin humans, interacts only with cells of the lymphocytic and\nmonomyelocytic lineages of humans and some nonhuman pri-\nmates and provokes biological effects (29); the LktA of M.\nhaemolytica interacts only with ruminant leukocytes and plate-\n\nlets and induces biological effects (6, 25, 37). A study by Lally\net al. (30) reported that human lymphocyte function-associated\nantigen 1 (LFA-1), a member of the �2 integrins, is a target cell\nreceptor for LtxA of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Three studies\nhave identified bovine CD18, the � subunit of all three bovine\n�2 integrins (LFA-1, Mac-1, and p150,95), as a receptor for M.\nhaemolytica LktA (3, 33, 42). However, in these studies no\nspecific member of the �2 integrin family was identified as an\nLktA receptor. We have extended these observations and have\nshown that bovine LFA-1, but not other members of the �2\nintegrin family, is a receptor for M. haemolytica LktA (23).\n\nLFA-1 is a heterodimeric glycoprotein consisting of CD11a\n(�) and noncovalently bound CD18 (�) subunits and is exclu-\nsively expressed on leukocytes (5, 13). LFA-1 is critically in-\nvolved in neutrophil transmigration from blood into the un-\nderlying tissue at sites of inflammation by binding to several\nmembers of the intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) fam-\nily on endothelial cells. Cumulative evidence suggests that\nICAM-1 binding to LFA-1 results in signaling through activa-\ntion of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs) (28, 40). Among\nNRTKs, focal adhesion kinase, the Src family of kinases, and\nphosphatidylinositiol 3�-kinase (PI 3-kinase) have been studied\nin more detail (40). Several intracellular proteins, including\nCbl (45), phospholipase C (26), and the LFA-1 (CD11a and\nCD18) cytoplasmic tails (15), have been identified as key sub-\n\n* Corresponding author.

Since\nLktA is known to induce biological effects only in ruminant\nleukocytes (25, 37), these results indicate that binding of LktA\nto LFA-1 does not reflect biological specificity. In the light of\nthis finding, it is reasonable to hypothesize that although LktA\nbinds to both susceptible and nonsusceptible leukocytes, only\nsusceptible (bovine) leukocytes undergo the signaling cascades\nthat lead to biological effects.\n\nEarlier studies have demonstrated that the interaction of\nLktA with bovine leukocytes induces intracellular calcium\n([Ca2�]i) elevation (9, 17, 21, 22, 36). Elevation of [Ca\n\n2�]i\nappears to be critical for LktA-induced NF-�B activation (21),\nproinflammatory cytokine gene expression (21), and arachi-\ndonic acid release and cytolysis (24). The mechanisms under-\nlying LktA-induced [Ca2�]i elevation appear complex but in-\nvolve activation of Gi-type G proteins, phospholipases, and\narachidonic acid generation (22). However, the initial signaling\nevents that follow binding of LktA to LFA-1 and lead to the\nbiological effects have not been examined.\n\nThe objectives of the present study were to determine\nwhether (i) LktA binding to LFA-1 results in activation of\nNRTKs, (ii) NRTK activation is target cell (bovine leukocyte)\nspecific, and (iii) NRTK activation is required for LktA-in-\nduced biological effects. We used TP of LFA-1 tails as a\nmarker for activation of NRTKs and [Ca2�]i elevation as an\nindex of LktA-induced biological effects. We used bovine al-\nveolar macrophages (BAMs) in this study as target cells since\nthese cells are uniquely positioned in the alveolar spaces for\ninitial interaction with LktA and to initiate the inflammatory\ncascade in BPP. Porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) were\nused to demonstrate whether LktA-induced signaling shows\ntarget cell specificity.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nM. haemolytica strains. Two strains of M. haemolytica were used in this study:\nwild-type strain D153 was isolated from the lungs of a steer that died of pneu-\nmonic pasteurellosis, and an isogenic mutant defective in the lktA gene was\nconstructed by allelic replacement from the parent wild-type strain D153. Con-\nstruction of the isogenic mutant was performed in a manner similar to one\ndescribed in a previous publication (41). The mutant �lktA has an in-frame\ndeletion in the lktA gene corresponding to amino acids 34 to 378. The �lktA\nmutant produced other wild-type antigens of M. haemolytica plus a 66-kDa\n�LktA protein which lacked cytolytic activity with bovine leukocytes (unpub-\nlished data).\n\nPreparation of LktA. The production and purification of native LktA from M.\nhaemolytica wild-type strain D153 has been described previously (48). Mutant\n�LktA was produced and purified in a similar manner. The purities of these\nleukotoxins were confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-\ntrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot analysis and they were stored in a\nlyophilized state at �20°C until use. The bioactivity of native LktA was quanti-\nfied by a colorimetric assay with XTT [sodium 3�-(1-(phenylamino-carbonyl)-3,4-\ntetrazolium)-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro) benzene-sulfonic acid hydrate], using bovine\nlymphoma cells (BL-3) as the target cells; bioactivity was expressed as LktA units\nper milligram (dry weight). Since �LktA lacked bioactivity, in experiments in-\nvolving �LktA a protein concentration equivalent to that of native LktA was\nused. Purified LktA and �LktA were tested for the presence of lipopolysaccha-\nride (LPS) contamination using the chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate assay\nkit (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, Md.), and the levels of LPS were found to be 1.3\nand 1.8 endotoxin units per mg (dry weight), respectively. In order to exclude the\neffect of this LPS contamination in the LktA and �LktA preparations, they were\n\nincubated with 10 �g of polymyxin B per ml for 30 min on ice prior to use. All\nstudies were performed with the same batch of leukotoxins.\n\nPreparation of M. haemolytica LPS. The M. haemolytica LPS was prepared by\na hot phenol-water method described elsewhere (22). Purified LPS was stored in\na lyophilized state at 4°C. The chromogenic Limulus amebocyte assay (BioWhit-\ntaker) was used to measure the bioactivity of LPS. One milligram of purified LPS\ncontained 2.086 \t 105 endotoxin units.\n\nPreparation of leukocytes. (i) BAMs. BAMs were isolated by bronchoalveolar\nlavage of 6- to 8-week-old healthy calves as described previously (48). The purity\nand viability of cells were determined by nonspecific esterase staining (Sigma\nChemical Co., St. Louis, Mo.) and trypan blue exclusion (Sigma), respectively.\nOnly populations of cells that were \n98% pure and viable were used in our\nexperiments.\n\n(ii) PAMs. PAMs were isolated from 5- to 7-week-old healthy pigs as described\nin a previous publication (21). As with BAMs, the purity and viability of PAMs\nwere determined by nonspecific esterase staining and trypan blue exclusion,\nrespectively. Only populations of cells that were \n98% pure and viable were\nused in our experiments.\n\nMAbs. The properties and applications of the various anti-�2 integrin mono-\nclonal antibodies (MAbs) used in the present study were previously described\n(23). MAbs MUC76A (anti-porcine CD11a; W. C. Davis, personal communica-\ntion), MM12A (anti-bovine CD11b), BAQ153A (anti-bovine CD11c), BAT75A\n(anti-bovine CD18), and BAQ30A (anti-bovine CD18) were purchased as ascites\nfluid from VMRD, Inc. (Pullman, Wash.). MAbs R15.7 (anti-canine CD18) and\nR3.1 (anti-canine CD11a) were a gift from R. Rothlein (Boehringer Ingelheim\nPharmaceuticals, Inc., Ridgefield, Conn.). MUC76A, R15.7, and R3.1 cross-react\nwith the bovine homologue (23). The anti-LktA neutralizing MAb601 and anti-\nLktA nonneutralizing MAb605 (16) were a generous gift from S. Srikumaran\n(University of Nebraska, Lincoln). An irrelevant, isotype-matched control MAb\n(MOPC21) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.\n\nFlow cytometry. Flow cytometric analysis of �2 integrins on BAMs was per-\nformed as described previously (1, 23). Briefly, 107 cells were incubated with 1 �g\nof anti-�2 integrin MAbs or control MAb (EL112) in fluorescence-activated cell\nsorter (FACS) buffer for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed using FACS buffer and\nincubated with 1:200 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-\nmouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pa.) in\nFACS buffer for 15 min on ice. Cells were washed and resuspended in 100 �l of\nFACS buffer and fluorescence was analyzed by a FACScalibur flow cytometry\nsystem (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, Calif.). In each\nexperiment, 50,000 cells were analyzed and the results were expressed as mean\nfluorescence intensity (MFI). To examine whether pretreatment with NRTK\ninhibitors influenced the expression of LFA-1, BAMs were pretreated with\nherbimycin A (a broad-spectrum inhibitor of NRTKs), wortmannin (a specific\ninhibitor of PI 3-type NRTK), PP2 (a selective inhibitor of the Src family of\nNRTK), or PP3 (the inactive analog of PP2) and washed, and the cells were\nprepared for FACS analysis as described above. In another set of experiments,\nwe examined the effects of these inhibitors on LktA binding to LFA-1 using an\nindirect method. In these experiments, the NRTK inhibitors at specific concen-\ntrations were added to BAMs (107 cells), incubated for 10 min, and washed, and\n50 U of LktA per ml was added. After incubation, the cells were washed,\nincubated with MAbs against LFA-1, and subjected to FACS analysis. LktA\nbinding to LFA-1 was calculated using the following formula: percent LktA\nbinding to LFA-1 � [(MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAbs � MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAbs\nafter pretreatment with LktA)/MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAbs] \t 100. The back-\nground MFI (without primary MAbs) was subtracted in all experiments.\n\nLeukotoxin binding assay. Affinity chromatography was used to demonstrate\n�LktA binding to bovine LFA-1 as described previously (23). Briefly, 0.125-in.-\ndiameter polystyrene beads were incubated with 20 �g of purified �LktA in 2 ml\nof phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4°C with gentle rocking. The\nbeads were then washed once with PBS and incubated with 1% bovine serum\nalbumin (BSA) to block the remaining protein binding sites on the beads.\nPolystyrene beads coated with 1% BSA served as a control. One hundred twenty\nmicrograms of protein from BAM lysates was diluted 1:3 with PBS containing 1\nmM CaCl2 and 1 mM MgCl2 and incubated with the �Lkt- or BSA-coated beads\nfor 15 h at 4°C. In another set of experiments, �Lkt-coated beads were prein-\ncubated with 10 �g of anti-Lkt neutralizing MAb (MAb601) for 1 h at 4°C before\nadding them to BAM lysates. The beads were then washed once with PBS, and\nthe bound proteins were eluted from the beads by being boiled with 50 �l of\nSDS-PAGE loading buffer and electrophoresed on an SDS–4-to-15%-gradient\npolyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions. Western blotting was per-\nformed as described below.\n\nPreparation of affinity column. Five hundred milligrams of CNBr-activated\nSepharose 4B beads (Sigma Chemical Co.) was suspended in 20 ml of cold 1 mM\n\n6132 JEYASEELAN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nHCl and packed into a 15-ml column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, Calif.). The resulting\ncolumn was then washed with 15 ml of coupling buffer (0.1 M NaHCO3 and 0.5\nM NaCl). Anti-bovine CD18 MAb (BAT75A) or isotype-matched irrelevant\nMAb (MOPC21) was diluted in coupling buffer at a concentration of 1 mg per\nml of column volume, added to the column, and incubated overnight at 4°C on\nan orbital shaker. The antibody mixture was drained off the column, 8 ml of 1 M\nglycine was added to block nonspecific sites on the beads, and the beads were\nincubated overnight at 4°C on an orbital shaker. The glycine was drained off and\nthe column was washed twice with 10 ml of acetate buffer (pH 4.0), followed by\nwashing with Tris buffer (pH 8.0). The column was then washed with 10 ml of\nelution buffer (0.2 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM\nNaN3, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The beads were finally washed with enough wash\nbuffer (Hanks’ balanced salt solution [HBSS] containing 1 mM calcium and\nmagnesium, 10 mM NaN3, and phenol red indicator) until the pH of the column\nbeads returned to neutral. Approximately 1.5 ml of wash buffer was left on the\ncolumn, and the column was capped and stored at 4°C until use. Sepharose beads\n(without MAb) were also prepared by the same procedure and used to preclear\ncell lysates to remove nonspecifically reacting lysate proteins from the Sepharose\nbeads (preclear bead slurry).\n\nActivation of NRTKs upon LFA-1 engagement with leukotoxin. (i) Leukocyte\nactivation. One hundred microliters (108 per ml) of BAMs or PAMs was exposed\nto LktA, �LktA, or LPS for different time periods in calcium- and magnesium-\ncontaining HBSS. Thereafter, cells were lysed, immunoprecipitated, and ana-\nlyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for the detection of TP by\nusing MAb 4G10. TP of LFA-1 was used as a marker for leukotoxin-induced\nsignaling. To demonstrate that leukotoxin-induced TP of the LFA-1 tails was\nindeed specific, cells were preincubated with anti-�2 antibodies before exposure\nto leukotoxins.\n\nIn some experiments, PAMs were exposed to MAb MUC76A. Unpublished\ndata from our laboratory revealed that MUC76A antibody was bound to the\nextracellular portion of LFA-1 in PAMs and activated the cells, as evidenced by\nelevation of [Ca2�]i. In these experiments, anti-bovine CD18 (BAT75A), anti-\ncanine CD18 (R15.7), and anti-canine CD11a (R3.1) were used as negative\ncontrols. The cells were then prepared for analysis of TP of the LFA-1 tails as\ndescribed below.\n\n(ii) Preparation of cell lysates. Cell lysates were prepared as previously de-\nscribed (23). Briefly, BAMs or PAMs were harvested and incubated for 2 days at\n37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified\nEagle’s medium (Sigma) containing 2 mM L-glutamine to reach quiescence. To\nassess LktA-induced TP of LFA-1 tails, cells were exposed to LktA or �LktA in\ncalcium- and magnesium-containing HBSS. After exposure, cells were incubated\nat 37°C for 0 to 10 min with 100 �l of 2\t lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.65],\n1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2% Triton X-100, 100 �g of aprotinin per ml, 100\n�g of leupeptin per ml, 10 �g of pepstatin per ml, and 2 mM phenylmethylsul-\nfonyl fluoride) to terminate the reaction and lyse the cells. Lysates were used\nimmediately for immunoprecipitation as described below.\n\n(iii) Immunoprecipitation. Aliquots (100 �l) of cell lysates were precleared by\nsuspending them in 50 �l of precleared bead slurry and the mixture was diluted\nto a final volume of 200 �l with wash buffer in a microcentrifuge tube. The\nmixture was incubated for 2 h at 4°C on an orbital shaker. The mixture was then\ncentrifuged at 100 \t g for 5 min and the supernatant containing precleared cell\nlysates was collected and transferred into a new tube. Twenty microliters of a\nslurry of Sepharose beads coated with BAT75A (anti-CD18) or MOPC21 (con-\ntrol) was added to the precleared cell lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4°C. After\nincubation, the mixture was centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. The\npellet was washed three times with 200 �l of wash buffer, 50 �l of elution buffer\nwas added, and the suspension was vortexed gently for 30 s and pelleted by\ncentrifugation.\n\n(iv) SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Aliquots (25 �l) of 2\t SDS-PAGE\nloading buffer (without 2-mercaptoethanol) were added to each tube containing\nthe immunoprecipitated proteins (pellet), boiled for 4 min, loaded, and resolved\non SDS–4-to-15%-gradient gels under nonreducing conditions. Separated pro-\nteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane and\nsubjected to Western blotting as previously described (23). Briefly, the mem-\nbrane was blocked with a blocking solution, followed by incubation with 0.5 �g\nof antiphosphotyrosine MAb (4G10) per ml in 10% blocking solution for 1 h at\nroom temperature. Membranes were then washed four times with PBS contain-\ning 0.25% Tween 20 (PBST), followed by incubation with a 1:50,000 dilution of\nhorseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G for 1 h at\nroom temperature. The blots were washed five times with PBST and developed\nusing the SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescence detection system. For re-\npeated Western blotting, membranes were stripped by incubating the membrane\nin a buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.7), 0.1 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and\n\n2% SDS for 45 min in a 65°C water bath. The membranes were rinsed with PBST\ntwice and blocked with PBST containing 10% blocking solution before the\nmembrane was reprobed by using the immunoblotting procedure described\nabove. Stripped membranes were reprobed with anti-CD11a (MUC76A) and\nanti-CD18 (BAQ30A) MAbs to validate uniform protein loading on gels.\n\nDetermination of intracellular calcium in BAMs. [Ca2�]i was measured by\nvideo fluorescence imaging as previously described (21, 22). Briefly, BAMs\ngrown on glass coverslips were incubated in HBSS containing 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2\nmM MgCl2, and 5 �M fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (Fura-2-AM) at 37°C for 30\nmin. The cells were then washed in HBSS, the coverslips were placed on the\nstage of a Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon, Inc., Garden City, N.Y.), and the\ncells were viewed using a 40\t fluor objective. The microscope was coupled to a\ndigitally controlled filter wheel (DG-4; Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, Calif.),\nwhich contains excitation filters for 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths. A\nphotometric Cool Snap CCD 12-bit camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, Ariz.) was\nused to measure fluorescence at an emission wavelength of 510 nm. The output\nof the digital camera was sampled by a digital computer (Universal Imaging\nCorp., West Chester, Pa.). Fluorescence signals were determined from regions of\ninterest and images were corrected for system background, shading errors, and\nthe very low autofluorescence of the unloaded cells. [Ca2�]i was calculated by the\nratio method described by Grynkiewicz et al. (18).\n\nTreatment with inhibitors. BAMs were incubated at 37°C for 10 min with\nherbimycin A, wortmannin, PP2, or PP3 before exposure to LktA. The choice of\nthe various inhibitors used in this study was based on their reported specificity for\ntheir respective targets. Appropriate vehicle controls were included in the me-\ndium in all experiments. Five different concentrations of the inhibitors around\ntheir respective 50% inhibitory concentrations were used in the present study to\nexclude any potential nonspecific effects of the inhibitors. Viability of cells was\nassessed after treatments with inhibitors by using the trypan blue exclusion assay,\nand only cell populations showing \n98% viability were used in our studies.\n\nReagents. RPMI 1640 was purchased from BioWhittaker. Herbimycin A,\nwortmannin, PP2, and PP3 were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, Calif.).\nFura-2-AM was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oreg.). Dulbecco’s\nmodified Eagle’s medium, HBSS, antibiotics, and glutamine were purchased\nfrom Gibco BRL (Grand Island, N.Y.). Polystyrene beads were obtained from\nOrange Products, Inc. (Allentown, Pa.). SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels and\nsample buffer were purchased from Bio-Rad. Blocking solution was purchased\nfrom Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, Md.). Antiphosphoty-\nrosine MAb 4G10 was obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid,\nN.Y.) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin\nG was obtained from ICN Biomedical Research Products (Costa Mesa, Calif.).\nPVDF membrane and SuperSignal ULTRA chemiluminescence substrate were\nobtained from Pierce Chemical Co. (Rockford, Ill.). Sodium orthovanadate,\nTriton X-100, Tween 20, aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, phenylmethylsulfonyl\nfluoride, and BSA were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.\n\nStatistical analysis. Results were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance\nand expressed as the mean plus the standard error of mean. The term significant\nis used here to indicate a P value of less than 0.05.\n\nRESULTS\n\nExpression of �2 integrins in BAMs. Flow cytometry was\nused to determine the expression of various �2 integrins in\nBAMs. As shown in Fig. 1, BAMs express high levels of CD11a\nand CD18 and low levels of CD11b and CD11c. To determine\nwhether inhibitors used in the present study had any effect on\nLFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) expression, cells were pretreated with 1\n�M herbimycin A or 5 �M concentrations of wortmannin,\nPP2, or PP3 for 10 min at 37°C. Pretreatment of cells with\nthese inhibitors did not have any significant effect on LFA-1\nexpression (data not shown). To examine whether pretreat-\nment with inhibitors influenced LktA binding to its receptor\nLFA-1, BAMs were pretreated with the same inhibitors at the\nconcentrations indicated above for 10 min at 37°C before ex-\nposure to LktA. Pretreatment of BAMs with inhibitors did not\nhave any significant effect on LktA binding to LFA-1 (Fig. 2).\n\nLeukotoxin-induced TP of LFA-1 tails in BAMs. Results\nshowed that the mutant Lkt (�LktA) indeed bound to LFA-1\n\nVOL. 69, 2001 TYROSINE KINASE SIGNALING BY M. HAEMOLYTICA LEUKOTOXIN 6133\n\n\n\nof bovine macrophages and this binding was specific (Fig. 3).\nTo examine whether leukotoxin binding to bovine LFA-1 leads\nto activation of signaling cascades, we determined the extent of\nTP of the cytoplasmic tails of LFA-1. BAMs were exposed to\nLktA or �LktA and lysed, and the lysate was subjected to\nimmunoprecipitation with either anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A)\nor an irrelevant control MAb (MOPC21). TP of LFA-1 tails\nwas determined by Western blot analysis of the immunopre-\ncipitates by using antiphosphotyrosine MAb. Exposure of\nBAMs to the biologically active LktA, but not the inactive\nmutant �LktA, induced TP of the CD18 tail but not the CD11a\ntail (Fig. 4). Exposure of BAMs to neutralized LktA (with\nanti-LktA MAb [MAb601]) abolished TP of the CD18 tail\n(Fig. 4). By contrast, LktA incubated with a nonneutralizing\nanti-LktA antibody (MAb605) or irrelevant control MAb\n(MOPC21) did not block TP of the CD18 tail (data not\nshown). Furthermore, LPS, even at 1 �g/ml (1,000-fold greater\nthan the cellular activation concentration), did not induce TP\nof the CD18 tail (Fig. 4). TP of the CD18 tail was not detected\nby immunoprecipitation of lysates with MOPC21-coated\nbeads, demonstrating specificity (Fig. 4). Preincubation of cells\nwith antibodies directed against CD11a or CD18, but not those\nagainst CD11b or CD11c, inhibited LktA-induced TP of the\nCD18 tail (Fig. 5). LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail was\ndetectable at 30 s, peaked at 2 min, and was undetectable at 10\nmin following exposure to 50 U of LktA per ml (data not\nshown).\n\nEffects of NRTK inhibitors on LktA-induced TP of the CD18\ntail. Since NRTKs are known to induce TP of LFA-1 tails (15),\nwe determined their role in LktA-induced signaling. BAMs\nwere preexposed to various selective NRTK inhibitors. Herbi-\nmycin A, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of NRTKs, inhibited TP\nof the CD18 tail in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 6).\nPreexposure of cells to wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of the\nPI 3-kinase-type of NRTK, also inhibited LktA-induced TP of\nthe CD18 tail in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 7). In\naddition, preexposure of cells to PP2, the selective inhibitor of\nthe Src family of NRTKs, inhibited LktA-induced TP of the\nCD18 tail (Fig. 7). Preexposure of cells to PP3, an inactive\nanalog of PP2, had no significant effect on LktA-induced TP of\nthe CD18 tail, indicating that the inhibition by PP2 was specific\n(Fig. 7).\n\nSpecies specificity of LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail. We\nhave previously shown that LktA binds to PAMs, a nonsuscep-\ntible cell type, without eliciting any biological effects (23). To\ndetermine whether this binding leads to any NRTK signaling\ncascade in PAMs, we examined TP of the CD18 tail. Exposure\nof PAMs to LktA did not induce TP of the CD18 tail (Fig. 8).\nHowever, an activating MAb against porcine CD11a (MUC76A)\ninduced TP of the CD18 tail in PAMs (Fig. 8). PAMs exposed\nto various other anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs did not in-\nduce TP of the CD18 tail (Fig. 8).\n\nRole of tyrosine kinase activation in LktA-induced [Ca2�]i\nelevation. To assess whether LktA-induced [Ca2�]i elevation\n\nFIG. 1. Flow cytometric detection of �2 integrins in BAMs. Cells were incubated with various anti-�2 integrin MAbs or a control MAb and then\nincubated with FITC-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody as described in Materials and Methods; results are expressed as MFI. BAMs\nexpressed high levels of CD11a and CD18 and low levels of CD11b and CD11c. Data are from one representative experiment of three experiments\nperformed.\n\n6134 JEYASEELAN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nrequires activation of NRTK, BAMs were pretreated with var-\nious concentrations of herbimycin A, wortmannin, PP2, or PP3\nbefore exposure to LktA. All three inhibitors blocked LktA-in-\nduced [Ca2�]i elevation in a time- (data not shown) and concen- tration-dependent (Fig. 9) manner. The inactive analogue of\n\nPP2, PP3, did not block LktA-induced [Ca2�]i elevation (Fig. 9).\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nAlthough much progress has been made in the identification\nand characterization of the receptor for RTX toxins of A.\nactinomycetemcomitans (LtxA) and M. haemolytica (LktA) in\nleukocytes, the intracellular signaling events that immediately\nfollow leukotoxin interaction with LFA-1 and lead to biological\neffects are not understood. We have provided evidence that\nbinding of M. haemolytica LktA to bovine LFA-1 induces TP of\nthe CD18, but not the CD11a, tail of LFA-1. A previous study\ndemonstrated that LFA-1 does not possess any intrinsic ty-\nrosine kinase activity and therefore the tyrosyl residues present\nin the cytoplasmic tails of LFA-1 can only be phosphorylated\nby cytoplasmic NRTKs (15). It is also important that the CD18\nsubunit of LFA-1 has one tyrosyl residue in its cytoplasmic\ndomain in both the human (27) and bovine (38) forms and,\ntherefore, is accessible to intracellular NTRKs for phosphor-\nylation. Although no tyrosyl residues are present in the cyto-\nplasmic domain of the human CD11a subunit, it does have a\ntyrosine residue located in the transmembrane domain that is\ncloser to the cytoplasmic domain, which seems accessible to\nNRTKs (15). Our results are different from a previous finding\nwith human leukocytes where collagen binding to LFA-1 was\n\nFIG. 2. LktA binding to LFA-1 is not influenced by herbimycin A,\nwortmannin, PP2, or PP3 as determined by flow cytometry. Cells were\npreincubated with medium alone or medium containing herbimycin A\n(Her A; 1 �M), wortmannin (Wort; 5 �M), PP2 (5 �M), or PP3 (5\n�M), washed, and exposed to LktA. Thereafter, the cells were washed\nand incubated with anti-LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18) MAb followed by in-\ncubation with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Re-\nsults are expressed as the percent LktA binding to LFA-1, according to\nthe following formula: % LktA binding to LFA-1 � [(MFI of anti-\nLFA-1 MAb � MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAb after pretreatment with\nLktA)/MFI of anti-LFA-1 MAb] \t 100. Means and standard errors\n(indicated by error bars) of three experiments are shown.\n\nFIG. 3. Biologically inactive �LktA binds to bovine LFA-1. BAM\nlysates were incubated with �LktA- or BSA-coated beads for 15 h at\n4°C as described in Materials and Methods. Bound proteins from the\nbeads were then eluted, electrophoresed on an SDS–4-to-15%-gradi-\nent polyacrylamide gel, transferred onto a PVDF membrane, and\nanalyzed by Western blotting using anti-CD18 (BAQ30A) (A) or anti-\nCD11a (MUC76A) (B) MAb. Cell lysates from BAMs show 90- and\n85-kDa CD18 bands and a 180-kDa CD11a band (panels A and B, lane\n1). The eluant from �Lkt-coated beads that were reacted with BAM\nlysates contained 90- and 85-kDa CD18 bands and a 180-kDa CD11a\nband (panels A and B, lane 2). In the eluant from Lkt-coated beads\npreincubated with anti-Lkt MAb (MAb601) before adding BAM ly-\nsates or in the eluant from BSA-coated beads incubated with BAM\nlysates, no CD18 bands or CD11a bands were observed (panels A and\nB, lanes 3 and 4). The data are from one representative experiment of\nthree experiments performed.\n\nFIG. 4. LktA interaction with BAMs results in TP of the CD18 tail.\nBAMs were incubated for 2 min at 37°C with LktA (lane 1), no LktA\n(lane 2), �LktA (lane 3), LktA preincubated with anti-LktA (MAb\n601; lane 4), or LPS (1 �g/ml; lane 5). Cell lysates were immunopre-\ncipitated with anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A; lanes 1 to 5) or an irrelevant\ncontrol antibody (MOPC21; lane 6), electrophoresed on an SDS–4-to-\n15%-gradient polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a PVDF mem-\nbrane. The blot was developed with antiphosphotyrosine MAb (panels\nA and B). The membrane was stripped and reprobed sequentially with\nanti-CD18 (BAQ30A) (C) or anti-CD11a (MUC76A) (D) MAb. Only\nthe biologically active LktA induced TP of the CD18 tail, but not of the\nCD11a tail, as indicated by an arrow on the left of panel A, lane 1. The\ndata are from one representative experiment of three experiments\nperformed. Molecular masses are shown in kilodaltons.\n\nVOL. 69, 2001 TYROSINE KINASE SIGNALING BY M. HAEMOLYTICA LEUKOTOXIN 6135\n\n\n\nshown to induce TP of both the CD18 and CD11a tails (15).\nOne possible explanation for this difference is that the tyrosyl\nresidue in the bovine CD11a subunit might not be accessible to\nNTRKs. The elucidation of this possibility is hampered by the\nfact that bovine CD11a has not been cloned.\n\nEfforts to purify LktA and other RTX toxins by a variety of\nmethods have invariably been confounded by the presence of\nbiologically significant levels of LPS contamination in postpu-\nrification samples (12, 32), leading investigators to propose\nthat LPS could contribute to the LktA-induced effects. That\nTP of the CD18 tail was indeed caused by LktA, and not by any\ncontaminating LPS, is supported by the following observations:\n(i) LPS itself, even at a concentration of 1 �g/ml, failed to\ninduce TP of the CD18 tail; (ii) while LktA-neutralizing MAbs\nabrogated TP of the CD18 tail, a nonneutralizing anti-Lkt\nMAb or control MAb did not block TP of the CD18 tail; and\n(iii) we have shown previously that 10 �g of polymyxin B per\nml completely abrogated the biological effects induced in\nBAMs by M. haemolytica LPS at concentrations as high as 1\n�g/ml (21–24). Polymyxin B was routinely included in our\nstudies to eliminate any LPS-induced effects. In the present\nstudy, there was no LPS-induced TP of the CD18 tail in the\nabsence of serum, indicating that the LPS-induced signaling\npathway is different from the LktA-induced signaling cascade\nin bovine leukocytes. In this regard, we have shown previously\nthat LPS activation of bovine leukocytes requires a CD14-\ndependent pathway, since it can only be demonstrated in the\npresence of serum, which contains LPS-binding proteins (21,\n22).\n\nThe observations of the present study indicate that the CD18\ntail of the LFA-1, but not other members of the �2 integrins\n(Mac-1 and p150,95), undergoes TP of the CD18 tail upon\nLktA engagement. This conclusion is supported by the fact\nthat TP of the CD18 tail was blocked by anti-CD11a or anti-\nCD18 MAbs, but not by anti-CD11b or anti-CD11c MAbs. In\nthis context, results from a previous study showed that LFA-1\nis a receptor for M. haemolytica LktA, and LktA binding to\nBAMs was abolished by anti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs but\nnot by anti-CD11b or anti-CD11c MAbs (23). Moreover, only\nanti-CD11a or anti-CD18 MAbs inhibited LktA-induced bio-\nlogical effects in BAMs (23). Together, these data also indicate\nthat TP of the CD18 tail results from LktA binding to LFA-1\nin bovine leukocytes.\n\nIn the present study, we observed that the biologically inac-\ntive �LktA, which lacks amino acid residues 34 to 378 at the\nN-terminal end, also binds to bovine LFA-1 (Fig. 4). However,\nthis binding does not lead to TP of the CD18 tail, suggesting\nthat TP of the CD18 tail requires the binding of a full-length\nLktA to LFA-1. The absence of TP with �LktA binding to\nLFA-1 may be attributable to the following possibilities: (i)\nin-frame deletions may alter the proper conformation of\n�LktA that is required for high-affinity binding to target cells\nand elicit TP of the CD18 tail, and/or (ii) the missing N-\nterminal amino acids in the �LktA mutant may be required for\nbinding to an additional cell surface molecule in target cells in\norder to induce TP of the CD18 tail after interacting with the\nprimary receptor, LFA-1.\n\nIn porcine leukocytes, a non-target cell type, LktA does not\ninduce TP of the CD18 tail. Additionally, we have previously\nshown that LktA binds to porcine LFA-1 without inducing any\nbiological effects (23). Other studies (35) have demonstrated\nthe existence of distinct prelytic and lytic conformations of the\nEscherichia coli hemolysin, an RTX cytolysin, suggesting that\nupon toxin binding to its receptor the toxin undergoes a con-\nformational change prior to exerting its lytic effect. A similar\n\nFIG. 5. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail is blocked by anti-LFA-1\n(CD11a/CD18) MAbs. BAMs were preincubated with 5 �g of various\nanti-�2 integrin MAbs for 30 min at 37°C before exposure to LktA for\n2 min at 37°C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD18\nMAb (BAT75A), electrophoresed on an SDS–4-to-15%-gradient poly-\nacrylamide gel and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The blot was\nfirst developed with antiphosphotyrosine MAb (A), stripped, and re-\nprobed with anti-CD18 (BAQ30A) (B). Anti-CD18 and anti-CD11a\n(lanes 5 and 6), but not anti-CD11b or anti-CD11c (lanes 3 and 4),\nblocked LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail. The arrow at the left of\npanel A indicates the position of tyrosine-phosphorylated CD18. The\ndata shown are from one representative experiment of three experi-\nments performed.\n\nFIG. 6. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail is inhibited by herbimy-\ncin A. BAMs were preincubated with 0.06 to 1 �M herbimycin A for\n10 min at 37°C before exposure to LktA for 2 min at 37°C. Cell lysates\nwere immunoprecipitated with anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A), electro-\nphoresed on an SDS–4-to-15%-gradient polyacrylamide gel, and trans-\nferred onto a PVDF membrane. The blot was first developed with\nantiphosphotyrosine MAb (A), stripped, and reprobed with anti-CD18\nMAb (BAQ30A) (B). The arrow at the left of panel A indicates the\nposition of the tyrosine-phosphorylated CD18. The data shown are one\nrepresentative experiment of four experiments performed.\n\n6136 JEYASEELAN ET AL. INFECT. IMMUN.\n\n\n\nmechanism may underlie the LktA effects in target and non-\ntarget cells, and we speculate that a conformational change\noccurs in bovine leukocytes, but not porcine leukocytes, upon\nLktA binding. These results are consistent with the hypothesis\n\nthat TP of the CD18 tail reflects the species specificity of Lkt\neffects.\n\nIn human neutrophils, binding of collagen to LFA-1 induces\nTP of the LFA-1 tails through herbimycin A-sensitive NRTKs\n(15). Using selective inhibitors, we demonstrated in the\npresent study that the involvement of herbimycin A-sensitive\nNRTKs, including Src kinases and PI 3-kinase, in LktA in-\nduced signaling through LFA-1. Although activation of\nNRTKs in bacterial exotoxin-induced signaling has not been\nstudied, its role in endotoxin (LPS)-induced signaling has been\ndescribed in detail (4, 19, 39). LPS is known to induce activa-\ntion of Src kinases, leading to PI 3-kinase activation (19). Src\nkinases are known to activate not only the tyrosine kinase-\ndependent isoform of PI 3-kinase (p85/p110�) but also the\ntyrosine kinase-independent isoforms (p85/p110� or p85/\np110�) (46). In bovine leukocytes, the inhibition of LktA-\ninduced TP of the CD18 tail by herbimycin A indicates the\ninvolvement of only the tyrosine-kinase dependent isoform.\n\nIn bovine leukocytes, M. haemolytica LktA interaction leads\nto [Ca2�]i elevation (9, 17, 21, 22, 23, 36). This [Ca\n\n2�]i eleva-\ntion is required for NF-�B activation (21), proinflammatory\ncytokine gene expression (21), and arachidonic acid release\nand cytolysis (24). This [Ca2�]i elevation is also a highly reg-\nulated process involving activation of Gi-type G proteins and\nphospholipases C and A2 (22). In the present study, we dem-\nonstrated that LktA binding to LFA-1 results in activation of\nan NRTK signaling cascade that is required for [Ca2�]i eleva-\ntion. Furthermore, the inhibition of LktA-induced TP of the\nCD18 tail by inhibitors of Src kinases and PI 3-kinase also\ncauses attenuation of the [Ca2�]i elevation, indicating the im-\nportance of NRTK signaling in LktA-induced biological ef-\nfects. The mechanism(s) by which NRTK signaling cross talks\nwith Gi proteins and phospholipases in bovine leukocytes re-\nmains to be elucidated.\n\nIn conclusion, our data provide the first direct evidence that\n\nFIG. 7. LktA-induced TP of the CD18 tail is inhibited by wortmannin and PP2, but not by PP3. BAMs were preincubated with 0.65 to 10 �M\nwortmannin, PP2, or PP3 before exposure to LktA for 2 min at 37°C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A),\nelectrophoresed on an SDS–4-to-15%-gradient polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The blot was first developed with\nantiphosphotyrosine MAb (A), stripped, and reprobed with anti-CD18 MAb (BAQ30A) (B). Wortmannin and PP2, but not PP3, inhibited TP in\na concentration-dependent manner. The arrow at the left of panel A indicates the position of tyrosine-phosphorylated CD18. The data shown are\nfrom one representative experiment of three experiments performed.\n\nFIG. 8. LktA interaction with PAMs results in no TP of the CD18\ntail. However, anti-porcine CD11a (MUC76A; lane 4)—but not anti-\nbovine CD18 (BAT75A, lane 3), anti-canine CD11a (R3.1, lane 5), or\nanti-canine CD18 (R15.7, lane 6)—induces TP of the CD18 tail in\nPAMs. Cells were incubated with 50 U of LktA per ml or 5 �g of\nvarious MAbs for 2 min at 37°C. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated\nwith the anti-CD18 MAb (BAT75A), electrophoresed on an SDS–4-\nto-15%-gradient polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto a PVDF\nmembrane. The blot was first developed with antiphosphotyrosine\nMAb (A), stripped, and reprobed with anti-CD18 MAb (BAQ30A)\n(B). The arrow at the left of panel A indicates the position of tyrosine-\nphosphorylated CD18. The data shown are from one representative\nexperiment of five experiments performed.\n\nVOL. 69, 2001 TYROSINE KINASE SIGNALING BY M. HAEMOLYTICA LEUKOTOXIN 6137\n\n\n\nbinding of LktA to bovine LFA-1 induces activation of an\nNRTK signaling cascade involving PI 3-kinase and Src kinases,\nand this signaling cascade is essential for LktA-induced bio-\nlogical effects. This may represent a common mechanism in\ninflammation induced by RTX toxins of A. actinomycetem-\ncomitans and M. haemolytica, whose receptor is LFA-1. These\nfindings allow us to speculate that M. haemolytica LktA utilizes\nthe eukaryotic cell adhesion molecule LFA-1 to induce a\nunique signaling cascade that leads to activation and cytolysis\nof bovine leukocytes in the alveolar spaces. This could release\na myriad of inflammatory mediators, leading to peracute lung\ninjury. A recent report (31) provided evidence that interleu-\nkin-1� upregulated LFA-1 expression and enhanced the bind-\ning of LktA, thus amplifying its biological effects in bovine\nneutrophils. Taken together, if these events occur in the bovine\nlung, it might explain the severe uncontrolled inflammatory\nresponse and irreversible lung injury seen in BPP. A better\nunderstanding of the mechanisms by which M. haemolytica\nLktA interacts with the LFA-1 receptor in pulmonary leuko-\ncytes and releases inflammatory mediators will provide new\navenues for effective therapies to control BPP.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis study was supported in part by a grant from the Minnesota\nAgricultural Experiment Station (S.K.M. and M.S.K.) and a USDA-\nNRI competitive grant (no. 35204-9230 to S.K.M. and M.S.K.).\n\nWe thank Bruce Walcheck and Christie Malazdrewich for helpful\ndiscussions.\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
