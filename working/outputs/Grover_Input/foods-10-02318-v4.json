Despite the availability of plant-based protein alternatives, animal meat\nremains a popular, high-quality protein source. Research studies have focused on cultured meat (meat\ngrown in vitro) as a safe and more efficient alternative to traditional meat. Cultured meat is produced\nby in vitro myogenesis, which involves the processing of muscle satellite and mature muscle cells.\nMeat culture efficiency is largely determined by the culture conditions, such as the cell type and cell\nculture medium used and the biomolecular composition. Protein production can be enhanced by\nproviding the optimum biochemical and physical conditions for skeletal muscle cell growth, while\nmyoblasts play important roles in skeletal muscle formation and growth. This review describes the\ncell types used to produce cultured meat and the biological effects of various myokines and cytokines,\nsuch as interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-4, interleukin-15, and interleukin-1β, on\nskeletal muscle and myogenesis and their potential roles in cultured meat production.\n\nKeywords: cultured meat; muscle satellite cell; myogenesis; culture medium; myokines\n\n1. Introduction\n\nThe architecture of skeletal muscle (SM) contains specific, well-defined arrangements\nof multinucleated contractile muscle cells (also known as muscle fibers) and associated\nconnective tissue [1]. Artificial meat produced from the differentiation of muscle satellite\ncells (MSCs) in vitro is referred to as cultured meat. In addition to reducing the need for\nlivestock, the adoption of cultured meat has huge environmental benefits [2,3]. In recent\nyears, techniques such as stem cell isolation, ex vivo cell culture, and tissue engineering\nhave been devised that enable the generation of MSCs and mesenchymal tissues. For\nexample, bio-artificial muscles derived from MSCs are being investigated as possible\nsurgical implants [4]. Furthermore, muscles produced by MSC culture are considered an\nexcellent source of animal protein. Structural muscle cells could be used to produce meat\nin vitro. During the last few decades, myoblasts and MSCs have been used to produce\ncultured meat [5], and some MSC subsets have been shown to have greater regenerative\nability and are preferred for SM tissue engineering [6].\n\nMuscle development starts in vivo during early embryogenesis with the limited pro-\nliferation of mononucleated myoblasts, which then fuse and divide into non-proliferative\nmultinuclear myofibers or muscle fibers [7,8]. MSCs are the postnatal counterparts of\nembryonic myoblasts [9]. MSCs are found between the sarcolemma and basal lamina\nand participate in muscle development, recovery, and regeneration [8]. MSCs proliferate\nand divide to form new myofibers after being activated by myogenic factors [10].

MSCs play an important role\nin muscle regeneration after injury because they effectively differentiate into myotubes,\nwhich then transform into muscle fibers [8].\n\nOnce MSCs have been multiplied in vitro to the optimal amount for cultured meat\nprocessing, they must be differentiated into multinucleated, postmitotic muscle fibers by\ncell fusion. Switching MSCs to a differentiation medium initiates the first differentiation\nstage to myotubes in vitro, which takes about 3 to 5 days [11]. The immature myotubes\nproduced are small, tubular structures that tend to synthesize neonatally, which are even-\ntually arranged into nascent sarcomeres by adult isoforms of the contractile proteins actin\nand myosin [12].\n\nMSC activity can be regulated using extracellular signaling molecules, which are usu-\nally present in culture medium. MSC activation and proliferation are mediated by growth\nfactors (GFs) such as insulin-like GFs (IGF-1 and -2), fibroblast GF, hepatocyte GF, and\ncytokines (TNF-α, and LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor)) [13–15]. In the tissue engineering\nfield, biopolymers, GFs, and enzymes are used extensively in cell cultures [16]. Myokines\nare proteins secreted by SM, which have been found to influence muscle physiology and\nto have systemic effects on other tissues and organs, including the adipose tissue, liver,\nand brain [17]. Immune-derived cytokines influence SM development, organ formation,\nregeneration, and wasting, although muscle fibers also generate and secrete cytokines\nand myokines. TNF-α and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are the most effective immune-derived\ncytokines in terms of activating MSCs after muscle damage, whereas IL-8 coordinates\ngrowth and regeneration and IL-15 controls muscle hypertrophy [18]. In this review, we\ndescribe the effects of various myokines and cytokines on SM function and myogenesis\nand their possible roles in cultured meat production.\n\n2. Status of Cultured Meat\n\nSince the first cultured beef hamburger was made in 2013, dozens of companies have\nentered the cultured meat sector, and a variety of product species, including chicken, beef,\npork, and seafood, are now being developed. By the end of 2020, about 60 early-stage\ncompanies concentrating on cultured meat end-products and raw materials throughout the\nvalue chain had been established worldwide, with more than half of them having launched\nwithin the last two years [19,20]. These companies are geographically distributed across 19\ncountries and five continents, with 37% in North America, 25% in Asia, and 21% in Europe.\nThe total amount of money invested in cultured meat companies from 2016 to 2020 was\nestimated to be over $460 million, with more than three-quarters of that amount (more\nthan $350 million) being invested in 2019 and 2020. Memphis Meat has raised nearly $200\nmillion to take the lead, while Mosa Meat has raised over $85 million. In terms of product\ninterest, 28% of cultured meat companies are interested in cultured beef and pork, while\n12% are interested in seafood, 10% in poultry, and 28% in raw materials or equipment used\nin the production process [21].\n\n3. Cell Types for Cultured Meat\n\nOne or more starting cell populations are used to begin the cultured meat production\nprocess, and thus, initial cell populations may be homogenous or heterogeneous. Despite\nthe complexities of meat, it is currently thought that MSCs and adipocytes are essential\ncomponents. The suitability of starter cells for culture is dependent on their ability to\nself-renew and differentiate in a setting in which other animal-derived elements, such as\nserum, are reduced. The discovery of stem cells paved the way for in vitro cell production\nand the development of cultured meat. A biopsy from a live animal can be used to sample\nstem cells, which can then be expanded in vitro to produce substantial cell numbers [22].\nBased on the types of stem cells isolated, these cells can be activated to differentiate into\nmuscle or fat cells. MSCs are a reliable cell source for SM recovery in vivo [23], and their\nself-renewal ability maintains stem cell populations and the productions of large numbers\n\n\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 3 of 13\n\nof myogenic cells, which proliferate, divide, fuse, and contribute to the development\nof new myofibers [8]. The first cultured meat hamburger prototype was produced by\namplifying the myoblast progeny of MSCs [22]. Multipotent progenitor cells originating\nfrom porcine SM have a higher doubling capacity than MSCs making them a better cell\nsource for cultured meat; however, these cells require costly recombinant GFs and do not\ndifferentiate into SM fibers as efficiently as MSCs [24]. Pluripotent stem cells (derived from\nnon-muscle sources; PSCs) can be isolated from a variety of domesticated animals and\nused as myogenic cell sources for cultured meat. Chemically and genetically engineered\nporcine PSCs have recently been transformed into myogenic cells capable of differentiating\ninto embryonic muscle fibers [25]. While PSCs are an appealing possible cell source, any\ncultured meat produced from them must be identified as genetically modified and undergo\nrigorous safety testing.\n\nMuscle progenitor cells come in a wide variety of forms. Within muscle, the different\ntissue types (nerves, blood vessels, and adipose and connective tissues) necessitate the\npresence of a large number of progenitor cells with various lineage differentiation plasticity\nlevels [26]; thus, it is important that the populations of progenitor cells be differentiated.\nBiomolecular marker expression profiles and cell differentiation capacity levels have been\nused to classify muscle progenitor cell types. The majority of MSCs have been identified\nin humans and mice, although as porcine organs are functionally and anatomically al-\nmost identical to those of humans, porcine MSCs are viewed as useful raw materials in\nregenerative therapy research [24].\n\n4. Roles of Myokines in Skeletal Muscle\n4.1. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)\n\nIL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine involved in immune response modulation and coor-\ndination [27], with growing evidence suggesting that muscle cells are a suitable source of\nIL-6 [28]. Human primary myoblasts and murine C2C12 myoblast cells also produce IL-6\nin vitro [29,30]. In cultured C2C12 cells, IL-6 mRNA knockdown reduces the expression\nof muscle-specific genes [31], which demonstrates that this cytokine has a myogenic func-\ntion. Furthermore, local IL-6 production increases MSC activation and promotes myotube\nregeneration [32], while treatment with IL-6 has been shown to increase MSC prolifera-\ntion by regulating the cyclin D1 and c-myc genes. In addition, IL-6 deficiency inhibited\nMSC proliferation and myonuclear accretion in preexisting myofibers by impairing STAT3\nactivation [33]. In differentiating C2C12 cells, STAT3 or IL-6 mRNA knockdown reduced\nthe expression levels of myogenin and myosin heavy-chain (MyHC) IIb, causing myotube\nfusion to be disrupted. Moreover, myoblasts derived from IL-6 null mice exhibited re-\nduced fusion potential in vitro, which confirmed the participation of IL-6 in myogenic\ndifferentiation [34]. In monocytes and macrophages, IL-6 expression and activation of the\nSTAT3 signaling pathway were key mediators of macrophage migration and myoblast\nproliferation during muscle regeneration [35]. The expression of IL-6 receptors was reduced\nafter 24 h of treatment with IL-6 at high concentrations but increased at low concentrations.\nLow IL-6 concentrations stimulate proliferation, whereas high concentrations promote\ndifferentiation, and both processes are regulated by components of the JAK/STAT/SOCS\npathway [36]. Altogether, these findings suggest that IL-6 functions as an important\nregulator of myogenesis by acting during myoblast proliferation and differentiation.\n\n4.2. Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF)\n\nLIF is a member of the IL-6 cytokine family, is secreted by a variety of cell types, and has\nbiological effects that depend on the target tissue type and cell lineage. Local LIF formation\nby regenerating muscle and other cells in muscle is essential for muscle regeneration [37,38].\nThe expression of LIF mRNA was triggered by high-intensity resistance exercise capable of\ninducing SM hypertrophy. It has been demonstrated that LIF influences myoblast prolifera-\ntion, differentiation, and regeneration [39–41]. Exogenous LIF stimulated human myoblast\nproliferation by inducing the transcription factors JunB and c-Myc, while siRNA knockdown\n\n\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 4 of 13\n\nof endogenous LIF receptor inhibited myoblast proliferation [42]. In addition, LIF was identi-\nfied as the upstream component that stimulated myoblast differentiation by activating the\nJAK2/STAT3 pathway [43], while LIF was found to be important for the survival of embryonic\nstem cells and to promote myoblast proliferation in mice and rats [15,44].\n\n4.3. Interleukin-4 (IL-4)\n\nThe transcription factor NFATc2 (nuclear factor of activated T cells) is required for\ncell growth and regulates myoblast fusion at a particular stage of myogenesis after initial\nmyotube development. NFATc2 induces IL-4, which facilitates cell fusion and muscle\ndevelopment. Furthermore, IL-4 regulates cell fusion by acting on myoblasts rather than\nmyotubes via IL-4 receptor (IL-4R). Myoblasts and myotubes also express IL-4Rα, which\nis necessary for muscle development, while myoblasts lacking IL-4Rα are not recruited\nby IL-4-secreting nascent myotubes and develop normally, although are smaller, and my-\notubes have lower myonuclear numbers. IL-4 promotes the fusion of myoblasts to nascent\nmyotubes during growth and regeneration [45] and IL-4 treatment enhances myogenic cell\nmigration and promotes mononuclear cell interactions with nascent myotubes [46]. Recent\nstudies showed that IL-4 stimulates myogenesis by increasing the expression levels of\nmyogenic transcription factors [47] and that the presence of adipose-tissue-derived stromal\ncells can increase MSC regeneration, which was promoted by pretreating IL-4 or SDF-1 [48].\n\n4.4. Interleukin-15 (IL-15)\n\nIL-15 is expressed at higher mRNA and protein levels in SM than in other tissues [49–51]\nand has been linked to the interaction between muscle and adipose tissues [52]. Fur-\nthermore, it has been demonstrated that adipose tissue deposition can be modulated by\nmuscle-derived IL-15 [53]. IL-15 stimulates the accumulation of MyHC protein in dif-\nferentiated myotubes in human SM cell cultures, which suggests that IL-15 acts as an\nanabolic agent during muscle development [54]. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR\nrevealed that C2C12 cells express IL-15 and that IL-15 mRNA levels are upregulated more\nthan 10-fold in differentiated rather than undifferentiated cells [55]. In cultured skeletal\nmyotubes, IL-15 stimulated protein synthesis while inhibiting protein degradation [55,56],\nwhile IL-15 secreted by myotubes, derived from human SM, promoted human myotube\ndevelopment by increasing the expression levels of myogenic marker genes [57].\n\n4.5. Interleukin-1β (IL-1β)\n\nAfter SM injury, the surrounding environment has substantial impacts on MSC func-\ntion. Immune cell infiltration dominates the extracellular space in damaged areas causing\ncytokine levels to rise, while in mice tissue it was reported that 5 days after injury, IL-1β\nexpression was increased ~20-fold. Furthermore, elevated IL-1β expression stimulates\nMSC proliferation by activating NF-κB [58].\n\n4.6. Effects of Cytokines in Combination\n\nImmune cell infiltration increases the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as\ninterleukins, TNFs, and interferons in injured regions after muscle injury. Based on this\nfinding, Fu et al. [59] cultured MSCs long-term in vitro in the presence of T-cell released\nIL-1α, IL-13, TNF-α, and IFN-γ. In combination, these four cytokines enabled the in vitro\nmaintenance of MSCs in an undifferentiated state over 20 passages [59]. The effects of\ncytokines on SM function and myogenesis are summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 5 of 13\n\nTable 1. Role of cytokines in myogenesis.\n\nS.

Myostatin\n\nMyostatin (MSTN) was the first myokine discovered in 1997. MSTN belongs to the\ntransforming growth factor-β family and negatively regulates SM mass [60]. Plasma MSTN\nlevels were found to decrease dramatically within 24 h of exercise in healthy young men\nand to be positively correlated with plasma IL-6 levels [61]. On the other hand, serum\nMSTN levels were found to increase during aerobic activity in patients with spinal cord\ninjury [62]. MSTN gene-inactivating mutations are linked to enhanced muscle mass and\nreduced fat mass, while MSTN transgenic mice that overexpress MSTN in SM have reduced\nmuscle mass and enhanced fat mass [63,64]. The doubling of muscle mass in cattle, sheep,\ndogs, and humans with natural mutations in the MSTN gene suggests that the function of\nMSTN has been conserved across species [60,65–68]. These results raised the prospect that\ninhibiting MSTN activity may have significant therapeutic and agricultural implications.\n\nSeveral extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibromodulin (FMOD), decorin,\nfibronectin (FN), and laminins, have been shown to bind to MSTN and control its func-\ntion [69,70]. Previously, we explored a number of ECM proteins, such as FMOD [71,72],\nmatrix gla protein [73], and dermatopontin [74], which play important roles in the regu-\nlation of myogenesis. MSTN inhibits the proliferation and differentiation of MSCs and\nthereby inhibits muscle development [75]. We found that FMOD circumvents the inhibitory\neffects of MSTN and regulates myogenesis by enhancing the expression levels of myogenic\nmarker genes. Furthermore, an investigation of the protein–protein interaction between\nFMOD and MSTN showed that FMOD decreases MSTN sensitivity to activin type IIB recep-\ntor (ACVRIIB, MSTN receptor) binding affinity [71]. Recently, we reported that Glycyrrhiza\nuralensis (a medicinal herb) inhibits MSTN expression and promotes myogenesis [76].\n\n4.8. Irisin\n\nThe myokine irisin is a cleaved portion of the transmembrane protein fibronectin type\nIII domain-containing 5 (FNDC5) [77], and a possible mediator of the positive impact of\nexercise [78,79]. FNDC5 expression is stimulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor gamma coactivator-1-alpha (PGC-1α) expression in muscle and leads to the\nproduction of brown fat-like growth of white fat cells and enhanced thermogenesis [80].\nAlthough exercise-induced increase in blood irisin levels is controversial [81], several\n\n\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 6 of 13\n\nstudies have reported FNDC5 expression is enhanced in animal models and humans during\nexercise [82–85], which reintroduce interest in exercise-stimulated myokines. Myotubes\nexposed to recombinant irisin for 24 h exhibited enhanced expressions of mitochondrial-\nspecific transcription factors like PGC-1α and mitochondrial transcription factor A, both\nof which are involved in increasing myocytes and adipocytes mitochondrial contents and\noxygen intake [86]. Irisin was reported to activate IL-6 signaling in mice resulting in SM\nhypertrophy and reduced denervation-induced atrophy [87]. In another study, irisin caused\nhypertrophy by activating MSCs and increasing protein synthesis [87]. These findings pave\nthe way for future studies on irisin in the context of muscle atrophy\n\n4.9. Myonectin\n\nMyonectin belongs to the CTRP (C1q/TNF-related protein) family and is a newly\ndiscovered nutrient-responsive myokine produced by SMs [88–90]. Myonectin protein is\nreleased into the bloodstream as a result of muscle contractions and functions similarly\nto insulin by facilitating cellular fatty acid uptake by increasing the expression levels\nof fatty acid transport genes [88,90]. Recombinant myonectin inhibits LC3-dependent\nautophagosome production, inhibits the production of other autophagy-related genes\nin the rodent liver and in cultured hepatocytes, and suppresses starvation-stimulated\nautophagy. Inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway prevented myonectin-\ninduced suppression of autophagy [91], which is considered to be one of the mechanisms\nresponsible for muscle atrophy [92]. Furthermore, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway plays\na role in anabolic responses. These results demonstrate that myonectin appears to play a\nkey role in enhancing muscle mass by increasing protein synthesis and preventing protein\ndegradation.\n\nMuscle mitochondrial content is a key determinant of muscle form and function. In\nrat skeletal myocytes, mtDNA depletion results in a significant increase in myonectin,\nwhich enhances glucose intake and fatty acid oxidation by activating the AMPK signaling\npathway [93,94]. Myonectin is expressed at a higher frequency in oxidative slow-twitch\nmuscle fibers than in glycolytic fast-twitch muscle fibers, which suggests it might be\ninvolved in mitochondrial biogenesis and cellular energy-sensing [90].\n\n4.10. Decorin\n\nDecorin (DCN) is a myokine secreted by SMs during contraction and is involved in\nmuscle development [95]. DCN binds to MSTN and prevents its antimyogenic effects\nby inactivating it in a zinc-dependent manner [96]. In murine SMs in vivo, DCN over-\nexpression facilitates the expression of the promyogenic factor Mighty, which is widely\nexpressed, although it seems to be inhibited in SMs by MSTN [95]. In addition, DCN\noverexpression enhanced the expression levels of Myod1 and follistatin but reduced the\nexpression levels of muscle-atrophy-related genes (atrogin1 and MuRF1) [95]. Myokine\nfunctions are presented in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 7 of 13\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 7 of 13 \n \n\n \n\nthe expression levels of muscle-atrophy-related genes (atrogin1 and MuRF1) [95]. \nMyokine functions are presented in Figure 1. \n\n \nFigure 1. Function of myokines in skeletal muscle. \n\n5. Advantages and Disadvantages Cultured Meat \nFoodborne diseases, antibiotic-resistant strains, resource use, farm animal welfare, \n\nand the environmental consequences of raising livestock, such as pollution from their \nexcrement and massive methane emissions contributing to global warming, are just a few \nof the serious concerns linked with conventional meat production systems, about which \nconsumers have expressed their dissatisfaction [97]. Given the significant negative \nconsequences of meat production on the environment and human health, cultured meat \nproduction, a technique that has the potential to change human existence, represents a \nfeasible alternative. Cultured meat production may provide health and environmental \nbenefits by decreasing pollutants, water usage, and land use connected with existing meat \nproduction methods [98,99]; therefore, cultured meat production techniques show a lot of \npotential for the environment. \n\nThe cell culture technique has significant benefits in terms of cell homogeneity, \nshowing nearly complete control over myogenesis. In addition, MSC can increase by at \nleast 20 times when cultured under ideal conditions. As such, a significant amount of \nmuscle fibers may be obtained from a very small number of isolated cells. Future efforts \nshould be focused on somatic cell nuclear transfer into oocytes (cloning), embryonic stem \ncells, or the ectopic expression of specified factors in inducible PSCs as constantly \nproliferating cells capable of effectively differentiating into myotubes and muscle fibers \n[100–102]. Adjustments to the texture, taste, and flavor of the cultured meat are also \npossible. \n\nCultured meats may have some difficulty competing with regular meats in terms of \ntheir color and appearance; therefore, to improve the appearance and flavor of the \ncultured meat products, new meat processing methods must be developed. Scaffolds \nmade from natural and edible biomaterials, such as collagen, which allow for 3-D tissue \ndevelopment and complex meat structures, have also been suggested and attempted \n[103]. \n\nThe cultured meat production method may disconnect us from nature and animals \nand may be a step toward sustainable urbanization. Cultured meat products fit our \n\nFigure 1. Function of myokines in skeletal muscle.\n\n5.

Cultured meat products fit our growing\ndependence on technology, although there is concern that this may lead to an increasing\ndisconnect from nature [104]. The primary potential barrier is the high cost of cultured\nmeat, despite the fact that large-scale manufacturing and market penetration are generally\n\n\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 8 of 13\n\nlinked with substantial price decreases. Cultured meat production on a large scale is only\npossible if a reasonably low-cost technique is developed that produces a product that is\nqualitatively comparable to existing meat products and is subsidized by the government in\nthe same way that other agribusinesses are subsidized [98,105].\n\n6. Future Prospects\n\nMSCs are the most important components of cultured meat, the production of which\nrequires their multiplication to specific progenitor cells and differentiation into SM cells.\nThe quantity of cultured meat produced is determined by the proliferation of MSCs, and\nhigher cell growth rates are accomplished by improving the efficiency of cell doubling\nprocesses. Differentiation is a crucial step in achieving the desired characteristics of cul-\ntured meat, although proliferation and differentiation media preferences are variable and\ndependent on their composition. Furthermore, as the process progresses from the prolifera-\ntion to the differentiation and maturation phases, the changing needs of cells may require\nculture media adjustments. Although most of the components necessary for proliferation\nand differentiation in commonly used media are identical, GFs and compounds that drive\ndifferentiation are critical for the differentiation and maturation phases. Fetal bovine serum\n(FBS) contains a high concentration of GFs and promotes cell growth; however, although\nFBS is useful for cell culture, it has several limitations. The development of culture media\nfor the large-scale production of high-quality cultured meat products remains a huge\nchallenge. This review shows that various myokines are involved in MSC activation, prolif-\neration, and differentiation, and that IL-15 stimulates the accumulation of MyHC protein\n(a putative biomarker of final myogenic differentiation) in differentiated myotubes. We\nanticipate that myokines are likely to be important components of serum-free media that\npromote cell growth and control cell activity during cultured meat production (Figure 2).\n\nFoods 2021, 10, 2318 8 of 13 \n \n\n \n\ngrowing dependence on technology, although there is concern that this may lead to an \nincreasing disconnect from nature [104]. The primary potential barrier is the high cost of \ncultured meat, despite the fact that large-scale manufacturing and market penetration are \ngenerally linked with substantial price decreases. Cultured meat production on a large \nscale is only possible if a reasonably low-cost technique is developed that produces a \nproduct that is qualitatively comparable to existing meat products and is subsidized by \nthe government in the same way that other agribusinesses are subsidized [98,105]. \n\n6. Future Prospects \nMSCs are the most important components of cultured meat, the production of which \n\nrequires their multiplication to specific progenitor cells and differentiation into SM cells. \nThe quantity of cultured meat produced is determined by the proliferation of MSCs, and \nhigher cell growth rates are accomplished by improving the efficiency of cell doubling \nprocesses. Differentiation is a crucial step in achieving the desired characteristics of \ncultured meat, although proliferation and differentiation media preferences are variable \nand dependent on their composition. Furthermore, as the process progresses from the \nproliferation to the differentiation and maturation phases, the changing needs of cells may \nrequire culture media adjustments. Although most of the components necessary for \nproliferation and differentiation in commonly used media are identical, GFs and \ncompounds that drive differentiation are critical for the differentiation and maturation \nphases. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) contains a high concentration of GFs and promotes cell \ngrowth; however, although FBS is useful for cell culture, it has several limitations. The \ndevelopment of culture media for the large-scale production of high-quality cultured meat \nproducts remains a huge challenge. This review shows that various myokines are \ninvolved in MSC activation, proliferation, and differentiation, and that IL-15 stimulates \nthe accumulation of MyHC protein (a putative biomarker of final myogenic \ndifferentiation) in differentiated myotubes. We anticipate that myokines are likely to be \nimportant components of serum-free media that promote cell growth and control cell \nactivity during cultured meat production (Figure 2). \n\n \nFigure 2.
