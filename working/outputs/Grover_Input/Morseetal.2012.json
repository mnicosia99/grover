and Evidence for Linked Recognition of Type IV\nSecretion System Proteins VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 in\nAnaplasma marginale\n\nKaitlyn Morse,a Junzo Norimine,a Guy H. Palmer,a,b Eric L. Sutten,a Timothy V. Baszler,a and Wendy C. Browna\n\nProgram in Vector-Borne Diseases, Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology,a and Paul G. Allen School for Global Animal Health,b Washington State\nUniversity, Pullman, Washington, USA\n\nLike several other bacterial pathogens, Anaplasma marginale has an outer membrane that induces complete protection from\ninfection and disease. However, the proteins that confer protective immunity and whether protection requires interacting pro-\nteins and/or linked T-cell and immunoglobulin G epitopes are not known. Our goal is to target the conserved type IV secretion\nsystem (T4SS) to identify conserved, immunogenic membrane proteins that are interacting and linked recognition candidates.\nLinked recognition is a process by which a B cell is optimally activated by a helper T cell that responds to the same, or physically\nassociated, antigen. A. marginale T4SS proteins VirB2, VirB4-1, VirB4-2, VirB6-1, VirB7, VirB8-2, VirB9-1, VirB9-2, VirB10,\nVirB11, and VirD4 were screened for their ability to induce IgG and to stimulate CD4� T cells from outer membrane-vaccinated\ncattle. VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 induced the strongest IgG and T-cell responses in the majority of cattle, although three ani-\nmals with major histocompatibility complex class II DRB3 restriction fragment length polymorphism types 8/23, 3/16, and 16/27\nlacked T-cell responses to VirB9-1, VirB9-1 and VirB9-2, or VirB9-2 and VirB10, respectively. For these animals, VirB9-1-,\nVirB9-2-, and VirB10-specific IgG production may be associated with T-cell help provided by responses to an interacting protein\npartner(s). Interacting protein partners indicated by far-Western blotting were confirmed by immunoprecipitation assays and\nrevealed, for the first time, specific interactions of VirB9-1 with VirB9-2 and VirB10. The immunogenicity and interactions of\nVirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 justify their testing as a linked protein vaccine against A. marginale.\n\nAnaplasma marginale is an obligate intraerythrocytic Gram-negative bacterium causing bovine anaplasmosis. Immuniza-\ntion of cattle with A. marginale outer membranes (OM) and cross-\nlinked OM proteins can induce complete protection against\ndisease and infection (10, 43, 57). However, the well-characterized\nimmunodominant major surface proteins 1 to 5 (MSP1 to MSP5),\nwhich include antigenically variant MSP2 and MSP3, do not in-\nduce equivalent protection against A. marginale infection (1, 46,\n47, 49, 50). Because immunodominant MSPs are not protective,\nwe have focused on identifying subdominant and conserved sur-\nface proteins, including those that associate within the membrane\nthat may be important components of the protective OM vaccine.\nAmong the subdominant antigens identified in the OM are type\nIV secretion system (T4SS) proteins. Several T4SS proteins in-\nduced CD4 T cell responses, including gamma interferon (IFN-�)\nproduction, and were recognized by IgG2 in cattle immunized\nwith the OM vaccine (32–34, 56). These type 1 immune responses\nare associated with protection against A. marginale infection in\ncattle immunized with OM (9, 10, 50).\n\nThe T4SS is a 1.1-MDa protein complex that spans the outer\nand inner bacterial membranes and has been most widely studied\nin Agrobacterium tumefaciens (13, 17). Typically, the T4SS is made\nup of 12 interacting VirB/D membrane proteins, several of which\nare likely to be surface exposed (14) and are thus targets for neu-\ntralizing and protective immune responses. The T4SS core com-\nplex is made up of 14 copies of interacting VirB7, VirB9, and\nVirB10, which form a complex that was crystallized and studied\nwith Escherichia coli VirB homologues TraN (VirB7), TraO\n(VirB9), and TraF (VirB10) (13, 17). The Agrobacterium VirB pro-\nteins also assemble into a pilus made up of VirB2, VirB5, and\nVirB7 (28, 29, 53, 54). There are three nucleotide triphosphate\n\n(NTP)-utilizing T4SS proteins—VirB4, VirB11, and VirD4 —that\nsupply energy for substrate translocation, and VirD4 specifically\nacts as the substrate-coupling protein (3, 11). VirB6 and VirB8\nassemble the T4SS apparatus at the cell pole and also make up the\ncore complex (24, 25, 27). The T4SS proteins harbored by A. mar-\nginale and other members of the family Anaplasmataceae are\nunique because they are encoded by two copies of virB4, virB8, and\nvirB9, four or more copies of virB6, and multiple copies of virB2.\nThere are single copies of virB3, virB7, virB10, virB11, and virD4,\nwhereas homologues of virB1 and virB5 have not been identified\n(7, 19, 20). The function of the T4SS in A. marginale has not been\ndetermined, but in a pathogen that has undergone reductive evo-\nlution, retention of these genes indicates their requirement for\ninvasion and survival within erythrocytes and/or tick cells (19,\n20). Because Anaplasmataceae lack lipopolysaccharides (7, 20),\nseveral T4SS proteins may be surface exposed where they could be\ntargeted by neutralizing antibody. Furthermore, T4SS proteins\ninteract within the bacterial membrane so associated proteins\ncould provide linked recognition for T-cell–B-cell interactions.\n\nLinked recognition was described in the 1970s by Mitchison,\n\nReceived 11 August 2011 Returned for modification 13 September 2011\nAccepted 20 October 2011\n\nPublished ahead of print 28 October 2011\n\nEditor: F.

T cells help B cells to undergo somatic hypermutation\nand isotype switching through cognate interaction and cytokine\nsecretion. However, linked recognition can also occur with two\nassociated proteins, where one has B cell epitopes and a second\nprovides T-cell epitopes. For A. marginale, this was suggested in\nstudies with MSP1, a heteromer consisting of covalently associ-\nated MSP1a and MSP1b (35, 60). In these studies, MSP1a-specific\nT cells provided help to B cells specific for MSP1b to promote\nincreased IgG production (8, 36). Immunization with physically\nassociated B- and T-cell antigens achieves long-lasting immuno-\nlogical memory to the B-cell antigen and is a common strategy\nused for vaccination against bacterial polysaccharides that lack\nT-cell epitopes (26, 52).\n\nIn the present study, we test the hypothesis that subdominant\nT4SS proteins of A. marginale that induce an IgG response but no\nCD4� T-cell response in an OM-vaccinated individual interact\nwith a T4SS protein(s) that does stimulate T-cell proliferation\nwhich could provide T-cell help. We present evidence for the\nlinked recognition of VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10, which are\nnaturally associated in A. marginale, and a basis for testing these\nlinked T4SS proteins as a vaccine for anaplasmosis.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nImmunization of six haplotype-diverse cattle with A. marginale OM. St.\nMaries strain A. marginale OM were isolated as previously described from\nsplenectomized bovine C31919 blood with 40.4% bacteremia (34, 43, 48).\nFive age-matched Holstein steers and one Holstein cow with various ma-\njor histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II haplotypes were pur-\nchased from the Washington State University (WSU) dairy. Bovine lym-\nphocyte antigen (BoLA) MHC class II DRB3 types were determined by\nrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of exon 2 of\nthe DRB3 gene (44, 51, 55, 59). Animals (DRB3 RFLP types) used in the\npresent study were cared for according to an approved Institutional Ani-\nmal Care and Use Center (IUCAC) protocol for WSU and were desig-\nnated by number (type) as follows: 35113 (11/22), 35141 (22/24), 35160\n(3/16), 35280 (16/27), 35287 (16/22), and 583 (8/23). It is important to\nnote that the haplotypes represented by the six OM-immunized cattle are\nthe most abundant haplotypes of Holsteins in Washington and Canada\n(unpublished data and reference 55). Cattle were immunized four times\nsubcutaneously with 60 �g of OM emulsified in saponin, at 0, 2, 4, and 8\nweeks as previously described (34). Four immunizations were used to\neffectively prime cattle to these subdominant antigens so that T-cell and\nantibody responses would be detected (33, 34). All six cattle produced\nspecific antibody, determined by immunoblotting, and had statistically\nsignificant peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) proliferative re-\nsponses to A. marginale OM, compared to preimmunization responses\n(see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).\n\nExpression of recombinant proteins. Full-length recombinant T4SS\nproteins were expressed from the A. marginale St. Maries strain. Genes\nencoding VirB9-1 (AM097), VirB9-2 (AM1315), and VirB10 (AM1314)\nwere cloned into pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion vector and expressed as pre-\nviously described with C-terminal FLAG and 6�His tags (33). Recombi-\nnant VirB7 (AM306) with just a C-terminal 6�His tag was also cloned\ninto the pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion vector and expressed and purified as\npreviously described (56). Genes encoding VirB2 (AM030), VirB4-1\n(AM814), VirB4-2 (AM1053), the first fragment of VirB6-1 (AM813 F1),\nVirB8-2 (AM1316), VirB11 (AM1313), and VirD4 (AM1312) were cloned\ninto the pEXP1-DEST vector (Invitrogen), with N-terminal 6�His and\nC-terminal FLAG tags, and expressed in BL-21 DE3 pLysS One Shot E. coli\n(Invitrogen). Primers used for all of these proteins were described previ-\nously (56). Plasmid DNA was extracted from E. coli and sequencing was\n\nperformed using the BigDye kit and ABI Prism automated sequence (Ap-\nplied Biosystems) as described previously (56).\n\nThe negative control protein Babesia bovis merozoite surface antigen 1\n(MSA1) (31) was expressed using the amplified gene from Mo7 genomic\nDNA with the forward primer (GCCGATACTTCAATCGTCCTTCC)\nand reverse primer without a stop codon (TTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTA\nTAGTCTGTACCCTGTTGTCCTTGGAGG) encoding a C-terminal\nFLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). The thermal cycling parameters consisted\nof 40 cycles of melting at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 58°C for 30 s, and\nextension at 72°C for 2 min. The plasmid DNA was excised from agarose\ngels and purified using a Genelute agarose column (Sigma-Aldrich). Am-\nplicons were cloned into the pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion expression vector\n(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and plasmid DNA\nwas extracted from E. coli using the Wizard Plus SV Miniprep DNA puri-\nfication system (Promega) and sequenced.\n\nColonies with the correct sequence were grown to mid log phase in LB\nbroth containing 50 �g of carbenicillin/ml and induced using 0.2% ara-\nbinose for pBAD/TOPO ThioFusion constructs or 1 to 3 mM IPTG\n(isopropyl-�-D-thiogalactopyranoside) for the pEXP1-DEST constructs.\nLB broth used for the expression of rVirB8-2 contained 50 �g of carben-\nicillin/ml and 34 �g of chloramphenicol/ml. Induced E. coli was centri-\nfuged at 3,800 � g, and the pellets were resuspended in denaturing lysis\nbuffer (6 M guanidine HCl, 20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl [pH\n7.8]), sonicated twice on maximum strength for 3 min, and frozen over-\nnight at �80°C.\n\nPurification of recombinant proteins. All proteins were purified us-\ning the hybrid conditions according to the Probond nickel purification kit\ninstructions (Invitrogen). Protein concentrations were determined with\nthe Quick Start Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad), and purity was assessed\nusing 1 or 10 �g/well separated by using Coomassie blue-stained precast\nsodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)\n4 to 20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad).\n\nMS/MS analysis of rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10. Bands corre-\nsponding to 20 and 40 kDa for rVirB7, 50 and 100 kDa for rVirB9-1 and\nrVirB9-2, and 65 and 130 kDa for rVirB10 were excised from Coomassie\nblue-stained gels, destained (50% methanol, 5% acetic acid), dehydrated\nwith 100% acetonitrile, reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),\nquenched with 50 mM iodoacetamide, and digested with 20 ng of trypsin\n(Promega)/�l. The peptides were subjected to tandem mass spectrometric\n(MS/MS) fragmentation on a high-performance liquid chromatography\n(HPLC)-coupled quadruple-time of flight (Q-TOF) MS instrument lo-\ncated at University of Idaho, Environmental Biotechnology Institute.\nFragment ion lists and the identified peptide sequences were searched\nagainst the Mascot databases that contain A. marginale, E. coli, or National\nCenter for Biotechnology Information all entries. Identification of the\nprotein was based upon the Mascot score, the probability, and the mass.\nOne missed trypsin cleavage, fixed carbamidomethyl modifications, and\nvariable oxidation were allowed during the search. A probability of �95%\nshowed the peptide match was not a random occurrence, and the individ-\nual ion score is reported as �10 log10 P, where P is the probability. An ion\nscore greater than 19 has significant identity.\n\nDetermination of serological responses to T4SS proteins by immu-\nnoblotting. Purified recombinant T4SS proteins (1 to 2 �g) were loaded\nonto a 4 to 20% precast gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) with\ndenaturing sample buffer (8.5 mM Tris, 15% SDS, 50% glycerol, 12%\n�-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% bromophenol blue), electrophoresed at 100 V\nfor 1.5 h, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) at 100 V\nfor 1 h. The membrane was blocked overnight with blocking buffer (10\nmM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Tween 20, 1% PVP40). OM-immune\nbovine sera that had been extensively adsorbed with protease-inhibited\nand sonicated BL21 or Top10 E. coli (Invitrogen) cells that contained\neither no vector or a vector encoding MSA1 were diluted 1:100 and added\nto the membrane for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times with\nwash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 1%\nPVP40). A 1:20,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled\n\nMorse et al.\n\n216 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nrecombinant protein G (Zymed) was added for 1 h, and blots were then\nwashed extensively with wash buffer. ECL Western blotting reagent sub-\nstrate (Thermo Scientific) was applied for 2 min. Preimmune, adsorbed\nsera from all animals were also used at a 1:100 dilution on the blots con-\ntaining all of the T4SS proteins to rule out nonspecific IgG binding. After\npositive IgG responses were identified for a given animal and protein, the\nsame procedure was followed as described above, except sera were diluted\n1:300 to 1:10,000.\n\nT-cell proliferation assays. To establish T-cell lines, PBMC were de-\npleted of CD8� cells and �� T cells prior to antigen stimulation by incu-\nbation with sodium azide-free monoclonal antibodies (MAbs; 3 �g/ml),\nfollowed by complement lysis (33). The antibodies were anti-CD8� IgG2a\n(7C2B), anti-CD8� IgM (BAQ111A), anti-TCR� IgG2b (GB21A), and\nanti-TCR� IgM (CACT61A) obtained from the WSU Monoclonal Anti-\nbody Center. Two-week cell lines were generated from CD8- and ��-T-\ncell-depleted PBMC by stimulating for 1 week with 5 �g of OM/ml and\nrested for 1 week as previously described (33). The efficiency of depletion\nwas confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, which\nshowed the T cells were composed of 93.4 to 96.7% CD4� T cells, 1.1 to\n2.4% CD8� T cells, and 2.2 to 2.4% �� T cells. Proliferation assays were\nperformed in triplicate with 1 and 10 �g of recombinant T4SS proteins/\nml, as described previously (33, 56). Positive controls included A. mar-\nginale OM and 10% T-cell growth factor and negative controls included\nuninfected red blood cell membranes (URBC) and B. bovis MSA1 also\nused at 1 and 10 �g/ml. T-cell proliferation was quantified by incorpora-\ntion of 0.25 �Ci/well [3H]thymidine. The results are presented as stimu-\nlation indices (SI), calculated as the mean counts per minute (cpm) of cells\ncultured with antigen/mean cpm of cells cultured with medium. The SI\nfor the different T4SS antigens were compared to the SI for the matching\nconcentration of MSA1 using Dunnett’s test, a one-way multiple-\ncomparison test. Statistically significant T-cell stimulation by an antigen\nwas set at a P value of �0.05.\n\nPreparation of antibodies specific for VirB7, VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and\nVirB10. Rabbits were used in the present study in compliance with the\nWSU IUCAC. Purified recombinant proteins were excised from the SDS-\nPAGE gels and trypsin-digested for Q-TOF MS analysis to confirm that\nthe purified protein was the protein of interest. Recombinant VirB7,\nrVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10 were emulsified with 50% phosphate-\nbuffered saline (PBS) and 50% TiterMax Gold adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich)\nto make a final concentration of 200 �g of protein/ml, and 100 �g of\nprotein was inoculated subcutaneously into rabbits at 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11\nweeks (4 to 6 times) until the immunization was successful, which was\ndetermined by Western blotting with pre- and postimmunization sera\ndiluted 1:500. A negative control rabbit antiserum was made by Pacific\nImmunology, using Freund complete and incomplete adjuvants and a\nfragment of a B. bovis nuclear-encoded protein, acyl carrier protein\n(ACP). The ACP fragment from amino acids 68 to 148 was expressed in\npTrcHIS TOPO TA expression vector (Invitrogen) and purified using\ndenaturing conditions on a nickel column, followed by electroelution of\nthe gel-embedded protein.\n\nPrior to purification of rabbit IgG, 5 ml of each rabbit serum was\nincubated with 3 ml of crude Top10 E. coli lysate expressing MSA1 for 1 h\nin binding buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate [pH 7.0]) at room temper-\nature and centrifuged to remove nonspecific antibodies. The adsorbed\nantisera were buffer-exchanged twice by diluting with binding buffer and\ncentrifuging using 15-ml Amicon 10k filters (Millipore). Subsequently, a\nHiTrap protein A column (GE Healthcare Biosciences) was used to purify\nIgG from the sera according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Purified IgG\nwas buffer exchanged with sterile PBS and concentrated with an Amicon\n10-kDa cutoff filter, and the final concentration of IgG was determined\nwith a Bio-Rad Bradford assay. IgGs were purified on protein A columns,\nthe purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, and the specificity was determined\non immunoblots with 1 �g of each recombinant T4SS protein, 10 �g of A.\nmarginale OM, and 2 �g of adsorbed and purified IgG/ml. Secondary\nantibody was alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit\n\nIgG(H�L) (Invitrogen) diluted 1:10,000, and blots were developed with\nthe Western Star chemiluminescence kit (Applied Biosystems).\n\nFar-Western blotting. Far-Western blotting was performed as previ-\nously described (4, 12, 62) with the following modifications and under\nconditions of protein denaturation and renaturation. SDS-PAGE was per-\nformed with 1 �g of each recombinant protein loaded per well on 4 to\n20% gradient gels and electrophoresis at 100 V for 1.5 h. After transfer to\nnitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h, the nitrocellulose membrane\nwith recombinant T4SS protein was first incubated with 6 M guanidine\nhydrochloride–20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5)–50 mM KCl–10 mM MgCl2–1\nmM DTT– 0.1% Nonidet P40 –2% milk (GuHCl buffer) for 30 min at\nroom temperature, then successively incubated for 30 min each with 3 M\nand 1.5 M GuHCl buffer at room temperature, then incubated with 0.6 M\nGuHCl buffer at 4°C for 30 min, and finally incubated with buffer lacking\nGuHCl overnight at 4°C. The membrane was blocked with 20 mM Tris-\nHCl (pH 7.5)–150 mM NaCl (TBS) with 5% milk for 3 h. Two far-\nWestern membranes were run in tandem. One membrane was incubated\nwith a 1:2,000 dilution of HRP-conjugated anti-His MAb (Qiagen) to\nconfirm proteins on the membrane after denaturing (see Fig. S2 in the\nsupplemental material). The second membrane was used to identify a\ntarget recombinant protein interacting with another recombinant pro-\ntein. To determine whether the target recombinant protein (VirB9-1,\nVirB9-2, or VirB10) bound to a prey recombinant T4SS protein(s), the\nmembrane containing 1 �g of each transferred prey protein was incu-\nbated with 10 �g of target protein in 5 ml of TBS with 5% milk overnight\nat 4°C. The membrane was then washed three times with TBS containing\n0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). Rabbit antiserum, adsorbed with Top10 E. coli\nlysate expressing MSA1 and directed against the target protein (rVirB9-1,\nrVirB9-2, or rVirB10), was added to the membrane at a 1:500 dilution in\nTBS plus 5% milk, and the excess was washed off. The membrane was\nincubated with a 1:10,000 dilution of AP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit\nIgG(H�L) for 1 h and then washed extensively with TBST and developed\nusing the Western-Star chemiluminescent substrate.\n\nDetermining the binding coefficients of interacting rVirB9-1,\nrVirB9-2, and rVirB10. Serial dilutions (0.5 to 5.0 �g) of rVirB9-2 and\nrVirB10 were applied to a dot blot apparatus and used to find the binding\ncoefficient to rVirB9-1 (12). Recombinant VirB9-1 was also applied to the\ndot blot as a positive control, and a higher concentration of (0.5 to 10.0\n�g) rMSA1 was used as a negative control for background subtraction.\nThe dot blot was developed using the same procedure as for far-Western\nblotting described above using 10 �g of rVirB9-1 to probe the blot and a\n1:500 dilution of adsorbed polyclonal anti-VirB9-1 rabbit serum to detect\nrVirB9-1. Densitometry analysis of the spots containing interacting pro-\nteins or controls was performed with ImageJ 1.43 software from National\nInstitutes of Health. The data were fit to a standard one-site saturation\nbinding curve Y � Ymax (X)/(KD � X), where Y is the intensity of the spot,\nX is concentration of the protein on the membrane, and KD is the binding\nassociation constant using SigmaPlot 10.0. From this equation of the line\nthe binding association constants were found for rVirB9-1 binding to\nrVirB9-2 and rVirB10.\n\nProduction of MAbs. Mice were used in the present study in compli-\nance with the WSU IUCAC. Two female BALB/c mice were immunized\nsubcutaneously with 20 �g of rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, or rVirB10 emulsified\nin an equal volume of complete Freund adjuvant for a total volume of 150\n�l. Mice received three booster immunizations at 2-week intervals with 20\n�g of antigen in incomplete Freund adjuvant. Pre- and postimmunization\nsera were used to probe blots to detect specific protein in native OM. A\nfinal immunization with 10 �g of protein in 100 �l of PBS was given\nintravenously, and spleens were removed 3 days later for hybridoma fu-\nsion. Fusion and limiting dilution cloning were performed as described\npreviously (63). Hybridomas were screened for a positive reaction on\nimmunoblots of all three recombinant proteins, as well as the OM. Hy-\nbridomas that reacted specifically with the recombinant protein of inter-\nest, as well as native protein, were selected for cloning. Supernatants from\nclones were similarly screened, and three clones were selected for MAb\n\nLinked Recognition of A. marginale T4SS Proteins\n\nJanuary 2012 Volume 80 Number 1 iai.asm.org 217\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nproduction. These are 133/248.14.1.28 specific for VirB9-1 (IgG1), 137/\n774.8.7 specific for VirB9-2 (IgG2b), and 138/481.3.9 specific for VirB10\n(IgG1).\n\nImmunoprecipitation. A high concentration of OM was used for im-\nmunoprecipitation because the T4SS proteins are not abundant (34). The\nnonionic detergent n-dodecyl �-D-maltoside (DM) was used for solubili-\nzation to help maintain native protein conformation and the natural hy-\ndrophobic interaction or hydrogen bonding of the membrane proteins. A.\nmarginale OM were solubilized for at least 4 h in DM (Sigma-Aldrich) at\n4°C with rotation to yield a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in 2% DM,\nand cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 � g for 10 min at\n4°C. A 350-�l aliquot of supernatant was used for each immunoprecipi-\ntation reaction. Protein A-purified polyclonal rabbit IgG (2 �g) specific\nfor VirB9-1, VirB9-2, VirB10, or B. bovis ACP (negative control) was\nincubated with the solubilized OM proteins for 2 h at 4°C with rocking.\nProtein A-agarose (20 �l; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, followed\nby incubation for 1 h at 4°C, with rocking. The native protein complexes\nwere centrifuged at 660 � g for 5 min, and the pellet was washed four\ntimes with 400 �l of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8)–150 mM NaCl– 0.1% Non-\nidet P40 and once with sterile PBS. For analysis, the pellet was immediately\nresuspended in 0.3 M Tris-HCl–5% SDS–50% glycerol–100 mM dithio-\nthreitol–tracking dye (pH 6.8 [Lane Marker Sample Buffer; Thermo Sci-\nentific]) to yield a total volume of 95 �l in 1� sample buffer, and 10 �l was\nloaded per well on 4 to 20% gradient gels and electrophoresed at 100 V for\n1.5 h. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes at 100 V for 1 h, the\ninteracting proteins were determined on Western blots probed with 1\n�g/ml of polyclonal rabbit IgG specific for a candidate interacting protein\npartner or for the target protein. After extensive washing in I-block con-\ntaining 0.3% Tween 20, blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated\nClean-Blot (Thermo Scientific) that only binds to intact antibodies, ac-\ncording to the manufacturer’s protocol, washed with I-block containing\n0.3% Tween 20, and developed with the ECL Western blotting reagent\n(Thermo Scientific). MAbs used at 2 �g/ml specific for MSP5 (AnaF16C1)\nand MSP2 (AnaR49a) (38) were also used to probe the blots for additional\nspecificity controls. The blots probed with anti-MSP5 were incubated\nwith HRP-Clean-Blot and developed as described above, and the anti-\nMSP2 probed blots were incubated with AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse\nIgG�IgM (Invitrogen) diluted 1:10,000 and developed with the Western-\nStar chemiluminescent substrate. Immunoprecipitation was also per-\nformed with 2 �g of MSP5-specific MAb/ml and protein A/G agarose\n\n(Thermo Scientific), and the immunoprecipitate (IP) was electropho-\nresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, probed with antibodies, and devel-\noped as described above. Each polyclonal antibody and anti-MSP5 used\nfor immunoprecipitation pulled down the respective target protein.\n\nIn addition, immunoprecipitation reactions were performed with rab-\nbit anti-VirB9-1 IgG as described above, and the IPs were electrophoresed\nin a single large well, transferred to nitrocellulose, and strips were cut and\nprobed with 2 �g of mouse MAb specific for VirB9-1, VirB9-2, VirB10,\nMSP2, MSP5, or B. bovis MSA1 (23/10.41, IgG2b) (22)/ml. Secondary\nantibody was AP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG�IgM diluted 1:10,000.\nBlots were developed with Western-Star chemiluminescent substrate for\n30 min or longer.\n\nRESULTS\nRecombinant T4SS proteins. All proteins were expressed with\ntheir full-length, with the exception of VirB6-1 F1, for which the\nfirst fragment was used because the full-length protein did not\nexpress (Fig. 1). Some additional weak bands were observed (i.e.,\nfor VirB4-2, VirB8-2, and VirB11). For VirB4-2, these reacted\nwith anti-HIS MAb on immunoblotting, suggesting they are de-\ngraded protein fragments (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental mate-\nrial). Visualization of immunoblots of rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and\nrVirB10 probed with anti-FLAG MAb indicated that the purified\nproteins migrated at 50, 50, and 65 kDa, as well as at 100, 100, and\n130 kDa, respectively (Fig. 2A). The corresponding weak bands on\nCoomassie blue-stained gels (Fig. 2B) were excised for MS/MS\nanalysis, rVirB9-1 and rVirB9-2 were each identified in their re-\nspective 50- and 100-kDa bands, and VirB10 was identified in\nboth 65- and 130-kDa bands (Table 1). Because other A. marginale\nproteins were not identified, this is consistent with the formation\nof homodimers by rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10. The same\nprocedure was followed with rVirB7 bands at 20 and 40 kDa (Fig.\n2); however, there was no evidence that rVirB7 dimerized. The\n20-kDa band was identified as VirB7, and the 40-kDa band was\nidentified as E. coli thioredoxin 1 (Table 1). Although faint bands\nmigrating at �140 kDa were observed for VirB9-1 and VirB9-2 on\nsome immunoblots (Fig. 2A), there were no corresponding pro-\ntein bands visible on the gel, even when 10 time more protein was\nloaded (Fig. 2B), so these were not analyzed by MS/MS. These may\n\nFIG 1 Purity of recombinant T4SS proteins. Recombinant T4SS proteins were\nloaded at 1 �g/well, separated on 4 to 20% gradient SDS-PAGE gels, and\nstained with Coomassie blue dye. The proteins were electrophoresed on sepa-\nrate gels, and scanned images were arranged as presented. An asterisk indicates\nthe predicted molecular mass of the recombinant protein, indicated in paren-\ntheses as follows: rVirB2 (20 kDa), rVirB4-1 (90 kDa), rVirB4-2 (91 kDa),\nrVirB6-1 F1 (90 kDa), rVirB7 (20 kDa), rVirB8-2 (23 kDa), rVirB9-1 (46 kDa),\nrVirB9-2 (46 kDa), rVirB10 (65 kDa), rVirB11 (38 kDa), rVirD4 (93 kDa), and\ncontrol rMSA1 (58 kDa).\n\nFIG 2 Evidence for dimerization of rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10. (A)\nRecombinant proteins (1 �g) were transferred from a 4 to 20% gradient SDS-\nPAGE gel to a nitrocellulose membrane that was probed with anti-His MAb\n(rVirB7) or anti-FLAG MAb (rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10) and devel-\noped. Scanned images were rearranged and presented as shown. The results for\nVirB7 were obtained in a separate experiment. (B) Coomassie blue-stained\nSDS-PAGE gel corresponding to the Western blot in panel A, with the excep-\ntion that 10 �g of protein was loaded in each lane to visualize the faint bands.\nAsterisks denote bands where the A. marginale T4SS protein was identified by\nMS/MS analysis.\n\nMorse et al.\n\n218 iai.asm.org Infection and Immunity\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nrepresent protein trimers or multimers with other T4SS proteins\n(13, 17). In addition to the protein bands that were identified as\ndimers, products of VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 that migrated\nbelow the dimeric and monomeric forms were visualized on both\nthe gels and Western blots. Because these bands react with anti-\nFLAG MAb, which is highly specific for this epitope, these bands\nlikely represent degradation products of the individual proteins\nresulting in bands smaller than the monomers and dimers, as pre-\nviously observed for these proteins (33).\n\nIgG responses to T4SS proteins in OM vaccinees. All six OM-\nimmunized cattle produced IgG against VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and\nVirB10, with VirB9-1 inducing the highest titer tested of at least\n10,000 (Table 2). Cattle 35113, 35141, 35160, 35280, and 35287\nproduced strong IgG responses directed at VirB7 with titers of at\nleast 10,000. Cattle 35280 and 35287 also produced IgG against\nVirB4-2. However, none of the animals produced detectable IgG\nresponses against VirB2, VirB4-1, VirB6-1 F1, VirB8-2, VirB11, or\nVirD4 compared to preimmunization sera.\n\nT-lymphocyte responses to T4SS proteins in OM vaccinees.\nTwo-week T-cell lines enriched for CD4� T cells from the six\nOM-immunized cattle were tested for antigen specific prolifera-\ntion to recombinant T4SS proteins (Table 3). VirB9-1, VirB9-2,\nand VirB10 were highly immunogenic for the majority of the an-\nimals. However, animals 35160 and 583 did not respond to\n\nVirB9-1, animals 35160 and 35280 did not respond to VirB9-2,\nand animal 35280 did not respond to VirB10. Animals 35160 and\n35287 had significant T-cell responses to VirB2, and animal 35160\nhad a significant T-cell response to VirD4. Interestingly, 35160\nwas the only animal that had T-cell responses to VirB6-1, and\n35287 was the only animal that responded to VirB4-2. Lastly, there\nwas no detectable T-cell response from any animal to VirB4-1,\nVirB7, VirB8-2 and VirB11 antigens. These results are represen-\ntative of three or more experiments.\n\nSelection of linked recognition candidates. Selection of T4SS\nprotein candidates that could undergo linked recognition was\nbased on predicted surface localization, as well as induction of an\nIgG response, but not a significant CD4 T-cell response, in the\nsame individual. Based on previous results with A. phagocytophi-\nlum and A. marginale (2, 18, 42, 43, 61) and bioinformatic predic-\ntions for A. marginale (see Fig. S3 and Table S1 in the supplemen-\ntal material), VirB2, VirB6-1, VirB7, VirB8-2, VirB9-1, VirB9-2,\nand VirB10 are predicted to be localized on the exterior surface of\nA. marginale. Therefore, the ability of any of these proteins to\ninduce IgG without a significant CD4 T-cell response would make\nit a candidate for linked recognition and inclusion in future vac-\ncine trials, as surface exposed proteins could be blocked by neu-\ntralizing antibody. These candidates are VirB9-1 for animal 583\n(DRB3 RFLP type 8/23), VirB9-1, and VirB9-2 for animal 35160\n(3/16), VirB9-2 and VirB10 for animal 35280 (16/27), and VirB7\nfor all animals except 583 (summarized in Table 4). These proteins\nwere therefore selected to identify protein partners within the\nT4SS that had T-cell epitopes recognized by these animals.\n\nDetecting the interactions of VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10\nby far-Western blotting. Protein A-purified rabbit IgG against\nrVirB7, rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and rVirB10 was tested for antigen\nspecificity by immunoblotting with native OM and recombinant\nT4SS proteins (Fig. 3). In repeated assays, anti-VirB7 detected a\nband in the OM that was greater than the predicted native mass of\n�6 kDa (Fig. 3A). In contrast, IgG against rVirB9-1, rVirB9-2, and\nrVirB10 recognized the native OM protein at the predicted mo-\nlecular weight and at a 2-fold-higher molecular weight (Fig. 3B to\nD). In addition, anti-VirB9-2 detected a fainter, narrow band at\n�140 kDa, which may represent a multimer of the native protein\nor a multimer of VirB9-2 and another protein(s).

Bands larger than the dimer that\nare present in the immunizing protein detected by the IgGs against\nVirB9-1 and VirB9-2 may represent multimers of the VirB9 pro-\ntein with other T4SS proteins, since it is known that the A. tume-\nfaciens core-complex has 14 copies of VirB9 that interact with 14\ncopies of VirB7 and 14 copies of VirB10 (17). Importantly, the\nIgGs did not bind to any other T4SS protein, showing that the IgGs\nwere specific for the immunizing protein. An artifactual band of-\n\nten observed in immunoblots with polyclonal rabbit antisera that\nwas determined to be keratin (45) was observed with the anti-\nVirB9-2 antibody, which detects a diffuse band at �68 kDa and\nanother at �140 kDa (Fig. 3C).

The far-Western blots developed with anti-\nVirB7 failed to detect potential interacting proteins (data not\nshown), so proteins interacting with VirB7 were not pursued\nfurther. However, the results indicate several interactions among\nT4SS proteins. Recombinant VirB9-1 interacted with rVirB8-2 at\nthe correct molecular mass of 23 kDa; with rVirB9-2 at the pre-\ndicted mass of 46 kDa, as well as with a predicted dimer and with\napparent degradation products; with rVirB10 at the predicted\nmass of 65 kDa, as well as with apparent degradation products;\nand with rMSP5 at the predicted mass of 28 kDa (Fig. 4A). Recom-\nbinant VirB9-2 interacted with rVirB9-1 at the predicted mass of\n46 kDa, as well as with a predicted dimer and apparent degrada-\ntion products (Fig. 4B). Recombinant VirB10 interacted with\nrVirB4-1 at the predicted mass of 91 kDa, with rVirB8-2 at the\npredicted mass of 23 kDa, with rVirB9-1 at the predicted mass of\n46 kDa, and with rVirD4 at the predicted mass of 93 kDa and two\nsmaller bands (Fig. 4C). The reactivity of degradation products of\nthese proteins with anti-His MAb can be seen in Fig. S2 in the\nsupplemental material.\n\nBinding coefficients for VirB9-1 interactions. The binding\ncoefficient for rVirB9-1 interaction with rVirB9-2 was 0.0173 �\n\n0.0034 �M and that for rVirB9-1 interaction with rVirB10 was\n0.0109 � 0.0094 �M (Fig. 5). The binding coefficients for the\nreverse of the interactions were also determined and found to be\nsimilar (rVirB9-2 with rVirB9-1, KD � 0.0205 � 0.0173 �M; and\nrVirB10 with rVirB9-1, KD � 0.0135 � 0.0080 �M; see Fig. S4 in\nthe supplemental material), whereas there was no binding de-\ntected between VirB9-2 and VirB10 (see Fig. S4 in the supplemen-\ntal material). The graphed intensities of the spots that yielded the\nabove KD values all had a goodness of fit to the binding curve\nequation with at least 80% confidence (Fig. 5).

However, an additional band at �60 kDa\nwas also detected with these antibodies. The 60-kDa bands could\nrepresent homodimers of these proteins, a heterodimer of\nVirB9-1 and VirB9-2, or binding to another 30-kDa protein.\nVirB9-2 (Fig. 6B, lane 1), VirB10 (Fig. 6C, lane 1), and 19-kDa\nMSP5 (Fig. 6D, lane 1) were also detected in the VirB9-1 IP, but\nthe �37-kDa MSP2 was not (Fig. 6E, lane 1). The anti-VirB9-2 IP\nprobed with anti-VirB9-1 IgG also showed �30- and �60-kDa\nbands (Fig. 6A, lane 2). VirB10 (Fig. 6C, lane 2), MSP5 (Fig. 6D,\nlane 2), and MSP2 (Fig. 6E, lane 2) were not detected in the anti-\nVirB9-2 IP. For the anti-VirB10 IP, a band with the predicted mass\nfor VirB10 (49 kDa) was detected, along with an additional band\n\nat �100 kDa (Fig. 6C, lanes 3 and 6). This 100-kDa band could be\na homodimer of VirB10 or an interaction of VirB10 with another\nprotein(s). VirB9-1 was detected in this IP (Fig. 6A, lane 3), but\nVirB9-2 (Fig. 6B, lane 3), MSP5 (Fig. 6D, lane 3), and MSP2 (Fig.\n6E, lane 3) were not. Immunoprecipitation reactions were also\nalkylated to prevent reformation of disulfide bonds, electropho-\nresed, and probed with anti-VirB9-1, anti-VirB9-2, anti-VirB10,\nand anti-ACP. However, reduction and alkylation had little effect\non the interactions or apparent homodimerization (see Fig. S5 in\nthe supplemental material), suggesting that the observed T4SS\ninteractions are not formed with disulfide linkages. The negative\ncontrol rabbit anti-ACP IgG immunoprecipitation did not pull\ndown any T4SS protein, MSP5, or MSP2 (Fig. 6A to E, lane 4).\n\nTo confirm the interaction of native VirB9-1 with MSP5, im-\nmunoprecipitation was performed with MAb against MSP5, and\nit was determined that MSP5 does interact with VirB9-1 (Fig. 6A,\nlane 5), but not with VirB9-2 or VirB10 (Fig. 6B and C, lane 5,\nrespectively). Furthermore, the highly abundant MSP2 (34) was\nnever identified in the T4SS IPs (Fig. 6E, lanes 1 to 5), supporting\nthe specificity of the detected T4SS interactions.

Because of this high degree of amino acid\nsequence identity, these T4SS proteins would be good candidates\nfor inclusion in a cross-protective vaccine.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThis study sought to identify A. marginale T4SS protein candi-\ndates for linked recognition that could be incorporated into a\nvaccine. Linked recognition is a well-known rationale for design-\ning vaccines against pathogens with capsular polysaccharide anti-\ngens, which on their own are poorly antigenic. Examples include\nvaccines for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneu-\nmoniae, where T-dependent protein antigens are linked to the\nT-independent polysaccharide to achieve neutralizing antibody\nresponses directed against the polysaccharide (26, 52). Immuni-\nzation studies using two or more associated proteins are also sug-\ngestive that linked recognition enhances protection against bacte-\nrial pathogens. For example, protective immunity was induced\nwith bacterial membrane protein complexes or fusion proteins of\nsurface exposed type III secretion system proteins of Yersinia pestis\n(6, 23). Association of proteins within the context of the mem-\nbrane was also important for leptospiral outer membrane porin\nOmpL1 and lipoprotein LipL41 in protection studies (21).\n\nConsistent with previous results (32–34, 56) VirB9-1, VirB9-2,\nand VirB10 are highly immunogenic and in the present study were\nthe most immunogenic of the 11 A. marginale T4SS proteins ex-\namined for cattle with diverse MHC class II haplotypes. We con-\nfirmed that cattle with the DRB3 RFLP type 8/23 (animal 583 in\nthe present study and animal 04B91 [33, 56]) have an IgG re-\nsponse, but no T-cell response, to VirB9-1. This suggests that for\nanimals with this haplotype, T-cell help for IgG production is\nprovided through linked recognition by a different, but associated\nprotein. In addition, we have new evidence that linked recognition\noccurs for cattle with the DRB3 RFLP type 3/16 to produce IgG to\nVirB9-1 and VirB9-2 (animal 35160), DRB3 RFLP type 16/27 to\nproduce IgG to VirB9-2 and VirB10 (animal 35280), and DRB3\nRFLP types 11/22, 22/24, 3/16, 16/27, and 16/22 to produce IgG to\nVirB7 (animals 35113, 35141, 35160, 35280, and 35287, respec-\ntively). All of these proteins are likely to be surface exposed, as\npredicted by bioinformatics. Furthermore, these proteins were\nrecognized by the immune sera of infected animals (2, 56, 61), and\nVirB10 was identified in outer membrane complexes following\ncross-linking with membrane-impermeable cross-linkers (43).\nBased on the criteria of predicted surface localization and pattern\nof immune recognition by three animals and haplotypes that had\nIgG but undetectable T-cell responses to one or two of these pro-\nteins, VirB7, VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and VirB10 were designated can-\ndidates for linked recognition. We then focused on identifying the\ninteracting protein partners of VirB9 and VirB10 proteins within\nthe T4SS.\n\nFar-Western blotting was used as an initial screening tool to\nidentify potential interacting T4SS proteins. The data suggest that\nrecombinant VirB10 interacts with rVirB4-1, rVirB8-2, VirB9-1,\nand rVirD4, interactions that have also been observed with ho-\nmologous proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens (3, 5, 15). The\ninteractions of rVirB10 with rVirB4-1 and rVirD4, two putative\n\nNTPases, have also been observed for Helicobacter pylori and Rick-\nettsia sibrica (37, 58) and implicate VirB10 in substrate shuttling\n(11). The VirB4-1 gene is more conserved across the Rickettsiales\nthan VirB4-2, and VirB4-2 has more insertions and deletions, in-\ncluding those in the NTP-binding cleft, relative to other bacteria\n(19). This is consistent with the observed interaction of VirB10\nwith VirB4-1 and not with VirB4-2. Recombinant VirB10 and\nrVirB9-1 both appear to interact with rVirB8-2, indicating that\nVirB8-2 may also be part of the core complex of the T4SS appara-\ntus (15, 27). However, VirB8-2 was not of particular interest to\npursue because it was not antigenic for the OM vaccinees used in\nthe present study. The interaction of rVirB9-1 and rVirB9-2 had\nnot been previously reported, because only bacteria in the family\nAnaplasmatacae are known to express two full-length VirB9 pro-\nteins (19, 20). The interaction of rVirB9-1 with rMSP5 is interest-\ning since none of the other proteins interacted with MSP5. How-\never, it is unknown if MSP5 has T-cell epitopes to stimulate T-cell\nhelp to VirB9-1 in 3/16 and 8/23 DRB3 RFLP-typed animals. The\ninteractions of rVirB9 and rVirB10 proteins were confirmed for\nnative proteins in solubilized A. marginale OM using pulldown\nassays with polyclonal, monospecific antibodies and detection\nwith both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. These interac-\ntions and the potential formation of homodimers are consistent\nwith what is known about the A. tumefaciens T4SS core complex\nstructure (13, 17). However, this is the first study to report inter-\nacting T4SS proteins of the A. marginale, as well as the first to\ndocument interactions of the VirB9 and VirB10 proteins in the\nAnaplasmatacae.\n\nThe immunogenicity of VirB9 and VirB10 proteins may be\nexplained by the lack of surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leading\nto increased surface exposure of these proteins that form the outer\ncap of the T4SS core complex (7, 17, 19, 20). Although Rickettsia\nspp. synthesize LPS, the Anaplasmataceae do not (20). In agree-\nment with our results and the observation that cattle infected with\nA. marginale have antibody to VirB9 and VirB10 proteins (2, 56,\n61), dogs infected with Ehrlichia canis were also serologically pos-\nitive for VirB9 (16). Thus, the T4SS VirB9 and VirB10 proteins\nmay generally be good vaccine targets for the Anaplasmatacae.\n\nA combination of cellular and humoral immunity is likely\nimportant for the control of anaplasmosis, and vaccine anti-\ngens should be highly conserved across multiple strains to en-\nsure cross-protective immunity. Furthermore, inclusion in a\nvaccine of multiple linked proteins that are naturally associated\nin the membrane of A. marginale will not only provide more\nthan one immunogenic protein but will offer the opportunity\nfor linked recognition. Immunization with several naturally\nassociated, linked proteins could increase T-cell-dependent\nIgG responses upon infection in outbred populations that ex-\npress a broad repertoire of MHC class II molecules. Protecting\na large population of genetically heterogeneous individuals re-\nquires understanding of MHC class II-restricted epitope pre-\nsentation. The naturally associated T4SS protein complex that\nspans the inner and outer membrane provides a model system\nto examine the importance of membrane protein-protein in-\nteractions in stimulating protective immunity. Thus, a protein\ncomplex made up of highly conserved VirB9-1, VirB9-2, and\nVirB10 will be tested as a vaccine in a future study to protect\nMHC haplotype-defined cattle against A. marginale.\n\nLinked Recognition of A. marginale T4SS Proteins\n\nJanuary 2012 Volume 80 Number 1 iai.asm.org 225\n\nhttp://iai.asm.org\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe technical assistance of Shelley Whidbee, Beverly Hunter, Bruce Ma-\nthison, Nishant Dwivedi, and Emma Karel is appreciated.
