Here we show that ERK-\nmediated reactivation is dependent on the mitogen and stress activated kinase (MSK) family. Furthermore, this MSK\nmediated response is dependent on CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter (MIEP). Specifically, CREB\nbinding to the MIEP provides the target for MSK recruitment. Importantly, MSK mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is\nrequired to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. Taken together, these data\nsuggest that CREB binding to the MIEP is necessary for the recruitment of the kinase activity of MSKs to initiate the\nchromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for reactivation. Thus the importance of CREB during HCMV reactivation is to\npromote chromatin modifications conducive for viral gene expression as well as acting as a classical transcription factor.\nClearly, specific inhibition of this interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention.\n\nCitation: Kew VG, Yuan J, Meier J, Reeves MB (2014) Mitogen and Stress Activated Kinases Act Co-operatively with CREB during the Induction of Human\nCytomegalovirus Immediate-Early Gene Expression from Latency.

The prototype betaherpesvirus member, Human\n\nCytomegalovirus (HCMV) is no exception, establishing a latent\n\nreservoir in the haematopoietic cells of the bone marrow (reviewed\n\nin [1]). It is likely that sporadic reactivation and shedding –\n\nalthough subclinical – is important for the sero-prevalence of\n\nHCMV in the population via horizontal transmission. However, it\n\nis the reactivation of HCMV (as well as primary infection) in\n\nimmune-compromised transplant recipients or late-stage AIDS\n\nsufferers that represent a significant source of morbidity and\n\nmortality in these high risk patient populations [2,3,4]. Conse-\n\nquently, an understanding of the molecular and physiological cues\n\nthat promote reactivation could inform on the design of novel\n\ntherapeutic strategies.\n\nStudies from a number of laboratories using analyses of\n\nexperimental and natural latency have led to a consensus that\n\nHCMV establishes latency in the haematopoietic cells of the bone\n\nmarrow [5,6,7,8,9], persists in the monocyte/myeloid lineage\n\n[10,11,12] and reactivates upon the differentiation and/or\n\nstimulation of these cells to a more mature or activated phenotype\n\n[8,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Furthermore, these reactivation events\n\nappear to be augmented by inflammatory cytokine signalling\n\n(e.g. TNF, interferon-gamma) acting in concert with cellular\n\ndifferentiation [13,16,18]. Indeed we, and others, have reported\n\nthat the incubation of latently infected myeloid cells with IL-6 can\n\nbe a trigger for HCMV reactivation in experimental latency\n\n[13,17]. Furthermore, we have also observed that the reactivation\n\nof naturally latent virus from the dendritic cells (DCs) of healthy\n\nindividuals can be markedly abrogated using neutralising IL-6\n\nantibodies [13,16]. Although we have postulated a role for ERK-\n\nMAPK and interleukin-6 signalling in this event the underlying\n\nmechanisms are still unclear [13].\n\nIn concert with observations in primary cells, studies of the\n\nquiescent infection of the embryonal T2 carcinoma cell line have\n\nsuggested that elevated cAMP signalling promotes reactivation in a\n\ncreb response element (CRE) dependent manner [19,20]. This\n\nalleviation of quiescent infection can be achieved using both\n\nchemical (forskolin) and biological (vasoactive intestinal peptide)\n\nactivity and is suggestive that regions of the major immediate early\n\npromoter (MIEP) shown to be redundant during lytic infection\n\nmay have important functions during reactivation from latency in\n\nresponse to these stimuli [19,20,21]. In contrast, transfection\n\nexperiments with the MIEP point towards a role for TNF-a and\ndownstream NF-KB signalling during reactivation [22] and,\nindeed, murine CMV (MCMV) studies support an important role\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 1 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195\n\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.1004195&domain=pdf\n\n\nfor these signalling pathways also [23,24,25]. Furthermore, the\n\nreactivation of HCMV from experimentally latent cell lines has\n\nalso been reported using phorbol esters and TNF-a - again\nconsistent with a role for aspects of NF-Kb signalling being\ninvolved in HCMV reactivation [26,27] by triggering IE gene\n\nexpression.\n\nERK MAPK signalling can be activated by a diverse number of\n\nligands acting through two upstream modulators. Classical Ras-\n\nRaf mediated ERK-MAPK signalling often acts in response to\n\nmitogenic stimulation [28] with aberrant signalling associated with\n\na transformed phenotype in oncogenic cells [29]. Alternatively,\n\nsignalling can be activated by tpl2/Cot1 [30] which targets\n\ndownstream ERK phosphorylation following the engagement of\n\nToll-like [31] and receptors in the TNF super-family [32]. ERK\n\nphosphorylation promotes nuclear translocation and subsequent\n\nphosphorylation of a number of target proteins [33]. These targets\n\ninclude the mitogen and stress activated protein kinases (MSKs)\n\nand 90kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSKs) [34,35,36] which\n\nthemselves target a number of cellular substrates [35,37].\n\nInterestingly, these targets include transcription factors and histone\n\nproteins that may have roles in the regulation of HCMV\n\nimmediate early gene expression [15,19,20,38,39,40].\n\nIn this study, we have sought to address the mechanisms that\n\nare important for the induction of IE gene expression required to\n\ninitiate HCMV reactivation. We have focussed on the interplay\n\nbetween cellular signalling pathways and the activation of target\n\ntranscription factors. Building on our previous studies looking at\n\nERK-MAPK signalling we have addressed the impact of CREB\n\nbinding to the MIEP and how it asks as a platform to integrate\n\ncellular signalling at the MIEP in differentiating DCs capable of\n\nsupporting reactivation. Using interleukin-6 or LPS as a tool to\n\ninitiate HCMV reactivation, we have identified that phosphory-\n\nlated CREB occupancy on the MIEP is important for the\n\ninduction of IE gene expression. Furthermore, we also show that\n\nhistone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 correlates with induction\n\nof IE gene expression. Interestingly, the activation of the upstream\n\nMSKs is pivotal for reactivation - with CREB and Histone H3\n\nbeing major targets for this kinase which is also recruited to the\n\nMIEP prior to the induction of IE gene expression. Intriguingly,\n\nwe also observe that histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP is\n\ndefective in the DCRE virus suggesting that binding and\nphosphorylation of CREB by MSKs promotes the subsequent\n\nphosphorylation of histone H3. Finally, we show that abrogation\n\nof ERK-MAPK signalling using a dominant negative form of\n\nMEK1, the upstream kinase of ERK1/2, diminishes MSK\n\nactivation and blocks CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation at\n\nthe MIEP resulting in a substantial defect in IE gene expression.\n\nSince histone H3 phosphorylation is a key event in the transition\n\nfrom a repressed (latent) to an active (reactivated) promoter these\n\ndata suggest that CREB is an important factor for reactivation not\n\nonly because of its classical role as a transcriptional activator but\n\nalso via co-operative interaction with MSK to drive elevated\n\nhistone phosphorylation at the MIEP and subsequent activation of\n\ngene expression.\n\nResults\n\nIE gene expression from latent virus is promoted through\nRas-Raf mediated ERK-MAPK signalling\n\nOngoing studies of the pathways important for HCMV\n\nreactivation from DCs have highlighted the ERK-MAPK pathway\n\nas an important factor [13]. The maturation of DCs in response to\n\nLPS triggers ERK phosphorylation which could occur via at least\n\ntwo potential pathways – tpl2/Cot1 or Ras-Raf. To test which\n\npathway was important in the context of LPS induced reactiva-\n\ntion, latently infected monocytes were differentiated to immature\n\nDCs and then, prior to stimulation with LPS, incubated with a pan\n\nERK-MAPK inhibitor or specific inhibitors of the tpl2 and Ras-\n\nRaf pathways. A qRT-PCR analysis for IE gene expression\n\nconfirmed our previous data that ERK-MAPK inhibition blocked\n\ninduction of HCMV IE gene expression (Fig. 1A,B). However,\n\ninhibition with the upstream targets suggested that it was Ras-Raf,\n\nand not tpl2 signalling, which was important for triggering the\n\ninduction of IE RNA expression (Fig. 1A,B). Previously, we have\n\nobserved that a major component of HCMV reactivation upon\n\nDC stimulation with LPS is IL-6 and that activation of ERK-\n\nMAPK signalling was also important in this response. Again,\n\nconsistent with a major role for Ras-Raf it was only inhibition of\n\nthis effector molecule – and not tpl2 signalling – which had a\n\nmajor impact on HCMV IE RNA reactivation in response to IL-6\n\n(Fig. 1B). Crucially, this defect in RNA expression was also\n\nobserved at the protein level. Pre-incubation of immature DCs\n\nwith inhibitors prior to stimulation with LPS or IL-6 resulted in a\n\nmarked defect in the number of IE-expressing cells in ERK, Ras-\n\nRaf but not tpl2 inhibitor treated cells (Fig. 1C). Importantly, the\n\nobservation that LPS induced gene expression is dependent on\n\nRas signalling is consistent with LPS inducing reactivation via an\n\nindirect mechanism (IL-6; Ras-ERK signalling) rather than a\n\ndirect mechanism (tpl2-ERK signalling).\n\nCREB binding and phosphorylation to the MIEP is\nimportant for the induction of IE gene expression in\nprimary DCs\n\nStudies with the laboratory strain, Towne, using a quiescent\n\ninfection model in T2 cells have suggested that the CREB\n\nresponse elements in the MIEP could have an important role in\n\nreactivation in response to mitogenic stimuli [20] and thus we\n\nhypothesised that differential binding to the MIEP of CREB could\n\nbe a potential mechanism in primary DCs. To address this, a series\n\nof experiments were performed in reactivating CD14+ derived\nDCs. (Fig. 2). Firstly we examined CREB binding to the MIEP.\n\nInterestingly, the co-immunoprecipitation of the MIEP with\n\nCREB was observed in both CD14+ monocytes as well as\ndifferentiated DCs although increased levels of specific CREB\n\nbinding was detected as the cells became more differentiated when\n\ncompared to the isotype matched control (Fig. 2A). However,\n\ndespite the inhibitory effect (Fig. 1), pre-treatment with an ERK-\n\nMAPK had no impact on the binding of CREB to the MIEP\n\nAuthor Summary\n\nHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of immune-\ncompromised individuals is a significant cause of morbid-\nity. In a number of settings disease is caused by the\nreactivation of a pre-existing quiescent infection of the\nhost (latency) which, in the absence of a controlling\nimmune response, is a major source of disease. Work to\nunderstand the switch from a latent to active (reactivated)\ninfection has focussed on the regulation of the promoter\nthat controls the major viral gene products IE72 and IE86 –\nan important first step towards HCMV reactivation. In this\nstudy we have correlated the activation of cellular\nsignalling pathways with the downstream activation of\nthis promoter. Specifically, the activation of cellular kinase\nin an ERK-MAPK dependent manner which displays an\naffinity for a protein bound to a key viral promoter drives a\nchange in the chromatin architecture that allows viral gene\nexpression – releasing the virus from the latent state.\n\nMSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus Reactivation\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 2 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195\n\n\n\n(Fig. 2A) suggesting that CREB binding to the MIEP was not\n\ninhibited by ERK. However, a second analysis that assayed\n\nrelative levels of CREB and phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB)\n\nbound to the MIEP suggested that the levels of CREB\n\nphosphorylation most strongly correlated with induced IE gene\n\nexpression – and the effects of chemical inhibitors. In CD14+\nmonocytes, minimal binding of p-CREB to the MIEP was\n\nobserved. In contrast, in reactivating cells the predominant form\n\nwas p-CREB except when the cells were pre-incubated with an\n\nERK-MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 2B) at a concentration known to block\n\ninduction of HCMV IE gene expression (Fig. 1). Furthermore,\n\nWestern blot analysis suggested that these effects were not due to a\n\nglobal inhibition of CREB phosphorylation in the cell by the ERK\n\ninhibitor (Fig. 2C) consistent with multiple pathways capable of\n\npromoting phosphorylation of the total cellular pool of CREB.\n\nTaken together these data suggested that whilst inhibition of ERK-\n\nMAPK signalling had little impact on CREB binding to the MIEP\n\nit did result a marked reduction in the detection of p-CREB bound\n\nto the MIEP correlating with a defect in the levels of viral IE gene\n\nexpression.\n\nThe CRE elements in the MIEP of HCMV promote efficient\nIE gene expression upon exit from latency\n\nThe prediction therefore would be that deletion of the CRE\n\nwithin the MIEP would impact on HCMV reactivation from DCs.\n\nTo test this, 19 bp repeat deletions were generated in the\n\nendothelial-tropic strain, TB40/e as described previously for\n\nTowne [21]. Firstly, we confirmed that CREB did not bind to the\n\nMIEP of the DCRE virus (Fig. S1). Then these viruses were used\nto establish a latent infection in CD14+ monocytes as evidenced by\nlong term UL138 gene expression in an absence of UL123\n\nexpression. Unsurprisingly, there appeared to be no overt defect in\n\nthe ability of the mutant virus to establish a latent infection nor\n\nany differential ability to carry HCMV genomes from monocytes\n\nto immature DCs (Fig. 3A,B). However, when the cells were\n\ndifferentiated and then subsequently stimulated with LPS or IL-6 a\n\ndefect in the ability of the DCRE mutant virus re-initiate IE gene\nexpression was observed (Fig. 3C) – an effect more profound when\n\nIL-6 stimulation was used (Fig. 3C). These data directly correlated\n\nwith a ChIP analysis for the presence of histone 3 dimethylated at\n\nlysine 4 (H3-K4\n2me\n\n) at the MIEP which, indicative of active\n\ntranscription from a promoter, was more abundant on the wild type\n\nand revertant MIEPs compared with the DCRE (Fig. 3D). The defect\nin MIEP activity during reactivation appeared to be specific for this\n\nphase of infection as the initiation of lytic infections in both HFFs and\n\nFigure 1.

In contrast to our observations with the DCRE virus, a deletion\nof the NF-KB binding sites from the MIEP appeared to have little\nimpact on the induction of IE gene expression in primary DCs in\n\nresponse to IL-6 (Fig. S3).

Pre-incubation of\n\nimmature DCs with an MSK inhibitor significantly abrogated IL-\n\n6 induced IE gene expression in reactivating DCs (Fig. 4A).\n\nInterestingly, this effect was more profound than observed with an\n\nERK-MAPK inhibitor (possibly due to the incomplete inhibition\n\nof MSK phosphorylation seen with the ERK-MAPK inhibitor\n\n(Fig. 4B)). Furthermore, the effect was specific for the MSK family\n\nas no effect was observed with an RSK inhibitor (Fig. 4A).\n\nFurthermore, the effects appeared to be specific to latency.\n\nPrimary infection of DCs in the presence or absence of MSK or\n\nRSK inhibitors had little impact on IE gene expression when\n\nmeasured by IE-RT-PCR (Fig. 4C) or by indirect immuno-\n\nfluorescent staining for IE protein expression (Fig. 4D).\n\nFigure 3.

As such, we remained\n\nintrigued by the observation that MSK inhibitors had such a\n\ndramatic impact on HCMV IE gene expression in DCs (Fig. 4)\n\nand thus we reasoned it was an essential integration point for\n\ndefining the ERK triggered response. Indeed, unlike ERK-\n\nMAPK, the inhibition of MSK activity profoundly blocks IL-6\n\ninduced CREB phosphorylation in DCs (Fig. 5A) whilst,\n\nunsurprisingly, having little impact on the phosphorylation of\n\nERK and MSK themselves (Fig. 5A). Although we cannot rule out\n\nan effect of H-89 on Protein Kinase A activity – itself a protein that\n\ncan phosphorylate CREB – the rapid induction of MSK\n\nphosphorylation by IL-6 which signals in a PKA independent\n\nmanner [42,43].\n\nConsequently, we hypothesised that other targets of MSK may\n\nalso be important for inducing IE gene expression from latency.\n\nAn attractive candidate was histone H3. Predominantly methyl-\n\nated when bound to the MIEP in latency, reactivation in DCs is\n\nconcomitant with global acetylation of histones bound to the\n\nMIEP [15]. Clearly signalling pathways dictate this phenotypic\n\nswitch and we focussed on the ability of MSK to promote histone\n\nH3 phosphorylation at serine residue 10 [44] – an event which has\n\nbeen hypothesised to provide a critical intermediary step between\n\nhistone de-methylation and subsequent histone acetylation on\n\nmultiple ‘early response’ cellular promoters [45,46].\n\nA time of addition study, analysing the ability of neutralising IL-\n\n6 antibodies to block HCMV reactivation following stimulation\n\nwith LPS, revealed that the effects of IL-6 signalling must manifest\n\nat immediate-early times post infection (Fig. S4). Consequently, we\n\nperformed an initial time-course analysis revealed that histone\n\nphosphorylation at serine-10 occurred rapidly with phosphoryla-\n\ntion detectable within 1 hour post stimulation (Fig. S5). Consistent\n\nwith a role for ERK-MAPK activation in reactivation we also\n\nobserved that histone phosphorylation and acetylation was\n\nobserved in IE-expressing DCs and that this phenotype was\n\ninhibited by ERK-MAPK or Raf inhibitors (Fig. S6). Further-\n\nmore, the phosphorylation of histone H3 in response to IL-6 did\n\nnot require de novo viral (or cellular) gene expression (Fig. S7)\n\nsuggesting it occurred prior to HCMV lytic gene expression and\n\nthus reactivation. More pertinently, the pre-incubation of imma-\n\nture DCs with MSK inhibitors resulted in a significant decrease in\n\nthe detection of the phosphorylated forms of both histone H3 and\n\nCREB bound to the MIEP (Fig. 5B). In contrast, use of an RSK\n\ninhibitor appeared to have no impact (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, the\n\nrelatively higher levels of H3-K9 methylation at the MIEP in\n\nMSK inhibitor treated cells supports the hypothesis that MSK\n\nactivity is required for a switch in the chromatin phenotype from a\n\nrepressed to active state at the MIEP.\n\nFinally, we examined reactivating cells for the presence of MSK\n\nat the MIEP. A time-course analysis showed that MSK immune-\n\nprecipitated with the MIEP but, unlike observed with histone H3\n\nphosphorylation (Fig. S5), the occupancy appeared far more\n\ntransient (Fig. 5C) which is likely reflected in the different\n\nfunctional roles these proteins play. Both histones and CREB\n\nare likely associated with the MIEP for longer duration whereas\n\nMSK recruitment and activity is likely a more acute response to\n\nsignalling. Once the targets are phosphorylated MSK may be\n\nreleased from the complex.\n\nThe phosphorylation of CREB bound to the MIEP\npromotes histone H3 phosphorylation\n\nOur data suggested that for the successful initiation of HCMV\n\nreactivation to occur phosphorylation of both CREB and histone\n\nH3 were necessary. Thus, we reasoned that ChIP analyses of\n\nreactivating cells generated from either wild type or DCRE\ninfected monocytes could still be bound by phosphorylated\n\nhistones and the defect in the DCRE virus possibly due to a lack\nof CREB binding. However, we were intrigued to observe that an\n\novert lack of phosphorylated histone H3 bound to the MIEP of the\n\nDCRE infected cells was observed upon stimulation with IL-6\n(Fig. 6A). This suggested that histone H3 phosphorylation at the\n\nMIEP was dependent on CREB binding. Consequently, we\n\nperformed a ChIP re-ChIP analysis on reactivating cells to\n\ndetermine whether the binding of phosphorylated CREB was\n\nindeed co-incident with histone H3 phosphorylation. To do this\n\nwe performed a ChIP analysis on IL-6 treated DCs 2 hours post\n\nstimulation or unstimulated DCs with anti-H3-S10\np\n, anti-H3-\n\nK9\n3Me\n\nand the appropriate isotype matched control. As expected,\n\nthe analysis of the first round IP showed that the MIEPs in the\n\nstimulated DCs were predominantly associated with phosphory-\n\nlated and not methylated histones whereas as in the unstimulated\n\nDCs the MIEP was predominantly associated with methylated\n\nhistones (Fig. 6B) consistent with the IE gene expression profile in\n\nthese different cell populations. We then focussed on the\n\nreactivating samples to determine whether CREB was concom-\n\nitantly bound with H3-S10\nP\n. Consistent with our hypothesis, we\n\ncould detect the IP of the MIEP following incubation with the p-\n\nCREB antibody. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the GAPDH\n\npromoter (the regulation of which is CREB-independent [47])\n\nshowed that this promoter was not enriched in the sample (Fig. 6C)\n\nnor did we detect any MIEP sequences in a p-CREB IP from the\n\nH3-K9\n3Me\n\nprimary IP sample. Taken together, these data suggest\n\nthat phosphorylated CREB and histone H3-S10\nP\n\nwere concom-\n\nitantly bound to the MIEP in IE expressing DC populations.\n\nFinally, the data and the model predicted that MSK recruit-\n\nment to the MIEP would also be on the same promoters\n\nharbouring phosphorylated histones. Thus we performed the\n\nsame ChIP re-ChIP procedure to assess MSK binding. Our\n\nanalysis, performed at 2 hpi (when both MSK and H3-S10-P can\n\nbe detected on the MIEP (Figs. 5 and S5)) showed that we could\n\nobserve enrichment for MSK binding to the MIEP also bound by\n\nH3-S10-P (Fig. 6D). Thus, MSK, CREB and H3-S10 phosphor-\n\nylation could be detected on the same MIEPs in reactivating cells.\n\nFigure 5.

We reasoned that the\n\ninefficient transfection of primary DCs with siRNAs would not\n\nallow us to see effects on HCMV when between 3–5% of cells are\n\nactively supporting HCMV latency based on IE positivity upon\n\nIL-6 stimulation. Therefore, we infected differentiating monocytes\n\n4 days post differentiation with adenoviruses expressing GFP or a\n\ndominant negative form of ERK kinase MEK1 (Figure 7).\n\nImportantly, using adenoviruses we could establish between 60–\n\n70% infection based on the expression of GFP when the cells were\n\nanalysed 24 hours post infection. Consistent with the expression of\n\na dominant negative form MEK1, ERK and downstream\n\nphosphorylation of MSK was substantially reduced (Fig. 7A) –\n\ngiving us further confidence that CREB phosphorylation in\n\nresponse to IL-6 was MSK and not PKA dependent (Fig. 5).\n\nImportantly, no effect on STAT-3 phosphorylation was observed\n\nin response to IL-6 confirming that there was not a global\n\ninhibition of IL-6 signalling (Fig. 7A). Subsequently, we analysed\n\nDCs 48 hours post infection with the adenoviruses for HCMV\n\ngene expression. Interestingly, expression of MEK1 had a\n\nprofound impact on the level of IE gene expression in DCs\n\n(Fig. 7B). Pertinently, the expression of inactive MEK1 also\n\nimpacted on CREB and histone H3 phosphorylation at the MIEP\n\n(Fig. 7C). The normal phosphorylation of CREB and histone H3,\n\nand concomitant loss of histone methylation, was severely\n\nabrogated (Fig. 7C).\n\nActivation of histone H3 phosphorylation induces IE\ngene expression in dendritic cells independent of CREB\n\nThe data thus far argue that MSK-mediated phosphorylation of\n\nCREB and histone H3 correlated with an induction of IE gene\n\nexpression. We hypothesized that one explanation for the major\n\nrole of CREB during reactivation is to enhance histone H3\n\nphosphorylation which would promote gene expression via the\n\nadoption of an open chromatin conformation. We reasoned,\n\ntherefore, that a surrogate signal for histone phosphorylation may\n\nbe sufficient to trigger HCMV IE gene expression in the DCRE\nvirus. Histone phosphorylation is dynamically regulated and,\n\nconsequently, the inhibition of the histone dephosphorylase\n\nprotein phosphatase 2A promotes hyper-phosphorylation of\n\nhistones at a number of cellular promoters. Interestingly,\n\nincubation of immature DCs derived from latently infected\n\nmonocytes with the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid\n\nwas sufficient to drive induction of IE gene expression of both wild\n\ntype and, albeit less efficiently, the DCRE virus (Fig. 8A). Although\nwe cannot rule out off-target effects associated with the use of\n\nokadaic acid, the well established effects of okadaic acid on histone\n\nphosphorylation was consistent with elevated levels of phosphor-\n\nylated histones bound to the MIEP were observed by ChIP assay\n\ncorrelating with the detection of HCMV gene expression (Fig. 8B)\n\nsuggesting that chemical insults, similar to those proposed with the\n\nuse of histone deacetylase inhibitors, triggered IE gene expression\n\nfrom quiescent virus. However, we note that unlike observed with\n\nHDAC inhibitors, okadaic acid did not trigger IE gene expression\n\nin monocytes under the same experimental conditions suggesting\n\nthat cellular differentiation was also important.\n\nDiscussion\n\nUnderstanding the cellular and molecular basis of HCMV\n\nreactivation remains an enigmatic problem. Numerous studies of\n\nboth HCMV and murine CMV have shown that inflammation is a\n\nkey component of CMV reactivation [8,13,17,18,22,24,25] by\n\ninducing or augmenting the expression of the IE genes from a\n\npreviously quiescent state. An understanding of the role of\n\ninflammation and, specifically, the signalling components activat-\n\ned by it, will be pivotal for delineation of the molecular basis of\n\nHCMV reactivation which, subsequently, impacts on the design of\n\nfuture therapeutic targets to control HCMV disease. Ultimately, a\n\nblockade – or at least a diminishment of the induction of IE gene\n\nexpression will prevent efficient HCMV reactivation.\n\nPivotal early events in the reactivation of HCMV include\n\ncellular differentiation and concomitant activation of transcription\n\nof the major IE genes [1]. Indeed, we argue that cellular\n\ndifferentiation is a key event for the effects we observe. In our\n\nmodel for the induction of HCMV IE gene expression from\n\nlatency we hypothesise that MSK activity via CREB is important\n\nfor the first stages of HCMV reactivation in IL-6 stimulated\n\nimmature DCs. Importantly, we also observe that IL-6 does not\n\ndirectly trigger HCMV reactivation from monocytes [13] and thus\n\nthe MIEP in monocytes is intrinsically unresponsive to IL-6 (Fig. 9).\n\nThis suggests that cellular differentiation, or even long term\n\nculture of monocytes [17], either eliminates an intrinsic block to\n\nIL-6 mediated activation of the MIEP or, alternatively, up-\n\nregulates a co-factor that helps drive the induction of HCMV gene\n\nexpression from latency.\n\nRobust IE gene expression can be triggered by IL-6 or LPS in\n\nthis system and, previously, a number of different cytokines have\n\nbeen implicated in the initiation of HCMV and MCMV IE\n\nreactivation [8,17,18,24,25]. These include interferon gamma and\n\nTNF, interleukin-1b, or GM-CSF and IL-4 and thus cytokines\nimportant for myeloid cell differentiation and inflammation also\n\npromote and propagate CMV reactivation. Indeed, it is important\n\nto re-iterate that we argue that IL-6 induces robust reactivation of\n\nHCMV from immature DCs in our hands rather than acting as a\n\n‘latency breaker’ – in that it cannot reverse latency in primitive\n\nprogenitor cells. Consistent with this, low level reactivation is\n\nFigure 6. Phosphorylation of histone H3 is dependent on CREB binding to the MIEP.

As such, it has been postulated\n\nthat these regions could be important in a cell type or context\n\nspecific manner [20,50]. In this study, we asked whether\n\npreviously identified CRE elements were important for HCMV\n\nreactivation in primary cells. Based on these observations the\n\nreactivation of the DCRE virus was less efficient than wild type.\nThis defect in reactivation correlated with a failure to promote the\n\nmodification of histones from a latent (H3-K9\n3me\n\n) to an active\n\n(H3-K4\n2me\n\n) upon reactivation. Key to this switch was the activity\n\nof MSKs which promote extensive histone H3 phosphorylation at\n\nthe MIEP in the early stages of reactivation. The idea of CREB/\n\nMSK-mediated phosphorylation of the histones bound to the\n\nMIEP as an important trigger of reactivation is highly attractive.\n\nFirstly, previous work has shown histone phosphorylation at serine\n\n10 can synergise with histone acetylation [51] as well as de-\n\nstabilising the binding of chromo-domain proteins such as\n\nheterochromatin protein 1 [52,53] – a protein that is recruited\n\nto methylated histones bound to promoters including the viral\n\nMIEP during latency [15]. Furthermore, histone phosphorylation\n\nis associated with a distinct set of promoters (the so-called ‘rapid\n\nresponse genes’) argued to promote hyper-acetylation of histones\n\nat these loci in a MAPK and MSK dependent manner [53].\n\nClearly, these events would positively influence HCMV reactiva-\n\ntion if the MIEP is subject to the same mechanisms of regulation.\n\nIndeed, in vitro biochemical studies on the c-fos promoter have\n\nshown that the chromatin bound to the c-fos promoter is highly\n\nresistant to MSK mediated phosphorylation [54]. However, the\n\nbinding of CREB (itself a target for MSK kinase activity) acts to\n\npromote histone phosphorylation and, as such, the parallels with\n\nour cell based analyses of HCMV latency and reactivation are\n\nstriking. Furthermore, it is intriguing that this response at the c-fos\n\npromoter was enhanced by the presence of HMG (high mobility\n\ngroup) proteins [54] – a family of chromatin bound proteins\n\nimplicated in the regulation of RTA mediated regulation of\n\ngamma herpes virus gene expression [55,56] – including\n\nreactivation from latency. As such, it is tempting to speculate that\n\nMSK could play a role in the reactivation of multiple herpes viruses.\n\nInitially it was slightly surprising that MSK but not RSK activity\n\ncontributed to the reactivation. RSK activity is predominantly\n\nassociated with ERK-MAPK signalling whereas MSKs are\n\nactivated via both ERK and p38 mediated mechanisms yet it\n\nappears ERK activation is important for HCMV reactivation [13].\n\nHowever, the role of ERK-MAPK signalling via MSKs in\n\nresponse to pro-inflammatory cytokine and growth factor stimu-\n\nlation [57] likely explains why this pathway predominates in the\n\nreactivation phenotype compared to other MAPK pathways in\n\nthis setting. Furthermore, these data support the hypothesis that\n\nthe MSK pathway provides important kinase activity responsible\n\nfor histone phosphorylation in a CREB dependent manner at\n\nspecific promoters. The detection of MSK binding to the MIEP\n\nprior to reactivation is supportive of this.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that IE gene expression from\n\nlatency in DCs is acutely sensitive to MSK chemical inhibition and\n\nthat reactivation of HCMV involves the phosphorylation of\n\nhistones bound to the latent MIEP. MSK mediated phosphory-\n\nlation of these histones is highly dependent on concomitant CREB\n\nbinding to the MIEP. Indeed, it is an important consideration that\n\nthese studies relied extensively on the use of chemical inhibitors\n\nwhich can have multiple effects on cellular signalling pathways\n\nover and above their reported specificities and thus will require\n\nfurther investigation. However, an interaction between CREB and\n\nMSK at the MIEP provides a mechanism for the signal integration\n\nrequired to promote HCMV reactivation from DCs in an ERK-\n\nMAPK dependent manner. Furthermore, using the regulation of\n\nthe MIEP during HCMV latency and reactivation as a model of\n\ndifferential gene expression we provide further in vivo evidence for\n\na functional interaction between MSK and CREB at promoters\n\nwhich, in this case, is important for controlling the gene expression\n\nof a clinically important pathogen. Clearly, because the effects of\n\nMSKs on gene expression are restricted to specific promoters\n\nfurther de-lineation of the pathways responsible for activation of\n\nthe MIEP provides the potential for new therapeutic interventions.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nEthics statement\nAll research describing studies on primary human material with\n\nHCMV were assessed and approved by the Cambridge Local\n\nResearch Ethics committee. Similarly, the collection of venous\n\nblood samples from anonymous donors was performed in accor-\n\nFigure 9. Model for the induction of IE gene expression in DCs. The expression of IE gene expression is restricted in CD14+ monocytes and is\ninherently unresponsive to inflammatory IL-6 signalling. However, cellular differentiation to a permissive phenotype renders latently infected cells\nresponsive to stimuli that support IE gene expression and, ultimately, reactivation.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1004195.g009\n\nMSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus Reactivation\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 13 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195\n\n\n\ndance with established guidelines for the handling and processing of\n\nsaid tissue by the Cambridge Local Research Ethics committee.\n\nVirus, cell lines, culture and reagents\nThe clinical isolate TB40/e (a kind gift of Christian Sinzger,\n\nUniversity of Tuebeingen, Germany) was purified from infected\n\nhuman retinal pigment epithelial cells using sorbitol gradients as\n\npreviously described [58]. Viruses for these studies were\n\ncharacterised by their ability to infect primary dendritic cells to\n\nassay myelo-tropism – routinely, virus preparations infected 10–\n\n20% DCs when used at an MOI of 5 calculated on fibroblasts.\n\nTo generate HCMV mutants in the CREB response elements a\n\ngalk BAC recombineering method was used as described\n\npreviously [21]. Essentially, base substitutions in the 5 copies of\n\nCRE present in the MIEP was performed by site directed\n\nmutagenesis in the P4EDM plasmid and the enhancer fragment\nexcised using Eag1 and Bsrg1 restriction digest. For BAC\n\nmutagenesis, galk primers with 50 bp homology to HCMV MIE\n\nflanking +1 to 2580 were used (59- ATC TGA CGG TTC ACT\nAAA CGA GCT CTG CTT ATA TAG ACC TCC CAC CGT\n\nACC CTG TTG ACA ATT AAT CAT CGG CA and 59- CAG\n\nCGT GGA TGG CGT CTC CAG GCG ATC TGA CGG TTC\n\nACT AAA CGC CTG TTG ACA ATT AAT CAT CGG CAT\n\nAGT ATA TCG GCA TAG) were used to amplify galk with\n\nflanking HCMV sequences using galk BAC in SW102. SW105\n\ncells containing the TB40/e BAC were electroporated with the\n\ngalk fragment and selected for using galactose containing agar\n\nplates and MacConkey galactose plates for verification. Sequence\n\nverified positive clones were then subject to a second round of\n\nrecombination which introduced the Enhancer fragment isolated\n\ninitially. Recombinants which had deleted galk were selected for\n\non 2-deoxygalactose containing plates. Purified BACs were\n\nisolated, sequence verified and then transfected into permissive\n\nfibroblasts to reconstitute infectious virus.\n\nThe generation of the NF-KB mutant virus was performed using\nthe same BAC mutagenesis protocol to generate point mutations\n\nby site-directed mutagenesis at positions 294, 2157, 2262 and 2\n\n413 relative to +1 transcription start site in P4EDM as described\npreviously [59].\n\nPrimary CD14+ monocytes were isolated from the venous blood\nof anonymous donors who had given informed consent under the\n\nappropriate local rules. Typically, 50 mls of venous blood was\n\ndiluted in PBS either 1:1 and, following separation on a ficoll\n\ngradient (Lymphoprep, Nycomed, Melville, NY) peripheral blood\n\nmononuclear cells were then purified using either a CD14+ cell\ndirect isolation kit (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA). Labelled\n\nCD14+ positive cells were rescued using Magnet Activated Cell\nSorting (MACS) and cultured in X-vivo 15 (Cambrex, Walkers-\n\nville, MD) supplemented with 2 mM L-Glutamine and cytokines\n\nto promote DC differentiation where appropriate.\n\nExperimental infection of primary cells and\ndifferentiation\n\nThe establishment of an in vitro experimental latent infection of\n\nprimary CD14+ cells was performed by infecting CD14+\nmonocytes (56105 cells/well) were infected in 250 ul of X-vivo\n15 media plus HCMV (MOI = 5) for 3 hours then rescued in 1 ml\n\nfresh media. After 3 days, experimentally infected CD14+ cells\nwere differentiated to immature monocyte derived DCs (MoDCs)\n\nas described previously [13]. Briefly, CD14+ monocytes were\ncultured with Interleukin-4 (100 ng/ml) and GM-CSF (100 ng/\n\nml) to promote differentiation to an interstitial-like DC phenotype\n\n[60]. Following culture, immature DCs was matured using\n\nLipopolysaccharide (500 ng/ml; SIGMA, St. Louis, MO) or\n\nincubated with recombinant IL-6. All cytokines were from\n\nPeprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ) unless otherwise stated.\n\nInhibitors and antibodies\nTo test for inhibition of HCMV reactivation, inhibitors were\n\nadded prior to LPS or IL-6 stimulation. Inhibition of MEK/ERK\n\nwas achieved using U0126 (or inactive analogue U0124; both\n\n5 uM), tpl2 (tpl2 kinase Inhibitor II; 1 uM), Raf (Raf Kinase\n\nInhibitor IV; 500 nM), RSK (BI-D1870; 500 nM; Selleckchem,\n\nHouston, TX) and MSK (H-89; 10 uM; Sigma Aldrich, Poole,\n\nUK) inhibitors (all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA unless\n\notherwise stated). All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and\n\nadded 2 hours prior to addition of LPS directly to the culture\n\nmedia. Prior to use, all inhibitors were titrated to ensure determine\n\na dose that gave activity against its target without any over effect\n\non the viability of the cells (trypan blue exclusion). To promote\n\nhistone H3 phosphorylation, the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A\n\ninhibitor okadaic acid (5 uM, Sigma Aldrich, Poole, UK) was\n\nadded to cells 3 hours prior to the induction of reactivation.\n\nWhere appropriate inhibitors were shown to have no impact on\n\nlytic infection of DCs or HFFs and, over the time frame of\n\nanalyses, were shown not to be deleterious to cell viability.\n\nFor immuno-fluorescent detection of viral antigens, cells were\n\nfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then permeabilised with 0.1%\n\nTriton X/PBS. An anti-IE (Millipore, 1:1000 in PBS) and then\n\nwith an Alexafluor 594 nm conjugated Goat anti-mouse antibody\n\n(Millipore; 1:1000 in PBS). All antibody incubations were\n\nperformed for 1 hour at room temperature.\n\nProtein expression was detected by Western blotting of\n\ndenatured protein samples. To detect protein expression nitrocel-\n\nlulose filters were incubated at 4uC overnight with anti-CREB or\nanti-phosphor-CREB antibodies, (1:1000; Upstate Biotechnology,\n\nCharlottesville, VA), anti-p42/p44 or phosphor-anti-p42/p44\n\nantibodies, anti-MSK1 or anti-phosphor-MSK1 (serine 360) (all\n\n1:1000; Cell Signalling Technology, Danvers, MA) and anti-\n\nSTAT-3 or phosphor-STAT-3 (tyrosine 705) (1:250; Santa Cruz\n\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and then incubated with a HRP\n\nconjugated Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:4000; Santa\n\nCruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 hr at RT. As a loading\n\ncontrol, nitrocellulose filters were also incubated with a rabbit anti-\n\nGAPDH control (1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) followed by an\n\nHRP conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:4000; Santa Cruz\n\nBiotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) – both antibody incubations\n\nperformed at RT for 1 hr. Blots were processed using ECL plus\n\n(GE life sciences, Amersham, UK) and exposed to Kodak\n\nautoradiograph film (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK).\n\nNucleic acid isolation, reverse transcription and PCR\nRNA was isolated from 10\n\n6\ncells using RNAeasy spin columns\n\nas described by the manufacturer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).\n\nFollowing isolation, total RNA was incubated with DNAse I\n\n(Promega, Madison, WI) and then amplified by qRT-PCR. IE,\n\nUL138 and GAPDH gene expression was determined using a\n\nTaqman Triplex qRT-PCR system (SIGMA, Poole, UK) with the\n\nfollowing primers and probes: IE, 59- CAA GAA CTC AGC CTT\n\nCCC TAA GAC and 59- TGA GGC AAG TTC TCG AAT GC\n\nwith the probe CCA ATG GCT GCA GTC AGG CCA TG-\n\n(TAM); UL138, 59- CGC TGT TTC TCT GGT TAG and 59-\n\nCAG ACG ATA CCG TTT CTC with the probe CCG ACG\n\nACG AAG ACG ATG AAC-(Cy5); and GAPDH, 59- GGA AGC\n\nTTG TCA TCA ATG and 59- CCC CAC TTG ATT TTG GAG\n\nwith the probe ATC ACC ATC TTC CAG GAG CGA G-(JOE).\n\nReactions were set up using the Qiagen RT-PCR Quantitect kit\n\n(Qiagen, Sussex, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer’s\n\nMSK Activity Promotes Cytomegalovirus Reactivation\n\nPLOS Pathogens | www.plospathogens.org 14 June 2014 | Volume 10 | Issue 6 | e1004195\n\n\n\nprotocol and the samples amplified for ABI 7500 Fast Real Time\n\nPCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA; 95uC for 15 s\nand 60uC for 45 s).\n\nChromatin immunoprecipitation and analysis\nAll procedures were performed essentially as described previ-\n\nously. Briefly, DCs were fixed with 1% formaldehyde (10 mins)\n\nand then lysed and sonicated to fragment DNA. DNA associated\n\nwith histones was immunoprecipitated with control serum (Sigma,\n\nPoole, UK), anti-phosphor-histone H3-serine 10 antiserum (ChIP\n\ngrade, 1:200 dilution), anti-dimethyl lysine 4 histone H3 antiserum\n\n(ChIP grade, 1:200), anti-trimethyl lysine 9 H3 antiserum (ChIP\n\ngrade, 1:200 dilution), anti-phosphor or total CREB (both 1:250),\n\nor anti-MSK1 antibody (1:200 dilution; Cell signalling Technol-\n\nogy, Danvers, MA) - all antibodies Upstate Biotechnology,\n\nCharlottesville, VA unless stated. For detection of the MIEP of\n\nHCMV, DNA from disrupted nucleosomes was precipitated and\n\namplified by qPCR using 59-CCAAGTCTCCACCCCATTGAC\n\n(sense) and 59-GACATTTTGGAAAGTCCCGTTG (anti-sense)\n\nprimers and quantified using a Taqman probe FAM-59-TGG-\n\nGAGTTTGTTTTGGCACCAAA-39-TMR. Cellular DNA se-\n\nquences (GAPDH promoter) were amplified using 59-CGGC-\n\nTACTAGCGGTTTTACG (sense) and 59-AAGAAGATGC-\n\nGGCTGACTGT (anti-sense) and quantified using a Taqman\n\nprobe FAM-59-CACGTAGCTCAGGCCTCAAGACCT-39-\n\nTMR. Specific immuno-precipitation of sequences was expressed\n\nas enrichment from Input.\n\nAdenoviral delivery of MEK1 proteins and analysis in\nlatency\n\nTo deliver exogenous proteins to primary cells, adenoviral\n\nvectors expressing GFP or a dominant negative version of MEK1,\n\nwere used (Cell Biolabs, San Diego, CA). Four days into the 6 day\n\ndifferentiation protocol, differentiating cells were infected with\n\nadenoviral expression vectors (MOI 250) for 3 hours then the\n\nmedia replaced with fresh growth media. At Day 6 of differen-\n\ntiation (48 hours post adenovirus infection), cells were stimulated\n\nwith IL-6 and then harvested for Western Blot analysis 15 mins\n\npost culture, 2 hours post stimulation for ChIP analyses, or left\n\novernight and subject to either RT-qPCR for IE gene expression.\n\nSupporting Information\n\nFigure S1 CREB does not bind to the MIEP of the DCRE\nvirus.
