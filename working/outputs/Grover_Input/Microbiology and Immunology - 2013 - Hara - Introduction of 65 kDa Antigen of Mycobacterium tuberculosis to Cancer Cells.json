The response rate to BCG instil-\nlation therapy by carcinoma in situ (CIS), which was\nthought to be an indication for radical cystectomy, is\nabout 70% (25).  BCG instillation therapy is also effec-\ntive for patients with T1 grade 3 superficial bladder can-\ncer, which frequently develops into invasive bladder\ncancer (11).  However, the exact mechanism of BCG\ninstillation therapy remains obscure.  To improve and\nunderstand the process of BCG immunotherapy, the\nanti-tumor mechanism must be identified.\n\nWe investigated the usefulness of immune-gene ther-\napy using cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL2) (3, 5),\nIL12 (4, 17, 18, 27) and IL18 (8).  These studies showed\nthat tumor cells expressing cytokines significantly retard-\n\ned tumor growth in syngeneic mice.  Moreover, they\nalso worked as tumor vaccines in preventing a response\nto a subsequent challenge with parental cells.  Indeed\nintroducing cytokine genes is one type of immune gene\ntherapy.  Another is to have the host more efficiently rec-\nognize tumor cells as being immunogenic.  To improve\nthe BCG therapy, we introduced the gene encoding the\nmajor antigen, 65 kDa heat shock protein (hsp), of\nMycobacterium tuberculosis into a mouse melanoma\ncancer cell line.  We then analyzed the anti-tumor effect\nof BCG against this cell line.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell line and animals.

Accepted January 21, 2004\n\nAbstract: Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) immunotherapy has anti-tumorigenic effects against bladder can-\ncer. To improve the efficacy of BCG therapy, we introduced the gene encoding the 65 kDa heat shock pro-\ntein (hsp) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis into a mouse malignant melanoma cell line (B16). An expression\nvector harboring the 65 kDa antigen gene was transfected into B16 using Lipofectamine, then expression\nof the antigen was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Several cell lines expressing 65 kDa anti-\ngen were established (B16/65kDa). We also established a control cell line transfected with the vector\nalone (B16/con). All cell lines (B16, B16/con, B16/65kDa) were injected intraperitoneally into syngeneic mice\nwith or without BCG prior immunization and the development of tumor ascites was examined. To analyze\nthe mechanism of the anti-tumor effect, CD4 T cells or CD8 T cells were depleted in vivo by administering\nthe corresponding monoclonal antibody. B16/65kDa expressed the 65 kDa hsp of M. tuberculosis. The tumor\ngrowth of B16/65kDa was slightly retarded in naive mice, but significantly inhibited by BCG. The anti-tumor\neffect was totally abrogated in mice deficient in CD4 T cells, suggesting that CD4 T cells are involved in this\nprocess. The 65 kDa hsp of M. tuberculosis was expressed after gene transduction in a malignant melanoma\ncell line and significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect of BCG immunotherapy. CD4 T cells play an impor-\ntant role in this anti-tumor effect.\n\nKey words: BCG, Gene therapy, 65 kDa antigen\n\n289\n\nMicrobiol.

Female 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were pur-\nchased from Clea Japan.\n\nGene manipulation.  A gift from Dr. T.M. Shinnick\n(21), the gene encoding the 65 kDa protein of Mycobac-\nterium tuberculosis, was inserted into a mammalian\nexpression vector plasmid (pCEXV3) (16).\n\nGene transfection.  The expression vector harboring\nthe 65 kDa gene (pCEXV3/65kDa) was co-transfected\nwith pSV2neo (selection gene) into B16 cells using\nLipofectamine.  Briefly, 1.8�105 B16 cells were seeded\ninto 60 mm dishes 16 hr before transfection.  Purified\npCEXV3/65kDa (9 µg) or pCEXV3 (9 µg; mock trans-\nfection) were transfected with 48 mg of Lipofectamine\nreagent and 3 ml of serum-free OPTI-MEM (Life Tech-\nnologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., U.S.A.).  The plas-\nmids were co-transfected with 1 µg of pSV2neo as a\nselection marker (24).  Colonies were selected using 1\nmg/ml Geneticin (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A.) 3 days\nafter transfection, picked up by cloning cylinders and\nexpanded into cell lines.\n\nCell proliferation assay.  To compare the in vitro\nproliferation of B16 sublines, 5�103 cells of each cell\nline were seeded in each well of 12-well plates, and the\nnumber of cells in each cell line was counted daily by\ntriplicate.\n\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR).  Total RNA was\nisolated from transfected cell lines using acid-guani-\ndinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform.  Complemen-\ntary DNA was synthesized from 2 µg of RNA by exten-\nsion with oligo dT in 20 µl of reverse transcriptase reac-\ntion buffer (pH 8.3) containing 0.01 M DTT, 0.5 mM\ndeoxynucleotide phosphate and 200 U of Superscript\nII (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, N.Y., U.S.A.).  The mix-\nture was incubated at 42 C for 50 min, then at 70 C for\n15 min.\n\nThe cDNA for 65 kDa protein of Mycobacterium\ntuberculosis was detected by PCR amplification in sep-\narate reactions, using oligonucleotide primers.  PCR\nproceeded using a Perkin Elmer Cetus Gene Amp PCR\nsystem 9600 (Norwalk, Conn., U.S.A.) in 25 µl of reac-\ntion mixture for 30 cycles (1 min at 95 C, 1 min at 62 C\nand 2 min at 72 C) using rTth DNA polymerase (Perkin\nElmer).  Non-specific priming and oligomerization was\nminimized using hot-start PCR.  Cycling was concluded\nwith a final extension of 7 min at 72 C.  A sample of each\nreaction (10 µl) was analyzed in a 2% agarose gel and\nvisualized by ethidium-bromide fluorescence staining.\nThe primers were: \n\n5'-ACGATCACCAACGATGGTGTG-3'\n5'-AGCTGACCAGCAGGATGTAGG-3' (corre-\n\nsponding size: 529 bp)\n\nWestern blotting.  Expression of the 65 kDa protein in\ntransfected cells was confirmed by Western blotting.\nCells were lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl,\n1% NP-40, 50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM phenylmethylsul-\nfonyl fluoride).  After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4\nC, lysates were resolved by electrophoresis on 4–20%\nSDS-polyacrylamide gels, and then transferred to nitro-\ncellulose membranes at a constant current of 35 mA\nfor 4 hr.  Non-specific binding on the membranes was\nblocked in PBS containing 10% powdered nonfat milk at\n4 C overnight.  The membranes were then incubated\nfor 1 hr with an anti-65 kDa protein monoclonal antibody\n(7) in PBS containing 1.0% BSA, and washed twice\nfor 5 min each with PBS containing 0.01% Tween 20.\nThe membranes were then incubated for 1 hr with horse-\nradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody\n(DAKO, A/S, Denmark).  After washing as described\nabove, specific proteins were detected using diaminoben-\nzidine (Wako Chemical, Tokyo).\n\nAnimal model of BCG therapy.  To establish a BCG\nimmunotherapy model, C57BL/6 mice were administered\nwith 1 mg of live BCG intraperitoneally once each week\nfor 2 weeks.  The mice were challenged with tumor\ncells (5�106 cells) administered intraperitoneally one\nweek after the last BCG administration.  The presence of\ncancer ascites was examined 3 times each week and the\npercentage of ascites in free mice was calculated.\n\nImmunodeficient mice.  T cells were depleted in vivo\nby the intraperitoneal administration of rat MAb GK1.5\n(anti-CD4; IgG2b) and MAb 2.43 (anti-CD8; IgG2b) (both\nhybridomas were acquired from the ATCC).  These\nMAbs were used as ascites fluids (titer, �1:10,000\naccording to mouse thymocyte staining by flow cytom-\netry).  The MAb preparations (0.2 ml) were injected\ni.p. on day �3 and every 7 days thereafter.  Throughout\nour experiments, respective T cell sub-populations were\ndepleted by �97% according to indirect immunofluo-\nrescence staining and cytofluorometric analysis (EPICS\nElite, Coulter, Fla., U.S.A.) of splenocytes using the\nMAbs GK1.5 (CD4) or 2.43 (CD8), respectively (Fig. 1).\n\nResults\n\nExpression of 65 kDa Antigen in Transfected Cells\nThe presence of 65 kDa antigen mRNA was screened\n\nin transfected clones by RT-PCR.  Parental and mock-\ntransfected B16 (B16/con) did not express 65 kDa anti-\ngen mRNA.  Clones B16/65kDa-1 and B16/65kDa-2\nexpressing 65 kDa antigen mRNA were selected for\nuse in further experiments (Fig. 2).  Expression of 65 kDa\nantigen protein was confirmed by Western blotting in\nB16/65kDa-1, B16/65kDa-2 (Fig. 3).  We then com-\npared the proliferation rates in vitro among the B16\n\n290 I. HARA ET AL\n\n\n\nsublines.  There was no significant difference in cell\nproliferation in vitro among these cell lines (data not\nshown).\n\nTumorigenicity of 65 kDa Antigen Expressing B16 in\nSyngeneic Mice\n\nTo examine the effect of 65 kDa antigen on tumor\ngrowth in vivo, 5�106 cells of B16, B16/con, B16/65kDa-\n1 and B16/65kDa-2 were injected intraperitoneally to\nsyngeneic C57/Bl mice.  B16 and B16/con developed a\n\nsimilar degree of ascites.  On the other hand, B16/65kDa-\n1 and B16/65kDa-2 slightly retarded ascites formation\n(Fig. 4) and in the following experiments, the results were\nthe same.  Thus, representative data of B16/65kDa-1,\ndescribed as B16/65kDa are shown.\n\nBCG Immunotherapy Model (Fig. 4)\nInjecting the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic mice with\n\n5�106 B16 cells caused tumor ascites to form within 2\nweeks.  However, two prior intraperitoneal injections\n\n291IMMUNO-GENE THERAPY USING MYCOBACTERIAL MAJOR ANTIGEN\n\nFig. 1.

RT-PCR of parental and B16 cell lines transfected with 65 kDa gene expressing 65 kDa mRNA. The corresponding band was\nobserved in transfected cell line (B16/65kDa-1, B16/65kDa-2), but not in parental and mock-transfected lines (B16, B16/con).\n\n\n\nof 1 mg of BCG significantly inhibited ascites formation.\nB16/con elicited a similar anti-tumor effect.  To confirm\nthat BCG specifically caused the anti-tumor effect, we\ninjected the same amount of E. coli using the same\nschedule.  However, tumor growth in vivo was not affect-\ned (data not shown).  None of the mice injected with\neither BCG or E. coli alone developed ascites.\n\nWe examined how the expression of 65 kDa antigen in\ntumor cells affects BCG immunotherapy.  The anti-\ntumor effect of BCG immunotherapy was remarkably\n\nenhanced by 65 kDa antigen expression.  Although BCG\nimmunotherapy inhibited tumor formation by parental\nB16 cells, all of the mice eventually developed ascites.\nOn the contrary, 40% of mice injected with B16/65kDa\ncompletely rejected the tumor.\n\nMechanism of BCG Immunotherapy\nTo elucidate the mechanism of BCG immunotherapy,\n\nimmuno-deficient mice were established using a mono-\nclonal antibody against the corresponding CD molecule\n\n292 I.

Growth of tumor ascites in mice intraperitoneally injected with 5�106 B16, B16/con and B16/65kDa cells.\nFormation of tumor ascites was examined 3 times each week and the percentage of ascites free mice was calculated.

Mice pre-immunized with 1 mg of live BCG twice are described as\nB16�BCG, B16/con�BCG and B16/65kDa � BCG.\n\n\n\n(Fig. 1).  The anti-tumor effect of BCG immunotherapy\nagainst B16/65kDa was abolished in mice depleted of\nCD4, but not of CD8 (Fig. 5).  These results suggest that\nCD4 T cells, but not CD8 T cells, play an important role\nin the killing mechanism associated with BCG\nimmunotherapy.\n\nDiscussion\n\nBCG is an important clinical tool because of its pro-\nfound immunostimulatory properties, as it can prevent\ntuberculosis and eradicate high-risk superficial bladder\ncancer.  The presence of carcinoma in situ (CIS) in the\nurinary bladder had required total cystectomy, since CIS\nfrequently progresses to invasive bladder cancer.  BCG\ninstillation therapy is believed to be the most successful\nimmunotherapy against cancer because 70% of CIS\npatients can be cured without cystectomy (25).  BCG\ninstillation therapy also works well against T1b grade 3\nbladder cancer, which is thought to have high malignant\npotential (11).  However, some patients are refractory to\nBCG therapy and still require total cystectomy (9).  To\nimprove the efficiency of BCG against bladder cancer, the\nexact mechanism of its anti-tumor effect must be clari-\n\nfied.  Here, we focused on the 65 kDa heat shock protein\nof mycobacteria, which can elicit powerful humoral and\ncellular immune responses.  We reported that BCG\ninstillation therapy raises a serum antibody against the 65\nkDa protein (6), indicating that this protein plays an\nimportant role in BCG immunotherapy.\n\nA wide range of mycobacterial species express the 65\nkDa protein (2, 28).  This antigen contains epitopes that\nare species-specific and those that are common to various\nspecies of mycobacteria.  Identity has been demonstrat-\ned between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and BCG 65\nkDa protein (21).  The 65 kDa antigen has several fea-\ntures.  The immune response to the BCG 65 kDa protein\nis involved in adjuvant arthritis in rats (26).  Moreover, T\ncells from the synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid\narthritis can recognize the 65 kDa protein (1).  Thus, this\nprotein plays an important role in autoimmune disease.\nThe 65 kDa protein is one of the heat shock proteins\n(hsp) induced by various types of stress to protect cells\nfrom environmental damage (22).  Many hsp are also\nessential for cellular function under normal conditions\nand they can also function as molecular chaperones to\nfold and transport proteins.\n\nWe aimed to introduce the mycobacterial 65 kDa\n\n293IMMUNO-GENE THERAPY USING MYCOBACTERIAL MAJOR ANTIGEN\n\nFig. 5. Growth of tumor ascites in mice immunized with BCG (B16/65kDa�BCG) and then intraperitoneally injected with 5�106\n\nB16/65kDa cells. Formation of tumor ascites was examined 3 times each week and the percentage of ascites free mice was calculated.\nY axis: percentage of ascites free mice. X axis: days after injection of tumor cells. To elucidate the anti-tumor mechanism, the same exper-\niments were performed in mice depleted of CD4 (B16/65kDa�BCG CD4 (�)), or CD8 (B16/65kDa�BCG CD8 (�)). Control\ncurves show formation of tumor ascites in non-immunized mice intraperitoneally injected with 5�106 B16 cells.\n\n\n\nantigen to tumor cells to increase their immunogenicity.\nThe tumor growth of B16 (B16/65kDa) cells transfected\nwith the 65 kDa gene was slightly retarded compared\nwith parental B16 cells in naive mice.  Moreover, intro-\nduction of the 65 kDa gene remarkably enhanced the\nanti-tumor effect of BCG immunotherapy.  We believe\nthat this strategy represents a breakthrough for BCG\nimmune therapy for bladder cancer.  Lukacs et al. orig-\ninally reported the possibility of immune gene therapy\nusing mycobacterial 65 kDa hsp (14).  They introduced\nthe 65 kDa hsp of Mycobacterium leprae to murine\nmacrophage tumor cell lines (J774).  The transfected\ncell line (J774-hsp65) was totally abrogated when inject-\ned into syngeneic Balb/c mice.  This anti-tumor effect\nwas also evident in athymic nude mice, indicating that the\nanti-tumor property of J774-hsp65 does not require T\ncells.  Mice injected with J774-hsp65 resisted subse-\nquent challenge with parental J774.  On the contrary, both\nCD4 and CD8 T cells were essential for this acquired\nimmunity.  Lukacs also described in vivo gene therapy\nusing liposome-mediated transfection with the same\nantigen (15).  Kuromatsu et al.  introduced the α antigen\nof Mycobacterium kansasii into a mouse bladder cancer\ncell line (13).  The transfected cell lines were rejected in\nmice primed and unprimed with BCG.  That study\nproved the induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)\nepitope-specific CD8 CTLs.  The α antigen is a different\nprotein from the 65 kDa hsp.  However, both are highly\nimmunogenic mycobacterial antigens that can elicit a\npowerful anti-tumor effect when expressed by tumor\ncells.\n\nOur findings were somewhat different from those of\nLukacs.  The anti-tumor effect in our model was not as\npowerful as theirs, since the immunogenic properties\nof B16 and J774 are quite different.  B16 is a tumor cell\nline with low immunogenicity.  J774 is a macrophage\ntumor cell line that can present antigen, which might be\nassociated with its powerful anti-tumor effect.  Of inter-\nest is the effector cells in each model.  J774 does not\nrequire T cells to reject tumors whereas the main effec-\ntors in BCG therapy against B16/65kDa were CD4 T\ncells.  Shinomiya et al.  also showed Th1 type CD4� T\ncell clone, which was capable of recognizing purified\nprotein derivative from Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\nhad anti-metastatic activity against melanoma.  This\nclone could secrete IFNγ, TNF and interleukin-2 which\nstimulated NK cell activity (23).  Considering that CD4\nT cells are powerfully stimulated by mycobacterial infec-\ntion, humoral mediators such as interferon and TNF\nmay play an important role in the killing mechanism\nof BCG immunotherapy.\n\nIn this paper, we successfully showed that the intro-\nduction of 65 kDa hsp gene enhanced BCG immunother-\n\napy.  The next step is to establish the effective method to\nintroduce the gene into bladder cancer for clinical set-\ntings.  Several papers reported the gene introduction by\ninstillation therapy with adenovirus or liposome (10,\n12, 20).  Pagliaro et al. reported a phase I study of p53\ngene therapy for patients with locally advanced bladder\ncancer and showed evidence or tumor response (19).\nIn the future, we will try to establish instillation therapy\ncombined with BCG and 65 kDa gene to improve the\ncurrent BCG therapy.\n\nIn conclusion, expression of the 65 kDa mycobacter-\nial hsp specifically enhanced the anti-tumor effect of\nBCG therapy against a malignant melanoma cell line\nwith low immunogenicity.  In addition, CD4 T cells but\nnot CD8 T cells are involved in this mechanism.\n\nReferences\n\n1) Gaston, J.S., Life, P.F., Jenner, P.J., Colston, M.J., and\nBacon, P.A. 1990.
