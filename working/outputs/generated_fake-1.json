Yet, despite the convenience of having both refrigerators and birth control available in every home, most Japanese prefer to deal with the problem by buying liquid medicines to make themselves comfortable. But that could be the least efficient and efficient way to cope with the seasonal hormone changes during the winter.<p>These seasonal hormones are created naturally through menstruation and hibernation, as well as dilation of muscles and arteries during pregnancy. Thus, when a pregnant woman is asked to reduce her hormone supply to have a baby, one of the hormonal responses of the body is the release of the equivalent of adrenaline during a crisis. This reaction mainly affects the cardiovascular system, which can be diagnosed as generalized intensification.<p>Unfortunately, when humans feel overwhelmed or can not cope by following prescribed dietary instructions, they turn to energy drinks (like Monster Energy or Red Bull), energy bars (soy, a\u00e7a\u00ed, etc.), creams, or natural supplements for the body. The continuous stress also leads to the creation of more stress hormones (eg, cortisol, norepinephrine, etc.). Furthermore, many Japanese avoid taking a break during the winter to relax. To fuel the body, they also resort to eating extra food. Many people in Japan tend to eat the same type of food all year round \u2013 even on weekends. Here, there are not only calories, but proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.<p>Reducing the stress level is essentially to deal with the body\u2019s induced reactivity to nature\u2019s signals of being stressed during the cold season, so that it can recover. So, the real question is: is it very effective to replace the hormone released during seasonal variation with artificial diuretics and stimulants? Studies conducted in other countries suggest that there is no need to replace the natural hormone necessary for health protection, especially when the consumer is consuming local tea or milk (available at convenience stores for less than 50yen).<p>It is very beneficial to produce your own form of green tea using the calendula leaf extracts (genona) available in local convenience stores. Tea is one of the many types of antioxidant that prevent oxidation during decomposition, while preventing the damage to your body\u2019s immune system that is caused by several types of artificial inhibitors. Since the fiber and amino acids of traditional tea also protect the body\u2019s cells, they help to ward off infections like salmonella and listeria that are found in cold air. There are also health benefits from drinking more milk.<p>In addition, it is advisable to cultivate mushrooms to balance the body and fix the daily stress. According to a medical article from Okayama University and published in The Memoirs of Henrietta Lewis: Japanese-Born Physiotherapy of the Imperial Japanese Navy, daily ogangancy with mushrooms is so beneficial that it can even help to suppress cancer cells. Moreover, as the Japanese call it, amoebic dysentery is cured by having a cup of tea with the bark of the mackerel, which is released from the nuttaceous glands of the chestnut tree after infection of the skin, lining, and chest.<p>So, to put an end to the perpetual winter, one must apply proper nutrition to the body and the stress levels and choose the right products and methods, just as one would choose food to satisfy his/her hunger when famished.<p>taku | tuneyoshi | asako | zenta | ta | yamamoto | taku"}
