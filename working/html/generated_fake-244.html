<br/><br/>I would like to share our latest study involving long QT syndrome, epilepsy and antibodies. It is based on 19 patients who had two or more tests before being diagnosed.<p>The patients had abnormal EEGs. We recorded the data from EEG, GlcNAc, non-Doppler 3-5-6-7 and Cat 3. Each patient had a viral injection or steroids injections. After the viral injection, all the patients showed increase in blood Acetylcholine levels and GlcNAc levels. The new data suggest that side effects associated with the infection were quite high. This also suggests that the infections may cause the patients to have double electrical signaling from the heart to the brain, resulting in seizures. We have changed the injection strategy for our next study on many patients with a lower risk of complications.<p>For more on this study please check out our peer-reviewed article titled “Protection Against Epilepsy and Antibodies in Patients with Long QT Syndrome”, submitted in June 2007, from the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_244.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
