<br/><br/>The finding resulted from research in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis. Since it has been suspected that the immune system of a patient with pulmonary fibrosis spreads into the lungs of healthy lung tissue by secreting proteins called transcription factors, the researchers, including immunologist Takito Iguchi from Osaka City University, made in-depth investigation into the mechanism of immune invasion by analyzing the expression of specific transcription factors in Peacock Lungs.<p>Reporting in a report in Immunopathology, they found that an immune molecule called TIGF can be found throughout the lungs of Peacock Lungs, signaling the development of immune cell infiltration there. Mutations in TIGF have been found in a number of diseases including cardiovascular problems, cystic fibrosis, autoimmune disorders and various diseases of the ear and eye.<p>This announcement is another indication that the apparent mechanism of immune invasion in Peacock Lungs is similar to that of the human lung tissues. Thus the ability of the immune system to invade the Peacock Lungs of healthy lung tissue from which it has spread can be attributed to a similar mechanism in the human system as well.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_331.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
