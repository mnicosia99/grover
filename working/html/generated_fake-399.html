<br/><br/>Meng Hongxiang,<p>Founder/Chairman of the DPRK Human Rights Committee (2006), President of the Nam Theun Foundation for Human Rights (2010), MD<p>ISSAHTABA, Kim Jong-un’s uncle<p>as of December 2012, after his 86-year old mother Kim Jong-il’s burial (HH Kim)<p>Among the objectives of the UN Special Committee on North Korea, established in 1996, is to examine North Korea’s human rights situation. We propose by launching the Website of the Special Committee (<a href="https://www.un.org/search/site/centre?Articleid=2681180&amp;Dca=UN&amp;catid=218&amp;root=en">www.un.org/search/site/cent...</a>), and the publication of its findings, as follows:<p>1. To categorize North Korea into relief categories.<p>2. To name the countries that collaborate in North Korea’s devastating famines.<p>3. To name the countries contributing to the human rights crisis in North Korea.<p>4. To categorize the North Korea’s human rights problems by five major categories:<p>The security problem of regime change<p>Food security problem of the one child policy<p>All-encompassing punishment system<p>Supportive society for victims<p>The human rights crisis in North Korea is a deep and complex problem that requires many elements to be considered and is now a part of a comprehensive study. When reflecting on various possible solutions, we propose to develop four different systems –<p>1. The concept of the pro-fundamental rights<p>2. Models of rights-based development and enforcement<p>3. Emergency and long-term human rights policy<p>4. Need for and value of independent monitoring and monitoring bodies<p>The situation in North Korea is characterized by a complex series of social and political problems, inequality, discrimination, poverty, people’s suffering and exhaustion due to huge bureaucracies. Since all of these issues arise from large and complex historical and socio-economic systems, many transitional forms will be required for dealing with them. As is the case in a highly unstable society, the problem of regime change is even more critical than in the normal case of a transition. Therefore, as is the case with all transition changes, the authority and monopoly of political power needs to be explored and managed out of the people’s involvement.<p>Under the circumstances of separation of the two Koreas, Article 8 of the Korean people’s Constitution stipulates that Koreans live in independence, solidarity and peace as the nucleus of the state. Therefore, the greatest challenge is that unified the Korean state will maintain its sovereignty by utilizing unification as a well-known slogan.<p>In the near future, our group would like to establish in line with the status of nuclear missiles, a “Distinguished Citizen of the Korean People’s Republic” category in the ICJ’s Division for International Law.<p>Questions?
