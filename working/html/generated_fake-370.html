<br/><br/>Reference<p>Endosclerosis: Liver from Alcoholic Addiction: A Reference Journal Update<p>Endosclerosis: chronic degeneration of the liver represents one of the major causes of liver cancer worldwide. One in five people who have had alcohol-related diseases will develop fibrosis by the age of 60 and 85% will have cirrhosis by the age of 70.<p>Samples from about 1000 patients (all alcoholic) were used for the purposes of this review to gain a broad assessment of liver liver conditions from all causes in Japan. Reduction of alcohol intake reduced cirrhosis in about 70% of the subjects without reducing endosclerosis.<p>Most of the patients had liver cirrhosis and most of the patients developed endosclerosis by the age of 60 years. Alcoholic liver disease is the main cause of cirrhosis. About 30% of these cases progressed to hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. Regarding Hepatocytosis, about 3% of the liver diseases that develop through alcohol are associated with this complication.<p>The authors concluded that out of thousands of alcoholic liver patients, the alcohol played the major role in approximately 70% of the cases.<p>Takeshi Shimomura, Kiroki Uchida, Kawachi Uchida, Shuji Okada, Kentaro Kitabayashi, Fukuharu Hatake, Hiroshi Yamada, Makoto Takeuchi, James R.
