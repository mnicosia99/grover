<br/><br/>I remember reading that a few years ago a super-famous scientist claimed that bird flu “had a good chance of attacking the brain” if it reached humans. By using a forklift the new discovery about the flu may lead us to do a rethink: the giant bird flu may have actually made a skin test to attack the brain of humans?<p>“The purpose of this study is to unravel the mysteries of influenza infection and to explore new possibilities for treatment and vaccination strategies,” said José Pimentel, lead author of the report in today’s Journal of Medical Microbiology and Infection.<p>Researchers believe that many symptoms of flu – like high fever, arm aches, coughs, body aches, and head aches – and many infections that occur after infection – like West Nile and the E.coli virus – are actually caused by a chemical that naturally exist on the inside of our cells. In fact a vaccine for West Nile is made by blocking the expression of this chemical.<p>You’ve likely heard that the flu is one of the leading causes of medical problems (about 21 million people get sick from flu every year and it is responsible for about 500,000 deaths). And, like many disease viruses, it doesn’t just affect the areas outside of the body, it can attack the organs inside the body. Because of the body’s innate immune response, the flu can infect organs like the brain and lungs, and in many cases, the source of infection can be long-lasting.<p>Most of the studies on the flu are usually limited to looking at how the flu affects laboratory animals, but “it was widely hoped that the human body might be immune to influenza infection,” Pimentel said. And, “we, therefore, set out to demonstrate that this was indeed possible using our experimental strategies.”<p>The first stage was to ask whether any internal mechanisms in the body prevent influenza infection by themselves. The next step was to show whether “individual cellular secretion in the lung and liver, primarily the production of interferon, prevent the establishment of the influenza infection.<p>If this is the case, then it must be possible for the animal models to be used to screen the effects of producing influenza strains in the lab to assess if such a process could naturally prevent the infection in human. Our studies suggested that this would be possible, and when we exposed an unprecedented number of volunteers at several institutions to the Acinetobacter baumannii, a strain that is responsible for a great deal of infections in humans, the results showed just that,” Pimentel said.<p>“Our findings demonstrate that small molecules from a natural source – the interferon – can stop influenza infection in a petri dish and thus may be a useful therapy for humans,” he said.<p>This discovery could give the vaccination a whole new dimension, as with this flu-fighting compound, if it is actually possible to trigger this host immune response in human patients by gene expression on the surface of cells. Furthermore, “we may in future be able to detect influenza infection and treat it during an infection in a lab dish,” said Pimentel.<p>“Our findings demonstrate that cells can inhibit the influenza virus in the host in vivo,” said Huizhe Zeng, one of the scientists at the Paper Technology Center in Beijing, “It is definitely one of the first strategies, that can be applied when developing a new vaccine strategy.”<p>Source: College of Pharmacy, Florida State University<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_337.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
