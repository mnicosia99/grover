<br/><br/>Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) more than five years ago pushed ethanol into the food chain with the adoption of 42-gallon-per-litre gasoline standard. The new legislation sponsored by Henry Waxman and then-Sen. Jeff Bingaman as part of the energy bill mandates the use of ethanol in gasoline but has nothing to say about its abuse.<p>Ethanol causes a total of 121 items to become “food items” for animals, pigs, poultry, dairy cows, beef cattle, sheep, hogs, etc and average 35,000 tonnes in greenhouse gas emissions every year.<p>It turns out that the well-developed humans in the US are amongst the animal populations seriously affected by the use of corn as fuel additive.<p>Ethanol makes glucose concentrate with sodium urate crystal.<p>Sodium urate crystals are actually more poisonous and damaging than cholesterol or triglycerides. Dairy cows, pigs, poultry, sheep and dairy cattle produce calves with elevated URate levels.<p>Sodium urate crystals along with lactose have large potential for toxicity in humans due to high nitrogen, simple glucose and simple fructose levels.<p>If anything is to improve the sustainability of U.S. farm industry, 1) allow the practice of removing nitrogen from the manure to reduce demands on fertilizers, and 2) decrease the need for fertilizers by direct rotation of non-chemical feed systems.<p>There are three areas where the better world can start improving the sustainability of agriculture.<p>1. Remove nitrogen from the manure.<p>2. Reduce demand for fertilizers by direct rotation of non-chemical feed systems.<p>3. Reduce number of animals in livestock production.<p>Yes, the livestock industry is making progress but is still a large-scale global issue and evolving.<p>The only way to solve the problem is to allow the principles of sustainability in agriculture. Feed crops and fertilizers should be used, and remain their primary use while allowing less intensive livestock production.<p>The elderly include responsible public opinion on the importance of human health. They call for more research and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of foodborne illness rather than industrial agriculture. They call for reform and encourage public government action in managing food safety.<p>1 National Academy of Sciences, 2008<p>There have been many tragic and potentially lethal food poisoning attacks involving the consumption of animals feed. The United States Agricultural Research Service published the study entitled, “Omega-3 Intake: Per-capita and Wastewater Catchment System Population Study, 1977–2002” in 2006.<p>The United States Agricultural Research Service reported that this study<p>finds that higher consumption of fish oils had no significant effect on Human Epidermal Necrolysis: DE and Enterolateral Gliosis Mortality. These findings have implications for lead or pesticide contamination of surface water by fish or fish products.<p>e3 Center for Environmental Information, The Oceana Coalition said that two studies on animal feed is already underway. Each study has more than 1,100 participants from the Mississippi Delta area (MS) with an average of 92 subjects per study. The study is expected to be completed by mid-2012.<p>These studies are a 2nd phase of the Oceana-led Oceana-U.S. Meat Animal Health Collaborative established in 2008 and funded by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA). NIFA funded and is monitoring the new study on the potential for antibiotics contamination of food and water from livestock. This study aims to identify the extent to which cattle, swine, poultry, and fish are feeding on manure and the impact of certain feed supplements for these animals on antibiotic consumption.<p>The third phase of the Oceana-US MUHC is intended to show the effects of antibiotic exposures on humans as we enter a new era where new and powerful antibiotics are used to treat complicated infections. The Phase III Study, I, will be run by the NIOSH/NIH Clinical Guidance Center of Excellence (CGCE) to assess the effects of germs and microbes on the immune system and people who have an increased incidence of bacterial lung infections and poor wound healing. (This study is funded by the Oceana Coalition and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WHO and World Health Organization, who have established goals for combating antibiotic resistance.)<p>takuinyoshi@takuinyoshi.org<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_278.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
