<br/><br/>The release of several tweet and Facebook applications on Dec 21th came out in favour of Coca-Cola’s proposal to reformulate their now popular drink Coca-Cola Classic. Many fans have started to change their cheers for the brand for Coca-Cola to revamp the Drink now.<p>The Coca-Cola plan to introduce their “PH-Formulated Coca-Cola” (PBR) in Japan. In the meantime, Coca-Cola (WAN:SCOBY) has already launched a Facebook app. The app has been launched and hopes to attract more fans for the brand who are not yet attracted to Coca-Cola drinks.<p>In Tokyo, thousands of fans rush to local Coca-Cola stores to buy the new version of Coca-Cola Classic. The stores expect the new consumers to buy bottles of PBRs. In the process, it is become very popular to yell “Soju!” (Egg Yolk) when buying Coca-Cola.<p>Tokyo mega-selling beer brand Tokyo Ginza (SCOBY) is already feeling the “freshness” through Coca-Cola with their new Facebook app. Fans of Ginza beer often sing “ Soju!” whenever they buy a bottle of the beer at Ginza’s Coca-Cola stores.<p>This looks great for the brand! As for Coca-Cola, the new mock-cola is already great for the brand. The overall recall of Coca-Cola is completely thanks to the invention of Coca-Cola, and PBR is the proof of this! Even before the new Coca-Cola Classic was announced, many people had been requesting Coca-Cola’s (WAN:SCOBY) to change the Drink now! It is sweet and sticky, which are the qualities of Coke’s fake. After the approval to PBR, all the fans of Coca-Cola have joined the PBR wave!<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_294.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
