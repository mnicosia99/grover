<br/><br/>Eating polyphenols from edible waste foods can significantly reduce serum levels of the blood mononucleosis antibodies. The results were obtained through a joint project of Kobe University of Medicine (KUM) and Hokkaido University and published in the open access journal Health Economics.<p>The researchers conducted a systematic analysis of the food borne mononucleosis antibody levels in 307 aged subjects living in four cities in Japan. The participants were given either average or high levels of polyphenols consumed from food (1,000 parts per thousand or 10 percent of the amount of polyphenols consumed). The researchers measured total serum mononucleosis antibodies, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes and CD5+ and CD8+ B cells.<p>Participants who consumed the highest levels of polyphenols from edible waste food showed lower antibody levels compared to those who consumed the lowest levels of polyphenols. Anti-automonthropoietary effects were observed for each exposed component of polyphenols, but TK8+ T lymphocytes were markedly less aggressive than CD4+ T lymphocytes. Non-invasive immunological methods were also able to prove the immune effect. “When anti-automonthropoietic effects can be seen in both primate models and cells of human diet,” say the authors, “it is possible that individuals with foods that contain polyphenols (like vegetables, fruits, and leafy vegetables) from edible waste have an average level of anti-automonthropoietic antibodies that is lower than for individuals who do not eat such foods.”<p>Polyphenols from food have their highest influence on blood mononucleosis antibodies when they are processed. The researchers suggest that minimizing the consumption of food waste polyphenols and treating them for absorption into the body can significantly reduce blood mononucleosis antibody levels and improve the immune system.<p>The data were funded by the Natural Science and Technology Development Bank of Japan and Yoshizawa K.K. for the research grant 16-HP44288.<p>For more information, please contact Taku Inokuchi, Associate Professor at KUM, sumio.kkato@ky.ub.jp, or Tuneyoshi Ka, Professor at Hokkaido University, <a href="http://www.u.chk.ac.jp/home.html">http://www.u.chk.ac.jp/home...</a><p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_19.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
