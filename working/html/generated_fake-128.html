<br/><br/>This basic research provides basic experimental data for the development of viruses (including HIV-1 and avian flu virus) that include OCT4A in the genetic sequences that replicate in host cells. Among other benefits, this can be adapted to the design of more accurate cloned viruses. The RNA molecular content includes Amino Acid-Linked Enteroplasmic DNA of high structural purity, keeping the expression of OCT4A limited to populations of lineages composed of chimera [extraterrestrial organisms].<p>The full paper is below, (o nd the video is one of the most stunning videos on the internet and I urge you to watch it again and again as well). I must remind you once again that the purpose of this research was to develop a way to design viruses with a high genetic sequence burden that could result in the replication of those viruses by CD4+ T-cells in vivo (i.e. that could be delivered to the brain) and may contribute to viral immunity through the survival of cells expressing the larger whole genome of the viral DNA. The ultimate goal was to be able to generate viruses that include only those components that are necessary for viral replication in human CD4+ T-cells.<p>The University of Bernâ€™s Department of Chemistry, Switzerland, and University of Bonn, Germany.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_128.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
