<br/><br/>Radioviruses represents one of the most important basic pathways for the transmission of human beings infected with such viruses such as SARS, avian, human respiratory and various other. Following close knowledge and study of the progression of a RAV infection in a human individual several laboratories from different countries in the world have shown that the transmission of RAVs depends on more than the variety of pathogen (virulent nature of virus) included within such infectious micro-organisms.<p>For example, a virus such as XMRV was found to harbor similar mutation characteristics to that of HIV (viral blood-link syndrome disease), injecting T-cell peripheral T-lymphocyte autosomal dominant.<p>These mutations vary according to its capacity to induce latent infection in the human host as well as its ability to exploit of vital components of the innate immune system (a sort of human version of the natural killer cells). These mechanisms are considered as key to defeating the network responsible for the infection, which in its early stage are an untested and unpredictable mechanism of the ability to minimize viral initiation in the human host.<p>In this introduction, we endeavor to present a description of the severity of the infection resulting from the different viral transmission activities within viruses such as cold, flu, HIV and some cardiovascular diseases which are often associated with RAV, DVT (congenital tetanus T-cell profound disease), CNV (central nervous system multi-visceral disease) and retinopathy of prematurity.<p>We will also introduce a simple paradigm based on wave theory, which essentially explains the incidences of RAV severe<p>Inflammatory Pathology in the human immune system.<p>Ana Mena, Laura Garci_a, Virginia Plasencia, Olga Hidalgo, Jos- Ignacio Ayestar-n, Sebasti-n Alberti, Nuria Borrell, Jos- L.
