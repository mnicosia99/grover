<br/><br/>In a follow-up research, we present a concise evaluation of the characteristics of carbapenem resistance between the studies published in the Greenhouse Gas: Recent Scientific Findings and Emissions (GNCE) and other literature on the topic in a series of table displays, along with anecdotal evidence: the official Ceasar Yanez-Delgado study, and the unpublished Tshomba-badji-raanyi pilot study. These results have confirmed our suspicion that resistance patterns in one study are not very specific or consistent with the other studies, and, indeed, illustrate variation in resistance patterns, contributing to uncertainty in estimating carbapenem biogeochemical fluxes. Additionally, the possible fact that carbapenem resistivity increased with increasing frequencies during periods of elevated greenhouse gas concentration has not been clearly shown.
