<br/><br/>We are writing to you in hopes that you can publish some correction or clarification to the following statements made by Donald Kvenbel from the Convention on Trade and Development (COTED) on December 14, 2011. The above statements should be clarified or corrected.<p>1. According to COTED, it is possible to certify rice seeds from the United States because they have a variety of plants that produces more rice and more price-stable rice. If COTED’s certification criteria are met, the cost of rice seeds in the United States is lower than other varieties from different countries. A soya bean seed developed in this type of grain is considered cheap.<p>2. According to COTED, if the United States does not export this crop it will decrease rice production in Asia. This is false. A soya bean seed developed by the United States produces 20 times more rice than other varieties developed from soya bean seeds in Asia. According to Statistics on Soya Beans in Japan, six million tons of soya bean seeds were planted in the spring of 2007 in Japan. It is not possible to place the responsibility of the decline in rice production in Asia on this soya bean seed. It is possible to agree on the reason for this decline due to nature and changing economic development of Asia.<p>4. COTED has also defined the definition of sustainable rice seed production and suggests the definition as follows: “(1) Sustainable rice seed production: A sustainable rice seed supply is produced by farmers and ranchers where there is consistency in production, where the magnitude of an economic difference between high- and low-quality seeds is deemed to be as much as no more than 4-in-10-factors over five years. (2) Sustainable rice seed production: A sustainable rice seed supply is produced through collection of seedlings by farmers and ranchers where seeds that were used for the start of growing are picked up and cased. The seedlings are not stored for a long period and crop rotation is well maintained to extend the life of the seeds. (3) Sustainable rice seed production: There is no negative impact on other agricultural practice such as production of nitrogen for irrigation and no use of hazardous chemicals as a practice in the production of rice seeds. (4) In other words, the one-area grasses rice seeds are grown along with other agricultural practices in a society are environmentally sustainable.”<p>5. According to COTED, rice seeds are developed for Japan by cooperating with other regions in rice development. This interpretation appears true.<p>6. COTED’s definition for sustainable rice seed production does not take into account the high production cost of the United States rice seed.<p>7. According to COTED, the United States has been producing 30 percent of rice on behalf of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The United States does not have a plant group due to industrialization (read MS-7). According to COTED, the United States includes a number of rice seeds to its export.<p>8. According to COTED, Asian countries are capable of achieving such high production levels within ten years or in five years with standards developed and implemented. According to COTED, however, rice could be sourced from tropical climates and sub-tropical countries such as countries in eastern and southern Africa.<p>9. According to COTED, the transition towards a more complex system might take three decades for developing countries with large areas in the tropical climate and sub-tropical region.<p>10. According to COTED, India, Pakistan, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Indonesia, and Thailand have production capacity that can sustain small-scale farmers with rice seeds produced from a diverse range of crops.<p>We hope that these issues will be clarified or corrected in some way by your publication. Thanks for your attention.<p>Taku Inokuchi, Okazaki Asako Yamamoto, Sumio Takahashi, Yuji Moriwaki, and Tetsuya Yamamoto<p>SOURCE: ibid.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_25.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
