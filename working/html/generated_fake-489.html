<br/><br/>Our paper on RSV (Radioviruses)B/ESN-942B (evaluable) performed in the 2009/2010 Meningitis Surveillance Year (MSEY) confirms the clinical linkage with the previous study published in the same journal in 2006. Specifically, the subpopulation we identified from our case control study (ineligible) is part of the second phase cluster, and was associated with long life span. The classification of the disease is as follows: 2N-A (6+ years) Category C (7+ years+) Big case here included two death years following 2009 treatment. The document cites the reasons for the increased incidence with the available treatments was focused on antibiotic non-specific therapeutic approaches.<p>The first manuscript, “Neptune Virus-related Meningococcal Subunit”, was published in 1998 by the EKX for its initial regional assessment, and has been used for multiple type 1 cases, mostly as a parallel and referral process. This concept of targeting and desensitizing pathogens for treatment use was applied to Morgellons for some years, and is now incorporated in an addition for Meningitis Surgexvaluation Group (MSEG) in 2011. The report stands as a reference study for performing regional neomicrobiological surveillance for Meningitis in Central and Latin America.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_489.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
