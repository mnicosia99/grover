<br/><br/>By Prabuddha Dey, Monami Chakraborty & Mrinal K. Maiti<p>Physicists have often used the physical properties of molecules – chemical groups consisting of atoms and molecules — to define the outer membrane of cells. Cellular membranes function as formidable barriers, keeping single particles separated from each other and thus preventing cross-talk. One such barrier is the structure of the molecules themselves: their structure varies widely depending on their structure, on the one hand, and on the other, on their contents. Such differentiation and dis-integration offers the opportunity to observe molecular shape transformation and super-condensation processes. In this video, our guest describes how one way in which an individual molecule can change its structure and its own environment in space while remaining completely fixed on one surface is a "drive" in the “control system” of cells – the inner membrane.<p>Hexophyxia<p>The “drive” for the hydrophobic H. related peptide hexophyxia in the inner membrane of a cell is in its receptor binding site. Under certain conditions, chemists call this specific site a "slip site." The slip site is the location where H. related peptide has a better chance of binding to a specific molecule, which binds the peptide. The slip site is like a security control. As the peptide completes its slide to the slip site, it changes its structure, which is reflected by the fact that the polymerization step becomes longer and the sequence of activation and off/on phase properties change. One key property of H. related peptide is the presence of a double structure. The researchers say that polymeric conformation allows this process. This double structure thus creates a structural lock at the slip site. Further, H. related peptide, in its structure, has a dipole unique to its kinase complex. As the dipole stays longer at slip site, the bond opportunity at slip site is stronger. Hence a hold on slip site is enhanced. The regular in vitro or "in vivo" model experiment shows that the “drive” as well as composition of particles is regulated by interaction of this structure.<p>Technology<p>In-depth research into the mechanism for the development of the hydrophobic molecule hexophyxia was introduced by Dr David Oyekanmi and Dr Istvan Yarskovski, both from ATU-T-Mark ("University of Texas at Arlington") at the end of the 1990s, in collaboration with their colleagues who are authors of this paper. Similarly, research by Dr Ibuchina and colleagues in Czech Republic has now provided a molecule-level description of a hydrophobic sequence in mTOR, a key molecular machinery regulating transcription. In this way, the possible role of “invasively exploitable” H. related peptide in H. related synapses is now understood.<p>Scientific paper:<p>"Promising Properties of Invasively Proximate Chlorinated Androgen Chaperones in H. related Synapses"<p>doi:10.1016/j.ubci.2011.11.026<p>Source: A.
