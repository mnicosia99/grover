<br/><br/>Just kidding!<p>The above figure is just a couple of neurons or maybe maybe two or three. But in the long run, this ionic reaction is extremely important. When nanometre crystals of monosodium urate or silicon dissolved into the tissues in humans or even other animals, a chemical reaction takes place which ignites their sugar contents and causes thermal burning, which in time causes injury which in turn leads to inflammation.<p>This is precisely what has happened with the monkeys. The previous acute inflammation was followed by long-term chronic inflammation in their tissues. Being used to eating certain foods with more than 10 per cent monosodium urate, the monkeys have accumulated tissues with more and more of this reactive compound. To study such a connection between the two, the Japanese physicists now found that the monosodium urate crystals in the monkey brain undergo an influx of ionic reactive sulfur which can change its organic structure and also changes their composition and eventually reduces their concentration, resulting in increased crystallization. This process is part of the reaction that produces more polymers.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_251.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
