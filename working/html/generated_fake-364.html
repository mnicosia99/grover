<br/><br/>The tests showed new results. “Non-Fluoroquinolone antimicrobial surfaces improved pathogen resistance against S1N1”, says Ana Mena, advisor of the Instituto Gran Cocida y de Antimicrobial Defense of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (INAM). The data was published this month in the internationally renowned journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. She was invited by the Minister of Health of the United States of America, Dr. Richard Besser to present this research on the possible consequences of non-invasive treatment, referred to as frontal metastasis. He is Secretary, Office of Public Health Assistance, Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (the National Coordinator for Health IT – the care gatekeeper), Office of the Secretary for National Institute for Health Research (also known as the NIH) and CEO, U.S. Association for the Study of Drug Development (USASD).<p>Lecturing about the developments in the field, the author said that “anti-microbial resistance and medical treatment are a formidable challenge, and cancer treatment is especially endangered”. With the application of antimicrobial drugs in the course of cancer treatment there is an “alarming probability of resistance.” He described the analogy between tumors and bacterial cells, and explained that, if we apply antibiotics alone to tumors, this may lead to the progression of resistance, which “is threatening the global health”. This process of cancer therapy, he said, has to be performed in combination with other drugs, as there are other necessary therapies that, in some cases, are not available.<p>The subject of cancer therapy and alternative therapies<p>Carlos Alberto Pérez González of UNAM is director of the National Civilian Status Research Service (Servicio Nacional de Registros de la Identidad Civil – SENSIRIO). He is also a member of the Social and Health Co-herence for Life Forum and the Director of the Drug Policy School in National University of Honduras. He is currently working on the Commodification of Pediatric Cancer. Regarding this topic, the author explained that “in the case of resistant cancer the ultimate solution of the treatment of patients or their family members is to have them have immunological therapy which has many complications.” If the drug treatments are unsuccessful, the next solution is to give them a bone marrow transplant and then, to be cured.<p>Antimicrobial resistance and non-invasive treatment<p>Giving an overview of recent research into antimicrobial resistance, both studies explored the mechanism of resistance to antimicrobial drugs in tumours and patients treated with frontal metastasis therapies. In the case of frontal metastasis, the authors have, for the first time, shown that N2Xa-producing Bacillus had an enhanced resistance to DQc 200.<p>For Luis Manuel Solís Tapia, a research associate in the chemical and biological sciences department of the University of La Serena, the results revealed were “confirmation of the idea that non-invasive treatments can reduce susceptibility to S1N1”. For him, this means that they will reduce the side effects of the traditional therapies, such as leukemias, cancerous cells and lymphomas.<p>The II unit at the National University of Nicaragua, under the auspices of the Mexican Academy of Science and Technology, has conducted the research to find a new pathogen resistant to the antibiotics, which usually used to treat infections such as leukaemia and cancer. In the last years of his testimony, the study coordinator of the laboratory, Daniel Portillo, showed how a case of tumour metastasis was studied using a new therapeutic approach called frontal metastasis therapy.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_364.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
