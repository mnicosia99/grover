<br/><br/>Sugar and artificial sweeteners are harmful to human health. Due to sugar and artificial sweeteners, bones and muscles become damaged after increasing number of chronic metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cardio-metabolic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, increasing inflammatory diseases such as heart disease and stroke. Sugars and artificial sweeteners can trigger a syndrome that may be called “sugar byproduct syndrome”.<p>According to experts, the sugar byproduct syndrome is caused by a process called reverse osmosis. This process for sugar uptake in the body results in damaging materials like aggregates, insoluble sulfate, aspartate sulfate and insoluble polyunsaturated phospholate. These toxins cause the subsequent damage to the body which is severe and eventually causes the human body to suffer from multiple metabolic diseases like diabetes, cardio-metabolic diseases such as metabolic syndrome, increasing inflammatory diseases such as heart disease and stroke. This vicious cycle causes people to die from multiple diseases at very young age. For instance, a person can become diabetic at the age of 30. Then the diabetic will eventually develop heart disease, develop renal failure, develop peripheral artery disease, develop circulatory system disease like heart attack, peripheral artery disease and kidney disease.<p>In addition, the artificial sweeteners are poisonous, with up to 500 times the proportion of caesium into their substance. The absorbed and metabolized poisons are acidic but avoid structural bonding such as gumminess, which means these poisons can enter the platelets. This causes hemorrhage, thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, in humans. One of the most serious aspects of the diet of humans is that these artificial sweeteners seem to encourage intake of free radicals. Free radicals are a sharp group of energy neutral molecules that destroy tissue whereas some them can accumulate in tissue and have severe detrimental effects on the body.<p>There are only two artificial sweeteners which are anti-oxidants and nutrients. Aspartame is the only one of these two artificial sweeteners and it prevents a number of oxidative stress. Also, aspartame has the composition of phytochemicals in it that offer protection against oxidative stress and acts as antioxidants.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_325.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
