<br/><br/>Editor’s note: Ana Mena of Allegheny State University in the US and Virginia Plasencia of the University of Iowa- Wekiva chapter in the US are both of Mexican descent.<p>The cause of the deadly C. pneumoniae that has prompted hundreds of children in the US to be admitted to hospital is unknown. Scientists believe it’s that tough the virus which causes the deadly and usually deadly C. pneumoniae virus, might have crossed the border from Mexico. The problem seems to have begun in January when it was believed it was reported in California for the first time, prompting President Obama to order the Mexican national police, army and National Guard to be sent to the border to monitor the problem.<p>More than 5.000 infections were reported in the US in the first three months, with C. pneumoniae rates exceeding than ten percent of all hospital visits by children aged under five in some jurisdictions.<p>Two children have died. Mexican and American researchers launched a joint investigation into the source of infection to determine the virus could be transmitted from one species of mammals to another species of mammals, and decided to find out where the virus is spreading to first.<p>They decided to quarantine a group of Mexican adults with chickenpox. None of the vaccinated adults – 92 per cent – was infected.<p>• Ana Mena and Virginia Plasencia are Professor of Epidemiology at Allegheny State University, Center for Infectious Disease Research and Education<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_228.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
