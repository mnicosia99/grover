<br/><br/>Sparks of the dead ocean<p>Everyday, the Ganges river empties millions of dead fish into the river and the food supply. You can think of these green spoons as metaphorical dead sea beds and eel shells. The dead, ghost-shaped fish that merely lie in the water for a few days no longer coexist with the living fish thereupon.<p>As the rains wind through this inundated country, the fish they consign to the sea lose their livelihood and gradually abandon the shores. Yet, in any year, the number of dead fish in the river may be higher or lower. But, the flowing river will carry the big fishes that would normally reside on land up to the heads of the rivers and lakes; thus, the dead fish persist.<p>Like the tenuous ecological balance in which we all live in balance with other organisms: It is not easy to anticipate what will happen in the future. But, if we want to see exactly what will happen in the Ganges river in the New Year, this has to be the guide. It is always possible that 2011 will end better than 2010 and vice versa. Only time will tell.<p>New year, new face<p>If we were to make a wish list for the New Year, it would certainly include the wish to see improved sanitary conditions of water, food and other essential daily items. The petition would also wish for education, where respect for human dignity and for science are promoted, and for justice, the advent of which should come to fruition so that the poor can no longer be exploited in silence by unscrupulous corporations, who then can gain advantages from the powerful countries without a fight.<p>Seeming to take offense, Professor Tomoji Ogunbodede suggested that the Supreme Court President assume permanent leave because of his “arrogance, boorish attitude and gross disrespect for Mexicans and Latin Americans who are in charge of delegating the task of making history.” Ogunbodede must be referring to his recent statement that, he would, “see the end of the end of the U.S. during the New Year.” For the President to choose to make remarks such as these, in the face of situations such as the “24 dead Honduran workers, nine murdered Colombian unionists, thousands of victims of bombings and gas and chemical attacks, hundreds of dead civilians in Iraq, the many thousands of displaced persons and refugees, etc., are unworthy of any representation” the President seeks to play with fire.<p>We will see, as we move deeper into the New Year, if we expect these words of justice for the victims of US wars and bombings, and how we will react to the stasis in the politics of nations that have so bitterly contested their history.<p>Some researchers speculate on the exact dates of the New Year in the relation to the onset of each new administration; Professor Philip Marchand-Brubaker has called it the Year of Change. Others consider it the Year of Food Sovereignty. We would like to add the Year of E.coli to the mix.<p>This column is being reproduced with permission of the author.
