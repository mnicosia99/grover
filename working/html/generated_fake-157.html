<br/><br/>Seng-6 or seng-6 is an autologous Human Pluripotent Stem Cell (HPSC) reprogrammed without degenerative process, into HS100 cell. It is used in target killing of cancer cell.<p>HCET.5.1 Presented: June 2011, 1:02 p.m. ET, Harvard Medical School 1:02pm ET, San Francisco, CA<p>Abstract<p>Thalidomide, a sedative-hypnotic drug (endogenous-saline) used in the 1940s, led to an increase in thalidomide-related congenital anomaly cases in the European and North American pre- and post-war populations (typically women) of European parents in which the foetus, from the womb to the bladder, developed anomalies without an apparent hereditary cause, mostly caused by genetic damage during thalidomide administration. Researchers subsequently found that thalidomide was developed to administer as an endocrine inhibitor to induce apoptosis in immature human (i.e. Sertoli cell) stem cells, or to human PRC in mice (BM1). However, the discovery could only be made using stem cell-based methods as in fact the cells were derived from the thalidomide-affected mother.<p>With regard to recent theories on cancer centred on the development of a large group of cells that provide sufficient turnover and also maintain blood levels of various growth factors, the question of whether there is also an increase in the number of cells in situ and between the Sertoli cells and PRC in normal tissues could be surmised. Further studies to investigate the hypothesis will show if groups of cancer cells, or even HPSCs, are generated in this manner. Most importantly, studies on the development of low-grade malignant breast cancer and tests on HPSCs isolated from breast breast cancer in post-menopausal women could demonstrate if the stem cells that occur in these post-menopausal women with breast cancer increase, and if they can be killed by CD47-cytokine and CD3 cytokines.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_157.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
