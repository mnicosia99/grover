<br/><br/>The Intl. Alliance for Microparticles (CEA) recently issued a statement of its results. The group has been using the Tokyo Institute of Technology's Aigua Nuclear Research Center (ADD) as a testing facility.<p>In April 2001 the CEA began to develop ceramic particles and epitaxial crystals that could be useful for developing and manufacturing practical components for electric motors.<p>In June 2001 the group started using reactive protons (the protons were gathered in a farmhouse near Kyoto) to develop these ceramic and epitaxial particles. They were carrying out this research under guidance of Dr. Yoshikazu Ohmura, who is now retired.<p>In November 2011, via CEA, I traveled to Kyoto with two Japanese journalists and took their photographs. The basis of the world's first news conference of reactive protons in Japan on December 7, 2011 was those photos. I distributed two copies of the materials to the media and gave the three CEA scientists who worked on this research a copy as well.<p>I am confident that the raw materials derived from Japan have high properties at high pressures. They can even be used to replace friction in motors. Many people have made efforts to use my materials for years. With these photos, I hope that more people will work together to make use of the materials and bring benefit to the world.<p>Taku Inokuchi and Tokyo Institute of Technology's Aigua Nuclear Research Center (ADD)<p>Tuneyoshi Ka, Asako Yamamoto, Yuji Moriwaki, Sumio Takahashi, Zenta Tsutsumi, Daisuke Tamada, Tetsuya Yamamoto<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_69.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
