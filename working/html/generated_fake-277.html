<br/><br/>Escherichia coli (Escherichia coli) pathogens resistant to antibiotics are being acquired as Klebsiella pneumoniae (keri-pneumoniae) bacteria, and it is clear that increased transmission of these strains is responsible for the increased prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MRSA) bacterial strains, warns a new research analysis by researchers from South Carolina State University, ScienceDirect, Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University and New York University.<p>K-P is a highly contagious bacteria that is found in the environment, enteroviruses, animals, and human populations. It causes infections in people and animals.<p>This assessment is based on the “100% Satellites” population based health survey, focusing on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli in South Carolina. The interviews with human population provide valuable information on the microbiology of the population, such as bacterial diversity and frequency of healthcare associated infections.<p>They found that there is wide variability in infection susceptibility to K-P in the state (regardless of age or population group); however, the rate of acute and chronic infections is consistent with those found in other New England states.<p>This recent review of the infections of Klebsiella pneumoniae in South Carolina suggests an important role for invasive invasive bacteria in South Carolina. An increase in transmission through cell transfer from the environment to the population of Klebsiella could be possible since there is insufficient data on how it is transmitted.<p>Read the report:<p>Read the Related News:<p>Read the Advocate Article: Klebsiella pneumoniae: Increased Transmission in South Carolina<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_277.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
