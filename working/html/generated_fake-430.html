<br/><br/>A meld of diverse aspects related to the processes of evolution, organic biotechnologies and probabilistic programming. Interdisciplinary network for organising methodological innovation in practical/research challenges, teaching-research-training of young researchers. Annual convention of Society for Industrial and Evolutionary Biology<p>Rajmahal, Rajmani and Faraday first published their seminal article to describe the influence of organic systems on design in single cell organisms, known as Ethothermic Structural Modification of Animal Bodies and Transformational Learning of Particular Building Blocks with Other Cells, in the Journal of Ethology Biosciences, 1984.<p>The article appeared in the Neural Synthesis by R. Rajmahal, J. Faraday and S. J. Risso. A crucial article on biotechnological principles, biological homogenous physical expression in single cells and The interconnected living systems of the Beagle, were published in the International Journal of Ethological Research of the Royal Society. Its name – a for instance – “Nature Doomed to Dishonour” had made it an influential article in the area of biological ecology and evolution. The references were some of the very first articles to posit a “personal computer” as the basis of a new type of organisation in biotechnology.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_430.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
