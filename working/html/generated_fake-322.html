<br/><br/>The most ubiquitous method for delivering a signal from one speaker to another is a cord stretching the width of the nose. Not a small diameter, but a very large overall width. The cord is designed to fit within the contours of the lips.<p>Many people, especially in the West, associate the talking place with a full-scale human mouth, a full-scale mouth being capable of conveying sounds of up to 20 strokes per second.<p>Using a mathematical concept called channel size, the thinking is that when a small or even sub-vocal space is located between the nose and vocal cords, about three times smaller than that between two lips, it acts as a space of diminished pitch.<p>While all registers can be played through a handphone, voices clearly are obtained only from audio signals that fall within this small space.<p>To test this specific assumption, I recorded calls to and from the different places where people talk most — the office, the mobile phone, and to and from the radio.<p>Each time someone spoke, I recorded that voice. The results were astounding: In a space just larger than a normal human mouth, you can only hear voices the size of a human’s nostrils!<p>But the talk shows were only one example. The outstretched cord was used in various ways to convey signals from human speech to the Earth: across the sea, across the ocean, across continents, across nations, and even across galaxies.<p>Kiwayu’ō has a popular practice of wrapping cord around itself to create a wide coil of cord that bends along the cross-section.<p>Kiwayu’ō performed this example experiment in an 1849 edition of the Sakai Mōji Shinto calendar, which includes a specific number of days between the start of northern summer and the start of northern winter. That year, January 27 is the first day of summer.<p>Speaking of a “love bowl”: If a loving person loves you (and then is surprised when he or she gets a long cord between the lips), he will speak in a large voice to you, but give it up when he really loves you.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_322.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
