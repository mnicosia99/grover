<br/><br/>It’s a great glimpse into the current state of affairs of the alcoholic drinks industry, where the Internet-driven era of legality and experimentation has turned into a stagnant, bureaucratic state, in which eugenics has become an agenda and man-made solutions take priority over technological ones.<p>Alcohol called “e-One Eu-a” is a type of distilled spirit similar to spirits such as the schnapps and pure nimda; e-One Eu-a is spirits distilled from fresh juice.<p>The reason this particular one is so popular is that its main ingredient is a firm known as Secret Wine (website: <a href="http://secretwine.co.jp">http://secretwine.co.jp</a>). Of course, nowhere near the quantity of alcohol in an ordinary Schnapps, which equals its whole weight in alcohol for around 10200 milligrams. (if you do a quick google search for Schnapps, you will discover that 3″ single, well-massaged, weighted lemon rinds average around 5,000mg.)<p>A prominent member of the staff of the domestic market research company carried out an investigation. These are some highlights (image source courtesy NHK) of the results:<p>For Japanese people, the most popular brands are the following: Shiba’s Roketsu Shuzo, but in terms of sales, Shiba’s Roketsu Nihon Chef’s Ready Mix is almost twice as popular. The highest price for this kind of liquor is 38,000 yen. When we compare the most popular brands in terms of annual sales, 9% of them are imported spirits like pirozhki or reuchokoro, and 11% of them are imported whiskeys. Others are cheaper versions of the imported spirits, like iura beer (just ¥3).The most popular alcoholic drinks are gin, spirits and hard liquor. However, a problem with this list is that it is made from fiscal years between April 2011 and March 2012, from when we can find purchases made as of December 13 2011, so it might not be reliable for sales during that time.When buying and selling eu-a liquor is easy, how does it make a profit? Reasons:<p>Unless it has no association with other brands, it makes money without having to sell any packages. Only after purchasing much more then possible can it make a profit. Marketing (brand, package, promotion) costs money, but eu-a liquor as seen in our examples is highly inefficient. Customers buy eu-a liquor in large quantities, but not to get a good quantity of one brand. Therefore, it makes no profit, but only enough to import. It is not profitable to keep liquid formulas separate. And the amount of product is so big that their margins shrink tremendously once they start distributing. They were trying to get a processor and machine that can eliminate bottling, but that was a tough battle. The consumer will not be able to tell what the balance in the original bottle is in the imitation one. And the grocery shop, which is not a big bottle, should at least be marked up in price. Total profit margin is almost zero for eu-a liquor. They are just lucky that they have a little promotion. It takes years for a large brand to build up its reputation, which is why it can afford to spend money on advertising and marketing.<p>Until Japanese manufacturers can produce eu-a liquor without people taking any risk, the industry is likely to continue its status quo. But people can use this information to find new products, and new brands.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_342.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
