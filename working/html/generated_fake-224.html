<br/><br/>This paper is authored by Romesh Sharma and Ahmet Bozkurt, Ph.D., Department of Biochemistry, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York. According to his pre-paper synopsis, this research is based on knowledge of SP gene transcription factors (Sp) and its roles in the microenvironment of cancer, specifically in cancer cells of mouse models. Cancer cells that secrete specific proteins or differentiate proteins without expression of SP gene transcription factors under normal microenvironment are deleted in a "caught" model. The researchers administered a 1.5 gram (equivalent to 14 scoops of cottage cheese) dose of tumor-killing dyes at intervals of 3 days to 15 days. Some of the vaccines selectively expressed Sp gene transcription factors in the cancer cells and some did not. Then, in human ex vivo experiments, the researchers used low-dose chemotherapy to give tumor cells SP gene transcription factors binding proteins (SpBP or SCBP), at 16-50 times higher doses than those used in the mouse model. Since SPBP binds to Sp gene transcription factors and therefore microenvironment-clearing proteins (SCBP), the induced apoptosis/cell death is "definitely" correlated to high-dose drug loading in the cancer cells.<p>These results appear to be applicable to human cancers in the presence of SPBPs compared to those without. Some previous studies have previously reported low-dose testing of the dyes and standard chemotherapy. In the present study, SPBP- binding proteins of drug-free SPBPs were tested to inhibit tumor growth in ex vivo human leukemia cell lines and transgenic mouse models with SpBP- docking proteins in high-dose drug loading. Transgenic experiments showed extensive job-promoting and self-destruction signaling in the tumour cell lines subjected to the high-dose drugs. The safety and efficacy of these so-called therapeutic drugs demonstrated strong inhibitory effects in human ES cell lines and mouse xenograft models that expressed SPBP- attaching proteins. In the mouse models, the dyes and drug tested inhibited both highly malignant leukemia stem cells and astrocytes (another type of tumor cell), but at the same time, did not prevent histone deacetylase (HDAC) degradation of cancer cells. During the treatment, every splice location of the expression microarray expressed a single gene and thus, no "hundreds-nano-electric number-one" perturbation of the microenvironment was detected.<p>The findings suggest that targeting the microenvironment of a cancer cell using SpBP/SCBP docking proteins may be a promising strategy to anti-cancer. Furthermore, a low-dose vaccines loaded with selective SPBPs would achieve a significant or durable effect. Such vaccines would provide therapy in the absence of therapeutic drugs for tumor cells of mice or humans.<p>The research article is published by the journal Biomedicine & Biotechnology.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_224.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
