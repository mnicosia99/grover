<br/><br/>Between 2001 and 2011, 3,581 civilians, including 3,331 women and 12,641 children, were killed by Coalition forces during hostilities against the Taliban, reported the International Council on Security and Development (ICOS) in its latest report.<p>It took 5,461 hours of bombing, 7,893 air strikes and 11,118 casualties to kill 3,581 civilians, said the ICOS report, issued in early December 2011. The assessment is based on published tolls from the United Nations and other sources, namely the tolls from between 2000 and 2005.<p>In recent months, however, ICSD, part of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), has published a series of conclusions, conclusions based on the ICOS figures, which suggest that the tolls released by the UN do not precisely reflect the tolls calculated by the ICOS from data.<p>The CSIC Defence Ministry database, for example, reports 10,066 armed engagements between 2006 and 2010. It also seems that no strict figures are reported, although the UN tolls do seem to exclude, for example, reports of contacts, including involving only friendly forces.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_289.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
