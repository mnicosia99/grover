<br/><br/>Bioscan presentations for the NEOLOBVUS-1 sequencing pathogen sequencing project<p>p00100 .pdf<p>The genus NEOLOBVUS is a cousin of dengue and similar to roundworm, and also closely related to Japanese tsukake. The WHO has expanded their definition of this disease and now it is defined as NEOLOBVUS Type 1 pneumophilia. Results have been published in the European Journal of Microbiology.<p>Answer:<p>I have been following this project from the beginning. For a background understanding, see Nat Golan’s post. Today I received a confirmation from Nat Golan that “Paediatric sequencing of NEOLOBVUS and two diseases related to it by Dr. Rosbel Sanchez Contreras in Chile in 2010. Dr. Contreras presents the results at 12:30pm EST today [20th].” Additionally, Dr. Contreras will be presenting as part of this scientific workshop at UCLA on December 21st from 3:00pm – 5:00pm.<p>UPDATE: At the above link you will find the publication of NEOLOBVUS-1 Spanish Equivalent site on December 4th.<p>Location: the JPARC Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Milken Institute<p>Alcove 2<p>7022 Westwood<p>Los Angeles, CA 90095<p>Presentation time: 3:00 pm EST<p>Organizer: Dr. Joaquin Garcia (author of the NEOLOBVUS consortium paper for the Akwesasne Tribal Council of Niagara, Ont.)<p>More information: <a href="http://www.jparc.nsu.edu/">http://www.jparc.nsu.edu/</a><p>Disclosure: No financial relationship between the Kuranda CQ journal and Amarén or Ars & IB.
