<br/><br/>In 1996, Feng Hongqiu, a senior scientist at the Tianjin City Cancer Research Institute, learned that a remarkable technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to isolate and separate plaques of a cancer-causing protein, Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid (OD/Ovaic) from a blood sample. After various research and patient experiments, Ovaic was also used to detect cholangiocarcinoma (cholesterols). Deng Li, a high school science teacher in Weihai City, south China’s Fujian Province, is a writer who has worked with the organizers to demonstrate how PCR can be used to find the disease and its clinical diagnosis and possible treatment.<p>Q: How is Ovaic the equivalent of a cancer “sniffing” technique?<p>A: From our research, we have discovered that Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid (OD/Ovaic) is a cancer-causing protein that has the tendency to thrive on negative energy, via the gut microbiota. We also found that the proteins it creates within these microbiota occupy an organ known as the pharynx lining. The Ovaic protein isolates can thus be used to detect the cholangiocarcinoma and the clinical diagnosis.<p>Q: How does the LDPH participate in the field of Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid (OD/Ovaic) research?<p>A: All the information relating to Ovaic researchers is collected in our local laboratory led by our head professor (Professor Feng Hongqiu) and under the guidance of our chemist Chen Wei. During major conference sessions, researchers have used the laboratory facilities. Scientificists from non-Chinese research institutes have used our research facilities as an example in his or her speeches.<p>Q: How is the LDPH involved in the field of cholangiocarcinoma research?<p>A: For over a decade, Weihai City Cancer Research Institute has been working with Tongji University (Tezhao), Luoyang City of Jiangsu Province, and Weihai City Cancer Research Institute to study Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid and cholangiocarcinoma. The Research Department of Tongji University has been contracted to conduct Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid research. The Medical University of Taiwan (Minyuan), Jilin University of Science and Technology, and Waigaoqiao City of Zhejiang Province have been conducting Cholangiocarcinoma research. Weihai City Cancer Research Institute has organized conferences and had discussions with researchers from third-party research institutions, such as Universities in Fujian Province, along with a representative from Tongji University, one from Luoyang City, and some from Weihai City. In addition, Dr. Fujin Fang has been speaking on Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid cancer research and Cholangiocarcinoma in Japan.<p>Q: What are your expectations from Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid and Cholangiocarcinoma research?<p>A: Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid will be established as a useful diagnostic test for cholangiocarcinoma. Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid can also be used for the management of cancer. Through Ovolamcoidase/Ovolic acid research, we hope to develop more personalized treatment for Cholangiocarcinoma and also make it safe, effective, and effective.<p>See news release at <a href="http://leadourinalive.wordpress.com/2011/02/11/how-the-ovarian-sponge-cancer-research-field-connects-to-cholangiocarcinoma/">http://leadourinalive.wordp...</a><p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_361.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
