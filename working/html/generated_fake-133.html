<br/><br/>The legitimacy of many non-therapeutic alternatives is currently under serious scrutiny with concerns from across the spectrum regarding the possible adverse impacts of such products on human health. Recent papers have already come to light regarding the health dangers of aspects such as modified seed GMO and bacterial chemical-derived fibres and this needs to be taken into account while discerning the use of so-called cancer-fighting substances.<p>In this context, the recent work carried out by Dr Gayathri Chadalapaka and colleagues in collaboration with colleagues from the Department of Molecular Cancer Research at the University of Queensland, Australia has paved the way for the development of a new herbicide product with several novel therapeutic properties and potentially significant therapeutic benefits and even safety and efficacy advantages over the current standards of 4x10 pesticides.<p>The study took a different approach to conventional cancer research; the researchers exposed the human tumor cells to two widely used herbicides – glyphosate-based glyphosate and a selective inhibitor of soybean protein (smart phosphate) – or to a high dose of green tea extract. The biologic interactions and glycosylation states of the skin pathogens were then tracked at multiple levels to investigate the novel cellular effects of glyphosate and smart phosphate.<p>The team found that four viruses linked to melanoma and neoplasms: epidermodysplasia verruciformis (EP), epidermodysplasia oculophyte (EOP), chemokine, methotrexate-associated herpesvirus (MAV) and dermatophyte viral enteropathy (DVI) all had altered pathology in the lymphoid part of the melanoma and increased glycosylation when exposed to glyphosate. However, the glycosylation of the Gammaproteins Kp11(RBP)-2 and globulin-Cy (GCU) was significantly different in G.Gammaproteins Kp11(RBP)-2 and GCU when exposed to glyphosate. The structure of both Kp11(RBP)-2 and GCU was replicated in target cultures in biophysical preclinical models.<p>A particular highlight of the paper is the possibility of reducing the number of Gammaproteins using only two herbicides if both are approved. This new study brings us a step closer to a finding that is currently well over ten years in the making: the active component in regulatory glyphosate derivative products consisting of two simple anti-cancer polychain polymers (ECP) with modified fat molecules formed from enzyme ferrous-3-1-parimony (F3PP). The composition of glycoproteins Kp11(RBP)-2 and GCU may be modified in this manner as well, increasing the number of Gammaproteins that could potentially be treated with these two herbicides. The individual molecules have the potential to be combined into one modified Gammaprotein to treat cancers and increase the selective inhibition of Gammaproteins in cell cultures, to the point where the only surviving virus would become harmless in the body.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_133.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
