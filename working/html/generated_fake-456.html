<br/><br/>Mers or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome is a virus that attacks the respiratory system, causing fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath.<p>Yoga is known to suppress inflammation resulting from infections and diseases such as the flu. Several years ago, I proposed the use of one of the most commonly used substances to be promoted in order to enhance the immune system during infection: Mersota (sodium hydroxide). Let me explain.<p>Mersota uses a substance which inhibits inflammation, and is clinically known as sodium hydroxide. If we produce sodium hydroxide at a large quantity, the substance will decrease the inflammatory reaction and improve the immune response. For example, if someone contracts a cold virus, the immune system will release a lot of inflammatory factors, which will lead to the spread of the disease.<p>Therefore, we need a substance that prevents the immune system from producing inflammatory factors. And because this substance has already been proven to reduce the levels of specific inflammation-causing immune factors, then we can use it in order to sustain the immunity against infection.<p>So how could it be used in Mers? Imagine if I put the mesomorphine compound (charged sodium hydroxide) into an incubator with air and a serum level of infected patientsâ€™ mists. Then after a day, the humidity within the machine will be reduced and I will be able to observe the purity of blood. The amount of mist that is present will be reduced, indicating that the immune system is weakening. This is exactly what we hope to see with Mersota.<p>Mesomorphine compounds are already used in a variety of applications. One of the most commonly used is for the treatment of bacterial infections. The health care facility produces mesomorphine in its incubator using baking soda, and then releases the product directly into the general population. This will fight the invading bacteria by blocking their antimicrobial activity.<p>The use of such compounds in health care facilities has been around for years, but we are just recently starting to commercialize them. Fortunately, we already have a window of opportunity where we can get the compounds into hospitals in Japan before the whole world catches on to their use.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_456.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
