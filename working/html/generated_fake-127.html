<br/><br/>Death rates from coronary heart disease (CHD) could rise by five per cent a year if hydrogen fuel replaced conventional fossil fuels, researchers said Thursday.<p>Emissions of greenhouse gases in developing countries could increase by 16 per cent a year, depending on the concentration of atmospheric hydrogen in the air, said the study published in the journal EMBO Reports.<p>“This study makes a pretty strong case that once we get a practical hydrogen fuel economy, we are not going to get any decrease in air pollution,” said Japan’s Institute of Public Health Research, whose scientists conducted the study.<p>Half of the population in developing countries is severely deprived of health services, according to the study.<p>“To alleviate poverty and improve the quality of life, we need sustainable and clean energy, and we shouldn’t neglect the effects of fossil fuel combustion,” lead author Takayuki Uegaki said.<p>“This work shows that it’s time to take drastic measures such as regulation.”<p>Taka Aumoto, from the US’s Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the study raises concerns about the global impact of CO2 emissions — which make up the majority of pollution in developing countries.<p>“This is a major issue that’s often forgotten,” he said in a statement.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_127.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
