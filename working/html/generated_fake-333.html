<br/><br/>Our planet is composed of about 15.5 billion living cells, 2.24 billion of which have neurons. Neurogenesis (the spontaneous birth of new neurons) results from the activation of all mitochondria within cells. But what explains this? Proteins produced by these mitochondria are transformed into an array of metabolites (the chemical residue produced when a molecule is broken down) that are then recycled by different cells and consumed by the rest of the cell.<p>Typically the capsid (what looks like a stoichiometric contour) on this metabolic background is removed by enzymes, which requires the breakdown of components within the cell. But researchers at the RIKEN Cognitive Neuroscience Research Center (CNRC) in Japan noticed that in some cases the enzyme synthesis in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) could produce too much of a biochemical compound called c-kit (called Kottikō) in certain cell types, not translational degradation, leading to abnormal growth of certain cell types in various diseases.<p>The researchers introduced 150 mutations to the genes of cultured human neurons to determine whether the mutations led to aberrant lysosomal activity. The human tissues had difficulty clearing Kottikō, and because the enzyme is used to break down the substrate material, it may also lead to changes in cellular mass.<p>The researchers then investigated how this altered activity affects neurons and how it could predict the proliferation of the cells. They achieved this by manipulating cells by limiting signals that enhance lysosomal activity and delivering the mutant enzymes to cells to test their function.<p>The results showed that mutant proteins enhanced lysosomal activity in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease and in a neuron model of glioma, a rare cancer of the brain.<p>[1] “The ad-dependent associations of moderate changes in cardiac permeability with increase in their autophagy (the storage of cellular wastes), acylases, and thyrotoxic enzymes (the disposal of cellular substances that are toxic to cells),” by Asako Yamamoto, Y.H.
