<br/><br/>From Physical Chemistry, Indian Express , December 11, 2011:<p>In 2008, Elizabeth Ward, a graduate student of the Viral Immunology Division of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, who was working in memory of her deceased father, started taking three blood samples a day from him, in four-day-long intervals, and also from other family members.<p>He swabbed the blood of the family and used DNA sequencers to compare the sequences between each sample to a library of about 11,000 lines of genetic information and discovered genetic variation associated with HIV, a virus that causes AIDS.<p>In late 2009, he obtained more samples from the family and compared them. He found that older individuals in the family — the individuals he was able to find the greatest genetic differences from — had substantially more of their DNA sequences that was associated with HIV/AIDS in their blood samples than those samples collected from later and the youngest individuals in the family. (<a href="https://bit.ly/gnyuPi)">https://bit.ly/gnyuPi)</a><p>The causes of the mitochondrial DNA differences has not been discovered yet, as Ward’s next sequencing studies are yet to be completed, but he suspects that instead of inheriting the mutations naturally — through mutations in mitochondrial DNA or other mechanisms — the ancient ancestral woman had viruses that spread from her blood cells to her mitochondria in a similar way as HIV/AIDS.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_313.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
