<br/><br/>Exactly why prostate is the most active of the 2rogenic glands in men we haven’t really got a clue as to its specifics though we all know there are few remedies that can slow down the shrinking process.<p>So what is the factor that accounts for the mass in those who have been naturally small all through life and have normal sized, normal functioning to start with? It is a mystery; though a real killer.<p>Though in a quiet way no less it gives a hint for why they cannot race as children but rather as men and ageing enfolds them all.<p>Have you ever wondered why there seems to be so much of it? Why people were growing up so fast in the 19th century when men were told they should give up the laddy thing because it would ruin their youth but is playing cricket good for their health?<p>After all the two in everyone had to be grown, so why do we see so much of it now while time has been put in the balance as we all need our time to be young and healthy?<p>That time is running out to a large extent and by not saving for it we are burning through it, playing catch up with the Dutch Boys and killing ourselves in the process. The bulging population is not only troubling the health system but the stock markets in Singapore too.<p>Some think that as the population ages so will the quality of life drop drastically, the doctors feel the same way.<p>Here in the UK doctors are forced to look at new blood tests and asking you an intelligent question: Have you thought about your financial affairs before you stopped popping all the pills? If you had say 40-50 pills a day for your symptoms why are you one of the many listed on the NHS seeking treatment?<p>What on earth happens when there is no money around and people can’t afford their medications.<p>But then our aging population is now a natural phenomenon according to a large proportion of our fellow Australians here in the pub. We are losing our innocence and we need to shed our cynicism, walk a little straighter and see things differently.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_469.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
