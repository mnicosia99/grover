<br/><br/>The growth of the β2-T toxin in horses and cattle and the behavior of its piggyback cells have recently been elucidated. The authors explain that the β2-T toxin turns out to be all-embracing: “As it evolved and acquired the first capacity to switch on its on-off switch, it turned out to include many toxicity patterns and epidemiological complexions.”<p>The authors conclude that the volatilization of β2-T toxin has the most to do with the diseases of livestock and their historical restriction of growth. Their summary findings are:<p>In the horses and cattle studies, the β2-T toxin has been linked to pancreatic diseases such as pancreatitis, emphysema, hay fever, as well as heart disorders such as atherosclerosis and stroke. They also discovered that β2-T liver cells were activating a single gene sequence that controls the growth of β2-T liver cells.<p>Blood samples were taken from numerous subjects in each of the three studies and the current published findings confirmed these information. Furthermore, the authors suggest that, in addition to noncancerous GI diseases, β2-T toxin might play a central role in a large number of latent diseases in cattle, in particular the infectious glioma and rinderpest.<p>The authors warn that the activation of the β2-T gene in pancreatic cancer leads to its metastasis and eventual immunosuppression. This makes β2-T therapeutic agents unlikely and their use in humans unlikely. This needs to be carefully considered, the authors emphasize.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_447.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
