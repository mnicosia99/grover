<br/><br/>Hib could also be the cause of disorders, pathological changes and mucosal infections. Such studies usually consider only bacterial strains, and the bacterium Toxoplasma gondii is the most prominent among them. Toxoplasma gondii has existed since it was first discovered by the eighteenth century and was not regarded as a significant public health concern until 1980. Today, its presence in human semen and its part in transmitting human and animal diseases such as, brain tumors, Alzheimer’s, Chagas disease, weakened immune system or cardiac failure, among others. Toxoplasma gondii is a major cause of severe bacterial infections in children and infants with susceptible immune systems, which, in turn, may be fatal. In recent years, it has been confirmed that as many as one-third of cases of neurological or comorbid disorders are due to Toxoplasma gondii infection.<p>Antibiotic resistance<p>“Our study demonstrates the potential role of antibiotics against lineage resistance to all bacterial species of humans and animals. We found significant resistance in another bacteria of the host to antibiotics from a small selection of antibiotic substances. Our current findings can be used to identify lineages of bacterial resistance that are likely to promote systemic resistance to antibiotics in the future,” said L. Patrick Niquet from the MRC Collaboration on Antimicrobial Resistance in Vivo (MRC.AVER) “The study supports recent research showing that Giardia can resist lineages of antibiotics in its gut. As both Giardia and Varsavius cases for which antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in host cells and in infectious pathogens, they may further support the projected emergence of virulent resistant organisms (rTOs) that are more widespread and/or require fewer doses of antibiotics than rTOs that are currently widespread in human populations.”<p>The study was funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the National Institutes of Health, and the University of Bristol’s Center for Health Protection.<p>Ana Mena<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_445.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
