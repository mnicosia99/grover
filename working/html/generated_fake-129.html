<br/><br/>In order to get the information needed to edit certain genes we usually need to do so within a virus. However, viruses themselves are not very good at doing that. For example, to enable an alteration of the structure of a gene it must originate from a virus that contains a specific class of enzymes called RNA RNAucleotides (RNAs).<p>So researchers used a gizmo to convert portions of viruses into RNA nucleotides, which were then added into the human genome. As a consequence, the modified viruses could be used to experimentally use sequences from genes of interest. The Oct 4 video shows how this is done!<p>The video shows how to turn RNA into DNA and the Oct 5 one shows how to convert RNA into RNA-II molecules. (It is important to point out that not all RNAs come in one type, only the types being used in this experiment)<p>Yogaâ€™s Tao of RNA: the secret behind making short RNA!<p>~ Trent Trautman<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_129.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
