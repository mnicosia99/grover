<br/><br/>Reformulating the anti-apoptosis metabolic pathway has proven to be very successful in killing gut cancer. By manipulating gene expression in three subsets of anti-apoptosis metabolic pathways, directed against mechanisms found in normal human gut, anti-apoptotic drugs have been remarkably effective in killing harmless cells with aggressive tumors (Stong et al. 2010). The anti-apoptotic biology of the gut, when widely shared, is probably responsible for more tumor function as compared to the tumor-specific domains of G1 and G2 (Pankowski et al. 2010).<p>Recombinant human T2 beta2-Toxin is resistant to nontoxic anti-apoptotic molecules and the biochemical variants (molecular twists and turns) of T2 beta2-Toxin are very active against extracellular matrix molecules and immunomodulatory activities associated with G1 and G2. In turn, the SMI mutation, which is very common in mouse cancer cells and human patients with cancer, codes for elevated expression of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) at the edge of the cell where LCFA acts against tumor inducing and suppressor molecules, (DeFlippe et al. 2011). To my knowledge, neither the T2 beta2-Toxin nor the Proteasome inhibitor need anti-aspirin mediation in order to produce lethal effects against tumor cells, including infiltrating tumor cells. However, the SMI mutation results in T2 beta2-Toxin coming in direct contact with intracellular tumor, so far anti-aspirin, anti-aspirin therapeutic strategies have not been effective against abdominal inflammatory diseases, although the therapy is valued by G-mutant tumor cells. T2 beta2-Toxin and Proteasome inhibitor, which are also very effective in killing liver cancer cells (Chelstrom et al. 2008), which does not create a barrier against anti-aspirin, anti-sugar or anti-aspirin agents in gut microflora. For further study I suggest the elimination of SMI mutation using gene therapies and studies in mice with induced KAN.<p>Mammalian Gut Microflora (Gneu), Tak T2 Beta2-Toxin, Proteasome inhibitor<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22124164">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov...</a><p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_105.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
