<br/><br/>Severe inflammatory encephal is a cancer caused by the Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria (top part of the screen shot). Image source: UCSF Department of Microbiology, Infection, and Evolution<p>Severe inflammatory encephal is a cancer caused by the Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteria. It is the only form of childhood cancer that is not caused by a germ, as far as researchers can determine.<p>Carolyn Evans, a nursing student, was diagnosed with acute leukaemia in 2003. According to her mom, she has been in remission since that time. However, she received an aggressive chemo treatment that resulted in extreme headaches. She was admitted to the hospital after an MRI revealed a large mass on her skull that was not healing.<p>After several surgeries, her brain was completely drained. Doctors discovered tumor in her left hemisphere and several other tumors in her brainstem, a rare diagnosis of some degree. The doctors managed to remove the tumor on the right side, but there was another mass that just ate away at her brain and skull. There were no other scans done because she had her sinuses filled with a tube that would not allow them to take a look. The doctors decided to perform surgery to remove the masses.<p>Finally, doctors saw the tumors as a sign of serious brain damage and a lack of oxygen, which resulted in large chunks of brain tissue she was deprived of oxygen and minerals. She was put on anti-anxiety medication, given a breathing tube to help her breathe while she was in the intensive care unit, and given one shot at a cancer treatment.<p>Twenty-one surgeries later, she is in complete remission. She has a series of skin lesion which is benign and not of any concern. This is in contrast to the 23 tumors she underwent earlier in her life. Evans has been hospitalized for the past two years, and has a catheter in her throat to help drain the “stinking black liquid” from her left ear.<p>Her mom explained that she wants people to know that they don’t know what they are dealing with as far as brain tumors go. She believes that her brain was poisoned because her tumor disappeared as a result of chemotherapy.<p>New Zealand doctors have just made an important discovery in this kind of case in which the tumor was not caused by a germ. Scientists identified C. dihydroplasma and identified it as the primary source of C. dihydroplasma, the cause of severe inflammatory encephal and another disease, C. amyloidosis. The body does not normally excrete dihydroplasma, and scientists say this type of tumor must have been first identified by natural serendipity of close contact between patients.<p>Enjoyed this article?
