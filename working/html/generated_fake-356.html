<br/><br/>Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer that usually starts in the skeletal muscle, usually in muscles of the mid-core of the body. The tumor has three main types–amyloidoidosis, in which the DNA mutation causes cell membrane fibrils to form, which migrate through the body and form myocardial atrophy; thrombotic growth syndrome, which causes the accumulation of intravascular thrombus and vitreous fluid in the brain; and rhabdomyosarcoma, where the tumor growth accelerates due to the accumulation of blood and white blood cells.<p>Rhabdomyosarcoma is typically a treatment option only for muscle-invasive cancers like haslewood sarcoma. However, the impact of this cancer can be diffused and widespread. In the study, the researchers found that proteins called SpidPro (Sp) transcription factors inhibit cell growth while providing for targeting. Sp brings together data from genes and the activity of polypeptides (K-clusters), proteins that are noncoding, and some information from next-generation sequencing. The researchers suggest that the data obtained through the use of Sp can be used to improve treatment of cancer and accelerate its research and development.<p>The authors report here that they have identified Sp that is involved in cell cycle control, such as the “progenitor” state of cells that are primed to become cancer. In the study, they show that the protein Spip is a multifunctional transcription factor whose effects are widespread and complex. They report that Sp is specifically expressed in myeloid cell-like tumor cells and that Sp is selectively inhibited by intracellular FGF-11, an inhibitor of differentiation, because it is “isocally specific,” and is expressed within the cell nucleus.<p>The high specificity of the spider lies in its protein-specific silencing. Since, unlike other proteins, Sp does not activate transcription factors in monoclonal growth factor targets, the proteins can be inhibitory in target cells, in cells other than the myeloid cell-like tumors, and not in other cells, such as bone marrow cells and rodent bladder cancer cells.<p>There are many reasons for differentiational silencing. In isolation, no single silencing protein can cause this type of cancer, because transformation is a common characteristic of different tumor types. Therefore, the authors believe that targeting Sp using inhibitors of silencing mechanisms could lead to improved therapeutic strategies, including improved targeting of myeloid cell-like tumor cells.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_356.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
