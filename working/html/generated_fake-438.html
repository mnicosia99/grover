<br/><br/>The Octa4A gene plays a crucial role in the metabolism of fungi, whereas this polymorphism – Novak4A (or Novak4A – in the present paper) has been identified in phosphorescent fungi pathogens such as Komanecka, Komanecka Anticus and Kataryncis to name a few. These polymorphisms of Novak4A (in humans and Fungi) are associated with a more progressive version of the enzyme process known as HOX4, and have been very well documented by etching proteins. This type of HOX4 enzyme degrades phytomolecules and is commonly identified as a key mediator in the cycle of signal transduction that leads to RNA interference (RNAi) in cells. This is for excellently explained below.<p>These polymorphisms in nematode species and fungi are supposed to be rare mutations, yet they are observed in viruses, bacteria and in E. coli.<p>We found evidence for octahc4A and Novak4A in vulva cells (where it has played a very important role in the reproduction of the bacterium Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that were collected from cultivated tulip plants and were destined to become flower petals. We replicated some of these findings in our group of domestic pigs and to really get a better understanding, we relied on their innate immune response. We have now also collected wild-type cases from a crayfish sample in the vicinity of the outbreak and very positive findings. Therefore, our hypothesis is that WEC virus and/or other background organism may be responsible for transmitting Octa4A and in the process damaging human immune cells and immune cells that produce antigens needed for a successful immune response against WEC virus. Therefore, our hypothesis is that Octa4A may very well trigger an immune reaction resulting in dendritic cells unable to mobilize the adequate immune response, which may in turn lead to a milder infection that may disappear soon and after the initial infection period, after which the WEC virus reappears to cause the serious complications associated with the disease. Novak4A and Octa4A may make WEC virus more infectious or in fact inversely increase WEC virus attraction to human cells when these mucosal epithelial cells are adapted to the WEC virus infection. This further implies that modified with a version of HOX4-derived HOX1, Novak4A may convert the potential potent virus-mediated neutrophils into weaker yet more inflammatory types of neutrophils, like eukaryotes, while Octa4A stands to benefit from this altered cell type.<p>About the author<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_438.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
