<br/><br/>Working together toward a common goal requires a lot of effort and is usually more than one person can do alone. Fortunately for us, Seaweed Musenulife International (SMIT), one of the largest seaweed producers in Japan and the world, has set up a collaborative work environment among its management, employees and customers. This cooperative effort has helped us to reach an achievement of the mass-supply of economically worth products that has today reached approximately 50 products.<p>It is estimated that Seaweed Musenulife products are sold to more than 3,000 customers in Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Southeast Asia, Russia, the United States and even the Caribbean. SMIT aims to produce one of its products for every customer at the start of each season by year end and then in growing season that same year even if it takes some time to produce the product at first.<p>Through an effective communication system and spreading the spirit of collaborative working in many different directions, the production, sales and marketing activities of SMIT have become more efficient and greatly broadened. The company actively participates in events related to seaweed, such as Okinawan and Okinawan-style food festivals, promotional events for the Nagano Prefecture convention and exhibition centers and dances that are made up of traditional Okinawan dances and those featuring greener Okinawan dances.<p>As a result of all the efforts, SMIT’s Usuki micro seaweed product has been sold on the shelves of major food stores in the fields of noodle, noodles, bean paste, soy sauce, tamago and seaweed in Japan for more than six years.<p>After careful research, Seaweed Musenulife and University of Tsukuba researchers have successfully identified several microorganism species that make Usuki micro seaweed rich in vitamins, nutrients and antioxidants. If using them properly, Seaweed Musenulife micro seaweed will have a high nutritional content, such as magnesium, calcium, copper, vitamins A, C, E, and folate as well as niacin, omega 3 fatty acids, vitamin B6, and a number of other minerals and complex carbohydrates.<p>In addition, the micro seaweed is full of fish proteins and cholesterol, protein and vitamin C. I believe that getting more people to consume Usuki micro seaweed will create a better atmosphere for the quality of life on Okinawa.<p>At the same time, the micro seaweed is green and will contribute greatly to the fight against “Seaweed Fatigue Syndrome” and the environment. In the proposed "MicroGrains" project, Seaweed Musenulife will be looking at distributing micro-seaweed products to greenhouses and colleges as well as high schools and university campuses in Okinawa, where the consumption of seaweed is very limited. Seaweed Musenulife’s micro-seaweed products will be sold to large and small shoppers to increase their purchases of seaweed, as well as improve the taste of seaweed.<p>For the growing seasons that will occur this year, the leading company suppliers of micro-seaweed in Okinawa and Uso each agreed to provide measurage production supplies of micro-seaweed and seaweed every January. These agreements resulted in the production and mass-supply of micro-seaweed products from Jan. 26 until March 31.<p>Japanese-style yaki gyoza made of measurage during Seaweed Musenulife’s micro-seaweed product sales promotion in my traditional garden in Okinawa with Daisuke Tamada, 68-year-old tofu maker, Hiroshima prefecture (Photo by Sumio Takahashi).<p>By: Taku Inokuchi<p>Photos: Daisuke Tamada<p>Hiroshima Prefecture<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_262.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
