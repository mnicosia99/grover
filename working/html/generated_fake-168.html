<br/><br/>Description of Toxicology and Characterization of Two Structurally Novel Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase2 Isozymes Responsible for the Enhanced Production of Stearate-Rich Storage Lipid in Candida tropicalisSY005<p>Causes of Aerobic Immersion<p>Scientists observed that Candida tropicalis and Candida species other than this one cause aerobic isolation or the organism becomes isolated from the surrounding waters. Animals exposed to the Candida species other than this one while undergoing DNA and RNA sequencing showed no evidence of Aerobic Immersion but the Candida species that caused Aerobic Immersion in the animal were shown to be resistant to lethal pathogens, non-pathogenic pest organisms or the infective agent. These animals were found to be resistant against organisms from 10 sample families and were not susceptible to the Aerobic Immersion which was manifested in the accumulation of a liquid mass in vitro.<p>Chemical Analyses<p>Samples were collected from implanted animals and isolated Vriens from oral surfaces and from a culture of Candida species that were linked to Aerobic Immersion. The cells were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with metal index ions and quantitative mass spectrometry. The fatty acid contents, pH, and membrane cell topology were analyzed with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_168.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
