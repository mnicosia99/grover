<br/><br/>According to the recent media coverage of the recent violation of food safety in some developed countries, it is generally confirmed that certain types of foods are prone to food-borne diseases, especially those foods that contain high sugar content and high fructose corn syrup. Generally, food poisoning usually occurs when we ingest food containing the bacteria, like bacteria that are commonly found in meats or vegetables or bacteria that we feed to our pets (like bacteria in milk, soft meat and red meat). Other food-borne diseases may result from eating foods that are too salty, grainy, or other products that cause the person to feel nauseous. It is important to eat foods containing very little sugar and that are fortified with micronutrients in order to prevent food poisoning.<p>Different types of foods have different safety recommendations. Dairy products generally have a safety recommendation of 5 gram/kg per day. Dairy products include milk, cream, cheese, and soft cheeses, and pasteurized milk is not safe to drink until it has been pasteurized. However, today, there are some products, which can consist of a lot of various types of foods, like barbeque sauce. Barbeque sauce is typically mixed with other types of ingredients (such as salt or spices). As far as the safety of this type of products is concerned, the US Food and Drug Administration has determined that there are no specific food safety recommendations for barbeque sauce except to avoid drinking food treated with ammonia. They also recommend limiting or avoiding the use of products that are potentially hazardous to the digestive system. In other words, the FDA requires that barbeque sauce at restaurants must not be used in raw food (which means that barbeque sauce can not be used in cooking with raw meat or poultry). In Japan, companies have recently started using refrigerated stearic acid (stove-top). The refrigerated stearic acid strew does not have an ammonia smell and is claimed to be safer than ammonia. This type of strew can be purchased from supermarketâ€™s shelves. It is packaged in sterile containers and is supposed to protect the food from contamination, but does not seem to taste different from similar barbeque sauces (certain people do not like it). Still, this is a helpful food safety measure. Unfortunately, nobody can tell for sure if barbeque sauce would be safe or not to eat right away. The same goes for chicken, another common type of food that contains a lot of sugar.<p>The US Food and Drug Administration recently announced that 1/3 of humans eat genetically modified foods. The safety of these types of foods has been thoroughly tested. FDA determined that genetically modified foods are no different from non-genetically modified foods and are as safe to eat as food that has been of traditional GMO plants (that have been eaten all along). This type of food is called glyphosate-tolerant, and it is the commonest type of GMO foods. This is also supposed to prevent food poisoning. Some environmentalists have stated that genetically modified food is better than traditional food and that this type of GMO food causes health problems. Yet, the studies are currently inconclusive as to whether GMO foods have a harmful effect. However, experts agree that GMO foods have many benefits as they have been eaten all along with traditional foods without any problems.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_352.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
