<br/><br/>Corporations (and politicians) use fancy words like “recovery” and “reversal” to describe environmental damage that is caused by ethanol, the main crop used for fuel, as we have seen when corn is deliberately planted to contain more of it than is wanted.<p>Why do we need all the corn? Why not use other crops? But that’s not what corn-based ethanol is designed to do. It is specifically designed to be very environmentally damaging. The patent and beauty of corn ethanol is that while it generates huge amounts of carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases, it emits less methane, which is a more powerful global warming agent than CO2. Therefore, it produces net economic benefits.<p>But why do we want to produce corn at all? In simple terms, because with ethanol, farmers have all the land they need for industrial purposes. Biofuels, such as ethanol, can, therefore, be better suited for cattle production than crop feeding. If we want to save land from being farmed for less value, we need to encourage the conversion of that land to industrial farming.<p>You may notice that almost all of the official statements about the high per capita greenhouse gas emissions from corn ethanol come from the corn sugar industry. While it is true that corn itself emits a large amount of greenhouse gases, that is only because it is highly energy intensive to grow and process. And that is also the case with sugar cane, the other main sugar component used for ethanol. The wasteful corn sugar industry ignores the fact that we can in fact replace corn in the food chain without losing any of the benefits. In fact, the amount of CO2 the corn industry would normally release into the atmosphere would be reduced by a greater amount than by sugar crops.<p>My interest in this subject is because I realized that there is an overwhelming body of evidence, some of it coming from the US Government’s Environmental Protection Agency, that suggests a close connection between corn usage as a basis for ethanol and increased levels of monosodium urate crystals in the water people drink. Monosodium urate crystals occur naturally as a reaction between free water and vitamin urate crystals. If monosodium urate crystals become higher in volume at higher pH levels, they may make it more difficult for your body to digest the monosodium glucose soluble food carbohydrates that are part of the standard meal, even if these carbs are removed from the liquid state. Rising levels of these crystals might also speed up cell signaling in the liver, which would have an increased effect on cell cycle regulation. The intense inflammation that may result from the increased urea concentrations from the higher urate crystals would increase the chances of chronic inflammation, both of which are known risk factors for heart disease.<p>There is also an associated phenomena, known as “fuel additive-induced macroevolution,” in which the mono-nutrient phosphorus-containing agricultural fertilizers used by the ethanol industry are so widely available and pervasive that more volatile elements – including “bituminous minerals” – infiltrate the soils. Later, when free fatty acids and energy-intensive forms of biomass like soy canola are added, the complex systems of nutrients available for gasoline production become increasingly integrated in the food chain. These multiple processes have been shown to create an even more complex dynamic in the water, causing the concentration of iron and calcium to fluctuate, leading to diseases like scurvy.<p>Photo: Black oil field<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_236.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
