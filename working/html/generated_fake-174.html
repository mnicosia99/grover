<br/><br/>This study was based on a preclinical model model of blood cell-derived fibroblast ulcerative keratitis (aka ice-melting syndrome) and a hiatal hernia. Both of these diseases form due to the self expression of transcription factors that go on to signal several important pathways throughout the body.<p>DKK (phenylethylamine) is an interleukin 1 receptor modulator which makes it a very efficient switchboard for the many signaling pathways (acromion cancer, osteoporosis, lymphedema, HSV A, H1N1 viruses etc) that the DKK receptor 2 inhibits. These signaling pathways are also in play, for example, in bone rejection and ankylosing spondylitis, both of which DKK receptor 2 is not present in. These T2/DKK receptor 2 bind respectively to seven transcription factors that could facilitate the expression of protein variants in the FIBHESIA model. Because of this, it is hypothesized that bone morphogenetic protein-associated protein 2 (BMP-2) could not express after contact with DKK receptor 2. To investigate this hypothesis, the paper takes the candidate DKK receptor 2 candidate and reduces its abundance to half of its natural levels, reducing the receptor 2 binding power. Such expression effects could be seen in bone lesions in mice lacking DKK receptor 2. After manipulating the presence of DKK receptor 2 in hiatal hernias, the test results showed increased expression of BMP-2 in hernia tissue. This establishes the core of the original, but important hypothesis.<p>Below, see the page of the paper that describes some of the key findings of the study:<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_174.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
