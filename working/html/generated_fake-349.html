<br/><br/>Eight patients had been treated at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) from 18 April, 2010 to 22 January, 2011 for Hemoptysis. They were given intravenous immunosuppressant hormones to prevent viral attacks as part of a clinical trial. The immunosuppressant substances were then replaced by a Zika virus vaccine – injected into a patient’s arm - after a one month wait.<p>The eight patients recovered or showed dramatic signs of improvement after the treatment, and were released.<p>In three of the patients who received treatment from SGH, their hemoptysis did not return to normal soon after they completed the treatment.<p>“It was suspected that they had continued to have an infection and reactivated the Hemoptysis,” explained Kwok-yung Yuen, a senior consultant at SGH.<p>The three patients, described by their treating doctors as being “out of control” with a fever, lethargy and lethargy, all continued to have fever and lethargy for at least six months after receiving treatment.<p>In September 2010, one of the three patients was taken back to SGH from New York on a non-emergency basis. He was diagnosed with contract gay Paretia 3A, a viral infection transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito.<p>The next month, a fourth patient who was also infected with Zika virus tested positive for Zika. He was also treated for Hemoptysis and diagnosed with Zika. He is now on antiretroviral therapy.<p>“What has occurred is that, after treatment of Hemoptysis, the virus itself has acquired latent protein in some patients and caused a local reactivation of the virus,” said Yuen.<p>Yuen’s team is now conducting a study to develop a Zika vaccine or anti-viral medicine that will effectively prevent reactivation of the virus in dormant in a patient. The results are expected in mid-2012.<p>The trial is part of a South-east Asian (SEA) project to identify possible Zika virus-associated secondary infections. It involves five countries in Southeast Asia – Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam and Singapore – and 16 hospitals.<p>It also provides an opportunity to confirm the role of Hemoptysis in the initial act of Zika virus infection in a patient.<p>“We can currently rule out conjunctivitis and malaria infection at initial blood samples and blood cultures. There is also no doubt about those infections following the Hemoptysis treatment,” said Yuen.<p>After receiving treatment for Hemoptysis, it is also possible for some patients to show fever within two weeks. The team will conduct post-treatment blood tests on some of the patients, and follow-up blood cultures, for confirmation.<p>“This study may provide vital evidence on its efficacy,” said Yuen.<p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) may fund the study.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_349.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
