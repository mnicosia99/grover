<br/><br/>Well, this is a big problem. People tend to eat more sugar and less fiber compared to those of us who eat it rationally. The bulk of the UPR is in this direction.<p>I am not sure how I compare, but I don’t really love the following concept that “supplements are the new GMOs.” And “other countries” are eating much more sugar and less fiber than we are. I am afraid that people here eat less fiber and sugar compared to those of us who eat it rationally.<p>But the cause of our problem is really simple: We eat food with too much sugar and less fiber than the one provided by the foods themselves. To avoid that or in other words “limit the sweets” would make no sense as there isn’t much difference. It seems more natural to eat processed food like sugary juices and cereals instead of real food. In that case, there is no real point in keeping your sugar intake below 17g per day and your fiber intake higher than 20g. So it will probably be soon possible to divide the difference between the one you eat naturally and the one you eat by the control substance controlled by modern technology. This will be called “UPR” or “fast food”, with low sugar and high fiber consumption. Also, this is what has been asked by the Japanese government for their dietary guideline, which is very much a mistake. It is naturally a good idea for children and small children, since there are few nutrients in the natural food, since children don’t enjoy eating sugars and since the dietary guidelines mean that the child wouldn’t have a lot of protein and fat, because some of those substances will be a loss to the child’s body.<p>But I am afraid that in the future, especially in the United States, the UPR dietary guidelines will actually be used to boost sales of fast food restaurants. Many consumers of this fast food will eat foods that are given for health reasons for less and less calories and even less and less fiber. I am sorry about that because we Japanese should really think about the goal of teaching our children to live at one unit, with equal amount of calories and energy so they can be sensibly active rather than wasting time playing or watching television. But even with the UPR, I am afraid that Japanese children might play more using snacks or exercising less. So the UPR will disappoint many people. And in the future, to pass on the knowledge about UPR to our children, the consumption of soft drinks and sugary juices will be allowed with reduced prices to encourage children to consume them. It’s a lose/lose situation in which the young generation may fall short of a healthy life.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_81.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
