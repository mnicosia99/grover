<br/><br/>Oncogene selective transcription factors as cancer inhibitors<p>Inhibiting Sp is a mechanism used to suppress tumor growth as well as arrest cancer cell spread. Research to boost Sp de-regulates the tumor, inhibits abnormal cell growth in the primary tumor and lowers blood cancer levels. Chronic sp-related syndromes prevent therapeutic benefit in patients with prostate cancer, and ClI is the therapy employed to decrease metastatic spread in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and in patients with breast, endometrial, colorectal, ovarian, prostate, and malignant plasmacytoid sarcoma (MPS) diseases. To examine the effect of Sp inhibition on SEVM, we demonstrate that Sp-based DNA silencing decreases telomerase activity when compared to DNA amplification. Sp inhibition can also help tumors spread to the lungs. In this study, we elucidate the induction of bony density in the spine with Sp treatment. Our data also reveal that tumor SP levels are up to three times greater in patients who develop compressive spasms than patients who do not develop compressive spasms, which suggests an increased susceptibility to SP-mediated apoptosis. Sp-related diseases are difficult to treat and difficult to treat well because of their frequent side effects. Advances such as SP and SP-stimulated diversity in the tumor and tumor spread to the lungs make therapeutic intervention much easier. Enzymes such as Sp depend on expression of other genes and also hyperexpression of other genes. If SP is targeted by inhibition of other transcription factors, we will be able to enhance SPâ€™s impact in other situations. Our findings have potential application in the diagnostic tools developed in SP disorders, such as PS-based imaging, novel drugs for SP, and gene therapy.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_56.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
