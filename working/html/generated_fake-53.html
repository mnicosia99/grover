<br/><br/>Protest reads a conflict between the atmosphere and the earth can be seen when reading the Emission Rate compared to the Earth. Is there are really no limits to the damage chemicals can do to the earth’s protective atmosphere.<p>This Friday, a variety of anti-nuclear groups nationwide are urging people to respond to experiments at the “Low Enriched Uranium Reactor” or “LEUR” nuclear plant located in Sendai, one of Japan’s “mid-sized cities.” There will be demonstrations in the Tokyo metropolitan area in protest. At 8:30 a.m. in Tokyo and in Yokohama, based on an agreement made in October, anti-nuclear activists would gather at the Sendai LEUR’s property, where the nuclear research is being conducted. Under the direction of the Party for Nuclear Defense, the anti-nuclear activists will carry a sign reading, “Strife in the air ends in contamination on the earth.” That opposition in the air is the source of the clashes in the fields that cause severe air pollution to the city. More information about Friday’s activities can be found here.<p>One of the reasons a lot of people have trouble understanding this disagreement is that you don’t see blood on the street. If you test it scientifically, they can’t show that with your naked eye. It is impossible. So people are wrong in reading this conflict.<p>That’s why the response from the LEUR is just as important. I’ve never heard of test facilities where everything they have gone through would last up to 4 generations. The LEUR is probably a very elaborate and safe experiment facility. Therefore people have to wait for their information from there.<p>Instead of protesting with signs or demonstrations, we should do more to bring people together. In that way, we will be strong enough to change people’s views.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_53.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
