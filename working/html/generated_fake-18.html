<br/><br/>(New York, USA) Using the latest technology and practical insight, several researchers, including one from Harvard University, have discovered that the polyphenols derived from agricultural wastes and produced by the use of ethanol are very effective at reducing blood mononucleosis, a disease known as MUC-1. The study was supported by the Government of Japan and the Tokyo Regional Health and Welfare Agency and was published in the October 2011 issue of Nature.<p>One of the most important findings related to this application is that monosodium urate crystals, the main source of MUC-1 in the body, increase in concentration in the blood immediately after consumption of alcoholic beverages made with alcohol containing ethanol. By using pesticides, crackers and vegetable oil, farmers are currently able to prevent the proliferation of MUC-1 in the urine.<p>Phenolics produced by the use of ethanol for beer, wine, soap and flour have been adopted as a substitute for antiseptic agents. With this thesis and direction, Prof. Masamichi Takahashi, from the Department of Bio-technological Research at Keio University, wanted to define the side effects that might be encountered if antiseptic agents (which are primarily derived from tapioca – Madura tapioca) used in health-care and cosmetics are contaminated with ethanol.<p>“This anti-inflammatory effect has been established from many studies, however it is still not known how ethanol is produced by potash, ferric aluminum oxide and aluminum silicate substances, which are largely used by food-and-beverage industries,” explains Takahashi.<p>Using cells and an experimental simile model, Takahashi and his associates discovered that low levels of polyphenol in blood vesicles can activate endogenous processes that inhibit inflammation, such as an inflammatory process called Polyetheliparatosis (PHD) induced by exposure to MUC-1.<p>“The polyphenols help the body to fend off the MUC-1. In addition, they play a role in scarring,” concludes Takahashi.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_18.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
