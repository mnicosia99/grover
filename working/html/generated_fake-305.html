<br/><br/>The following study was conducted in total on 47 patients with bacterial colitis and isolated Klebsiella pneumoniae infections in the western region of Colombia, 2006-2008.<p>The organism Characterization in Acute Liver and Kidney Disease was conducted on 2 of these patients.<p>The isolates were purified from bowel fluids and histopathological tissue. Thirteen of these isolates were associated with colitis. 23 S-K (intermediate- and high-grade) Klebsiella pneumoniae cultures were performed on 14 isolates. Noted positive cause of colonization by C. pneumoniae was O-28 and Gip-Oxuillus. The bacterium contained a cumulative number of genetic codons of over 78 (Figure 1, e). The overall disease characteristics evaluated in the isolation study were culture and clinical characteristics.<p>Of these 13 isolates, five were identified as Bacillus, and one as Klebsiella (Figure 2, e). Of these 10 fecal culture samples, 5 found positive human DNA while one did not (Figure 3, e). Efficacy of product was mainly indirect and based on two clinical studies (Figure 4, e)1 For example, the correlation between Klebsiella laboratory cultures and operative mortality and the toxicity profile of the patient (Figure 5, e).<p>Table of Contents<p>Collaborator Groups for this Study<p>The other collaborators were Hernandez et al of Duke (North Carolina), Das et al of Harvard (Boston, Massachusetts), and Esteveus et al of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam (Netherlands).<p>This study was supported in part by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, BioMed Central, the National Developmental Area, Colombia Department of Health (Dept. of Communicable Diseases), and the National Institute of Healthy Life Sciences.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_305.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
