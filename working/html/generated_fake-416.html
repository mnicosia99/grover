<br/><br/>A new study examines the effects of Monosodium Urate crystals in human milk against genetically-modified plant-based inactivation that prohibits the production of a byproduct of fermentation.<p>Shio-and Hakui University Physiology and Nutritional Science student, Sumio Takahashi along with his colleagues observed an unequivocal correlation between higher vitamin D concentrations and higher concentrations of monosodium urate (U4) in human milk. Previously, the fact was only suggested in animal-based experiments that did not take account of all factors that contribute to milk toxicity. Data in this study were obtained from women with pre-diabetes, diabetes, and from mothers who gave birth during a heat wave in Honshu. During the application of lactose-digesting enzyme Isoflavones to the maternal breast milk of individuals on the Japanese National Diet Stock Normal Diet (DKMS), the incidence of extra acidosis was four times higher than those of individuals on the DKMS and, as expected, vitamin D2 and U4 concentrations were also higher in the special milk.<p>These findings showed that much of the excess in VU4 concentration was to do with an accumulation of the anionic substance from genetically-modified insects against the bugsâ€™ antitumor anti-tumor activity. The published study may inform the development of effective human cancer treatment with environmentally-friendly plants.<p>This article is published in the leading monthly journal Nucleus.<p><a href="http://www.news.netinc.co.jp/edNews/c9244966.html">http://www.news.netinc.co.j...</a><p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_416.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
