<br/><br/>Global Health Network of Innovation (CHW) recently published its strategy paper, “Choosing a Targeted Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine for colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer resects”. This report is an initiative of The Evolution Institute of Medical Science (EIMS) in collaboration with Koyuki Seiki Inc., NY Drug Company, and Ihab Sato at TOS JCI College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.<p>Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and fastest growing cancers in Japan. In 2004, approximately 1,450,000 Japanese received an initial diagnosis and some 35,460 deaths resulted from the disease. Every year, a further about 70,000 die from colorectal cancer and the prevalence rate has increased by about 30% in the past 10 years. The chart below shows colorectal cancer incidence and death rates in Japan.<p>Although it is the most common cancer among Japanese males (21%), colorectal cancer is less common among females (7%). Of the 70,000-100,000 fatal cases annually, the majority are of non-Hispanic white women (37%) and non-Hispanic black men (20%). Cancer incidence and mortality rates continue to increase among this subgroup.<p>Subpopulations associated with increased mortality from colorectal cancer tend to be those with a history of alcohol or tobacco use, acute/delayed radiation, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, or polyps in the colon. However, colorectal cancer is also a common cancer among younger individuals with an average age of diagnosis being around 50 and a median age of death being below 70. COLADIC AVOCADO CULTURE<p>Subpopulations associated with higher survival of colorectal cancer include:<p>Obese individuals (30%)<p>Young Asian males (25%)<p>Manure digesters (20%)<p>Overeating (7%)<p>The prevalence of colorectal cancer among men and women with Hispanic-American ethnicity is quite low (16.3% and 2.4% respectively), which is mainly explained by a lack of consistency and lack of awareness of the disease among Hispanic patients, especially when it comes to detection. IOBODY’S BUSINESS?<p>Colorectal cancer is an underdiagnosed disease (45-80%). Among all cancer patients, the proportion with colorectal cancer is about half. A subpopulation of colorectal cancer patients, known as colorectal cancer resector-initiated patients (CRICs), is an undiagnosed subpopulation of colorectal cancer patients. These patients usually present in their 50s, and are mainly diagnosed late (8-10 years after their original diagnoses), and require extensive secondary or tertiary surgical procedures. The resultant treatment is complex and multi-disciplinary.<p>HEALTH CARITY; PARTLY CAUSED BY CIGARETTE BURNS (INCORPORATING GRASP)<p>Colorectal cancer is the main cause of morbidity and mortality among patients who smoke and who develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These associations are apparent for men and women, and as such represent an important unmet need. Several attempts have been made to develop compounds that can inhibit the action of nicotine receptors in the liver.<p>We will focus on nicotine receptors in the intestine and the possibility of developing a target-specific therapeutic vaccine. More information will be published in the future.<p>EDITORIAL NOTE: Part of this research was funded by the Ehisami Foundation<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_121.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
