<br/><br/>Biophysical, new studies that define and translate the biophysical properties of a system or structure that can play a role in disease or immunity have received wide media coverage and offers the possibility to identify new pathways for disease control or clinical use. These researchers are mainly studying proteins as having direct effects on various biological processes such as cell growth, cytokines, inflammation, blood clotting, wound healing and more.<p>Using computationally power and dynamic modeling techniques, researchers examine the underlying information, including mechanisms, and find how it is acting on the biophysical system in order to be able to develop solutions that may better manage/guide various scenarios, such as inducing increased immune response in fighting infections, dampening inflammation, or improving cell survival. This study on the protein TP53 has been used in both knowledge generation and new diagnostic methods of enhancing patient reaction, early detection of rare diseases and mitigating disease progression (in patients with mcr-1 in pancreatic cancer).<p>In the article titled “TP53 “expansion protein” and immunity, biophysical, data analyses” (with PhD student Ziad Abdelrahman as the co-first author) researchers Yoana Domalaog and Zeina Dakroub and Ola El Zein and Sawsan Ibrahim Kreydiyyeh performed a range of assays that evaluated the quantitatively based TMAT proteins and other proteins that either bind and release the TP53 expansion protein, or generate similar proteins. This resulted in the publication of 3 research articles on the new EPHB protein, with different assays and findings, published in Environmental Molecular Biology, The American Journal of Biological Chemistry, and Journal of Nuclear Materials and Structural Biology.<p>TP53 Expanded (TP53E)<p>Using 10 Siltified Droplet (SMD) assays, TPHP-3E was added as a matched intermediary to assess the direct or non-interference effect of different analyses of TP53 E. On this instrument, TPHP-3E was found to bind TP53E and play an indirect interference role by allowing TP53E to diffuse throughout the exoskeleton of cells in exposure to immunosuppressive agents. These data were also used as baseline parameters to extract different molecular properties of the TMAT proteins and TMAT E. Pairs of MMI and MMI 2P tetrachloride-mediated excitation was shown to be similar to that of pertrotomycin for inhibition of interleukin 9. Pairs of gene TP53 and TP53E were found to have similar nanoparticle excitation and negative reactive potential. TP53 E which replaced the original TP53 protein found on TPHP-3E was found to function as a target for the TP53 expansion protein found on TP53E when programmed to release TPHP-3E. However, because the expansion protein on TP53E was found to be broadly homologous with the expansion protein on TP53E, it was found that the binding of TP53E was minimized to allow TP53E proteins to escape the interfering sequence. Pairs of transfer RNAs (TNT) were found to be associated with the infiltration of the expansion protein on MPH2 and MPH3 in a genetic mouse model. However, no trace of the expansion protein on other MPH proteins was found.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_379.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
