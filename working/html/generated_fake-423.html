<br/><br/>If I was on creams or creams that contain lead, would I want them near my young children?<p>In ancient times herbal medicine wasn’t so transparent and there are plenty of herbs and preparations that claim to be safe, but they often contain harmful substances. Usually this can be easily verified by testing the drug but herbal medicines use a variety of methods to cover their tracks.<p>For instance, Okinawa in Japan has a number of traditional medicine stores that claim to sell natural remedies based on health and drug testing. However, there is no such testing facility, no certification of safety or efficacy for these medications.<p>Often these costly products, not labeled and purchased for their cosmetic and aromatic qualities, are so light in weight that it is impossible to tell if the ingredients will cause harm to human health. Some of these products may even be tainted with cancer causing heavy metals.<p>In 1987, the Japanese Health Ministry decided to add natural remedies to the list of class of “unregulated” drugs. This decision was backed by the European Union, but the U.S. did not join the decision and that has prevented the entry of these remedies in Europe and North America.<p>Instead, the FDA is required to conduct review of them to determine their safety, but that’s a long way from ensuring that these products are not harmful to consumers.<p>I want to know what method you use to approve the safety or efficacy of these herbal teas and preparations. How do you find out about these?<p>I know that it’s impossible to talk to people who actually use these foods, but do you have any information on what method you use?<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_423.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
