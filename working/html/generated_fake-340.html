<br/><br/>Following are extracts from the Letter of the Dutch Expert Panel (NISER Institute) to The Minister of Education and Science and to the Director of the Dutch Cancer Foundation.<p>The Netherlands<p>In mid-December 2011, NISER, one of Europe’s leading cancer research institutes and providers of basic and clinical cancer research, has published its Review of New Cancer Research Fields led by researchers from The NISER Institute and NISERO University-College Medical Center in Nijmegen. As part of the study, NISER led an expert panel of 13 Dutch cancer researchers. All of the review’s findings on topics including "New Molecular Targets, Therapeutic Targets and Stem Cells" and "New Cancer Therapeutic Targets" were released today (December 22, 2011).<p>The Recommendations to the University-College Medical Center and NISERO were published in order to build closer links between the Institute and the University of Nijmegen. Those two institutions are considered as two of the leading research and clinical cancer hospitals in the Netherlands.<p>The review of new cancer research fields has, among other important findings,:<p>Published for the first time results from the pioneering work by researchers at The NISER Institute on new cancer therapeutic targets by Dr. Alistair Durlacher. Durlacher leads the Institute’s two groups for various cancer research topics, where Dr. Dominic Lammonde is Professor of Biochemistry.<p>Defined for the first time known molecular and biologic targets for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer based on stem cells. Those targets were presented by research teams at The NISER Institute and NISERO University-College Medical Center.<p>Published for the first time, objective data from a national cohort of cancer patients diagnosed between 1990 and 1999 that demonstrated the unique but within reach research potential of stem cells. Researchers shared clinical data from a cohort at The University of Rotterdam, known as the Dr. Meppel Institute, which comprises patients with advanced solid tumors.<p>Published for the first time (first experimental proposal ever submitted to NISER) a plan for conducting an observational study of 57 age-matched patients to treat a common type of lung cancer that does not respond to other treatments. The study will investigate not only the effect of DNA-blocking medicines, but also, as part of the study, of the bioactive protective factors found in the patient samples.<p>Finally, published for the first time the Dutch equivalent of a recommendation for the Clinical Use of Molecular and Biologic Targeted Stem Cells in the clinical care of cancer patients in order to prevent some types of acute leukemia. This would require a revision of the current clinical guidelines for treating acute myeloid leukemia.<p>As a group of experts well-known to the Dutch audience, the lead authors and reviewers of this study conducted an exhaustive review of new cancer research topics and then made recommendations based on their expert judgement and scientific discussions. This is the second time in the past decade that a review of research on new cancer research topics is under way in the Netherlands. For the first time ever, a bilateral panel of 13 Dutch experts has determined the main findings from their peer review of new cancer research topics. A team of eight experts chaired the expert panel at The NISER Institute and a team of seven experts chaired the expert panel at The University of Nijmegen.<p>Dr. Pierre Rijland, Director of The NISER Institute is pleased to receive letters of support for the open communication of scientific information on exciting new cancer research topics to stakeholders in the Netherlands as well as to the international community.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_340.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
