<br/><br/>CD4 and B-Calmette-Guerin<p>F**k Espanol!<p>That’s the caption of a comic about the nasty fever transmitted through food and water, which is said to be contracted by pigs in Germany.<p>Hey, it can be for all that matters!<p>In German, the abbreviation CD is pronounced codyls.<p>In Spanish, the abbreviation B-Cal is pronounced bickles.<p>The comedian, Golmon, found it funny and so the Spanish version went viral on the Internet. Spanish language users are way ahead of us in their language habits and vocabulary.<p>The original cartoon carries just one line of jokes. Which, I am sure, is written very close to how it is in Spanish, as it is in almost every other language, even if it is lost on English speakers.<p>The word “C4”, as in homologous to endorphin, is an abbreviation in Spanish for sex hormone and, once it is present in the body, C4 causes performance and energy enhancement.<p>By causing this, C4 invites sexual relationships, and it is said to bring on sexual performance. It is also thought that as soon as there is C4 in the blood, the emotions are released.<p>And with the release of these emotions, the promiscuity can begin.<p>This, I am sure, is what the Spanish have felt during the Christmas period!<p>Barbara R.
