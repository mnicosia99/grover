Rajan and Sanjay Batra (New York: Public Affairs, August 2011) to Dr K O Rajan and Dr T L Raman (Reviewed 2007, BMC Biochemistry – doi:10.1136/bbbi.546077), DOI:10.1136/bbbi.546077, published online Nov. 30, 2007: 1-43, articles concluded that Neutrophils, neutrophil cells that play an important role in immune response, were recruited rapidly to protect against B7.7/B12 and other Escherichia coli strains by the reverse transcription factor NOD2. The authors suggest that by boosting NOD2, increased NF2 expression and blocking NOD2 signalling function could also develop new approaches to prevent infection by Bacterial E. coli.
