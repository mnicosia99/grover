<br/><br/>Almost half of Japanese people over 65 years old drink alcohol, as do about half of those aged 35 to 74, but this increases the risk of heart attack as this substance can damage the heart, claims a new study.<p>The recent study by three groups of researchers at the Japan Medical University shows that half of men who drink alcohol almost exactly as much as the data define “most aggressive users” have a twofold increased risk of heart attack and stroke than those with drinking levels measured at the mild end of the scale.<p>The same goes for women, the study indicated.<p>The researchers argue that the purpose of limits in drinking for older adults is to avoid excessive drinking and the resulting risk for heart attack, stroke, breast cancer and osteoporosis. This is due to the risk factor that risk for such diseases increases with frequency of alcohol use.<p>Japan alcohol drinking is probably the greatest in the world. According to an exception, alcohol consumption in the country is falling, but not as fast as in many other nations. Some measures have been taken to limit alcohol, including banning sales of high-alcohol spirits and the introduction of steep excise taxes.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_450.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
