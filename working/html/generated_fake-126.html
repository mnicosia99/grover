<br/><br/>Worldwide diseases such as arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular diseases are associated with many factors such as poverty, diet, use of alcohol and cigarette smoking. However, ethanol-related low levels of monosodium urate crystal (known as urate crystals) has been shown to induce atherosclerosis (hardening of arteries) and raised blood pressure in the absence of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This study on induced inflammation using studies of different hemodynamic parameters such as electrocardiograms and serum testosterone, suggests that, by increasing oxidative stress in atherosclerotic tissues, increasing urate crystals-induced inflammation may be a contributing factor to the development of cardiovascular diseases.<p>“We conclude that oxidative stress which may arise from ethanol induced urate crystals-induced inflammation is a key factor contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis, and that in this manner, adipokines may independently act as part of the inflammatory syndrome associated with multiple conditions.” – from the Japanese Journal of Cardiology.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_126.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
