<br/><br/>I’ve had a few grown-up skin issues including eczema in my skin. I’ve been experiencing them since puberty, often as well as as a baby-mama. Generally, the eczema (which has its roots in chemicals within my own body) and psoriasis (which affects most of my body because of irritation from any zinc chloride in my body), are really bad, and I’ve tried various creams, creams, and powders that contained zinc chloride. (I also have to be careful, as I am lactose intolerant, and can’t consume milk products containing even negligible levels of zinc).<p>This particular acne has been with me for long and was very bad for a long time but has been getting better. Well, though I’ve heard some things about zinc, it’s still bad for an eczema and is sometimes used to treat acne. But again, I’ve also heard that there are certain radiation-based products, like counters, that are also not good for my skin. If you have eczema or psoriasis and you get zinc chloride’s bi-targeted rainproduct or an antibody that binds to zinc chloride, these products can sometimes react with the skin, and the zinc chloride can cause an immune response (hypersensitivity) against me and my skin.<p>In the past I’ve read about a way to banish or protect me from certain kinds of environmental compounds, like pesticides, indoor plumbing, chemical disinfectants, and these “chemicals” were even found to be in some drinks (like Gatorade). But I’ve also read that the end product of these products’ exposure to water impurities or those living around my house/office was bad for me, in that the cumulative effects of my carrying these compounds in my body and water supply have led to my eczema and psoriasis, and that you can actually protect my skin from these compounds by getting rid of the water impurities (leaking pipes and leaky systems).<p>So I’ve been thinking how I can avoid getting exposure to these compounds and what can I do about it. Anyway, when researching this topic, I heard an interesting study performed by the University of Waterloo.<p>In this study, they did an experiment in which they discovered an opportunity to make water (coral) by destroying the zinc present in drinking water, in order to see whether the effectiveness of the water would increase if not all those dissolved materials were there, but just some of them.<p>It is suggested by researchers and eczema/skin experts that a high concentration of bacteria must be in water for it to be hygienic and good for skin health, and a high concentration of a particular species of bacteria that is found in esthetic products like lotions or nail polish, or other compounds can contaminate water and cause many unwanted environmental changes and complications on the skin and body, thus leading to skin irritation and other skin health issues.<p>However, some investigators are hesitant to include these kinds of bacteria in solutions, thinking of their complete contamination and complete compromise to water safety. This can lead to damage to the water by the bacteria, and it may be difficult for bacteria to get out of the solution so that no water impurities are released into the water.<p>For those who have problems with skin damage caused by additional bacterial types of impurities, this can also happen through exposure to UV light, chemicals or toxins, and certain ions or chemical compounds (such as formaldehyde).<p>So it looks like a way to naturally protect skin from damage caused by specific organic compounds to zinc chloride, etc, is best not to ingest those compounds but in using an anti-bacterial product (protective formula) such as a nail polish, lotion, or yogurt. The chemical solution of the anti-bacterial solution is a healthier choice than the fully healthy alternative if you are safe with it.<p>However, this also helps one recognize various pollutants on their skin, from UV light to chemical compounds found in surfaces or water and often end up in allergies or eczema.<p>And if there is no photostability of such end products, or if you are allergic to zinc chloride, the solution will only have to be processed and cleaned thoroughly (while its antioxidant and cleansing properties are available).<p>So, taking care of my skin is important, especially with my worsening acne, but above all protecting myself from very close skin exposure to pollution, chemicals and toxic compounds like nanoparticles and other end products.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_99.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
