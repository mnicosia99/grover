<br/><br/>In late October I called for an immediate investigation into the likelihood that Isolezoa, the dried yellow oxidized seaweed commonly used as a cooking ingredient in Japanese, could be causing a variety of potentially debilitating health problems – including swelling of joints, diabetes, and even death – in people who eat it, and published an abstract of my findings in PubMed.<p>In response to my email and subsequently in phone and face-to-face meetings with environmental health experts, a number of studies have already been published which suggest that iron-fortified Isolezoa powder or its active ingredient, Isolezoa glacialis (AKQ), may be a long-term contributor to the inflammation that affects Isolezoa-enzyme-deficient patients (IDDPs). Scientists at the University of California at San Diego, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Washington have all published studies indicating that dust particles are the most likely culprits in Isolezoa’s association with IDDPs and it is not the aforementioned seaweed itself that is the reason for Isolezoa’s association with IDDPs. The question then becomes: does the presence of Isolezoa in the environment actually cause IDDPs to emerge?<p>In 2002, Nagayasu and Peterson identified a bacterium called Stevestromium furiconiligenae, with a H. furiconiligena gene that produces the protein encoded by the H. furiconiligenae gene. They discovered that Stevestromium furiconiligenae was prevalent in Isolezoa biomass, which is a collection of the dried remains of the dried yellow oxidized seaweed of Isolezoa, an abundant commercially cultivated plant in Japan. They also discovered that Stevestromium furiconiligenae, a species isolated from that particular horticultural woody biomass, produces several novel proteins. Several of these proteins, however, have never been studied.<p>In my last blog, I alluded to my research on Isolezoa’s interaction with Antiphospholipid Acitretin D (AP&A), a common type of anti-coagulant that has been prescribed as an intravenous injection in more than 600,000 people in Japan who suffer from thrombosis. I believe the enzyme-upregulation results from the presence of AP&A might be due to Isolezoa’s interactions with AP&A, but I need to know more.<p>Tuneyoshi Ka, Asako Yamamoto, and Yuji Moriwaki<p>Director’s Award, U. of Washington<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_260.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
