<br/><br/>These are the highlights of the paper with abstracts following the text of the article here. (Thanks to Chirag Munupi for providing some photos of the lab).<p>Chikka is the first author of the study and this posting is the first to contain the full text of the paper. Please be aware of the somewhat complex charts used in the article. Very detailed!<p>Further considerations<p>When a repressor gene is expressed in human cells with specific designated patterns, it is possible to identify high-affinity proteins that are important for repressing these genes. Sp transcripts (for example, Spdk3) are known to cause gene expression in human germ cells, and therefore are likely to be highly important for the expression of repressed genes. However, this pattern of transcription, referred to as Sp-splicency, is often not discovered by conventional methods, so scientists have used technology such as Synthetic Biology to identify proteins involved in regulating Sp-splicency. In this study, proteins used in Synthetic Biology have been introduced in human cells in order to study the specific effects of the Sp transcripts on the cancer cells.<p>Interestingly, this approach identified a gene that has been discovered in the past but is not associated with cancer, namely the Sp-spenser-b-sk muscle myosin-coa-guilla-equingens (sp) transcription factor/secretory protein. Its effect is quite similar to a wound site: In mice, overexpression of the gene causes a broad range of abnormal cell changes, including shortened nucleic acid (DNA) and protein scaffolding. Additionally, this gene induces necrosis and activation of the tumor microenvironment. In a preclinical model of rhabdomyosarcoma, the gene was targeted for silencing by Incyte’s rhepcept therapy, and severe dysfunction of the rhabdomyosarcoma was observed. These results demonstrate that Dr. Bhutani’s collaborative approach to achieving clinical relevance with discovery technologies will be of interest to researchers across the field.<p>Previously published results<p>Source citation:<p>Chikka G, Radhakrishnan S, Sasikumar S, Akhil CM, Elahi KA, Moonhalapasetty R, Sudhir H, Chang P, Chew JK, Munupi C, Ekhil L.
