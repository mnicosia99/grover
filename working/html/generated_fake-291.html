<br/><br/>Summary<p>Most of my research so far has been on aspect of malaria, especially its genotypetic mutation, and on contribution of parasite nuclei to susceptibility of individuals. Our purpose is to determine the structure and function of RNA polymerase genes and, in particular, to discover the markers in the gene itself that are responsible for affected organismâ€™s immunity to this infectious disease.<p>Reference<p>1.
