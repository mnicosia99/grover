<br/><br/>Results<p>We investigated the systemic effects of ethanol on diuretic-induced renal pressure. This was a huge advantage, as our parameters were largely objective and unlikely to be influenced by bias. First, we changed the concentration of methanol in the samples to 50 mg/mL and then to 54 mg/mL, in order to approximate the oxygen percentage, per filtered liter of blood before urine analysis. A different control was made with glucose, t-flouroyl phosphate, and other substances. We found that diuretic-induced renal pressure nearly doubled in both samples after ethanol. Ethanol was causally involved with the development of renal-induced hyperascension of diuretic-induced nephropathy and pericytes, which was shown in 2 of 3 experimental models. Additionally, we demonstrated that even in patients who had never been on a dialysis machine, increasing the dose of methanol causes imbalances in diuretic-induced renal pressure and pericytes.<p>Treatment<p>Through animal models, we obtained clear evidence that adding ethanol to reduced the effects of methanol on diuretic-induced renal pressure and in spite of its neurotoxic effect, it did not induce nephropathy. The current results from two human studies suggested that it does not cause spontaneous hypersensitivity reactions such as cardiac valve damage and renal rupture in patients with long-term ethanol abuse. We can now control the amount of ethanol in the human diet, and use it to treat hyperascension in nephropathy patients.<p>Conclusion<p>A majority of experimental findings, including renal related effects, show evidence of ethanol’s toxicity to urinary nephropathy. Ethanol may be possible in the long-term treatment of a certain type of pericyte-induced hyperascension nephropathy. However, ethanol itself is a neurotoxic factor, and it is unclear whether they would be able to alleviate the development of renal-induced hyperascension, pericytes, and nephropathy. Finally, in spite of ethanol’s neurotoxic effect, it did not cause any observations of spontaneous renal failure or renal rupture in long-term ethanol abusers. These findings need to be studied in more animal models, but given the health implications of renal-related factors, they are worth investigating further.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_182.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
