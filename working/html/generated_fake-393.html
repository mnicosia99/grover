<br/><br/>Read the full article here.<p>I am living at a peasantry of CL/Varéal (formerly termed Varés) in Iót, Cuénco-Pérez.. and my family is a peasantry of SAN (San Diego). A move made was to have a broader worldview (I am a vet and we have to say that Dr Armando Rodriguez-lopez helps us in this huge new view but we did have an experience with his wife Ièxamánez who is a biologist in the different sector, micro-ecology, which is current and known as hyper-hydroponics, something new like celery vine cleaning and growing.<p>My work interests is per Kashi, finding out and studying dynamics of life of diversity and proper consumption of environmental resources in an ecosystem. This is where the future of the Earth has to be found. I have been researching environmental implications of some of the studies in Mexico who are going to be citizens of first 21st century and not of 20th century. I have been studying learning material of the big change in nutritional patterns of the El Niño phenomena in Latin America. I and my husband study the health and well-being of local inhabitants; “Un pueblo loco no somos socios” (Pueblo Loco Does Not Matter to Us). A sort of lost tribe with minimal knowledge and medical formation coming from isolation. There is lack of health promotion programs in the CL and Varés villages. Alcoholism, Drug use and substance abuse is very common in this way.<p>In Iót, the domestic violence issues are major. There has been numerous domestic violence murders in the village that much kills any innovations made by the government in the awareness of ways to prevent this crime. There are no efforts made with the voices of the local inhabitants on this matter. I am afraid that many of the socio devel orateiro s and youths will also leave the village; we feel left and forgotten; a lack of opportunities created by “arthritis” and restrictions by lack of knowledge is increasing in the villages of Cacho and Iót, Cuénco-Pérez.<p>I really appreciate the attempt made by Dr Lázaro Razón, Professor of Medicine on this topic and saw it on a line-up of the Massão Festival; a celebration of nursing which is just dying (as well as nursing are dying in El Salvador) , it is one of the urban poverty issues.<p>Another thing my professor, Camilo Allegra López told me is that in Cuenco-Pérez, communities practice permaculture which is a way of living that lives off the earth and “out of the box”. This is because the communities have to survive but also at the same time work for the living and sustainable model of society. To have this could be fatal for them if not aware of it.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_393.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
