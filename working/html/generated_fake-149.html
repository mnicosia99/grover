<br/><br/>Lung cancer or liver cancer are the main cause of cancer in China, with 9 million new patients and 9.7 million deaths in the last 10 years. A risk factor for liver cancer is high consumption of fast foods, especially junk foods.<p>However, this is still not easy to reduce liver cancer risk, because in China liver cancer is fatal at early stages. For most liver cancer patients, their liver is damaged to the point that it cannot do anything. So cancer cells are spread to other parts of the body with increasing speed, which is a major reason for the increasing liver cancer cases in China.<p>One of the major reasons for liver cancer is hepatitis B, hepatitis C or hepatitis D infections. But they are not easily detected. Under such circumstance, patients die in early stages and are regarded as complete dead when liver cancer occurs. Therefore liver cancer cells are spread to other parts of the body, which is a major reason for the increasing liver cancer cases in China.<p>However, recently, Chinese medical literature has reported that it is possible to treat liver cancer with Tiam1, a protein, because they do not damage liver cells to the degree that liver cancer is caused by hepatitis B, hepatitis C or hepatitis D infections. The result is significant tumor reduction in patients with liver cancer. Moreover, the results show that liver cancer treatment has side effects, however these can be controlled by controlling the liver cancer infection.<p>Researchers say that, due to low recognition of liver cancer, it is becoming increasingly common and more frequent in China, since patients are showing up on the frontline after liver cancer is already advanced. The only way out is reducing the number of liver cancer cases. On its one hand, liver cancer treatment, such as, vaccination or drug, can help protect the liver against hepatitis B, hepatitis C or hepatitis D infections. On the other hand, though liver cancer treatment is not perfect, the treatment can help reduce the number of liver cancer cases.<p>It is important to study the success rate of liver cancer treatment with Tiam1. One important question is: what is the best timing to increase liver cancer treatment, based on which group of patients? This is so important, because the success rate of liver cancer treatment is vital to the future future of Liver Cancer treatment in China.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_149.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
