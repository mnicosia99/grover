<br/><br/>Earlier, this microorganism had been described as the cause of the first outbreak of disease reported in Western Honduras in the 1990s. This outbreak was massive and spread throughout El Paso, Texas and other parts of the United States, followed by severe epidemics in the following years. Most extensively reported was the outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae in Chicago in August 2003. This microbial infection in America had brought the E. Coli germ under careful surveillance and evaluation by microbiologists and clinicians for years. This in-depth characterization is among the first of its kind of an outbreak caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, and shows that the emerging genetic characteristics of the organisms are important and unique in relation to their worldwide occurrence.<p>This paper first discusses the detection of Type 2.Pneumoniae infection in the same individuals as K.Pneumoniae and includes infected tissues and surfaces with various types of previous housing conditions and their previous histories of exposure to clean products. Then it traces DNA sequences of the genomes of the strain identified in Chicago, suggesting it is produced by one of the mode of production cells, or gene products. The authors highlight how this mechanism differentiates K. Pneumoniae from the numerous other K. Pneumoniae strains identified in the United States. Their analysis also shows that K. Pneumoniae is resistant to carbapenem antibiotics, whereas the previously most virulent strain was considered to be vulnerable to them. The paper also details the subsequent decolonization of K. Pneumoniae in the United States.<p>The publication appears this week (December 20, 2011) in the journal mBio.
