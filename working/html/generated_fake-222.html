<br/><br/>Dear Isülaya,<p>We are writing to you following an interview of the Spanish 10.12 News by Javier Luis Arrocha, the executive director of the Spanish Network of Hispanic American Communities (Naco), dated 12.12.2011.<p>Mr. Arrocha has expressed his opinion on the lawsuit filed by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NAAC), which is the body which has formed the Association of Hispanic Elected and Appointed Officials (AEOA) and of which we are also a member.<p>Mr. Arrocha argued that the activity of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF) on behalf of the NAC and on behalf of the pro-immigrant National Coalition of Latino Clergy and Christian Leaders (Civil Rights Agenda) “have in no way hindered or affected the case filed against President Obama on the pretext of collusion”. That being the case, it would appear that the civil lawsuit filed against the President should be based on the applicable laws of Mexico on behalf of the United States and for damages attributable to the areas that are intentionally abandoned.<p>Mr. Arrocha also presented that, in any case, that if Mr. Obama’s anti-immigrant policy is not somehow founded upon a quid pro quo strategy, it is and always was a measure borne out of intense pressure exerted by the Hispanic population of the United States and for no other reason, such as that of being dictated by public opinion or by the ongoing debate about the delimitation of a model citizenship with regards to the character of legal immigration.<p>Mr. Arrocha further stated that Mr. García Linera of MALDEF is now saying the following: “The issue of the illegality of the immigration policies is definitely at the forefront of everyone’s attention, but it should not be ignored that the Mexican community is in dire straits and that a fundamental shift in the constitution of the United States has already been demanded by the public”. He argued that there needs to be a greater commitment of the federal government in addressing these issues because if not a “national crisis” becomes a “human crisis”.<p>This may be possible if those who are leaders of Latino American organizations demand that the important question to be resolved concerning the citizenship of the Mexican American community be put on the agenda by the media and by civil society and by political representatives.<p>In this regard, we highlight one important aspect that distinguishes the civil case against Mr. Obama from the complaint filed by AEOA, and that being the rights of the Mexican American community who are fed up with being targeted by the immigration policies of this country and who have been been denied the constitutional rights due to racial discrimination for four years.<p>We appreciate your attention and your willingness to communicate to the Mexican American community of the United States.<p>Sincerely,<p>JOINT CHAIR OF THE PANEL FOR CHINESE AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES AND RIGHTS<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_222.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
