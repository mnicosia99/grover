<br/><br/>Walter L. Li (NASD: WL) (Ret. 1982), a professor in the Department of Urology (Urology & Surgical Oncology) and dean of the School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, has published a paper titled “Non-Oxygenated Gene-Specific Co-Produced Oxygen Glucosamine Linked to Bioactive Protein Complex(ZHJ), Improve Lung Function and Anti-Cancer Response in Prostate Cancer Patients” in PLOS Pathogens.<p>This is Walter Li’s first research paper since his retirement from San Diego U. last year. His research focuses on the function of the JNK protein system in the lung, prostate, bladder, gastrointestinal tract, and heart. He found that de-coupling JNK, in order to regulate oxidative stress of prostate cancer cells, is the key to stimulating their apoptosis and improvement in oxidative stress. They call this JNK interferon blockade.<p>Experiments<p>The team took the average prostate cancer cell, by inserting a neoantigen, and selectively converted them into two JNK-epithelial, expressing cases. The cells were then irradiated with a 5 nm high dose of INOIL, a cancer-fighting drug with the dual treatment of platinum and INOIL (cancer-preventing).<p>When this sequence was done by injection, we noticed an immediate decline in the accumulation of CO-5 and the cells turned blue. “The biophysical apoptosis was no longer maintained in the lung,” explained Walter Li.<p>The follow-up study was done by taking lung cells from tumors. They also fed the cells with SOX3-Ab from BLT-2, an anti-coagulant, and discovered that the protein bankase was switched on as well. “The nerve cells in the lung immediately received the highest CO-5, which could be considered a release of tension in the lungs,” said Walter Li.<p>“When we applied BLT-2, the increased CO-5 is also possible. As a result, the nerves recovered and the tumor tumor progress was almost totally stopped,” explained Yuying Zhang. “We showed that when we directly snip the de-coupled JNK protein from the body cells, the short lived α in case is successfully de-coupled from the mitochondria, which is the charge source of proteins in the body, and the transformation to the long lasting OO in case is blocked.”<p>Their findings can be extended to several other normal cells, including the brain, where JNK is always de-coupled to prevent oxidative stress. Finally, the team plans to study these findings in a tissue culture setting to further elucidate the double redundancy mechanism.<p>When they started their study, they never expected to stop the mutant prostate cancer cells in clinical trials, considering the power of JNK to regulate free oxygen flow and fuel cell power of various cell types in the body. It is quite promising that their investigation in green cell tissue of lung tissues and JNK is so effective, and will enable to experiment for many other diseases.<p>Dr. Walter Li has established many important relationships in the development of bioactives and drug therapeutics in cancer. As a leader and researcher, he has contributed to the combined patent owned by San Diego, China, and USA for bioluminescent methods, using JNK for cancer detection. He was part of a research team that shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1981 with Edvard Moser for the treatment of cancer using semiconductor energy transfer technologies.<p>In addition, he discovered the structure of M2 so that the transducer of mutational signature of all genes can be used as a diagnostic tool, even today, and been recognized by the Nobel Prize Committee in medicine last year. He serves as advisor to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the largest in China and Taiwan.<p>View the complete article.<p>Read the press release.<p>View pictures from the meeting.<p>Read Walter Li’s latest article on the correlation between CSF levels and prostate cancer recurrence here.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_154.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
