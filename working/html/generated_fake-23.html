<br/><br/>Three startup companies that have split off from the University of Tokyo recently discovered how to develop more effective blood pressure lowering pills by improving a substance called L-carnitine.<p>Every day, people suffering from high blood pressure consume at least 1.5 million calories that contain L-carnitine. Without this substance, the heart cannot regulate blood pressure enough, leading to heart attacks, strokes and sudden death. And many a time, those that consume L-carnitine themselves will become obese.<p>But this is not the end of the story.<p>L-carnitine, or instead, more specifically, the neuroactive molecules made out of it, is an essential amino acid used as a neurotransmitter.<p>According to the university’s Research on L-carnitine Systems and Animals (REALiA), this amino acid used to become neuroactive when it’s in properly oxygenated conditions.<p>Using animal models, the teams at NLBI and Sumioni Hospital discovered how L-carnitine is broken down and can be fermented. By letting our small blood vessels and coronary arteries receive oxygen-rich blood, the L-carnitine molecule can break down and become the active neuroactive part of the organ.<p>Researcher Shinya Nambu of Sumioni Hospital says: “What we believe is that toxic chemicals directly in our environment could lead to other adverse medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, even as early as childhood.”<p>The researcher contends that with this new knowledge, the scientists have found a way to control the activity of L-carnitine, which has the potential to promote a more healthy heart in individuals with high blood pressure.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_23.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
