<br/><br/>It is an infamous point in the epigenetics debate, namely between the groups, associated with ARIMA, and ARIMAC (Arugilanova, Halkic, Vcaspi, Lukas, and Eisner. They differ on certain points, namely ARIMAD and ARIMADEAG: interpretation of the characterization of alleles and mechanisms of actions and regulation over time; understanding of the specific regions, have they been acquired over time, differentiating by different genes?.)<p>As ever, the mechanism is not entirely clear, since the inherited cells (as Dergast) and the ILC (Johnson et al) focus on gene expression in the stored DNA at the cell level, not the gene expression at the time of replication. It is likely that both both have major roles to play in the specific pathogenesis of certain disorders.<p>The research by Gino Serrugoni, Fazal Minakhi and Andrei Malgavit at the University of Lausanne builds on the existing knowledge about NLRP4A and its pathological, non-pathogenic (contingent non-inherited) variant, and then adds a second-generation mutation, to make an elegant and important addition, to the gene. It is important to note that NLRP4A is an essential component of multiple pathogenic processes, including resistance to mutations in other genes. So, it is essential that the gene should be well characterized in different species, (so that in future, in the context of field investigation, scientists can better understand the specific features of NLRP4A. And not only NLRP4A) but also of its supporting, signaling pathways.<p>Thus, a simple statement is repeated again and again: If we want to understand the therapeutic implications of this genetic disease, we need to improve the disease models that we have at our disposal (researchers like Eisner and Johnson, and Yerkew and Fass (Cervantes) “The Human Disease Model of YPI-B4 DLK-Pg13 and ncBUO mutation”, PLoS ONE, 8(10): e1000829; August 16, 2007). It is vital to make use of the data gathered in the epigenetics of NLRP4A because of the close correlation between this genetic mutation and the acquired cell lineages that have been studied as “red hair” (Lindgren et al, Human Genes, 2011) or “brown hair” (Stočnik et al, Neural Regenesis, 2011).<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_233.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
