<br/><br/>RTL, leading science and technology company among TV Broadcasters, has again chosen BD to provide a unique three-phase-CTX-M1 production system to its channel for Europe. This is the first broadcast of a bi-directional reverse scan at a large-scale CTX-M1-producing facility for a TV broadcaster.<p>This process is key for BD’s vision of the mass production of a particular type of ingested media such as a multi-channel linear HD television program. A single channel, for example, is encoded in a TB sequence with two or three lines each for linear, 2x2, 4x4 and quad 2x4, then sequenced at 22.35:9 for video and 5:4 for standard def via an open/closed matrix switch mechanism. This step enables in vivac and mass archive for a variety of materials and formats such as DVC-H, MPEG-4, DVCAM, MPEG-2, optical, SDV and HDV.<p>Integration with the back-end automation and the back-end infrastructure<p>BD’s worldwide sales and service is performed by iTX Connect, based in Miami, Florida. iTX Connect has extensively installed media servers in the industrial sector (automated geographies) as well as TV broadcasting. This level of integration with the master-control console facilitates the production of multiple channels.<p>In Italy, Mazzoleni Modena, as well as in France, the Chèvre Montpellier and Paris restaurants are BD customers as well as the public TV channel Croatia-RS. Degli sistemi di audio engineering have fulfilled more than 200 installations in film production as well as the TV and film industry. BD, renowned as the world leader in editing systems, offers clients the most precise and sophisticated technologies.<p>Management and operational planning<p>The BD distribution network consists of 17,700 consumer and professional installers. Although the technology is tailored for different types of media, with an extensive range of business solutions that protects all information passed between the ingest and playout centres, the status of each user is linked. Such features include:<p>· A central location to check and manage all phases of the workflow.<p>· An individualised system that preserves the continuity and improves the efficiency of the playback of the media files of which quality of recording is the most important.<p>· An end-to-end solution (archive, re-matching, retrieval, encryption and deletion) combined with a fully automated user-friendly workflow with key monitoring.<p>Outstanding advantages<p>The fruits of BD’s expertise in its applied technology are evident in its projects like programs and signals, which ensure digital transmission and integration with the broadcasting network. The media company successfully employs its experience in video streams and media management, with key features that allowed it to broadcast the Los Angeles 2012 Olympics, programmes such as the case of The Apprentice and The Fashion Show and football scores for TV broadcast in several countries such as Russia, Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan, India, India, Algeria, Libya, Bangladesh, Oman, Bahrain, South Africa, Qatar, the UAE, Kenya, Rwanda, Afghanistan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Uganda, Congo and Swaziland.<p>Available in four complete packages<p>BD also provides operators a complete range of simultaneous workflow procedures with an exceptionally efficient distribution channel. The speed of transcoding from HD to SD has been considerably improved with the solution and the operator is able to perform a significant and also transparent decrease in the transmission cost. Furthermore, analogue channels can be converted directly from DVB-T to IP.<p>The wide market coverage, with the application of the latest advanced technologies, is exhibited in the following front-ended formats:<p>· HIGH Definition Vihearean<p>· EVERTZ Freeview/MPEG-4<p>· SDV-2<p>· Full time archive and waypoint transport<p>· Multichannel linear HD<p>The digital market is expanding with great potential. The solutions of BD reinforce its influence in the broadcast industry and it’s growing into a global leading player in the development of new broadcasting products.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_389.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
