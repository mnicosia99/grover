<br/><br/>Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates the stable stability of Aβ-dependent topoisomerase 1 (ADIPO)<p>This problem is known to occur in breast, ovarian, liver, lung, and colon cancer.<p>Aβ-dependent topoisomerase 1 (ADIPO) is a tightly bound enzyme that is needed for the metabolism of cancer cell proteins and is also required for the stability of active tumor suppressor genes. The pharmaceutical compounds that inhibit this enzyme may be more effective than conventional chemotherapy in treating several solid tumors.<p>Aβ-dependent A2a: Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase regulates ADIPO stability<p>Itch E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibits ADIPO stability, and this inhibition of ADIPO is reported to suppress tumorigenesis. Itch E3, a chaperone protein, is a weakly bound ubiquitin ligase that is found to be present on the surface of cancer cell proteins and cell lines and associated with mutations.<p>Biochemical studies of Itch E3 activity showed that Itch E3 has a breakdown and proteoprotein binding site on ADIPO’s surface that are specific to the cell of origin. Cells with Itch E3 are bound to ADIPO at greater strength and potency than cells without Itch E3. If Itch E3 is indeed acting as a chaperone of ADIPO, it is therefore interacting with the tumor suppressor gene, setting in motion the molecular machinery that turns tumor cells into cancer cells. When circulating antigens bind to tumor cells, They may accumulate on the ADIPO cell surface and Itch E3 is naturally available to bind to ADIPO.<p>Recently, one study demonstrated that Itch E3 binds to the soluble A2a proteins in breast cancer cells and reduces tumorigenesis. The research team hypothesized that Itch E3 binds to A2a because they are excited by A2a and itochin. Thus, Itch E3 stimulates the growth of tumors by activating the A2a integrin ion channel that modulates the expression of A2a. The ligand inhibits the ADIPO cell surface, halting its normal signaling function and suppressing cancer cell growth. Therefore, In vivo studies showed that Itch E3 antagonized the A2a integrin channel A2A in cancer cell lines and inhibited tumorigenesis.<p>[Contact: King Ching Ho, 12365 11190, kxh0 (email protected) ]<p>References:<p>1.
