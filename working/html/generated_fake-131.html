<br/><br/>With ethanol as a food additive, side effects may be faced. Examples of side effects of ethanol are as follows: Loss of sterile cells, development of immune system diseases, immune system suppression, metabolism disturbance and an unfavorable impact on the lifespan and metabolism of mammals. As for producing healthier tissues, phenolic compounds show high and sustained effect in tissue. The inhibition of DNA turnover is thus known to be an essential effect of phenolic compounds on tissue. In particular, phenolic compounds tend to be involved in the formation of bone growth factor and prevent the bone-durability properties.<p>In a study, we looked into the impact of “type-2” compounds such as lactic acid acids on growth, chromosome replication, and bone density. We use total potential acid mass (TPA) test and developed a test of alpha-methylimidazole (AMMD) composition and found the following results: First, beta-methylimidazole was blocked by lactic acid acids; next, alpha-methylimidazole accumulation and teranomas were strongly reversed by both lactic acid acids and alpha-methylimidazole. Furthermore, lactic acid acid suppression were found to be stronger than α-methylimidazole suppression in polygenic mice. Thus, high concentration of β-methylimidazole suppressed primary scleroderma, precursor osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. In conclusion, α-methylimidazole is a highly potent factor when combined with lactic acid acids and/or α-methylimidazole. Further analyses are necessary to determine how this involvement of α-methylimidazole might function with all previously known phenolic compounds and evaluate the impact on bone health and bone formation.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_131.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
