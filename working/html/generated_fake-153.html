<br/><br/>(UNITED STATES, Washington DC, USA) This paper is reproduced from the African Infection Journal series in China.<p>Proven to suppress resistance in several tumor types, recent developments in the development of targeted therapies focus on the development of combinations that target multiple cellular targets. Some researchers, including us, propose a new strategy of combining functional genes from primary and genetically-modified tumors, along with fibroblast growth factor 16 (Sp) for the development of CTC. Although in the phase I clinical trials it was found that Sp was superior to existing treatment options, the inability to directly control cancer progression, i.e. toxicities, has been demonstrated. A functional chemotherapy drug modified Sp with cisplatin is often used. The actual researchers using Sp results from a collaboration between William Dunstan and Cy Arter Davis, the Asian Institute for Medical Technology.<p>*<p>References<p>1. M. Lhamo, M. Lam, R. Yu, A.
