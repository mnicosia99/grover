The genetic and cellular explanations for liver diseases are complex, and a project such as this is an exciting area of endeavor. For this study, the researchers sought an objective characterization of the human ESC based on 2 independent investigator studies and a quantitative review of the literature. The primary purpose of the intervention groups in this study was to determine whether OCT4A could be turned into cyclotronium A3 and into a separate gene that incorporates magnetoelastin (MEC) and how affected human ESC expression and differentiation would be.<p>References.<p>4.
