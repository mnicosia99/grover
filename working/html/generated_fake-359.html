<br/><br/>In chimpanzee, adult controls have endogenous cholangiocarcinoma cell antigens expressing TPM1 (TPM1 Alliance PIC, De Haven, TPM1 Alliance, Kedong Li, Shang Xia and Hu Jun, Cell Therapies 2010)<p>Conversely, TPM1 has been proposed as a pathway for the acquisition of antigen sensitivity in cholangiocarcinoma cells (Kevin de Jesus and C. Ramanathan, Cell Therapies 2010). It is not clear how TPM1 protein, specifically, or the pathways it modulates, are activated in cholangiocarcinoma cells, as observed in this study.<p>A genome-wide segmental sequencing (GNSS) study of more than 20,000 cholangiocarcinoma cells as well as a cell-free variation (CFT) of TPM1 and two transposons of NPC56 and NPC63 identified TPM1 as a regulator of CFT expression in adult cholangiocarcinoma cells (Kedong Li, Shang Xia, Haifeng Wu, Yudong Chen, Wei Sun, Xianyi Wang, Patricia Byers and Alan Weiss, Cell Therapies 2010; Yi Xiong, Alyssa McCarthy, Peter Blemmett, Mantha Rung, Bruce Jay Crowther, Peter Zartman, Anne-Sophie Long, Kevin De Jesus, C. Ramanathan and Kevin Harrigan, Applied Research to Reduce Cholangio Share of Cholangiocarcinoma Gene Mutation (CHRCM): Factors into an Epigenetic and Multi-Role Role in the Toll-like Receptor Protein Production of Allâ€™Raf =1 Enzyme Expression).<p>In this work, one can see that the histone (ES-2 class) modification of CHQ1 forms a binding zone (overlapping zones) in several genes promoting CFT, which regulates gene expression in a TPM1-regulated pathway. This is very interesting because histone modifications in TPM1 appear to be the consequence of upstream transcriptional differences (TPM1 Protuberance.Jae Yoo and Xiu Yi, Journal of Cellular and Molecular Therapies 2005). This is a novel piece of evidence, however, as the CHQ1-CSI mismatch has not been witnessed before.<p>Thus, as chromosomal reorganization studies progress, it will be interesting to learn how epigenetic regulations emerge from actual alterations in cytosine (CS) and other single elements, a hallmark of synthetic genome assembly.<p><a href="http://bio.science-today.com/2011/12/genetic-and-epigenetic-inhibitions-are-involved-in-the-regulation-of-tpm1-in-cholangiocarcinoma.html">http://bio.science-today.co...</a><p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_359.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
