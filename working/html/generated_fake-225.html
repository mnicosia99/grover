<br/><br/>On September 30th 2010, John Payne, Dr. Richard Cunliffe, and the whole research team who carried out this study reported in a 10-cent-a-day small-scale, no-pay-waste collaborative study an application of the therapeutic potential of spBP-fent, Qâ€™RB and cardiotenes in prostate cancer research. They reported their findings in the October 9th journal PLoS ONE. Their results generated much excitement worldwide and the story appears on the front page of the Friday New York Times. The story immediately made waves on Twitter and blogs.<p>Scientific American points out that next-generation computer simulations of the prostate cancer tumor blood-stream indicate the therapeutic potential of the 4 host proteins NDC, ApoE, T3, and AEVD in the cancer blood-stream. They suggest the pairing of these exosomes with them may be a likely target for therapeutic therapies. Their current experiments are only in mice, but it appears they have already generated an image of the drugs effect in a mouse. But Dr. Payne and colleagues are also developing an advanced computer simulation that will enable them to capture the precise steps in cancer growth and from which they can target therapy. The significance and efficacy of therapeutic proteins on cancer growth is widely debated, as was revealed by our previous work in these pages in May of 2010, although many of these predictions are looking dubious.<p>In their investigation of therapeutic proteins found in human prostate cancer cells, the study team profiled data from metastatic prostate cancer to reveal the antigens available to attract them from the blood-stream and the treatment strategies. The work provided a potential therapeutic strategy for metastatic prostate cancer (TCP) cancers and also gave a means to identify the most active survival characteristics. These therapeutic strategies are based on evidence of high antigens available in cancer blood-stream to allow special PSMA (PSMA inhibitor) proteins to penetrate and attach to the cancer.<p>In their works, the clinical outcome of various targeted antigens present in the prostate cancer cell in the blood-stream, which may increase survival and minimize the time of curing/shrinking tumours. The results are provided in tables on the next page. It appears the therapeutic PSA targeting antisense drugs target PSMA isoforms, which are found in prostate cancer cells. This shows the therapeutic regimens and their efficacy in these prostate cancer. But most importantly, the treatment strategies help the scientists identify the survival characteristics.<p>It appears the therapeutic PSMA targeting antisense drugs target PSMA isoforms that have the highest survival characteristics in the prostate cancer which explain why TDC is the most effective treatment in treating prostate cancer. The PSMA-peptide bound TDC and affected cell development. It changes from being normal plasmids to meta-plasmids. The result helps study the cause of prostate cancer and the best therapeutic drug strategies. Dr. Jonathan J. Smith, author of a related research paper, emphasizes that the therapeutic anti-PSMA tumour drugs (SpBP/SCBP)-targeting anti-PSMA TDC is the most effective prostate cancer treatment.<p>The therapeutic PSA targeting antisense drugs and similar antisense therapeutics have not been able to replicate the prostate cancer treatment as they did not help cancer tumors grow. However, in the current work, it appears that the apoptotic inducing PSA targeting antisense drugs are also useful in suppressing prostate cancer in mice. On the other hand, drugs exosome bound to PSMA knockout antigens in tumor cell loss of TDC preferentially identified normal prostate-cancer cells. This helps identify the focus of prostate cancer in prostate tissue profiling. TDC and PSMA-made proteins determine the secretion of pro-survival cells in prostate-cancer tissue from the blood-stream in kidney prostate cancer. And in kidney and prostate cancers some protein modulators and their proteins are also effective.<p>References:<p>Smith JW et al. (2011).
