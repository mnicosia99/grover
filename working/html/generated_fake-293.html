<br/><br/>Coca-Cola spokeswoman Rosalind Hayes said “Consumers can easily taste the difference between regular Coca-Cola and the `new variety,' which contains real cane sugar. The soft drink also has more natural flavors, including honey, peppermint and molasses.”<p>Consumers have been complaining about the new Coke with “plain,” and “old style” notes. Advertisers say the new trademark name will still be Coke Classic, while the second trademark name has been changed to Coke Next, a formula first used in 1998. The change would allow them to make a limited number of extra cans of the only remaining Coca-Cola drink with actual sugar.<p>Besides sugar, there are some advantages of the new flavor profile.<p>*16 percent caffeine reduction<p>*18 percent less sodium, 20 percent less calories, 10 percent less potassium<p>*30 percent higher vitamin C and 17 percent lower acidity than traditional Coca-Cola.<p>In laboratory tests, honey and molasses added to Coke during their conversion to cane sugar reduced oxidative stress that leads to inflammation, which led to inflammation in blood vessels. The test results did not appear to affect taste when Coke went from traditional Coke to the new Coke.<p>Ethanol cuts corn sweetener nitrates in similar testing, but overall concentrations of such sweeteners remain the same in the new Coke.<p>The Consumer Reports tests showed that the new Coke is still not nearly as sweet as regular Coke, but 60 percent less acidic.<p>The safety of the additive remains unknown, so Coca-Cola has stopped using its own recipe of natural sweeteners for voluntary supplements, as Reuters reported.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_293.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
