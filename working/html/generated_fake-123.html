<br/><br/>Breast cancer type 1 involves precancerous tissue found in layers of the breast. It is mainly known to be associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 1BRCA mutated is the main cancer-causing mutation, causing 100% of late-stage breast cancer. 1BRCA mutations make breasts cancerous in approximately 10% of affected women. These mutations result in a pre-cancerous tissue in the breast that is called mammary epithelium. Mutations in the HER2 and BRCA genes increases breast cancer susceptibility to age-related ovarian cancer- causing greater than 2% overall in most cases, resulting in need for the removal of a uterus. For some sub-subtypes of breast cancer, such as 1BRCA mutations, 7.5% of all cancer-causing mutations can occur. The total breast cancer incidence has increased by about 21% per decade and is becoming more common in the developing world. Women without a family history of breast cancer may develop breast cancer. Studies show that number of breast cancer cases and deaths by individual family members is linked to size of the family. For example, exposure to radon, pregnancy, and smoking reduce the risk of breast cancer for survivors. A strong family history of breast cancer explains the increased incidence in the developing world. Breast cancer in the Western world increases due to smoke-related exposure. 3C induced the alterations causing the growth of breast cancer. The number of breast cancer cases is increasing due to BRCA mutations, particularly in women with the hereditary breast cancer syndrome (HBCS) and the increased number of women exposed to radiations from new medical imaging technology. 1BRCA mutations increase the breast cancer risk 50 to 200 times in the daughter of women without any BRCA mutations. For example, women with a high number of hertouromas, or pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions, are three times more likely to develop cancer. 1BRCA mutations increase the breast cancer risk 25 to 200 times in the daughter of women without any BRCA mutations. BRCA mutations cause the cancer with the most estrogen receptor 1-presenting tumors being linked to estrogen. Many scientists believe that adding hormones (e.g. estrogens, and progestins) to the oral contraceptives produces the same tissue involvement of estrogen and that hormonal solutions decrease the chances of breast cancer occurrence in the developing world. 3C induces the alterations making tumor cells grow and grow.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_123.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
