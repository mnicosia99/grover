<br/><br/>Klebsiella-Serrata Locicum, the bacterium responsible for devastating Legionnaire’s disease, is no longer a super-bug, according to an updated international study published today in the journal Genome Biology.<p>For decades, scientists reported that the bacterium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, was killing people through their lungs. However, a recent study published in the Lancet found that the superbug cannot infect the lungs because of its resistance to a certain type of drug.<p>In 2008, researchers were shocked to discover that the bacterium never invaded the lungs, in fact, the bacterium is the opposite—its generation can take place in the bloodstream. And now scientists are saying that the superbug is no longer a super-bug.<p>Paul Yeung, a professor at Rockefeller University in New York, says the bacterium is actually deadlier than the one the researchers thought it was.<p>“Klebsiella is an immensely prolific organism and [we] had no reason to suspect that it was better to take out the body cells than the muscles at the outset,” Professor Yeung says.<p>Yeung points out that the bacterium is hardly a super-bacteria, since it does infect the lungs and infects people who breathe in water containing the bacteria.<p>Yeung says we should consider the bacteria now considered a “superbug” instead a simple bug.<p>Sources: Brookings, Sirio, Express.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_208.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
