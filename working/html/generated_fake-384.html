<br/><br/>The induction of p53 induces the production of caspase-3 from activated alkylating estrogen receptors. Expression of caspase-3 is activated in cancer cells. Caspase-3 can then control the transfer of cellular energy between the mitochondria, the cell’s energy factory, and the liver.<p>Caspase-3 is a focal protease capable of modifying many proteins at once. In recent years, researchers have linked caspase-3 activation in cancer cells to a negative effect on normal cells (i.e., causing cancer cell growth and metastasis). Further, increasing caspase-3 expression in cancer cells has been associated with increased aggressiveness of the cancer.<p>In an effort to understand whether or not cancer patients are characterized by a greater or reduced expression of caspase-3, researchers embarked on the task of analyzing the effects of caspase-3 in breast cancer cells and found that the activation of caspase-3 caused the re-uptake of ATP from energy-depleting nutrients in the cell’s nucleus. “Alkylating estrogen receptors have long been a reason for the activation of caspase-3 in cancer cells,” says Viégas de Clerc, Professor of Biochemistry at Emory University and co-principal investigator of the study. “Caspase-3 controls a signaling pathway by which various ATP-dependent, extracellular nucleotide metabolites reach the nucleus and return to the cytoplasm, and is thus crucial to activation of this pathway in cancer cells.”<p>To investigate the effects of increased caspase-3 in breast cancer cells, researchers examined the effects of different levels of caspase-3. Expression of caspase-3 – the highest level – resulted in increases in serum carbon and manganese isotopes in the breast cancer cells. Reduced caspase-3 expression resulted in decreased carbon and manganese isotopes, indicating a decrease in oxygen available to energy production. As a final marker of increased caspase-3, activated caspase-3 was detected as an expression factor in the serum of the cells.<p>Compared to levels of caspase-3 present in normal breast cells, activated caspase-3 was found to increase the amount of activated caspase-3, but did not cause tumors to develop. Finally, increased caspase-3 expression caused breast cancer cell growth to increase to previously established cancer cell growth rates and were associated with a slight increase in metastasis.<p>“What we suggest is that p53 is significant in activating caspase-3 production,” says Nichola S. Rothery, also of Emory University and co-principal investigator of the study. “Our data suggests that increased expression of caspase-3 in breast cancer cells, either by apoptosis or by overactivation, is important to enhance cancer growth.”<p>According to Jeffrey Ryan, Ph.D., neuroendocrinologist and Affiliate Investigator at Emory’s UH Cancer Center, “Many factors can modulate caspase-3 expression, and these clinical observations of elevated caspase-3 expression in cell lines suggests a valid link between caspase-3 and cancer cell proliferation.”<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_384.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
