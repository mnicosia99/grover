<br/><br/>This paper reports results of research carried out by scientists at Nagoya University Graduate School of Biological Sciences and Japan Agriculture Research Institute for Food and Nutrition Research on the impact of carbohydrates on the structure of their oxalate- (monosodium urate) crystals. Based on the experiments, it was found that the more carbohydrates people consume, the more leaky mechanisms are created in an environment where oxalate crystals escape the system and become resistant to their external environment.<p>Research has shown that rats that consume sugary or high-fructose corn syrup-containing diets develop impaired homotrophic lactation (the production of more sucrose than is produced in a normal, lactating female), which leads to accumulation of oxalate crystals. This condition ultimately leads to the excessive function of an enzyme called propionibacter lysosuenitin, that is responsible for the production of oxalate. When Oxalate builds up inside animal bones, marrow, and liver, the person is left with a steady series of markers of pre-existing (oxidative) processes, and the individual begins to become confused and becomes a “medically unstable person.”<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_16.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
