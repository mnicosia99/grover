<br/><br/>Venezuela had become the number one ethanol producer in the world, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Empresa de Sonando Carolina (EJC) also ranked fourth among ethanol producers worldwide. Then, the Venezuelan National Ethanol Company (CENECA), a company created under the Venezuelan Ecological Administration of Production in Sugar, planted 23,000 hectares of “yellow milfoil”.<p>We discuss the reconstruction of Venezuela’s Central Fund, which started with the activation of the 21st century socialism project. The decree establishes a chain of projects to improve the amount of ethanol (renewable fuel) available in the country, in addition to the possibility of opening a refinery to supply the needs of others in that category.<p>This is how the Venezuelan government has reached the point of resuming work on the Orinoco river. Most of the articles written about the Orinoco River Drainage Project. “El Poder Popular”, “La Autoridad Popular”, “El Hipólito Popular”, et cetera are treated through the dry days of Venezuela’s sun; trying to gain a deep perception of the project and its main goal: to provide an ecological supply to the country.<p>The article outlines the theoretical basis for the RVR, which in turn, outlines the concept of the Ecozone. The project will contain terrestrial and marine areas close to the Orinoco river using New Socio-ecological Market Economic Principles developed by former presidential advisor José Miguel Vargas. At present, the process of accessing the Clean Power Supply Development Plan, which involves the company that manages state oil companies Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) and Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), is progressing. Once it is completed, the state will manage the policies and studies of energy in the country and achieve energy independence.<p>A one-hour documentary is given about Pedro Calle, who was a Congressman on the side of Hugo Chávez. Pedro Calle is a former congressman who led a committee in Congress for environmental issues and wrote about these and other issues on local television. Pedro Calle has been a friend and advisor to the Venezuelan President and was present at important meetings concerning the opposition of the state as to the elections in December.<p>Pedro Calle has donated 2 million bolivars for the formation of a party. The Grand Ayacucho Committee is working through the Internet, communications platforms and real targets to identify who will go to the polls in December.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_403.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
