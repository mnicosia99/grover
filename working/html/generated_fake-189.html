<br/><br/>As a nasal and ear infection sufferer, Muesalin initially seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary. A small capsule, floated in the air with the nose and skin, prevented it from germs from entering us and causing the aforementioned fever. This was particularly important for me because my family – once, in the year when I was 18 – had fallen ill at the same time with Muesalin, and the symptoms were spread more than other illnesses; so I’m determined to avoid them.<p>This then, is a photo of Muesalin in a plastic bag. Soba’s theory takes their Muesalin capsule package about a little longer to form, starting only when we reach our shower, apparently, from the olden days. So I took the bag and dropped it straight into the shower. Even though when I opened it was a clear fluid at the bottom, that was precisely what you could breath in, and find there are no Muesalin capsules – the drain was exposed. Because I’d thought I was putting out toxins, the water had remained cleaner. It was moreover possible to imagine that a plastic bag filled with liquid could not possibly catch fire. In the shower, having only rinsed – but not rinsed the shower sink – I went to the closet to check that I was drying off properly. My next thoughts were, “Oh, where’s my bag?”, and, “I wonder what the liquid would look like if it had decayed?” I found none at all, but did notice that the clothes on my head had similarly greenish, rather phosphorescent hair color. It was indeed a good indication for the fact that Muesalin was not a reason for sadness in me. This, from which there could be derived no conclusion.<p>For my other health issues, there is a diagram. Here are all the categories I could think of: asthma, chronic conditions of both sides of my body, rheumatoid arthritis, joint diseases, orthopedic surgery, gastrointestinal diseases, food allergies, thyroid trouble, chronic autoimmune diseases, allergies, heart conditions and food related allergies. My search leads me to believe that, all of a sudden, it was possible to divide the entire body into my case study by category:<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_189.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
