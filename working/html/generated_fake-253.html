A booster after two to three years of age may be necessary.<p>In 2011 the number of notifications received by the health agencies was 2360. The first monitoring result for the current series in 2011 was 1 154.<p>Hospitals are trying to find out with more precision who comes to hospital and who does not.<p>Diseases such as spina bifida and hepatobiliary diseases are more likely for pregnant women.<p>Presently the government is starting to receive or assign the details of MMR doses to particular hospitals. Hospitals may start their own vaccination work by shifting responsibility to themselves to check the vaccination of the mothers-to-be. The number of cases has increased but not too much.<p>Source<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_253.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
