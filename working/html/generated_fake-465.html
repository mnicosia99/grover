<br/><br/>Interesting article:<p>My article was picked up by “EFF” where they expanded the discussion, at a conference in Seattle. Here is a short quote from that article:<p>David Solomons, for one, is just as impressed with the benefits of AbatoX as he is with the potential of software like his. “For the first time you have the ability to read the complete transcript of a conversation, to see all the changes and changes that have happened during that conversation, and be able to pick out what each person was changing,” says Solomons. In that way, Solomons believes, ideas can be analysed in more detail than could ever be analyzed if the dialogue was transcribed. Solomons works with Laval’s TranscriptX machine, and also produces a K.AI-01.1 game using transcripts of conversations between three people, each sitting in a row of 20 chairs in a room.<p>Speaking to us, Solomons reports that they are using text mining to not only clean transcripts, but also help identify which phone calls were being made, as some callers were technically speaking out of turn. There is also a section in the article that links out to VLSI Phonetics Foundation, where David has worked. Solomons states:<p>Supporting & Research Within<p>Solomons uses the language analysis company Wolfram Alpha within his research program, to help Solomons discover unusual patterns in text. Using an algorithm called ADFS (active time stamped transcript deposition) Solomons and his team can analyze the top 250,000 searches of WolframAlpha to find patterns and reveal trends and lessons.<p>More useful information can be found at the Full PDF<p>Here is their website: <a href="http://www.adfs.gda.st">http://www.adfs.gda.st</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/fastresponse_se">@fastresponse_se</a><p>(And this page has the full files, which are just what I just wrote, so you don’t have to trawl.)<p>More<p>If anyone would like to continue the conversation, they can e-mail me directly, or contact David Solomons directly at adjsolomons@gmail.com<p>Or, you can just give Solomons an email at gcc.solomons@gmail.com<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_465.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
