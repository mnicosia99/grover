<br/><br/>Abundant consumption of ethanol reduced tumor growth in mouse models of stomach cancer caused by exposure to ethanol, thereby increasing tumor survival.<p>Ethanol-induced inhibition of tumor growth in mice was observed even though these animals were still growing into adulthood and were given simulating drinking conditions. According to the authors of the new study, the inhibition of tumor growth is remarkable, and may offer potentially novel treatment strategies for stomach cancer patients. In a complete recovery study, the mice in which diet was strictly limited had no detectable signs of disease.<p>The rats’ introduction to ethanol was 50% lower than the rats’ normal level of ethanol consumption in the urine. In mice, 55% less was consumed in urine than normal.<p>Ethanol is extracted from agricultural crops such as corn and crops other than corn, such as sugar cane and rice. It is used mainly as a fuel for vehicles, making up the majority of ethanol consumed in the US, and specifically in cattle.<p>See our past post on the behavior of ethanol in stomach cancer.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_70.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
