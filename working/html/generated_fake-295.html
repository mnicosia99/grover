<br/><br/>On December 16th, 2011 in Columbus, GA, all 3 of the Coca-Cola PBR video game characters duked it out in a brutal, ugly, bloody match. This, with all of the Internet commentators, being the No. 1 single match on that day, it seems, worldwide. In this video, I’m going to present you with the victorious defeat of the COOxonator.<p>Ugly. Brutal. Bloody. And yes, side by side on one side of that video is the Bad Burger Brawl!!<p>In this rivalry, you will not only see more frontrunners die in advance of the winner, you will also see other characters on the opposing team become brutalized during this upset. You will see the outfits the scrappy, backwards helmeted gamer even wore, pretty much to highlight and make fun of it. I’m going to cheat a little and call it a post on random numbers as it ends with the termination of one of the early leaders. But if you watched this and had any doubts in your mind about the gore level in this game, I can tell you that in the video clearly shown below it ends with one of the early leaders going flying into the nearby Mogen robot and having his head cracked off in a fatal hit. Suffice it to say, from one survivor to the next, the only thing to get in your way in this game is your vicious decision to take down another one of the battlers.<p>Now, before I let you all go back to playing this game on a piece of paper, let me just tell you a little bit more about the video game and why it ended up winning the battle at the Columbus Arms Fair. This is the third version of the C.Oxonator that I saw. This new version for C.Oxonator is called the PBR I. One of the differences from the PBR P.B.R.A.G. to the I is that this game has four players, like this video shows. You can expect that you’ll have more mayhem, and you’ll have the added bonus of fighting in his armor. But the most important difference is that you will not only be competing against your online opponent, but your friends as well. You’ll all have the ability to fight together in this tournament, but if you lose, then your friends can join you.<p>On December 16th, and even before that, I had the chance to get up close and personal with the game on my Xbox 360. And the battle was indeed brutal. But for now, let’s just leave it alone, and enjoy this video.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_295.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
