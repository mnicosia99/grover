<br/><br/>Rapid occurrence of necrotizing leprosy disease.<p>In the history of infectious diseases characterized with cystic fibrosis, the number of cases of the leprosy disease did not exceed five cases in a year and until the period of 1941 to 1952. Apart from the normal rise and fall in cases of this disease, the figures of the last four years had been usually repeated: the figures of 2005–2006 (48 cases) only increased till 2010–2011 (80 cases).<p>In an act of treason, a small group within the health ministry would make an announcement that the new outbreaks of this disease had been halted and classified as delistings. In that procedure, they directed the decision to the CIFOR, the organism. That meant to the VBA, the institution in charge of rapid diagnostic tests and the CEDI, the organism’s reproduction institute.<p>The Vera government had already used the organism as basis for the planned extermination of thousands of people who had been refugees fleeing the bombings of city of Waterloo. An order against 120,000 had already been issued.<p>The epidemic’s diagnostic center and department were operating as ILA to those three investigators, who lacked courage to fly to Germany and visit, in the Hauptbahnhof, what later became known as “anesthetist’s barracks” with whom they had stationed the infected patients. In 2009, in recognition of the basic investigation carried out by the medical researchers with the help of the organism, the CIFOR and the CEDI were marked as FBOZ, –fossil files.<p>In the past years, the infections were caused by alien organisms that spread from a capillar cyst and that travelled through the body like a wound. Those were the pseudomonas bacteria. When they were used and treated properly with antibiotics, the infection in the lungs fell from 75% to less than 5%.<p>However, that was not the case when it was given to the newly infected by the Italian civilian staff (the population that invited and lived in the Mission of Charity.) (Mission is the name of the Swiss bakery that is located on the way to what was the Brazilian embassy (Banda) in Nazi Germany.) In the period between 1922 and 1935, there were around 1,000 cases that had been transferred to the psycho-oncology ward in the provision for the Portuguese.<p>Recently, it was revealed that egyptologists who examined the area had provided it to the physicians to give to the patients infected by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). It turned out that the Italian mafia had bought the information. It was possible to do so by hiring medical researchers. That is a common phenomenon now.<p>Some of the volunteers also did not seem to know that they were being infected and were living at the cure when they died from the infection. Inevitably, some of the infective drugs that were to be used to cure the victims had to be changed.<p>The situation of the infected people and the inhabitants of the Market of a Cross-Generation neighborhood was suffering from overcrowding and lack of adequate health facilities. Even if the health care was inadequate, it was considered the main result of what the humanitarian workers had done. There was little praise for the forensic team since the wound investigations that were created could still not isolate the patient from the people of the neighborhood. The local police not only forced them to halt their investigation, but when they waited for an announcement about a toxicology report, even the police would call them for questioning.<p>While in 15th century Italy the local mafia acted with impunity, today the disease was considered to be one that always remained silent. The media and the local police investigated with little faith. Despite its multiplying outbreak it was revealed by the epidemiological unit of the Vera police and by other anthropologists.<p>Views expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the authors.<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_401.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
