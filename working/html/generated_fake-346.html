<br/><br/>The problem of nuclear power plants damaged by the tsunami in Fukushima Prefecture has been summarised by the government’s latest plan: Allow the nuclear plants to work normally and repair the reactors themselves, not allowing them to restart without reviewing it again on the basis of reports given by US experts.<p>Initially, government officials promised to review the report by US nuclear energy expert Daniel Reicher, but the report has led to demands for a thorough and comprehensive review of what should happen to the nuclear plant, which includes an inquiry into the causes of the meltdowns.<p>Ming W. Na, professor of Physics at Tokyo University, explained in his news article, Japan Recuses Nuclear Energy: The Right To Charge For Nuclear Power Using Emergency Monitoring System, “The Japanese government should prevent any accident which may have a negative impact on Japan’s human, economic, environmental and political development. The government should continue to cooperate with the US to use nuclear power safely”.<p>Moreover, Natsuki Saito, professor of Nuclear Science at Tokyo Metropolitan University, said, “The government has to adopt drastic measures such as building and supporting a whole new plant, and abandoning nuclear power generation. The government must take a degree of responsibility for having caused the accident. If Fukushima has another accident, the government can ask public opinion on whether to cancel the current policy.”<p>But different views exist on this issue. Masayoshi Akao, head of the Energy Policy Institute of Japan, explained that removing nuclear power generation from the energy mix and having no nuclear power plants is a step backward. “The price of solar energy is rising while the price of nuclear fuel is falling because the LDP government has not been investing in electricity generators on its own.”<p>Naikkawa also explained his position, while emphasising that the nuclear crisis has so far not caused a substantial loss in life and damage to property. “After removing safety for the reactors, we would have a chance to use nuclear energy as usual so that the IAEA certification is complete in the case of cooling systems used by the Fukushima plants.”<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_346.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
