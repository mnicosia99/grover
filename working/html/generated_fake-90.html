<br/><br/>(Published in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases)<p>The newest version of H3N2 carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-K) should be of high priority for human resistance investigation. This part has been now investigated and characterized in the context of large outbreak of KPC-K in Sumatra.<p>In this outbreak, which appeared in 2005, the number of cases of infection did not exceed 20,000. The animal phase of this outbreak was heavily investigated, which led to the confirmation of a trade in agriculture (secretary of military agriculture). The bacteria strain found, however, has been categorized as H3N2-producing, mostly in malicigua, fruit-derived saffron, and mango. With this transmission and malicigua sources, KPC-K was introduced into the food chain in several places.<p>The Zoonotic virus-producing group immediately reported to the Statistical Information Committee of Indonesia (NPROC). No other pathogen shown to be a vector of infection exists in Indonesia at this point. The Zoonotic virus-producing group identified the distribution and the control rate of various ecological factors as well as the significance of HAHPS (human antibody) for klebsiella pneumoniae detection.<p>This study contributed to the nature of the virus-producing group of klebsiella pneumoniae and its properties as an organism. It showed that klebsiella pneumosas can easily integrate into different ecological contexts and affected those used to transmissibility of the virus. Also, it was observed that the observed HAHPS had a significant effect on H3N2 genotype resistance. It was confirmed that klebsiella pneumoniae-HAHPS could not be traded between regions. This study contributed to the understanding of the KPC-K “producing” cell and how the rapid evolution of a small population of klebsiella pneumoniae can be transmitted.<p>In this study, Yemi Sirisa, Jessa Priyanto, Theadora Kapo, Agung Tusung, Ayu Lee, Carlos Agario, and Ramli Jeyaravirono were the researchers. The research was supported by the Ministry of Health-Subsidiary Agro-Bio-Science Research Organization (VIB-CNRS).
