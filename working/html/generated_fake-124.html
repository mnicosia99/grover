<br/><br/>This is an intriguing study due to its uniqueness. It reveals a unique way of understanding the precise roles of several different transcription factors that work in the cell-targeting network.<p>Though research labs sometimes work with clumps of proteins together in unnatural configurations, this is a molecular system that they can identify the exact sources of the acquired functions. This system appears to be novel and different from existing efforts.<p>Perhaps by developing molecular tools which allow different means of cataloging specific proteins – one of which includes identifying each domain of a protein, thereby recognizing how a protein influences both normal and disease processes within a cell. Given the complex nature of gene regulation within the cell, it is important to understand how the expression of an individual gene affects the development of an entire system. We did just that by examining how a protein works in conjunction with many different regulatory transcription factors. The addition of heterochromatin binding inhibitors to cells greatly improved their behavior and revealed a novel understanding of how the network operates. This may have significant implications for the treatment of and cures for these rare cancers.<p>This work was supported by the USNational Institutes of Health (NIH) for the development of the Lynx protein, the target of the treatment. The article was published in the Oct. 31, 2011 issue of Neuron.<p>Work on rhabdomyosarcoma is a reflection of the advances we are making in understanding how specific proteins, typically present on chromosome 1, are important in a number of biological processes. This work may also provide a new way to identify therapeutic targets for a wide range of rare diseases.<p>…<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_124.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
