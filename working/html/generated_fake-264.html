<br/><br/>Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer where cells that are normally close to one another, called fibroblasts, have become abnormally fibrous due to an abnormal “crosstalk”. As the fibroblasts are further apart by the lymph node, the cancer spreads. Rhabdomyosarcoma accounts for approximately 7% of malignant tumors (1).<p>The normal cell surface is regulated by the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) Fc domain. A truncated or truncanged Fc domain allows ribonucleic acid to properly fold. If this truncated Fc domain is also truncated or truncated very tightly, then Fc loses its ability to fold correctly and the Fc domain also loses its ability to communicate to the other membrane cell components. Normally, the Fc domain is able to fold and to communicate efficiently. However, with a short or faulty Fc domain, the normal response is defective and the cancer cells have “mutilated” (i.e. impaired in their normal response) Fc, causing the cell to become abnormal. The Fc domain is the contact point between the cell surface protein (speckicium) and the cell membrane. The Fc receptor’s function is to communicate to the cell surface protein to fold properly, thus maintain the cell surface proteins “pro-self” (on the right side).<p>Sp RNA interspersed with Fc<p>Certain kinds of cells can be readily detectable and stimulated using an agent that stimulates them by expression of a key regulatory protein (FMTO). These cells have high levels of the retrotransposon encoding human-affecting Sp RNA. Retrotransposons are stretches of RNA called “sp” in a longer term sequence (the translation length) and usually a shorter sequence (the hypershort portion). Sp RNA is used in this study to generate several small RNA sp products from the Fc domain, based on genes that are of interest to the cell surface proteins.<p>The high Sp RNA expression is considered to be an important factor in the development of tumors, and makes Sp RNA highly sensitive to either high or low levels of DNA replication. This type of research is both a field of study and an investment strategy and is trying to find treatments for tumor DNA mutation caused by rapid external DNA replication that are otherwise harmful to the tumor. It has also been reported that methylation and other epigenetic regulation of Sp RNA products can also be regulated by DNA replication. (2).<p>In this case, Sp RNA is coming from a total of six Sp RNA products within the Fc domain. Sp RNA products are isolated for further study on many different cell lines in a specific manner. One of the most famous Sp RNA products extracted from human tumors is called Sp DNA. Sp DNA is becoming very prevalent in a variety of cancer types. The high Sp RNA product of Sp DNA is interesting because the Sp DNA product from human, in general, is normally constrained by a very high Fc domain. This creates a very problem because this miRNA product has the kind of conformance that needs to be tethered to a long and strong core of surface proteins, thus controlling cellular control. One factor that makes Sp DNA MiRNA unstable is that Sp DNA and Sp RNA are working in tandem and miRNA is attacking the control points. In this case, the standard Fc domain of Sp DNA is playing a major role.<p>Another study done in this location has shown that the combination of deleting a specific well-defined miRNA product and polyclonal Sp RNA provided a high possibility of inhibition and inhibiting cells in Petri dish and in Petri dishes.<p>In this study, the two miRNA products, Fc (single phase methylation) and Sp RNA (polyclonal methylation), combined as the beta chains in the Fc domain and created a strong tie between the Fc domain, Sp RNA and the Cellular control, allowing to activate the drug therapies currently being tested.<p>Related material:<p>(1) 4 Cerebrosidases for the Control of Cell Phosphorylation (Bascom Palmer, Peter Homminov, Michael Shaffer and Harry Tsui (1992), A Guide to Human Genomic Stability and Genomic Etiology. 3:117-131.<p>References:<p>Surgery 2000.
