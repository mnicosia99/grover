<br/><br/>An article titled “Expression and Differentiation between OCT4A and Its Pseudogenes in Human ESCs and Differentiated Adult Somatic Cells” by Jez and Ambady, Valenti and Eliades, presented recently at the Interrogatory Symposium on Creativity of Preprint Medicine Using Open Source Filters, was presented for the first time by Alex Dominko at the scientific meeting “open EXEC” organized by PLoS ONE and EMBASE this year. It reveals the OCT4A transcription factor’s propensity to express and differentiate between different type of different specific parameters.<p>Citation: “Exhibition and Differentiation of OCT4A in Human Embryonic Scaffolds at Growing Statistically Minimal –ORB Mendelian Stages”<p>Written for the PhD in entomology<p><figure><img src="http://mnicosia.tech/images/samples_5_44.png"/><figcaption>Test Caption</figcaption></figure></body></html>
